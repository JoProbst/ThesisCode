Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a condition characterized by impulsiveness, mood instability, negative self-image, and episodes of self-injury and attempted suicide. While the exact underlying causes and pathophysiological processes are yet to be identified, a combination of genetics, environmental factors, and a history of childhood trauma have all been shown to contribute to the development of the disorder. Pharmacists are an important part of the multidisciplinary healthcare team that manages patients with BPD. Psychotherapy should be utilized as the primary treatment for BPD, although pharmacotherapeutic agents are often prescribed for the management of symptoms. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition characterized by a pattern of impulsiveness and mood instability. The word is a complex term used to describe the way someone thinks, feels, and behaves, underpinning that individual’s sense of self. BPD is associated with an increased risk of suicide together with fears of abandonment. Patients with BPD feel empty and have a negative self-image. While BPD and bipolar disorder (types I and II) display over-lapping symptoms, there are certain features that distinguish the two. In particular, the pattern of affective instability, a prominent feature in both disorders, varies. Patients with BPD demonstrate transient mood shifts that occur in response to interpersonal stressors, whereas bipolar disorder is associated with sustained mood changes. Recent studies have shown that BPD is present in about 6% of primary care patients in community-based samples and in 15% to 20% of patients in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics. The majority of these patients tend to be female, with rates as high as 75% in clinical settings. Most patients with BPD are admitted into a treatment facility following a suicide attempt or an episode of deliberate self-injury. The average risk of suicide attempt is 60% to 70%, and about 10% of BPD patients die of suicide (this figure is particularly high for young women). On average, patients remain in the hospital for 6.3 days per year and make nearly one emergency room visit every 2 years. These rates are six to 12 times higher than those among patients with a major depressive disorder. These figures translate to a large economic burden, with the use of expensive healthcare resources, persistent lack of patient productivity, and emotional costs, as well as other costs related to a variety of behaviors such as domestic violence, reckless driving, imprisonment, and pathologic gambling. Patients with BPD have characteristically unstable moods and express feeling “up” and “down” without any explanation. Since the person’s thoughts and feelings can be difficult to manage, many patients resort to different ways of self-harm, such as cutting, ligaturing (strangulation), or overdosing on drugs, as a way of managing distress. Those with BPD may experience difficulty maintaining social relationships, and conflicts with other individuals often lead to social isolation and problems at work. Furthermore, they tend to have intense but short-lived relationships due to problematic attachment patterns. Psychotic symptoms may occur, but are usually brief, circumscribed, or accompanied by good reality testing. Patients with BPD may manifest over-whelming anger when in a state of crisis. They often display a poor sense of who they are and are frequently dissatisfied with their functioning, feeling empty and negative about themselves. BPD is often associated with other mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, and overlapping symptoms may make it difficult to establish a clear diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of BPD negatively affects the course and treatment of coexisting medical conditions and other psychiatric disorders. BPD can be caused by different combinations of symptoms. The four main features of BPD include affective instability, identity problems, negative relationships, and self-harm. An accurate diagnosis is very important, as it helps such individuals understand their difficulties and seek appropriate help. However, there have been concerns about the validity of the diagnosis, and some consider it stigmatizing. The diagnosis of BPD is made after the age of 18 years using one of two criteria—The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Even though personality disorders are diagnosed only in adults, BPD manifests itself in adolescence in the form of uncontrollable anger, self-mutilations, dissociation, and other such behaviors. lists the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for BPD. Although the cause of BPD is not fully understood, a combination of genetic and environmental factors, as well as a history of childhood neglect or trauma including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, has been known to increase an individual’s risk of developing this condition. Even though specific genes that link the disorder have not yet been identified, BPD is significantly inheritable, with 42% to 68% of the variance being associated with genetic factors. Furthermore, all the major components of the disorder, including affective instability, identity problems, negative relationships, and self-harm, have been shown to track in families. A difficult childhood can impair brain development significantly since neural pathways develop rapidly during this time and children are dependent upon their caregivers for all of their needs. A number of underlying causes for the development of BPD have been proposed. One proposal suggests that increased cortisol production through stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may occur in cases of chronic stress, such as that associated with childhood adversity. The limbic system, which includes the amygdala, the hippocampus, and frontal areas of the brain, have also been linked to BPD. Neuroimaging studies have shown a reduction in the volume of the amygdala in individuals with BPD, possibly as a result of excitotoxicity, a process whereby nerve cells are damaged by excessive stimulation. Yet another study group has proposed that the amygdala actually becomes more sensitive in people with BPD. BPD is a complex and multifaceted condition usually requiring a multidisciplinary treatment approach including drug therapy, occupational therapy, psychological therapy, and housing support. Effective treatment usually leads to a good prognosis, and patients should ideally undergo therapy within the community, as long, unstructured hospital admissions can worsen the condition. Healthcare professionals should be aware that patients with BPD may have difficulty establishing relationships and may reject treatments offered or have unrealistic expectations of them due to the nature of the condition. Psychotherapy is seen to have a beneficial impact on a variety of factors when used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as BPD, bipolar affective disorder, and schizophrenia. It has been noted that psychotherapy reduces inpatient treatment and decreases work impairment. As such, psychotherapy should be utilized as the primary treatment for BPD. Psychotherapy aims to encourage self-reflection, improve interpersonal and emotional understanding, challenge and modify dysfunctional core beliefs, and achieve better environmental adjustment. Patients should ideally attend twice weekly psychotherapy sessions, and treatment duration should be a minimum of 3 months. Psychotherapy encompasses a number of different techniques including dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), transference-focused psychotherapy, mentalization-based therapy, and general psychiatric management, all of which can be used for the management of BPD. These methods have been shown to reduce the need for other treatments, including emergency room visits and pharmacotherapy, by 80% to 90%, and the occurrence of self-harm and/or suicidal episodes by about 50%. The challenge with psychotherapy is that extensive training is required before it can be delivered, and it is therefore not widely available, even though the clinical and cost benefits are maintained during a period of 2 to 5 years. DBT is a technique based upon cognitive behavioral therapy that is specifically designed for the management of BPD. It was originally developed as an outpatient program, but with time it has been modified for use in hospital settings and among more diverse populations with an aim of increasing the capacity to self-regulate and teaching interpersonal effectiveness, distance tolerance, emotional regulation, and mindfulness. DBT is normally delivered as a group skills training session with telephone consultations and individual coaching sessions offered alongside. Mentalization-based treatment is another method of psychotherapy that was developed specifically for the management of BPD. This therapy is aimed at improving a patient’s ability to understand both his or her own mental state and that of others. Mentalization-based treatment is much shorter and has fewer requirements than the other forms of psychotherapy, as it is administered as weekly individual therapy sessions as well as group sessions over 18 months. Transference-focused psychotherapy is centered on emotions arising in the relationship with the therapist and the use of traditional psychodynamic techniques. Generally, individuals undergo twice-weekly individual therapy sessions for about 1 year. While psychotherapy is essential in establishing long-term improvements in the patient’s personality and overall functioning, pharmacotherapeutic agents are often prescribed for the management of symptoms and trait vulnerabilities. Pharmacologic therapy might be initiated as an adjunct to psychotherapy in patients with symptoms of impulsivity, affective instability, and/or psychosis. No medications have been approved by the FDA specifically for the treatment of BPD. Antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and dietary supplements have all been used in BPD patients even though there is no conclusive research in this area and the medications are unlicensed for this indication (i.e., used off-label). Mood stabilizers (topiramate, valproate, lamotrigine), second-generation antipsychotics (olanzapine, aripiprazole), and omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to be useful in the management of affective symptoms and impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol in BPD patients. Antipsychotics have been shown to have an additional role in improving a BPD patient’s cognitive symptoms. They help with impaired cognition and emotional flattening and are therefore useful in patients who experience a high level of emotional distress. The use of these agents is further limited by common adverse effects including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes with atypical antipsychotic agents, or by sedation and possibly toxic effects to kidneys with mood stabilizers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been found to be effective in decreasing the severity of depressed mood, anxiety, and anger, mainly in subjects with a concomitant affective disorder. The effects of antidepressants on impulsive behaviors are uncertain. Some randomized trials have concluded that SSRIs and other antidepressants have little benefit, if any, over placebo. Since BPD worsens depression outcomes, it is possible that the patients in fact respond poorly to treatment. Benzodiazepines are contraindicated for use in BPD as they reduce inhibitions and therefore may worsen impulsivity. Furthermore, patients with BPD are at a greater risk of addiction and may become addicted to sedatives. Other anxiolytics, hypnotics, and sedatives such as zolpidem may be useful for the treatment of BPD when used for brief periods for crisis management, such as short in-patient hospital admissions. A summary of treatment options is provided in . Pharmacists are an important part of the multidisciplinary healthcare team that manages patients with BPD. With access to patient medication records, pharmacists can monitor patient compliance as well as ensure that individuals are not overdosing on their prescribed medications. Furthermore, polypharmacy is a common concern in patients with BPD; one study found that 80% of patients with BPD were taking three or more medications. Pharmacists are suitably placed to discuss multiple medications with patients and review what drugs they should discontinue, if any. 1. Grilo CM, Sanislow CA, Skodol AE, et al.

Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that causes intense mood swings, impulsive behaviors, and severe problems with self-worth. It can lead to troubled relationships in every area of a person's life. Most of the time, signs of the disorder first appear in childhood. But problems often don't start until early adulthood. Treatment can be hard, and getting better can take years. Problems with emotions and behaviors are hard to improve. But with treatment, most people with severe symptoms do get better over time. Experts don't know exactly what causes borderline personality disorder. Problems with chemicals in the brain that help control moods may play a role. It also seems to run in families. Often, people who get it faced some kind of childhood trauma such as abuse, neglect, or the death of a parent. The risk is higher when people who had childhood trauma also have problems coping with anxiety or stress. Everyone has problems with emotions or behaviors sometimes. But if you have borderline personality disorder, the problems are severe, repeat over a long time, and disrupt your life. The most common symptoms include: Harmful, impulsive behaviors. These may include things like substance use, , out-of-control spending, risky sexual behavior, and reckless driving. Relationship problems. You may see others as either ""good"" or ""bad"" and may shift from one view to the other suddenly, for minor reasons. This can make relationships very difficult. A frantic fear of being left alone (abandoned). This fear may lead to frantic attempts to hold on to those around you. Or it may cause you to reject others before they can reject you. Problems with anger, such as violent temper tantrums. Hurting yourself, such as cutting or burning yourself. Times when you feel paranoid or lose a sense of reality ().

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) The DSM, which is published by the American Psychiatric Association, is the official source of diagnostic information for psychiatric disorders, including BPD and related conditions. For each disorder, the DSM provides a list of symptoms and specifies how many symptoms are needed (and how severe the symptoms must be) to warrant a particular diagnosis. The current DSM criteria for a BPD diagnosis are summarized below. BPD is a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotion, as well as marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: Emotional instability in reaction to day-to-day events (e.g., intense episodic sadness, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days) Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined Identity disturbance with markedly or persistently unstable self-image or sense of self in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating) Inappropriate, or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights) Pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by extremes between idealization and devaluation (also known as """") Recurrent , gestures, or threats, or Transient, stress-related or severe .﻿ If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the at for support and assistance from a trained counselor.

Many of the workgroup members are considered preeminent BPD researchers and work directly with BPD patients. The symptom criteria were established based on the best research available. However, it is important to keep in mind that the symptom criteria may be refined as new research comes out. The fifth edition of the DSM, DSM-V, was released in 2013 after many years of research and deliberation by experts. The symptom criteria for BPD in the new version remained the same as the previous version, DSM-IV.﻿ There are a number of psychological disorders and medical problems that can cause symptoms very similar to those associated with BPD.﻿ For this reason, it is important to see a licensed clinician (for example, a therapist or doctor) who can listen to your concerns, conduct a thorough assessment, and make an accurate diagnosis. A complete may include several components. Your therapist or doctor may ask you to participate in an interview, during which they will ask you questions about your symptoms, physical health, and past and present life situation. They may also ask you to fill out a written questionnaire about BPD symptoms. Finally, if you are willing, your clinician may ask to talk to family or loved ones to get complete information on the ways that your symptoms are affecting you. At the end of the assessment process, your clinician will compile all of the information and make a diagnosis. Then, they will speak with you at length about the diagnosis and treatment options.

What research is being done to improve the diagnosis and treatment of borderline personality disorder? How do I know if I have borderline personality disorder? What research is being done to improve the diagnosis and treatment of borderline personality disorder? Borderline personality disorder is an illness marked by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image, and behavior. These symptoms often result in impulsive actions and problems in relationships with other people. A person with borderline personality disorder may experience episodes of anger, depression, and anxiety that may last from a few hours to days. Recognizable symptoms typically show up during adolescence (teenage years) or early adulthood, but early symptoms of the illness can occur during childhood. People with borderline personality disorder may experience mood swings and may display uncertainty about how they see themselves and their role in the world. As a result, their interests and values can change quickly. People with borderline personality disorder also tend to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. Their opinions of other people can also change quickly. An individual who is seen as a friend one day may be considered an enemy or traitor the next. These shifting feelings can lead to intense and unstable relationships. Efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, such as rapidly initiating intimate (physical or emotional) relationships or cutting off communication with someone in anticipation of being abandoned A pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family, friends, and loved ones, often swinging from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger (devaluation) Distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self Impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge eating. If these behaviors occur primarily during times of elevated mood or energy, they may be indicative of a mood disorder, rather than borderline personality disorder. Recurring thoughts of suicidal behaviors or threats Intense and highly changeable moods, with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days Inappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger Difficulty trusting, which is sometimes accompanied by irrational fear of other people’s intentions Feelings of dissociation, such as feeling cut off from oneself, observing oneself from outside one’s body, or feelings of unreality Not everyone with borderline personality disorder experiences every symptom. Some individuals experience only a few symptoms, while others have many. Symptoms can be triggered by seemingly ordinary events; for example, people with borderline personality disorder may become angry and distressed over minor separations — due to business trips or changes in plans — from people to whom they feel close. The severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the individual and their particular illness. Scientists aren’t sure what causes borderline personality disorder, but research suggests that genetic, environmental, and social factors play a role. People who have a close family member (such as a parent or sibling) with the disorder may be at a higher risk of developing borderline personality disorder or borderline personality disorder traits (such as impulsiveness and aggression). Studies show that people with borderline personality disorder can have structural and functional changes in the brain especially in the areas that control impulses and emotional regulation. But is it not clear whether these changes were risk factors for the disorder, or caused by the disorder. Many people with borderline personality disorder report experiencing traumatic life events, such as abuse, abandonment, or adversity during childhood. Others may have been exposed to unstable, invalidating relationships, and hostile conflicts. Although these factors may increase a person’s risk, it does not mean that the person will develop borderline personality disorder. Likewise, there may be people without these risk factors who will develop borderline personality disorder in their lifetime. How do I know if I have borderline personality disorder? A licensed mental health professional—such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker—experienced in diagnosing and treating mental disorders can diagnose borderline personality disorder, based on a thorough interview and a discussion about symptoms. A careful and thorough medical exam can also help rule out other possible causes of symptoms. The mental health professional may ask about symptoms and personal and family medical histories, including any history of mental illness. This information can help determine the best treatment. What other illnesses often co-occur with borderline personality disorder? Borderline personality disorder often occurs with other mental illnesses. These co-occurring disorders can make it harder to diagnose and treat borderline personality disorder, especially if symptoms of other illnesses overlap with the symptoms of borderline personality disorder. For example, a person with borderline personality disorder may be more likely to also experience symptoms of major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, or eating disorders. Borderline personality disorder has historically been viewed as difficult to treat. But with newer, evidence-based treatment, many people with borderline personality disorder experience fewer and less severe symptoms, improved functioning, and an improved quality of life. It is important for patients with borderline personality disorder to receive evidence-based, specialized treatment from an appropriately-trained mental health professional. Other types of treatment, or treatment provided by a provider who is not appropriately trained, may not benefit the patient. Many factors affect the length of time it takes for symptoms to improve once treatment begins, so it is important for people with borderline personality disorder and their loved ones to be patient and to receive appropriate support during treatment. NIMH-funded studies indicate that borderline personality disorder patients who don’t receive adequate treatment are more likely to develop other chronic medical or mental illnesses and are less likely to make healthy lifestyle choices. Borderline personality disorder is also associated with a significantly higher rate of self-harm and suicidal behavior than the general population. Borderline personality disorder is associated with higher rates of suicide and self-harming behaviors.

The treatments described below are just some of the options that may be available to a person with borderline personality disorder. is the first-line treatment for people with borderline personality disorder. It can be provided one-on-one between the therapist and the patient or in a group setting. Therapist-led group sessions may help teach people with borderline personality disorder how to interact with others and how to express themselves effectively. It is important that people in therapy get along with and trust their therapist. The very nature of borderline personality disorder can make it difficult for people with this disorder to maintain a comfortable and trusting bond with their therapist. Two examples of psychotherapies used to treat borderline personality disorder include and DBT, which was developed for individuals with borderline personality disorder, uses concepts of mindfulness and acceptance or being aware of and attentive to the current situation and emotional state. DBT also teaches skills to control intense emotions, reduce self-destructive behaviors, and improve relationships. CBT can help people with borderline personality disorder identify and change core beliefs and behaviors that underlie inaccurate perceptions of themselves and others and problems interacting with others. CBT may help reduce a range of mood and anxiety symptoms and reduce the number of suicidal or self-harming behaviors. Medications are not typically used as the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder as the benefits are unclear. However, in some cases, a psychiatrist may recommend medications to treat specific symptoms, such as mood swings, depression, or other mental disorders that may occur with borderline personality disorder. Treatment with medications may require care from more than one medical professional. Certain medications can cause different side effects in different people. Individuals should talk to his or her provider about what to expect from a particular medication. Some people with borderline personality disorder experience severe symptoms and require intensive, often inpatient, care. Other people may need outpatient treatments but never need hospitalization or emergency care. Families of people with borderline personality disorder may also benefit from therapy. Having a relative with the disorder can be stressful, and family members may unintentionally act in ways that worsen their relative's symptoms. Some borderline personality disorder therapies include family members in treatment sessions. These sessions help families develop skills to better understand and support a relative with borderline personality disorder. Other therapies focus on the needs of family members to help them understand the obstacles and strategies for caring for someone with borderline personality disorder. Although more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of family therapy in borderline personality disorder, studies on other mental disorders suggest that including family members can help in a person's treatment. What research is being done to improve the diagnosis and treatment of borderline personality disorder? Research on borderline personality disorder is focusing on biological and environmental risk factors, with special attention on symptoms that may emerge at a young age. Researchers are conducting studies focused on adolescents at risk for borderline personality disorder to develop methods that help identify the disorder early. Borderline personality disorder research is also focused on the development and evaluation of psychotherapy and pharmacological interventions to prevent self-harming and suicidal behaviors, which occur at a high rate among people with borderline personality disorder. Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions, including borderline personality disorder. During clinical trials, treatments might be new drugs, new types of psychotherapy, new combinations of drugs, or new ways to use existing treatments. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individual participants may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. Decisions about participating in a clinical trial are best made in collaboration with a licensed health professional. To learn more about clinical trials, please visit NIH Clinical Trials and You ().

What Is the Prognosis for Borderline Personality Disorder? Can It Be Cured? Doctor's Notes on Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Definition and Facts Borderline personality disorder has ongoing patterns of different moods. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental illness that is marked by a chronic pattern of unstable relationships, poor self-image, and mood changes. It is also characterized by severe impulsivity. As with other personality disorders, BPD usually begins in early adulthood. Similar to the prevalence of in the population, BPD is thought to affect about 1% of the population and 15% of patients in psychiatric hospitals. In contrast to how often women seek treatment for , women tend to seek treatment for BPD at a rate much higher than men, so the estimates on how many men suffer from this disorder may be lower than the actual numbers. Individuals with BPD struggle with many difficulties. For example, women with the disorder are at risk for feeling less satisfied by, and more often coerced into, sexual relationships. One in 10 people with BPD commits ,and frequently engages in self-injurious behaviors like cutting themselves or overdosing on medication. People with this disorder who attempt suicide are more likely to have a history of sexual abuse compared to the general population. Adults with BPD also might have other personality disorders like In addition to those mental health problems, children with BPD seem to be specifically at risk for having several other personality disorders, including passive aggressive personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Although BPD has been thought by some to be a variation of , research suggests that each of these disorders is indeed distinct. In contrast to , which is classically characterized by emotions alternating between elation and , BPD tends to be associated with marked changes in mood between and anger or anxiety and . There are a lot of similarities between BPD an posttraumatic disorders (), leading to a belief that BPD might be an actual form of . Borderline personality disorder or BPD, is an illness in which ongoing patterns of varying , self-image, and behavior. These signs and symptoms of borderline personality disorder often result in impulsive actions and problems in relationships with other people. What Are the Symptoms and Signs of Borderline Personality Disorder? Symptoms of BPD are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision () and include desperate attempts to prevent real or imagined abandonment; unstable and intense relationships with others that alternate between seeing the other person as flawless and as worthless; potentially self-damaging impulsive behaviors, like or reckless driving; repeated or behaviors, or self-mutilation (for example, cutting or burning themselves); unstable emotional states, usually lasting a few hours to a few days; inappropriately intense anger or trouble controlling anger; short-lived episodes of paranoia (extreme suspiciousness) or dissociation (disconnecting from sense of self and reality) that are caused by . The most common signs and symptoms that are not listed include; mood instability and impulsivity (the tendency to act without thinking) tend to be the most specific to BPD. These two symptoms are thought to be the driving force behind the unstable relationships and chronic suicidal thoughts that are hallmarks of this disorder. in men, BPD tends to include more explosive anger and co-occur with and antisocial personality disorder, in women, this disorder more often co-occurs with , as well as mood and anxiety disorders. People who suffer from a number of the above symptoms but not enough to qualify for having BPD are described as having borderline personality traits. Like most other mental disorders, BPD has no one specific cause but tends to have a number of biological, psychological, and social contributing factors. Biological risk factors for BPD include a family history of this diagnosis, substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder, impulsivity, or mood instability. Many consequences of being the victim of childhood abuse can be features of BPD. Specifically, childhood abuse can result in the sufferer having difficulty regulating their own emotions, a tendency to harm oneself, and problems forming healthy bonds with others. Other symptoms that childhood abuse victims and individuals with BPD have in common may include trouble understanding their thoughts and feelings and those of others, having an unstable self-image, trouble expressing both positive and negative feelings, and having trouble understanding and managing their feelings about themselves and others, also called splitting. Although a history of being the victim of (for example, physical, sexual, or emotional) is a psychological risk factor for BPD, it is also a contributing factor for a number of other emotional problems. Socially, being part of what is considered to be a modern or rapidly changing culture is thought to be associated with the development of BPD as well. When Should You Call a Doctor about Borderline Personality Disorder? As with any other mental health issues, the time to seek medical care for BPD is when the symptoms meaningfully interfere with the sufferer's life. Individuals with BPD often enter care when they experience negative changes in their lives, like divorce or another relationship loss or job loss. Other symptoms that indicate the need for treatment include, but are not limited to, eating disorders, , significant , anger, anxiety or mood swings, self-injurious behaviors like cutting, and thoughts of dying or killing oneself. What Exams and Tests Diagnose Borderline Personality Disorder? There is no specific definitive test, like a blood test, that can accurately assess that a person has a borderline personality disorder. Therefore, practitioners conduct a mental health interview that looks for the presence of the symptoms previously described. The professional also usually asks questions to explore (screen) whether or not other emotional problems like , anxiety, , dependence, and/or other addictions are present. Mental health professionals will also likely explore whether the individual is a safety risk by having homicidal thoughts, suicidal thoughts, or other thoughts of self-harm. Ascertain medical conditions can influence how BPD manifests (presents), the mental health examiner will likely refer the individual for a complete physical examination and any tests they may need to better understand their medical situation. What Is the Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder? Although psychiatric hospitalization may often be used to address the suicidal and other safety crises of individuals with BPD, it is unclear how beneficial that intervention is. In contrast, partial hospitalization has shown some promise as an intervention for individuals with BPD who are not in imminent danger of mortally harming themselves or others. Partial hospitalization involves the sufferer receiving intensive mental health treatment for several hours per day then returning home each afternoon or evening. Therapeutic communities are living arrangements that provide a safe, nurturing, and structured environment for individuals with BPD that they may not have received as a child. Those communities can play an important role in the care for these individuals. Most practitioners will use some form of psychotherapy to treat BPD. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) addresses problems that individuals with a borderline personality disorder often have relating to others and managing their behaviors and feelings. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy involves the mental health professional helping the person with BPD explore deep feelings and the ways they manage those feelings (defenses) in ways that are not constructive. Interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on helping people with BPD relate to others in healthier, more appropriate ways. Psychotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for BPD. Many practitioners use techniques to help BPD sufferers better regulate their emotions and interact with others. Given the constraints of health insurance-funded treatment, mental health providers are often limited to supporting patients in their daily emotional and interpersonal struggles rather than directly treating their symptoms. What Medications Treat Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms? While medications can be helpful in reducing some of the specific mood symptoms of BPD, they by no means cure the disorder. Given the high number of mood problems that characterize this illness, practitioners take care to try and minimize the number and doses of medications in order to avoid exposing the person with BPD to numerous side effects. Using multiple medications at the same time, also called polypharmacy, can also put the person at risk for attempting to use their supply of medications to suicide. Despite these risks, careful use of medications can help achieve some symptom relief in certain people with BPD. Examples of include medications that affect the activity of the chemical in the brain (serotonergic medications) like (), (), (), (), and (). They are often used due to the combinations of high effectiveness and relatively low occurrence of serious side effects. Other antidepressants that practitioners frequently use to address mood symptoms for individuals with BPD include antidepressants that impact the activity of serotonin as well as epinephrine and , like () and (), as well as those that affect the activity of in the brain like (). Older antidepressants like tricyclics are not used as often as they used to be due to difficulties with possible side effects and the possibility of overdose. Are There Natural Home Remedies to Treat Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms? Individuals who suffer from BPD can take steps to help their own progress in mental health treatment. Rearranging their schedule such that they are able to attend psychotherapy sessions regularly over a long period of time is key to making progress in a timely way. Promoting their own healthy lifestyle may also include minimizing any access they have to weapons or other dangerous household items so they may be less likely to act on self-injurious, suicidal, or homicidal urges when they occur. That may include entrusting medication supplies to a trusted adult in the household to decrease the opportunity for overdose. Daily steps that people with BPD can take to further promote healthy living include avoiding states of physical depletion. Maintaining good , regular , and adequate , as well as learning and using stress-management techniques are examples of such steps. What Is the Prognosis for Borderline Personality Disorder? Can It Be Cured? Although individuals with BPD have a one in 10 chance of completing suicide, and adults with this disorder are at risk for having difficulty functioning in many aspects of their lives, many tend to regain much of their functioning by 40 years of age. Therefore, the BPD sufferer who is able to work with the professionals who care for them can be optimistic about the prognosis for their recovery over time. The development of BPD is highly associated with a history of childhood abuse, prevention, and early appropriate treatment of abuse are often considered in preventing this disorder. Prevention of child abuse has societal, parental, and child components. Examples of societal risk factors include high rates of crime and unemployment with low levels of social services. Parent-related risk factors of abuse and therefore of BPD include lack of social support and skills and the presence of . In children, risk factors include premature birth, low birth weight, or child handicap.

COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation. Get the latest public health information from CDC: Get the latest research information from NIH: Get the latest shareable resources on coping with COVID-19 from NIMH: > > Borderline personality disorder is an illness marked by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image, and behavior. These symptoms often result in impulsive actions and problems in relationships. People with borderline personality disorder may experience intense episodes of anger, depression, and anxiety that can last from a few hours to days. People with borderline personality disorder may experience mood swings and display uncertainty about how they see themselves and their role in the world. As a result, their interests and values can change quickly. People with borderline personality disorder also tend to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. Their opinions of other people can also change quickly. An individual who is seen as a friend one day may be considered an enemy or traitor the next. These shifting feelings can lead to intense and unstable relationships. Efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, such as rapidly initiating intimate (physical or emotional) relationships or cutting off communication with someone in anticipation of being abandoned A pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family, friends, and loved ones, often swinging from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger (devaluation) Distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self Impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge eating. If these behaviors occur primarily during a period of elevated mood or energy, they may be signs of a mood disorder—not borderline personality disorder Recurring thoughts of suicidal behaviors or threats Intense and highly changeable moods, with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days Inappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger Difficulty trusting, which is sometimes accompanied by irrational fear of other people’s intentions Feelings of dissociation, such as feeling cut off from oneself, seeing oneself from outside one’s body, or feelings of unreality Not everyone with borderline personality disorder experiences every symptom. Some individuals experience only a few symptoms, while others have many. Symptoms can be triggered by seemingly ordinary events. For example, people with borderline personality disorder may become angry and distressed over minor separations from people to whom they feel close, such as traveling on business trips. The severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the individual and their illness. The cause of borderline personality disorder is not yet clear, but research suggests that genetics, brain structure and function, and environmental, cultural, and social factors play a role, or may increase the risk for developing borderline personality disorder. People who have a close family member, such as a parent or sibling with the disorder may be at higher risk of developing borderline personality disorder. Studies show that people with borderline personality disorder can have structural and functional changes in the brain especially in the areas that control impulses and emotional regulation. But is it not clear whether these changes are risk factors for the disorder, or caused by the disorder. Many people with borderline personality disorder report experiencing traumatic life events, such as abuse, abandonment, or adversity during childhood. Others may have been exposed to unstable, invalidating relationships, and hostile conflicts. Although these factors may increase a person’s risk, it does not mean that the person will develop borderline personality disorder. Likewise, there may be people without these risk factors who will develop borderline personality disorder in their lifetime. Borderline personality disorder has historically been viewed as difficult to treat. But, with newer, evidence-based treatment, many people with the disorder experience fewer or less severe symptoms, and an improved quality of life. It is important that people with borderline personality disorder receive evidence-based, specialized treatment from an appropriately trained provider. Other types of treatment, or treatment provided by a doctor or therapist who is not appropriately trained, may not benefit the person. Many factors affect the length of time it takes for symptoms to improve once treatment begins, so it is important for people with borderline personality disorder and their loved ones to be patient and to receive appropriate support during treatment. A licensed mental health professional—such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker—experienced in diagnosing and treating mental disorders can diagnose borderline personality disorder by: Completing a thorough interview, including a discussion about symptoms Performing a careful and thorough medical exam, which can help rule out other possible causes of symptoms Asking about family medical histories, including any history of mental illness Borderline personality disorder often occurs with other mental illnesses. Co-occurring disorders can make it harder to diagnose and treat borderline personality disorder, especially if symptoms of other illnesses overlap with the symptoms of borderline personality disorder. For example, a person with borderline personality disorder may be more likely to also experience symptoms of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, or eating disorders. NIMH-funded studies show that people with borderline personality disorder who don’t receive adequate treatment are: More likely to develop other chronic medical or mental illnesses Borderline personality disorder is also associated with a significantly higher rate of self-harm and suicidal behavior than the general public.

If you think you or someone you know has symptoms of BPD, the first step is to see your doctor. It may take weeks or months to get a diagnosis. A health professional needs to get to know you properly first. They will need to do a complete mental health assessment, with questions about the current symptoms, past history such as , medical history, relationships and family background such as childhood trauma. To be diagnosed for BPD, you need to have at least 5 of the following: frantic efforts to avoid real or imaginary abandonment consistently intense and unstable relationships with other people persistently distorted self-image or sense of self at least 2 impulsive behaviours that are potentially self-damaging ongoing , suicidal behaviour or threats long-term, chronic feelings of loneliness and emptiness difficulty controlling intense and inappropriate  feeling disconnected from reality, or having paranoid thoughts Teenagers may start showing the symptoms of BPD, but to be diagnosed they need to have symptoms that are severe enough to persistently interfere with daily functioning for 1 year or longer.

Many people with BPD experience as part of their disorder; they have beliefs that others mean them harm, without basis in reality.﻿ Most people with BP who have paranoia experience transient symptoms that occur under conditions of stress rather than all the time. Chronic paranoid ideation, the long-standing and unchanging delusional beliefs that others plan to harm you, may be indicative of a psychotic disorder, such as . This can be a debilitating symptom, making the person with BPD feel constantly threatened, even by friends, coworkers, and family. People with BPD also have a tendency to think in extremes, a phenomenon called """" or “black-or-white” thinking.﻿ People with BPD often struggle to see the complexity in people and situations and are unable to recognize that things are often not either perfect or horrible, but are something in between. This can lead to "","" which refers to an inability to maintain a cohesive set of beliefs about oneself and others. Because of these extreme patterns of thinking, people with borderline personality are prone to slip from one side to the opposite side in their thinking. For example, they might one day believe that their partner is the most wonderful, loving person in the world, and the next thing that they are evil, hateful and full of contempt. This can harm their potential to hold lasting interpersonal relationships and how they can interact with others. Another problematic pattern of thinking that occurs in BPD has less to do with the content of thoughts, what people with BP think about, but rather the process of perception. is a common symptom of BPD that involves feeling “unreal,” numb, or separate from one’s own body or psychological experiences.﻿ Again, in most people with BPD, dissociative symptoms tend to occur under conditions of stress. Some experts believe that dissociation is actually a way of coping with very intensely emotional situations by “shutting down” or separating from the experience.

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Many wonder how the term borderline came to describe . Let's learn more about the origin of this term, and why its use is debated by some experts today.  History of ""Borderline"" in Borderline Personality Disorder The term ""borderline"" was first introduced in the United States in 1938. It was a term used by early psychiatrists to describe people who were thought to have a tendency to regress into ""borderline schizophrenia"" in certain situations. At the time, people with neurosis were believed to be treatable, whereas people with psychoses were deemed untreatable. Then, by the 1970s, a deeper understanding of borderline personality disorder began to emerge. Psychoanalysts like Otto Kernberg defined borderline as a middle level of personality organization between psychosis and neurosis. People with BPD were described as having ""primitive"" psychological defenses such as splitting and projective identification. Soon, a pattern of symptoms began to emerge to describe those with borderline personality disorder. These included:  Strong tendency for both self-harm and suicidal thinking In 1980, BPD became an official personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III or DSM-III. Today far more is known about BPD. Now BPD is recognized as a disorder characterized by intense emotional experiences and instability in relationships and behavior that begins in early adulthood and manifests itself in multiple contexts (for example, at home, and at work).﻿ In addition, experts have recognized that there is a strong genetic component to BPD. According to the DSM-5, in order to be diagnosed with BPD, a person must meet these criteria:﻿ A pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self image, and emotions Frantic efforts to avoid real or imaged abandonment Transient stress related to alternations in reality If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the at for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our . The term ""borderline"" is still debated by some people. Many experts are now calling for BPD to be renamed because they believe the term ""borderline"" is outdated and potentially stigmatizing. Some believe that BPD should not be classified as a personality disorder, but rather as a , or an identity disorder. It's important to not get too hung up on the term ""borderline."" The term is old and may be changed in the future.

In psychiatry, the same may be said of that which we call . Noted primarily for symptoms such as impaired mood regulation, unstable relationships with others, and self-harming behaviors, the name ""borderline personality disorder,"" fails to capture the essence of this serious mental illness. As currently defined, borderline personality disorder is considered a reflection of an essential aspect of a person's character that influences his or her way of seeing and being seen in the world. Recent research, however, has shown that symptoms of the disorder aren't constant and may not always be as enduring as some researchers and clinicians may think. Yet fluctuating moods and behavior also happen to define another mental illness, , with which borderline personality disorder may be confused. Symptoms that overlap with other illnesses, as well as the high rate of co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders often seen in people with borderline personality disorder, create challenges for proper diagnosis and treatment. According to data from the NIMH-funded , about 85 percent of people with borderline personality disorder also meet the diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder, including: 61 percent also have at least one , most commonly a specific phobia, or social phobia 49 percent have an impulse-control disorder, most commonly intermittent explosive disorder 38 percent have a substance abuse or dependence disorder, most commonly alcohol abuse or dependence 34 percent have a mood disorder, most commonly dysthymia (mild, chronic depression), or . One of the most tragic outcomes for any mental disorder, , presents an especially high risk in this population. As many as 80 percent of people with borderline personality disorder have suicidal behaviors, and about 4-9 percent complete suicide. Despite these overwhelming statistics, proper treatment can help reduce or lessen the severity of symptoms. Treatment may mean short-term hospitalization, especially when there is an immediate threat to a person's life, such as from suicidal behaviors and alcohol or drug dependence. But in most cases, , or ""talk therapy,"" is effective in helping people to manage even the most destructive symptoms of the illness. For example, an NIMH-funded study of 101 women with borderline personality disorder showed that dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) reduced suicide attempts by half compared with other types of psychotherapy.

In psychiatry, the same may be said of that which we call . Noted primarily for symptoms such as impaired mood regulation, unstable relationships with others, and self-harming behaviors, the name ""borderline personality disorder,"" fails to capture the essence of this serious mental illness. As currently defined, borderline personality disorder is considered a reflection of an essential aspect of a person's character that influences his or her way of seeing and being seen in the world. Recent research, however, has shown that symptoms of the disorder aren't constant and may not always be as enduring as some researchers and clinicians may think. Yet fluctuating moods and behavior also happen to define another mental illness, , with which borderline personality disorder may be confused. Symptoms that overlap with other illnesses, as well as the high rate of co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders often seen in people with borderline personality disorder, create challenges for proper diagnosis and treatment. According to data from the NIMH-funded , about 85 percent of people with borderline personality disorder also meet the diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder, including: 61 percent also have at least one , most commonly a specific phobia, or social phobia 49 percent have an impulse-control disorder, most commonly intermittent explosive disorder 38 percent have a substance abuse or dependence disorder, most commonly alcohol abuse or dependence 34 percent have a mood disorder, most commonly dysthymia (mild, chronic depression), or . One of the most tragic outcomes for any mental disorder, , presents an especially high risk in this population. As many as 80 percent of people with borderline personality disorder have suicidal behaviors, and about 4-9 percent complete suicide. Despite these overwhelming statistics, proper treatment can help reduce or lessen the severity of symptoms. Treatment may mean short-term hospitalization, especially when there is an immediate threat to a person's life, such as from suicidal behaviors and alcohol or drug dependence. But in most cases, , or ""talk therapy,"" is effective in helping people to manage even the most destructive symptoms of the illness. For example, an NIMH-funded study of 101 women with borderline personality disorder showed that dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) reduced suicide attempts by half compared with other types of psychotherapy. DBT also excelled at reducing use of emergency room and inpatient services and retained more participants in therapy, compared to other mostly traditional approaches to treatment.

In fact, there is still controversy over whether it is appropriate to diagnose teens with BPD.﻿ Many experts argue that teens can have BPD, and adolescent BPD is now recognized as an official diagnosis.﻿ Parents often have questions about borderline personality in adolescents. Some are worried that their teen is exhibiting the signs of borderline personality disorder (BPD), such as intense and ,, or difficulties in relationships.﻿ Others have BPD themselves and are worried that their kids will also have the disorder. Many experts have argued that borderline personality should not be diagnosed in anyone younger than 18 since technically, their personality is not yet fully formed.

The risk factors for borderline personality in adolescents are very similar to the risk factors in adults. In fact, many of the environmental risk factors for BPD occur during childhood. For example, and neglect, as well as parental separation or loss, have been linked to borderline personality in adults and teens.

Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder that impacts the way you think and feel about yourself and others, causing problems functioning in everyday life. It includes self-image issues, difficulty managing emotions and behavior, and a pattern of unstable relationships. With borderline personality disorder, you have an intense fear of abandonment or instability, and you may have difficulty tolerating being alone. Yet inappropriate anger, impulsiveness and frequent mood swings may push others away, even though you want to have loving and lasting relationships. Borderline personality disorder usually begins by early adulthood. The condition seems to be worse in young adulthood and may gradually get better with age. If you have borderline personality disorder, don't get discouraged. Many people with this disorder get better over time with treatment and can learn to live satisfying lives. Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Borderline personality disorder affects how you feel about yourself, how you relate to others and how you behave. An intense fear of abandonment, even going to extreme measures to avoid real or imagined separation or rejection A pattern of unstable intense relationships, such as idealizing someone one moment and then suddenly believing the person doesn't care enough or is cruel Rapid changes in self-identity and self-image that include shifting goals and values, and seeing yourself as bad or as if you don't exist at all Periods of stress-related paranoia and loss of contact with reality, lasting from a few minutes to a few hours Impulsive and risky behavior, such as gambling, reckless driving, unsafe sex, spending sprees, binge eating or drug abuse, or sabotaging success by suddenly quitting a good job or ending a positive relationship Suicidal threats or behavior or self-injury, often in response to fear of separation or rejection Wide mood swings lasting from a few hours to a few days, which can include intense happiness, irritability, shame or anxiety Inappropriate, intense anger, such as frequently losing your temper, being sarcastic or bitter, or having physical fights If you're aware that you have any of the signs or symptoms above, talk to your doctor or a mental health provider. If you have fantasies or mental images about hurting yourself or have other suicidal thoughts, get help right away by taking one of these actions: Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Call a suicide hotline number. In the U.S., call the at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) any time of day. Use that same number and press ""1"" to reach the . Call your mental health provider, doctor or other health care provider. Reach out to a loved one, close friend, trusted peer or co-worker. If you notice signs or symptoms in a family member or friend, talk to that person about seeing a doctor or mental health provider. But you can't force someone to seek help. If the relationship causes you significant stress, you may find it helpful to see a therapist yourself. As with other mental health disorders, the causes of borderline personality disorder aren't fully understood. In addition to environmental factors — such as a history of child abuse or neglect — borderline personality disorder may be linked to: Some studies of twins and families suggest that personality disorders may be inherited or strongly associated with other mental health disorders among family members. Some research has shown changes in certain areas of the brain involved in emotion regulation, impulsivity and aggression. In addition, certain brain chemicals that help regulate mood, such as serotonin, may not function properly. Some factors related to personality development can increase the risk of developing borderline personality disorder. These include: You may be at a higher risk if a close relative — your mother, father, brother or sister — has the same or a similar disorder. Many people with the disorder report being sexually or physically abused or neglected during childhood. Some people have lost or were separated from a parent or close caregiver when they were young or had parents or caregivers with substance misuse or other mental health issues. Others have been exposed to hostile conflict and unstable family relationships. Borderline personality disorder can damage many areas of your life. It can negatively affect intimate relationships, jobs, school, social activities and self-image, resulting in: Conflict-filled relationships, marital stress or divorce Self-injury, such as cutting or burning, and frequent hospitalizations Unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, motor vehicle accidents and physical fights due to impulsive and risky behavior In addition, you may have other mental health disorders, such as: Borderline personality disorder.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental health issue that is characterized by unstable relationships, behaviors, moods, and emotions. Left untreated, BPD can cause significant issues in a person’s life disrupting their work, school, day-to-day events, and their relationships with others.  Like many psychological disorders, the causes of BPD are complex and not fully known. But with appropriate help and treatment, people diagnosed with BPD can live a better quality of life and reduce their symptoms. Although the exact cause of BPD is unknown, researchers believe that genetic, biological, and environmental factors play a role in this complex disorder. For instance, there is strong evidence that childhood trauma such as abuse and neglect may be associated with BPD. Similar to many other psychiatric disorders, there is evidence that BPD is highly heritable. People who have a first-degree relative with BPD have an increased risk of developing the condition, but this fact does not guarantee they will be diagnosed. To diagnose someone with BPD, mental health clinicians ascertain if a person has displayed five or more of the criteria for BPD such as emotional instability, impulsive behavior, unstable self-image, inappropriate anger, idealization and devaluation in relationships, suicidal or self-harming behaviors, transient stress related paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms. In most cases, BPD is treated with a combination of medications and psychotherapy. However, there are times when a person with BPD may be hospitalized to protect themselves and others. There are several evidence based psychotherapies often used in the treatment of BPD including Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT), and Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP). A mental illness is often diagnosed when a person experiences disturbances in their thought patterns, feelings, or behaviors. Typically, these disturbances impact a person’s life by causing distress for them at work, at school, or in their relationships and activities. A psychological evaluation consists of a series of interviews, tests, and assessments to measure a person’s behaviors, thoughts, and emotions and help mental health professionals arrive at a diagnosis.﻿ These evaluations are also used to help guide a person’s treatment. DBT is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy designed to teach people how to live with the intense and challenging emotions that accompany BPD. Developed in the late 1980s, DBT helps people learn how to regulate their emotions and behaviors, improve their relationships, and develop mindful ways of coping with stress. MBT is an evidence-based treatment option for people with BPD in which they learn how to engage in mentalizing. Mentalizing, which involves being able to separate one's emotional state from that of others, helps people with BPD learn how to think before they react to their emotions or the perceived feelings of others.﻿ TFP is an evidence-based psychotherapy approach for people with BPD. It uses the idea of transference—the concept that people will bring their problematic emotional reactions into the therapy relationship itself.﻿ The therapist utilizes these interactions to bring attention to aspects of the patient's mind they may not be fully aware of. This can lead to potential emotional and relationship growth.

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. (BPD) relationships are often chaotic, intense, and conflict-laden. This can be especially true for relationships. If you are considering starting a relationship with someone with BPD, or are in one now, you need to educate yourself about the disorder and what to expect. Likewise, if you have been diagnosed with BPD, it can be helpful to think about how your symptoms have affected your and romantic relationships. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the resource mental health professionals refer to when making a diagnosis, symptoms of BPD include intense, unstable, and conflicted personal relationships. In essence, people with BPD are often terrified that others will leave them. However, they can also shift suddenly to feeling smothered and fearful of intimacy, which leads them to withdraw from relationships. The result is a constant back-and-forth between demands for love or attention and sudden withdrawal or isolation. Another BPD symptom that particularly impacts relationships is called abandonment sensitivity.﻿ This can lead those with BPD to be constantly watching for signs that someone may leave them and to interpret even a minor event as a sign that abandonment is imminent. The emotions may result in frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, such as pleading, public scenes, and even physically preventing the other person from leaving. Another common complaint of loved ones in borderline relationships is . While lying and deception are not part of the formal diagnostic criteria for BPD, many loved ones say lying is one of their biggest concerns; this can be because BPD causes people to see things very differently than others.  is another classic symptom of BPD, and many people with BPD struggle with issues of sexuality. Also, a large percentage of people with BPD experienced ,﻿ which can make sex very complicated. Finally, other symptoms of BPD, including , ,﻿ and , which can have an indirect impact on borderline relationships. For example, if a loved one with BPD is engaging in impulsive behaviors like going on spending sprees, it can cause major stress within the family. In addition, suicidal gestures can be scary for romantic partners and can introduce lots of stress into the relationship. If you or your partner are having suicidal thoughts, contact the at for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our . Research has confirmed that people with BPD tend to have very stormy romantic relationships characterized by a great deal of tumult and dysfunction.﻿ For example, one study demonstrated that women with BPD symptoms reported greater chronic relationship stress and more frequent conflicts. Also, the more severe a person’s BPD symptoms are the less satisfaction their partner reports. In addition, research has also shown that BPD symptoms are associated with a greater number of romantic relationships over time, and a higher incidence of unplanned pregnancies in women.﻿ People with BPD also tend to have more former partners and tend to terminate more relationships in their social networks than people without . This suggests that romantic relationships with people with BPD are more likely to end in a . Finally, in terms of sex, research has shown that women with BPD have more negative attitudes about sex, are more likely to feel pressured into having sex with their partner, and are more ambivalent about sex than women without BPD.﻿ Unfortunately, little research has been done on sexuality in men with BPD. Given all the difficulties that exist in BPD relationships, why would anyone start a relationship with someone with the disorder? First, it's important to remember that despite these intense and disruptive symptoms,﻿ people with BPD are frequently good, kind, and caring individuals. Often they have many positive qualities that can make them great romantic partners some of the time. Furthermore, many people who have been in a romantic relationship with someone with BPD talk about how fun, exciting, and passionate a BPD partner can be. Many people are drawn to a BPD partner precisely because people with BPD have intense emotions and a strong desire for intimacy. Most BPD relationships go through a honeymoon period. People with BPD will often report that at the beginning of a new romantic relationship they put their new partner “on a pedestal” and sometimes feel they have found their perfect match, a soul mate who will rescue them from their emotional pain. This kind of thinking is called “idealization.” This honeymoon period can be very exciting for the new partner too. After all, it's really nice to have someone feel so strongly about you and to feel as if you are needed. Problems start to arise, however, when reality sets in. When a person with BPD realizes that her new partner is not faultless, that image of the perfect (idealized) soul mate can come crashing down. Because people with BPD struggle with , or seeing things only in black and white, they can have trouble recognizing the fact that most people make mistakes even when they mean well. As a result, people with BPD may quickly go from idealization to —or thinking that their partner is a horrible person.﻿ The key to maintaining a relationship with someone with BPD is to find ways to cope with these cycles and to encourage your BPD partner to to reduce these cycles. Sometimes partners in BPD relationships are helped by couples therapy. In addition to couples therapy, for the person with BPD, there are therapies that have been shown to be effective in terms of helping with relationships: :DBT is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that relates a person's thinking to their behavior. There are four main skills taught in , and one of them is managing interpersonal skills. : is a therapy that focuses on helping someone make sense of what is going on in their mind and the minds of others. :There are currently no , but they are sometimes prescribed by doctors to help improve certain symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Research suggests that certain medications can help a person manage their anger, impulsivity, and depression.﻿ On that note, though, it's important to weigh carefully the side effects of a medication with its potential benefit. Many issues may arise when a BPD relationship is ending. Because people with BPD have an intense fear of abandonment, a breakup can leave them feeling absolutely desperate and devastated. Even if a relationship is unhealthy, a person with BPD can often have trouble letting the relationship go. This is particularly true of long-term partnerships or marriages.﻿ This is why it's a good idea to have a support network for you and partner, especially if a break-up may occur, and this network often includes a mental health professional. On a positive and final note, please remember that the prognosis for BPD is good. This means that while most people with BPD do experience residual symptoms even after time and treatment, in the long term there is often hope that your relationship with your loved one can work.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious psychological condition that's characterized by and emotions, relationships, and behavior. It's one of several personality disorders recognized by the  (APA). Personality disorders are psychological conditions that begin in adolescence or early adulthood, continue over many years, and, when left untreated, can cause a great deal of distress.﻿ Thankfully, the right treatments targeted for BPD can help significantly. BPD can often interfere with your ability to enjoy life or achieve fulfillment in relationships, work, or school. It's associated with specific and significant problems in interpersonal relationships, self-image, emotions, behaviors, and thinking, including:﻿ : BPD is associated with a tendency to engage in risky and , such as going on shopping sprees, drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or abusing drugs, engaging in promiscuous or , or binge eating. Also, people with BPD are more prone to engage in self-harming behaviors, such as cutting or burning and attempting suicide. : Emotional instability is a key feature of BPD. Individuals feel like they're on an emotional roller coaster with quick mood shifts (i.e., going from feeling OK to feeling extremely down or blue within a few minutes). Mood changes can last from minutes to days and are often intense. Anger, anxiety, and overwhelming emptiness are common as well. : People with BPD tend to have with loved ones characterized by frequent conflicts, arguments, and break-ups. BPD is associated with an intense fear of being abandoned by loved ones and attempts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. This usually leads to difficulty trusting others, putting a strain on relationships. : Individuals with BPD have difficulties related to the stability of their sense of self. They report many ups and downs in how they feel about themselves. One moment they may feel good about themselves, but the next they may feel they are bad or even evil. : Under conditions of stress, people with BPD may experience changes in thinking, including (for example, thoughts that others may be trying to cause them harm), or (feeling spaced out, numb, or like they're not really in their body). Not everyone with BPD experiences every symptom. Some people may have a few, while others experience most of these symptoms.﻿ BPD is diagnosed by evaluating an individual's symptoms and reviewing their medical history. A doctor may also perform a physical exam and lab tests to rule out medical illnesses that might be contributing to the symptoms.﻿ In order to be diagnosed with BPD, the individual must experience five or more of the following symptoms in a variety of contexts:﻿ A doctor or therapist will also rule out mental health conditions that can cause similar symptoms. This includes bipolar disorder, histrionic personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.

However, there is research to suggest that some combination of nature (biology or genetics) and nurture (environment) is at play. Contributing factors that may increase your risk include: : There is evidence of differences in brain structure and function in individuals with BPD, especially in the parts of the brain that affect impulse control and emotional regulation.﻿ However, it's still unclear if these differences are a result of having BPD, or if they are part of the cause. : Having a parent or sibling with BPD may also increase the risk of developing the condition.﻿ : Many people diagnosed with BPD have experienced childhood abuse, trauma, or neglect or were separated from their caregivers at an early age.﻿ However, not all people with BPD had one of these childhood experiences, and, conversely, many people who have had them do not develop BPD. Remember that a risk factor is not the same as a cause; just because you have risk factors doesn't mean you will develop BPD, just as people without them can develop it anyway. Although at one time experts believed that BPD was unlikely to respond to treatment, research has shown that BPD is very treatable.﻿ Getting help from a mental health professional is critical because, with consistent treatment, you can live a better quality of life with fewer symptoms. Since BPD is associated with risky behavior, self-harm, and suicide, treatment can also help curb these behaviors.

The symptoms of BPD can affect a variety of areas, including , school, relationships, legal status, and physical health, which is why treatment is so critical. Despite the obstacles that BPD can cause, many people with BPD lead normal, fulfilling lives when they stick with their treatment plan. If you have BPD, there are things you can do that will help improve your ability to function and cope.

If you are a healthcare professional and you find any issue, please reach out to A borderline personality disorder is a in which someone experiences wide mood swings and is unable to stabilize their emotions. This condition can lead to a great sense of insecurity, affecting the way that people interact with others and disrupting relationships. The chemical is often marketed under the name Ecstasy or Molly. MDMA causes a sensation of pleasure, increased empathy, increased energy and changes people’s perception of time and other sensations. Is Borderline Personality Disorder Caused by MDMA Use? Effects of MDMA Use on Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms Is MDMA Used in the Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder? Treating MDMA Addiction and Borderline Personality Disorder Is Borderline Personality Disorder Caused by MDMA Use? There is no available research that shows any link between using MDMA and the development of borderline personality disorder. Typically, borderline personality disorder causes are linked to in someone’s past. Borderline personality disorder risk factors include being abandoned or severely neglected as a child, being physically, emotionally or sexually abused as a child or growing up with a disrupted family. Because borderline personality disorder is caused more from psychological trauma, it is unlikely that using MDMA or other substances will cause this condition. However, while borderline personality disorder is not likely caused by MDMA, there is evidence that using drugs borderline personality disorder, causing worse symptoms, a decreased likelihood of responding to treatments and having a higher risk of suicide. The research that found this connection refers to illicit drugs in general and does not explicitly study the effects of MDMA. Effects of MDMA Use on Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms The effects of MDMA on borderline personality disorder have not been specifically examined in any major scientific studies. While this connection has not been studied, there is evidence that prolonged MDMA use can lead to symptoms that include depression and paranoia. Because borderline personality disorder causes mood swings and unstable emotions, it would be reasonable to assume that MDMA use could worsen symptoms of depression in those with borderline personality disorder who already have severe emotional distress from a psychological trauma, and that paranoia may worsen the difficulty in maintaining good relationships that those with borderline personality disorder often experience. Medical scientists have not yet done the research needed to see if this is actually true, and the exact effects of MDMA on those with borderline personality disorder are currently unknown. Is MDMA Used in the Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder? There are several borderline personality disorder treatment medications that can help to reduce the symptoms that borderline personality disorder can cause and to reduce the risk of self harm that accompanies borderline personality disorder. These medications are designed to stabilize moods and emotions and address chemical imbalances that could be contributed to borderline personality disorder. MDMA is not used as a medication in treating borderline personality disorder. However, in 2017, MDMA used for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While PTSD is quite different from a borderline personality disorder, it is possible that some of the medicinal effects of MDMA may be useful in treating borderline personality disorder. MDMA has been shown to increase empathy and positive feelings. MDMA has not been tested or used for borderline personality disorder, but it is feasible that future research may show that there could be a medical use for MDMA for those who have a borderline personality disorder. While this could be a possibility, there is no current evidence that MDMA helps with borderline personality disorder and those who have this condition should avoid taking MDMA unless instructed otherwise by their doctor. Treating MDMA Addiction and Borderline Personality Disorder Co-occurring disorders (also called dual diagnosis) is a condition where someone has both a mental health illness and a substance use disorder. Someone who has an addiction to MDMA and also has borderline personality disorder will typically be diagnosed with a co-occurring disorder. Co-occurring disorders require specialized treatment in which both conditions are treated at the same time. This could involve having a specialist create a borderline personality disorder treatment plan while simultaneously planning MDMA addiction treatment options. Successful treatment will require specialized treatment of both conditions at the same time, and if only one condition is treated the chances of recovery will be much lower. today to speak with a representative about how professional addiction treatment can help.

a0d502c7-6cc8-4337-984c-2b0656b1e537,"How Cognitive Behavior Therapy Can Help Borderline Personality Disorder is usually only diagnosed in people over the age of 18, and is most often found in women. Characteristics of the borderline patient include extreme thinking (also known as black and white thinking), a love/hate relationship with others, impulsive decision making, inability to cope with being alone, fear of abandonment, loss of control over her emotions, feelings of emptiness, a lack of identity and self-injurious behaviors. The borderline person often has chaotic relationships with others, either pushing them away or pulling them close. They feel out of control in regards to their emotions. They are unstable. BPD can come from abandonment as a child, abuse, poor communication as a child, or growing up in a dysfunctional family. Many people with BPD feel powerless over their condition. CBT has various components that can teach a person how to better manage their emotions. These components include Rational Behavior Therapy, Rational Living Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Cognitive Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy. CBT teaches the person to actually change their thoughts, so that their emotions can follow. This form of therapy is direct, structured and hands-on; the person is given written homework that helps them look at how their thinking is creating chaos in their life. The more aware the person is of their own thought patterns, the more in control they become of what they do with those thoughts. For example, if a person is stuck in traffic their mind will probably start thinking about how awful it is that they are going to be late. There are now two options: the person can give into those thoughts and get upset and angry, or they can accept the situation as it is, knowing that nothing can be done to change it, and move their mind elsewhere. If the person gets angry, it will most likely affect the outcome of their day; if they accept what they are thinking without allowing it to determine what they are feeling, they remain in control. This way there are numerous benefits of CBT for borderline personality disorder. How Cognitive Behavior Therapy Can Help Borderline Personality Disorder CBT emphasizes the importance of emotions, particularly emotional management in leading a happy and fulfilling life. For the person with borderline personality disorder this seems like an impossible feat at first. CBT lasts for sixteen weeks, and throughout that time, the patient works one-on-one with a trained CBT therapist who tries to help the patient learn to reframe their thinking and take control of their emotions. CBT teaches that thoughts control emotions and emotions control behaviors. Since people with borderline can be aggressive and violent when their emotions are strong, being able to control the thought will enable them to change the way they behave in the event of a particular emotion. Written assignments give the borderline an opportunity to chart their distorted thinking so that they can deconstruct it with their therapist and see where their thinking is skewed. Some assignments teach them to look at their black and white thinking, and try to find a gray area while they are in the midst of the particular situation. CBT teaches that practice and repetition can lead to routine and habit. If the patient continually tries to challenge distorted thinking, it will eventually become second-nature. Borderline personality disorder is one of the few personality disorders that is not chronic. People can and do recover from BPD and the benefits of CBT for borderline personality disorder are evident. Cognitive behavior therapy is a successful way to help people get on the path to recovery and a more stable life.

However, they are very different conditions that require different treatment plans. Understanding the difference between borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment. Characteristics of Borderline Personality Disorder Key Differences Between Borderline Personality and Bipolar Disorder Characteristics of Borderline Personality Disorder is a personality disorder characterized by difficulties with emotional regulation, impulse control, and interpersonal relationships. The lifetime prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the United States population is about 6%. Symptoms of borderline personality disorder include: Life experiences, including childhood trauma, are common causes of borderline personality disorder. Neglect or abuse while growing up can lead to chronic difficulties with that characterize BPD. Overreacting to emotional situations, such as interpersonal conflicts, is a frequent sign of borderline personality disorder. The reaction may be so severe that the individual thinks about harming themselves to express their emotions and pain. , such as , are also common in those who have borderline personality disorder. is a mood disorder characterized by extreme shifts in mood. About of the U.S. population has bipolar disorder in a given year.  If a person’s mood quickly shifts back and forth from a very high state (manic) to a very low (depressed) state, this may be a sign that they have bipolar disorder.  During a , it is common to experience racing thoughts and become overly focused on a topic. During a low state, the individual will typically become very depressed and lose interest in daily activities. Genetic factors and changes in brain structure and function are believed to cause bipolar disorder. There are two : bipolar I (bipolar one) disorder and bipolar II (bipolar two) disorder.  Bipolar I disorder, also known as manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by . Though not all people with bipolar I disorder have depressive episodes, many do. During manic episodes, impulsive behavior can include excessive spending, unsafe sex or substance use. Bipolar II disorder is characterized by at least one less intense () episode and at least one . The manic periods of bipolar II are less extreme than bipolar I and may include periods of increased activity and inspiration. Symptom-free periods occur between manic episodes and can last days, weeks or even years. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder, while borderline personality disorder is a personality disorder. are characterized by persistent thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that deviate from the expectations of society and lead to suffering. Personality disorder symptoms typically develop by early adulthood and may be linked to childhood trauma.  Symptoms of personality disorders include distrust of others, paranoia, distorted perception of reality, a poor sense of self, depression and suicidal thoughts. Personality disorders affect of the general population. such as bipolar disorder are characterized by severe changes in a person’s emotional state that interfere with their ability to function correctly. Mood disorders can occur at any age and may run in families. Mood disorder symptoms include depression, irritability, , loss of interest in usual activities, decreased energy or difficulty sleeping. Mood disorders of adults in the United States. A mental health professional can diagnose either bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder by asking questions about your symptoms, collecting your personal and family medical history and using questionnaires. The mental health professional will use the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) to diagnose you correctly based on your symptoms. According to, bipolar I is easier to differentiate from borderline personality disorder than bipolar II is. The severe manic episodes that occur in bipolar I are not seen in people with borderline personality disorder. However, since severe manic episodes are not observed in bipolar II, this type can be more challenging to differentiate from a borderline personality disorder. Although both borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder are characterized by emotional instability and impulsive behavior, there are several differentiating characteristics.  People with commonly experience switching between states of mania and depression. Between these states, they may have symptom-free phases that can last for days, weeks, months or years. , on the other hand, is characterized by persistent emotional difficulties and behavioral problems without symptom-free periods like bipolar disorder. Sleep difficulties are common in bipolar disorder but are seen less frequently in borderline personality disorder. Mood disorders such as bipolar disorder commonly run in families, while personality disorders are less likely to. Relationship problems, and suicidal thoughts are more widely seen in borderline personality disorder. show that people with borderline personality disorder tend to show impulsiveness and anger in reaction to relationship issues on a long-term basis. People with bipolar disorder, however, show irritability and aggressive behavior only during short-term manic episodes. Together, these unique features help mental health professionals correctly diagnose borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. It is unclear whether an accurate with both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder is possible.  Some studies have shown that about 10% of people with a borderline personality disorder also have had bipolar I disorder, and 10% have bipolar II disorder. However, it is uncertain whether this dual diagnosis is a real occurrence or due to an incorrect diagnosis. Inaccurate diagnosis can occur because symptoms change over time and overlap between the two mental health conditions. For example, temporary episodes of emotional instability associated with a borderline personality disorder might be confused with bipolar II hypomanic episodes. A thorough summary of past and present symptoms, as well as how long they last and how severe they are, will help a mental health professional correctly diagnose the two conditions. A recent study demonstrated that three items from a standard mood disorder screening questionnaire help differentiate borderline personality disorder vs. bipolar disorder.  If you answer yes to the three questions below, you are more likely to have bipolar disorder than borderline personality disorder. Keep in mind, though, that your answers do not guarantee a diagnosis: Have you ever felt so good that people thought you were not your normal self, or have you been so hyper that it got you into trouble? Were you ever much more active or doing many more things than usual? If you answered yes to either of the previous two questions, have those scenarios ever happened at the same time? Receiving an accurate diagnosis is an essential first step in receiving the proper treatment for bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder.  Each mental health condition is treated using different methods. working with a therapist to understand the condition and learn techniques to manage it, including . mood stabilizers, , , antidepressants, and anti-anxiety medications temporary to stabilize and set up a treatment plan peer support groups or family sessions to help gain an understanding of the condition and learn coping strategies includes: is a form of psychotherapy that emphasizes the importance of how our thoughts and emotions affect our behavior; allows patients to learn healthy ways to deal with difficult emotions and challenging life situations. highlights that patients can improve their response to emotional stimuli by accepting their life challenges; exercises encourage the development of skills that help the patient observe and describe their thoughts non-judgmentally Medications for borderline personality disorder include and for dealing with depression and anxiety symptoms that can accompany borderline personality disorder rather than treating BPD itself Key Differences Between Borderline Personality and Bipolar Disorder When it comes to differences in borderline personality disorder versus bipolar disorder, each has its own specific symptoms.

If you are a healthcare professional and you find any issue, please reach out to Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has long been misunderstood. Even its name reflects early beliefs about BPD that proved to be wildly inaccurate. Psychiatrists in the 1930s thought people who presented with symptoms of BPD were on the border between the two primary categories of mental illness: psychosis and neurosis. This meant they saw BPD as a thought disorder that approached the delusional thinking associated with schizophrenia but did not quite reach it. Understanding the condition has improved in the last several decades. Psychologists now know borderline personality disorder is completely unrelated to schizophrenia. Rather than a disorder of thought, BPD is a disorder of emotional regulation. Unfortunately, despite advances in clinical insight, the perception of borderline personality disorder remains distorted, and stigma persists. People who are “difficult” or “resistant” are often said to have BPD even when their symptoms suggest another disorder. However, knowledgeable clinicians understand that BPD is linked with trauma and is as treatable as other trauma-related conditions, like (PTSD) and dissociative disorders. Who Is at Risk for Borderline Personality Disorder? Borderline personality disorder is one of ten listed in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Personality disorders usually develop prior to adulthood and manifest as more ingrained expressions of identity than other . This is why people often refer to the criteria for personality disorders as “traits” rather than symptoms. For example, when a person has symptoms of borderline personality disorder but does not meet the criteria for a full diagnosis, clinicians often describe that person as having BPD traits. Mental health professionals define borderline personality disorder by considering its effects on emotional regulation, impulse control, and interpersonal relationships. To be diagnosed with the disorder, a person must have at least four of the following BPD traits listed in the DSM-5: Significant and persistent identity disturbance or an unstable sense of self Recurrent suicidal or self-harming behavior, including suicidal gestures and threats Disproportionate or inappropriate anger, rage episodes, or difficulty controlling temper Emotional instability and reactivity as exhibited by intense episodic dysphoria, anxiety or irritability Impulsivity in at least two areas with a significant risk of danger, such as substance use and unprotected sexual activity A pattern of unstable and intense relationships in which another person is alternately idealized and devalued Transient stress-induced paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms Borderline personality traits have some similarities to symptoms of , another trauma-related disorder. Just as people with PTSD are often easily startled by sudden environmental changes than others, people with BPD usually react more intensely to emotional stimuli than people without BPD. For example, a person with BPD is more likely to experience intense distress in response to an interpersonal conflict and may engage in self-destructive or self-harming behavior to express or manage the overwhelming emotional pain they feel. Living with borderline personality disorder requires weathering emotional storms. People with BPD who do not get treatment are at an increased risk of both intentional and unintentional suicide as well as a host of other negative outcomes. However, those who receive the right can learn how to manage their symptoms. While there are no official subtypes of BPD listed in the DSM-5, many people have classified subtypes of borderline personality disorder based on a wide variety of ways individuals express BPD traits. For example, some people with BPD are less outwardly expressive and more prone to feelings of emptiness and identity disturbance, while others are more demonstrative and engage in impulsive and self-harming behavior. One recent analysis split people with borderline personality disorder into three categories. performed a cluster analysis on nearly 200 people with BPD and identified three types of borderline personality presentations: The has the most severe symptoms and most impaired functioning of the three types, particularly when it comes to mood stability and identity integration. These individuals have high rates of self-harm and a more dependent interpersonal style. The has the least severe symptoms, with higher functioning in domains of self-control, effective stability and identity integration. However, these individuals tend to be lower functioning in domains of responsibility and social skills and have a more domineering interpersonal style. The has less severe symptoms, higher functioning in domains of responsibility and social skills, and a socially inhibited interpersonal style. An American psychologist named Theodore Millon created a similar classification system for borderline personality disorder, placing people with BPD in one of four subtypes: discouraged borderline, impulsive borderline, petulant borderline and self-destructive borderline. Discouraged borderline personality disorder is a subtype that most closely resembles the “core BPD” subtype identified by Smits and associate researchers. People that fit the criteria for this subtype are often less assertive, more compliant, and more likely to feel depressed and powerless. They are prone to self-harm. People with this subtype tend to exhibit characteristics of dependent personality disorder and major depressive disorder. Borderline impulsive type is a subtype of BPD characterized by impulsivity, distractibility, irritability and thrill- and attention-seeking behavior. People with this type of BPD are often charming and seductive and are prone to suicidality and self-harm. Impulsive borderline disorder shares traits in common with other “cluster B” personality disorders, characterized by overly emotional, dramatic or unpredictable behavior or thoughts, including antisocial and histrionic personality disorders. People with petulant borderline personality disorder tend to be pessimistic, resentful, critical, indirectly aggressive, restless, and easily disappointed. They may quickly feel insulted and react in defiant and stubborn ways to perceived slights. People with this subtype are often unpredictable in their relationships, often engaging in a “push-pull” dynamic in which they feel a deep need for others, then push them away. These individuals normally exhibit characteristics of paranoid personality disorder and depressive disorders. Self-destructive borderline personality disorder also shares features of depressive disorders. People who fit the description of this subtype of BPD may be masochistic, self-punishing, moody and introverted. They often exhibit a pattern of conforming to the expectations of others and then acting out angrily. They also tend to have an increased risk of suicide. Given the wide range of ways people can express borderline personality disorder traits, the symptoms of borderline personality disorder can vary. Some people with BPD are elaborately and dramatically self-destructive, with visible scars from and frequent hospitalizations. Others are quiet, melancholy, and creative, more likely to suffer from BPD symptoms like feelings of emptiness, an unstable sense of self, dissociative episodes and dysphoria. People who don’t know them well often don’t have any idea of the intensity of their emotional states. Still, borderline personality disorder symptoms share a common pattern. The disorder affects relationships, emotions and behavior in ways that are linked. The intense emotions that come with the disorder primarily arise in response to interpersonal conflict. Many, but not all, people with BPD cut or harm themselves when they are overwhelmed to distract from their emotional pain with physical pain or to show others how much they are hurting. Common borderline personality disorder signs and symptoms include the following: Sudden outbursts of disproportionate rage or other intense emotions Dramatic and frequent changes in interests, hobbies and sources of enthusiasm Descriptions of loved ones that alternate between excessive praise and condemnation, and relationships that follow this pattern of idealization and devaluation Rapidly cycling moods that do not follow a typical pattern of manic and depressive episodes, such as elation and dejection alternating several times throughout the day Dissociative symptoms ranging from severe depersonalization and dissociative fugue states to mildly escapist or numbing behaviors Preoccupation with obtaining a sense of safety or comfort, especially through close relationships The connection between these symptoms can be better understood when borderline personality disorder is considered in light of its roots in childhood and adolescent trauma. The causes of borderline personality disorder can be grouped into : People with borderline personality disorder can usually trace the origins of their disorder to all three of these areas. A family history of mental illness, especially of BPD or related conditions, is a major factor. People with first-degree relatives who have BPD or BPD traits are five times more likely to have BPD. They were also more likely to have had an emotionally sensitive temperament and issues with impulse control at a young age. However, these genetic and biological factors alone are not enough to cause the disorder. Life experiences are the major causes of BPD, particularly childhood trauma. People with BPD may have been sexually or physically abused or grown up in chaotic or violent homes. They often have histories of emotional abuse or neglect. Separation from parents is also strongly linked to the development of borderline personality disorder. Clinicians diagnose borderline personality disorder through clinical observation and interview. Sometimes, people with BPD seek help themselves to understand what is causing their intense and painful emotional experiences. A therapist will learn more about their history and ask targeted questions to identify BPD traits before making a diagnosis. In some cases, a self-destructive episode or suicidal crisis leads to hospitalization, and a diagnosis is made by clinicians during inpatient treatment. Borderline personality disorder is frequently misdiagnosed. Some people who do not have BPD are incorrectly diagnosed with it, while people who have BPD are sometimes diagnosed with something else. A careful process of clinical examination and is required to rule out conditions with overlapping or similar symptoms, including the following disorders: There are telltale differences that distinguish BPD from these alternative diagnoses. For example, mood episodes in bipolar disorder last longer than those in borderline personality disorder and are less clearly linked to external factors. While people with PTSD and BPD often have exaggerated reactions to environmental and social events, people with PTSD suffer from intrusive trauma symptoms that are not part of BPD. However, it is important to note that people with BPD often have histories of trauma and may have comorbid PTSD or other disorders. Who Is at Risk for Borderline Personality Disorder? The following risk factors are the most strongly linked to the development of BPD: A violent or chaotic home environment in childhood Episodes of impulsive or explosive behavior in childhood A history of trauma or abuse in childhood or adolescence A family history of BPD, BPD traits or other personality disorders Borderline personality disorder often develops by late adolescence or early adulthood and is not linked to any factors that emerge after childhood or early adolescence. Recent research shows that previous assumptions that BPD is more prevalent in women than men are wrong. Part of the reason for this historic discrepancy in diagnosis is that borderline personality disorder manifests differently in men than it does in women. found that men with BPD are more likely to have an explosive temper and to engage in dangerous or risk-seeking behavior than women with the disorder. They are also more likely to have co-occurring substance use disorders. Another reason that women may be diagnosed with BPD more frequently than men is that women with the disorder are to have sought psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy for mental health concerns, while men with BPD are more likely to have first received treatment for a . Borderline personality disorder in women is also more likely to be paired with co-occurring PTSD, mood, anxiety or eating disorders. Borderline personality disorder statistics include the following: The lifetime prevalence of BPD in the general United States population is about . The prevalence of BPD in people receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment is . Historically, about of people diagnosed with BPD have been women. This likely reflects both overdiagnoses in women and underdiagnoses in men. suggests there is actually no difference in the prevalence of BPD in men and women. About of people with BPD have co-occurring anxiety disorders. Nearly of people with BPD have comorbid mood disorders. Approximately of people with BPD have substance use disorders. People with borderline personality disorder have a suicide risk that is than that of the general population. Almost of people with BPD attempt suicide at least once in their lives.

So it's not surprising that BPD can also have a major impact on your sex life. While very few researchers have studied BPD and its effects on sexuality, more and more work is suggesting that people with BPD can experience several key difficulties with sex. Research has demonstrated that women with BPD tend to have more negative attitudes about sex. For example, women with BPD report having a greater number of mixed feelings about sexual relations, and are also more likely to feel pressured to have sex with their sexual partners.﻿ In addition, women with BPD report more general sexual dissatisfaction. Much less is known about how BPD affects men’s attitudes about sex. There may be a number of reasons for these more negative attitudes toward sex, including the fact that: Many women with BPD are survivors of child abuse, which may contribute to overall negative reactions to adult sexual experiences. Women with BPD are more likely to experience a great deal of conflict in their relationships, so they may feel less positive about sex.  is one of the listed in the DSM-5. In the case of sexuality, a trend toward impulsive behavior may lead to reckless sexual behavior as well. People with BPD are most at risk of engaging in impulsive acts when they are experiencing intense emotional responses, or when they are by alcohol or other substances. Intense sadness, fear, jealousy, or positive emotions may also lead to impulsive sexuality. In addition to engaging in reckless or impulsive sex, there is evidence that people with BPD are more prone to promiscuity.﻿ This differs from impulsive sex in that promiscuity is the act of intentionally having multiple sexual partners (rather than having casual sex on a whim). Why might people with BPD be more promiscuous? One possibility is that they may use sex to combat feelings of emptiness that are associated with the disorder. When feeling empty, numb, lonely, or bored, sex may generate positive emotional responses. While some studies have shown an increase in sexual behavior in people with BPD, there is also evidence that some actually avoid sex. For example, in a 2003 study, Dr. Mary Zanarini and colleagues found that people with BPD reported avoidance of sex for fear of experiencing an exacerbation of their symptoms.﻿ While the research is far from conclusive (and is particularly sparse with regard to men with BPD), there is evidence to suggest that people with BPD can experience a variety of sexual difficulties.﻿  It is likely that the impact of BPD symptoms on sex can vary substantially from person to person, and can take very different forms.

In fact, about a third of people with BPD will be convicted of a crime in their lifetime.﻿﻿ BPD symptoms can cause you to get in trouble with the law, but knowing more about legal issues and how they are affected by BPD can help you identify potential problem areas. One source of significant legal trouble is impulse control. If you have BPD, you may struggle with taking actions without thinking about the consequences or engaging in behaviors when you are angry or upset.﻿﻿ This is called and it can land many people with BPD in hot water.

If you are a healthcare professional and you find any issue, please reach out to A personality disorder is an unchanging and enduring pattern of thoughts and behaviors that can cause difficulties in several areas of a person’s life. All personality disorders involve distorted patterns of thinking, inappropriate emotional responses, poor impulse control and social challenges. Alcoholism and personality disorders commonly co-occur. People with alcohol use disorder may abuse alcohol as a means of coping with their intense emotions. When present simultaneously, alcoholism and personality disorders can be difficult to treat. However, recovery is possible with treatment that comprehensively addresses both conditions. Research has found that the occurrence of personality disorders in those diagnosed with alcohol disorders from as low as 22–40 percent to as high as 58–78 percent. Alcohol use cannot prompt the development of a personality disorder, but it can impact the progression by worsening a personality disorder’s symptoms and effects. Alcohol-induced personality disorders occur when alcohol triggers symptoms and signs of a personality disorder during intoxication or withdrawal. These signs may last for weeks but tend to disappear after a period of abstinence. Misdiagnosis becomes increasingly problematic in these cases, as attention is usually placed on personality disorder symptoms rather than alcohol dependence. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a condition where individuals portray intense and inappropriate reactions, display high levels of impulsivity and have difficulty maintaining stability in their relationships. Individuals with BPD tend to have an intense fear of abandonment, experience powerful feelings of anxiety and depression and engage in risky and self-destructive behaviors. Borderline personality disorder and alcohol abuse frequently co-occur, often because some individuals with BPD use alcohol to cope with and reduce the intensity of their symptoms, including: There may also be a genetic linkage with borderline personality disorder and drinking, as the two conditions share many mutual genetic pathways. There is a strong association between antisocial personality disorder and alcoholism. Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a lack of regard for laws and authority. People who have antisocial personality disorder engage in dangerous behaviors, lack guilt and display low impulse control. These qualities make a person prone to addictive behaviors, with alcoholism being the one most common. Alcohol addiction and antisocial personality disorder often prove to be a dangerous combination, as people with both of these conditions often display aggressive and destructive behaviors, including violence, sexual assault, child abuse and homicidal behaviors. Antisocial symptoms such as impulsivity, deceit and poor decision making also tend to worsen with alcohol use. Studies show that an individual diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder is to develop alcohol dependence. People with antisocial personality disorder tend to be young when they start alcohol use, use alcohol for extended amounts of time and form addiction-related problems quickly. Narcissistic personality disorder occurs when an individual has an extravagant and overblown view of themselves and their importance. Narcissistic personality disorder and alcohol abuse share several similarities. Both conditions involve denial, as a narcissist believes that they are perfect, while denial allows addiction to develop. Narcissistic personality disorder and alcohol use disorder are both characterized by a lack of self-reflection, a sense of entitlement and an unwillingness to accept responsibility. Nearly of people with a narcissistic personality diagnosis also meet the diagnostic criteria for an alcohol use disorder. Some people with narcissistic personality disorder may use alcohol to cope with negative emotions and feelings. Alcohol use can heighten a narcissist’s feelings of entitlement and showiness while reducing empathy for others. Alcoholism and personality disorders co-occur frequently. However, the onset of a personality disorder usually occurs before alcohol dependence develops. Dysfunction in areas of the brain during childhood that controls emotional responsiveness of developing a personality disorder and later trigger the development of alcohol dependence. Individuals with personality disorders often have difficulty with emotional regulation and become increasingly susceptible to feelings of distress regarding personal, social and occupational difficulties. As individuals struggle with the symptoms of their personality disorder, alcohol can provide an emotional escape from feelings of low self-worth, isolation and emotional confusion. Similarly, alcohol may be used to help enhance positive emotions and overall feelings of well-being. Common personality disorder traits including impulsivity, emotional instability and negative affect may also account for high rates of alcohol abuse disorders. Co-Occurring Alcohol Abuse and Personality Disorders Treatment Personality disorder treatment can be challenging because many of the symptoms of these conditions can make it hard for a person to recognize that treatment is needed in the first place. Alcohol abuse serves to make these barriers more problematic, as it can increase the severity of symptoms or make it more difficult to detect and treat personality disorders. Because of the complex way both of these conditions interact, must be conducted simultaneously with personality disorder treatment for treatment to be successful. Alcoholism and personality disorders are commonly co-occurring conditions Alcohol cannot cause a personality disorder, but it can intensify the symptoms of a personality disorder Symptoms of a personality disorder, such as impulsivity and risk-taking, can prompt increased alcohol use Personality disorders commonly develop before alcohol dependence Alcohol is often used to cope with the symptoms of a personality disorder Alcohol dependence can lead to misdiagnosis of a personality disorder and act as a hindrance to treatment Alcoholism personality disorders can be challenging to treat because each condition can exacerbate the symptoms of the other condition Treatment for a co-occurring alcoholism and personality disorder can result in positive outcomes if both conditions are addressed simultaneously.

From movies to sad songs, these are the types of small triggers you can avoid without disrupting your life. Avoiding triggers is not always possible or even advisable, and therefore learning other ways to  is important as well. Avoiding triggers is only one option for your recovery and not a long-term solution for every trigger. While it can be extremely helpful as you begin to work with a , you need to exercise this strategy in moderation. Avoiding triggers can be very useful when the trigger you are avoiding is predictable and avoiding it doesn't limit your life in significant ways. But if the trigger is unpredictable or involves very large parts of your life, avoiding it isn't realistic or sustainable. For example, many people with BPD are triggered by .﻿ The only way to avoid conflict in relationships completely, however, is to have no relationships at all, since conflict is an inevitable part of all relationships. Unfortunately, many people with BPD find themselves pushing away loved ones for this very reason; they may become avoidant of relationships altogether in order to avoid exacerbating their symptoms. This strategy doesn't work. It only makes feelings of rejection and loneliness worse, bringing on severe symptoms.﻿ We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. It's important to work with your therapist or doctor when deciding how to handle triggers.﻿ They will help you navigate whether or not it's practical to avoid them. If avoiding a trigger will disrupt your life in some way, such as keeping you from going to work or ignoring your partner, avoidance isn't a viable option for you. Your therapist will instead help you find another way to cope with the trigger, such as developing a trigger action plan. Triggers can set off or exacerbate the symptoms of borderline personality disorder. If you're living with BPD, learning to identify those triggers is an important part of managing your symptoms. Avoiding triggers can sometimes be helpful, especially early on when you're learning to navigate your condition.

Learn more about the diagnoses and treatments for personality disorders, such as borderline personality and narcissistic personality. Personality disorders: symptoms, diagnosis, causes Every personality disorder has its unique symptoms and behaviours. Someone may display some of these traits but not have a personality disorder diagnosis. The first step towards getting support and treatment for a personality disorder is speaking with a mental health professional. Personality disorder refers to a long-term pattern of thinking and behaviour that causes distress, making it difficult to function in everyday life. People with histrionic personality disorder can seem highly dramatic and approval seeking, with a desire to be the centre of attention. People with avoidant personality disorder appear shy and timid. They avoid people and situations because they fear negative judgement by others. People with antisocial personality disorder are sometimes called 'psychopaths'. They tend to disregard the law or other people’s rights. Dissociative identity disorder, also known as multiple personality disorder, can cause people to feel as though they have at least two distinct personalities. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is used to treat people with borderline personality disorder. It aims to change negative thought patterns and behaviours. Links to information about social behaviour disorders. Whilst paranoia may be caused by a mental disorder, it can also be triggered by recreational drug use, neurological diseases, severe trauma or stress. Mental health conditions broadly refers to many conditions, including mood disorders, eating disorders and anxiety conditions. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental disorder affecting people’s thoughts and behaviours, making it difficult to cope with life. People with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) may appear arrogant, with an inflated self-image and disregard for the feelings of others. As with most mental disorders, causes of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are not completely understood. Learn more about the mental health disorder. Although it is not known what causes narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), it is probably a mixture of genes, early childhood experiences and psychological factors. There are many Borderline Personality Disorder symptoms including intense mood swings, unstable relationships, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Learn more. If you suspect you have BPD, the first step to receiving a borderline personality disorder diagnosis is to see a doctor or mental health professional. Treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD) Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) combines support, psychological therapy and, in some cases, medication. Find out more about BPD. Symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) A person struggling with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) may find themselves isolated and lonely as others find their symptoms challenging and hard to deal with. Diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) A narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) diagnosis is usually made using a psychological evaluation process with a questionnaire and assessment tools. This covers the symptom severity and the person’s history. Treatments for narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) There’s no specific medication to treat NPD. However, people with NPD sometimes also develop depression or anxiety, and in such cases antidepressant medications may be beneficial. Mastering OCD is an app designed to lessen the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder. It’s downloadable from the Google Play Store and Apple iOS Store. Research into the causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suggests both stress and environmental factors play a role. There is no ‘test’ for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but a diagnosis is based on an assessment of the person’s behaviours, thoughts and feelings. For people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), unwanted negative thoughts can be constant and can start to take control of their lives. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be treated, enabling people with OCD to live happier lives. Seeing a doctor is the first step to recovery. If you or someone you know displays OCD symptoms to the extent that it affects quality of life, visit a doctor for an assessment. Trichotillomania is a psychiatric disorder that compels people to pull out their hair. Lasting for several months or many years, it can fluctuate in severity.

(8-10) Although BPD occurs in up to 40% of psychiatric inpatients (11) and 10% of outpatients, (12) it is underrecognized. (13-15) Often, patients with BPD do not receive an accurate diagnosis until [greater than or equal to] 10 years after initially seeking treatment. (16) The treatment and clinical implications of failing to recognize BPD include overprescribing medication and underutilizing empirically effective psychotherapies. (14) This review summarizes studies of the underdiagnosis of BPD in routine clinical practice, describes which patients should be screened, and reviews alternative approaches to screening. Underrecognition of BPD The Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project is an ongoing clinical research study involving the integration of research assessment methods into routine clinical practice. (17) In an early report from the MIDAS project, BPD diagnoses derived from structured and unstructured clinical interviews were compared between 2 groups of psychiatric outpatients in the same practice. (15) Individuals in the structured interview cohort were 35 times more often diagnosed with BPD than individuals evaluated with an unstructured clinical interview. Importantly, when the information from the structured interview was presented to the clinicians, BPD was more likely to be diagnosed clinically. Other studies (13,16) also found that the rate of diagnosing BPD was higher when the diagnosis was based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview compared with an unstructured clinical interview, and that clinicians were reluctant to diagnose BPD during their routine intake diagnostic evaluation. Clinicians, however, do not use semi-structured interviews in their practice, and they also do not tend to diagnose personality disorders (PDs) based on direct questioning, as they typically would when assessing a symptom-based disorder such as depression or anxiety. Rather, clinicians report that they rely on longitudinal observations to diagnose PDs. (18), However, the results from the MIDAS project were inconsistent with clinicians' reports. When clinicians were presented with the results of the semi-structured interview, they usually would diagnose BPD, even though it was the initial evaluation. If clinicians actually relied on longitudinal observations and considered information based on the direct question approach of research interviews to be irrelevant or invalid, then the results from the semi-structured interview should not have influenced the rate at which they diagnosed BPD. This suggests that the primary issue in diagnosing PDs is not the need for longitudinal observation but rather the need for more information, and that there is a role for screening questionnaires. One potential criticism of studies demonstrating underrecognition of BPD in clinical practice is that patients typically were interviewed when they presented for treatment, when most were depressed or anxious. The possible pathologizing effects of psychiatric state on personality have been known for years. (19) However, a large body of literature examining the treatment, prognostic, familial, and biological correlates of PDs supports the validity of diagnosing PDs in this manner. Moreover, from a clinical perspective, the sooner a clinician is aware of the presence of BPD, the more likely this information can be used for treatment planning. Who should be screened for BPD? BPD is underrecognized and underdiagnosed because patients with BPD often also have comorbid mood, anxiety, or substance use disorders. (20,21) The symptoms associated with these disorders are typically the chief concern of patients with undiagnosed BPD who present for treatment. Patients with BPD rarely present for an intake evaluation and state that they are struggling with abandonment fears, chronic feelings of emptiness, or an identity disturbance. If patients identified these problems as their chief concerns, BPD would be easier to recognize. Although several studies have documented the frequency of BPD in patients with a specific psychiatric diagnosis such as major depressive disorder (MDD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, (22-26) the MIDAS project examined the frequency of BPD in patients with various diagnoses and evaluated which disorders were associated with a significantly increased rate of BPD. (27) The highest rate of BPD was found in patients with bipolar disorder. Approximately 25% of patients with bipolar II disorder and one-third of those with bipolar I disorder were diagnosed with BPD; these rates were significantly higher than the rate of BPD in patients without these disorders (Table 1, (27) page 15). The rate of BPD was second highest in patients with a principal diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and MDD; however, the rate of BPD in these patients was not significantly elevated compared with patients who did not have these principal diagnoses. Three disorders were associated with a significantly lower rate of BPD: adjustment disorder, dysthymic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. It would be easy to recommend screening for BPD in all psychiatric patients. However, that is not feasible or practical. In making screening recommendations, absolute risk should be considered more important than relative risk. Clinicians should screen for BPD in patients presenting to a general psychiatric outpatient practice with a principal diagnosis of MDD, bipolar disorder, PTSD, or panic disorder with agoraphobia. That is, I recommend screening for BPD in patients with a principal diagnosis in which the prevalence of BPD is [greater than or equal to] 10% (Table 1 (27)). A brief review of screening statistics Screening tests for most psychiatric disorders are based on multi-item scales in which a total score is computed from a sum of item scores, and a cutoff point is established to determine who does and does not screen positive on the test. However, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are not invariant properties of a screening test with a continuous score distribution. Rather, the performance statistics of a scale can be altered by changing the threshold score to distinguish cases from non-cases. When the screening threshold is lowered, sensitivity increases and specificity decreases. For screening, a broad net needs to be cast so that all (or almost all) cases are included. Therefore, the cutoff score should be set low to prioritize the sensitivity of the instrument. A screening scale also should have high negative predictive value so that the clinician can be confident that patients who screen negative on the test do not have the disorder. Screening questionnaires for BPD Several questionnaires have been developed to screen for PDs (Table 2, (28-35) page 16). Some screen for each of the DSM PDs, (28,36-42) and some screen more broadly for the presence or absence of any PD. (29,43,44) The most commonly studied self-report scale for BPD is the McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (MSIBPD), (30) a 10-item self-report scale derived from a subset of questions from the BPD module of a semi-structured diagnostic interview. The initial validation study (30) found that the optimal cutoff score was 7, which resulted in a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 89%. Three studies have evaluated the scale in adolescents and young adults, (45-47) and 3 studies examined the scale in adult outpatients. (48-50) Across all 6 studies, at the optimal cutoff scores determined in each study, the sensitivity of the MSI-BPD ranged from 68% to 94% (mean, 80%) and the specificity ranged from 66% to 80% (mean, 72%). Problems with screening questionnaires. Although screening scales have been developed for many psychiatric disorders, they have not been widely used in mental health settings. In a previous commentary, I argued that the conceptual justification for using self-report screening scales for single disorders in psychiatric settings is questionable. (51) Another problem with screening scales is their potential misuse as case-finding instruments. In the literature on bipolar disorder screening, several researchers misconstrued a positive screen to indicate caseness. (51) Although this is not a problem with the screening measures or the selection of a cutoff score, caution must be taken to not confuse screening with diagnosis. (52) Screening for BPD as part of your diagnostic interview An alternative approach to using self-administered questionnaires for screening is for clinicians to include questions in their evaluation as part of a psychiatric review of systems. When conducting a diagnostic interview, clinicians typically screen for disorders that are comorbid with the principal diagnosis by asking about the comorbid disorders' necessary features or ""gate criteria."" For example, in a patient with a principal diagnosis of MDD, the clinician would inquire about the presence of panic attacks, excessive worry, or substance use to screen for the presence of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or a substance use disorder. In contrast, for polythetically defined disorders such as BPD, there is no single gate criterion, because the disorder is diagnosed based on the presence of at least 5 of 9 criteria and no single one of these criteria is required to be present to establish the diagnosis. As part of the MIDAS project, the psychometric properties of the BPD criteria were examined to determine if it was possible to identify 1 or 2 criteria that could serve as gate criteria to screen for the disorder. If the sensitivity of 1 criterion or a combination of 2 BPD criteria was sufficiently high (ie, >90%), then the assessment of this criterion (or these criteria) could be included in a psychiatric review of systems, thus potentially improving the detection of BPD. Researchers hypothesized that affective instability, considered first by Linehan (53) and later by other theorists (54) to be of central importance to the clinical manifestations of BPD, could function as a gate criterion. In the sample of 3,674 psychiatric outpatients who were evaluated with a semi-structured interview, the sensitivity of the affective instability criterion was 92.8%, and the negative predictive value of the criterion was 99%. These results from the MIDAS project were consistent with the results of other, smaller studies that found that >90% of patients with BPD report affective instability, and it was the most frequent BPD criterion. (55-62) The largest of these studies, the multisite Collaborative Longitudinal Investigation of Personality Study (CLPS), found that sensitivity of affective instability was 94%, which was higher than the sensitivity of the other BPD criteria. (62) Moreover, the CLPS examined the sensitivity of the BPD criteria assessed at baseline in relation to a diagnosis of BPD that was made 2 years later. (63) Affective instability had a 90% sensitivity and 95% negative predictive value in predicting a future diagnosis of BPD. Both of these figures were the highest of the BPD criteria. Other studies have found a negative predictive value >95%. (55,58-61) Therefore, a clinician can be highly confident in ruling out a diagnosis of BPD in patients who do not report affective instability. Table 3 lists questions used to assess affective instability in semi-structured interviews. Identifying a single BPD criterion that is present in the vast majority of patients diagnosed with BPD will allow clinicians to follow their usual clinical practice when conducting a psychiatric review of systems and inquire about the gate criteria of various disorders. Several studies have found that >90% of patients with BPD report affective instability. However, this does not mean that the diagnosis of BPD can be abbreviated to an assessment of the presence or absence of affective instability. Many patients who screen positive will not have BPD when a more definitive diagnostic evaluation is conducted. In the case of BPD, the more costly definitive diagnostic procedure simply entails inquiry of the other diagnostic criteria. References (1.) Bellino S, Patria L, Paradiso E, et al.

Bottom Line Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is underdiagnosed in clinical practice. Detection of BPD can be improved by careful clinical evaluations that inquire about the features of BPD and the use of screening questionnaires. Affective instability may serve as a gate criterion that can be used to rule out BPD or prompt a more definitive diagnostic evaluation.

Many of the symptoms, or traits, associated with borderline personality disorder can be understood as attempts to adapt to these chaotic early environments. For this reason, the best borderline personality disorder treatment includes interventions that help people process trauma, relinquish childhood fears and learn how to regulate their emotions. The primary treatment for borderline personality disorder is . However, treatment occasionally involves medications, especially when someone with BPD has co-occurring disorders. Medications for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder Therapy Options for Borderline Personality Disorder Treatments for Borderline Personality Disorder with Co-Occurring Conditions Medications for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder One of the characteristics of a personality disorder is that it develops by early adulthood or by the end of adolescence. The reason why symptoms of personality disorders are typically called “traits” is that they are established early in life, retained over time, and experienced more as an aspect of the self than a temporary or circumstantial condition. For this reason, using medications to treat borderline personality disorder is relatively rare. There are a few other reasons that using medication for borderline personality disorder has not been established as a common practice. One is that people with borderline personality disorder frequently engage in self-harm and make suicide attempts at significantly higher rates than the general population. This makes prescribing medications that could potentially result in a lethal overdose a risky approach. Another reason is that clinicians used to believe that borderline personality disorder was almost impossible to successfully treat and did not believe that pharmacotherapy for the condition was viable. While mental health professionals still take the potential for self-harm into consideration when prescribing borderline personality disorder medication, they are more likely to determine that such interventions have the potential to be successful. Recent research has revealed that borderline personality disorder responds to many interventions, including medications. (SSRIs) are a class of antidepressant medications that are effective in the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. These medications work by increasing the availability of serotonin in the brain. Recent research suggests that this increased availability of serotonin can . For these reasons, SSRIs are often prescribed to people with borderline personality disorder to improve . While research is limited, some , including lamotrigine and topiramate, have been shown to reduce aggression in people with borderline personality disorder. For this reason, these medications are only recommended for people who have difficulty controlling aggressive behavior. Since the development of second-generation or atypical in the 1990s and early 2000s, these drugs have increasingly been prescribed for conditions other than psychosis. They are often used to stabilize mood, reduce aggression and improve cognitive symptoms that arise in a wide range of psychiatric conditions. Research supports the use of aripiprazole (Abilify) and olanzapine (Zyprexa) to help people with borderline personality disorder manage aggression, affective instability or impulse control problems. Therapy Options for Borderline Personality Disorder Therapy for borderline personality disorder has traditionally focused on helping people regulate emotions, control impulses, manage or prevent crises and counter the cognitive distortions that impact their interpersonal functioning. Improved understanding of borderline personality disorder has helped treatment move beyond symptom management and coping skill development to the resolution of underlying emotional issues, especially those related to trauma. While traditional borderline personality disorder interventions are still effective and frequently used to treat the condition, trauma-focused therapies have become increasingly popular treatment options. The focus in is on helping clients gain insights into the origins of their psychological complexes, which often lie in childhood experiences. By bringing unconscious reactions or beliefs from childhood into the light of conscious awareness, a person can be freed from them and learn how to make more conscious choices about what they believe and how they act as adults. Since most people with borderline personality disorder grew up in abusive or chaotic homes, their unconscious reactions, beliefs and adaptive strategies were shaped by these environments. A psychodynamic therapist can help a person with borderline personality disorder identify and process past experiences and re-shape beliefs about relationships that were derived from experiences with their parents and other authority figures. is one of the most thoroughly researched and effective interventions for a wide range of psychiatric conditions. It remains the primary therapy for treating depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other . Cognitive behavioral therapy for borderline personality disorder is less popular than CBT for other disorders because cognitive elements are less primary in borderline personality disorder. However, it remains an effective choice for the treatment of certain aspects of the disorder. CBT can help people with borderline personality disorder: Address negative beliefs about people and relationships that provoke their intense emotional reactions to interpersonal conflict Identify triggers to self-destructive or impulsive behavior and establish alternative methods for coping with them when they arise Learn behavioral techniques for self-soothing and relaxation such as progressive relaxation, visualization and grounding techniques One of the best interventions for borderline personality disorder, (DBT) was derived from CBT and tailored to specifically address borderline symptoms and traits.  It has become one of the most widely used and effective interventions for borderline personality disorder and is now used to treat mood and trauma-based disorders as well. DBT combines CBT techniques with techniques drawn from meditation and mindfulness practices. The goal of DBT is to help people with borderline personality disorder become more aware of their emotions and learn how to hold them in awareness without acting on them. DBT is specifically designed to improve: DBT often uses a in which a person develops skills in the above four areas to establish more behavioral control before moving on to deeper healing work in therapy. A 2006 study by found that DBT reduced the rate of suicide attempts by half in the group of women that were studied. It also reduced rates of hospitalization and premature cessation of treatment. A 2007 study by found transference-focused (psychodynamic) psychotherapy and CBT to be equally effective in improving mood, reducing anxiety, raising levels of general functioning and improving social outcomes in a group of people with borderline personality disorder. Mentalization is the process by which people come to understand themselves and others, particularly by developing empathy for. Mentalization-based therapy (MBT) is designed to improve this process. It helps people with BPD establish a more stable sense of self and gain more insight into their emotional processes. It can also help people with BPD improve their interpersonal and conflict resolution skills. Research by shows that MBT reduced suicidality, improved treatment retention, , and increased global functioning in people with borderline personality disorder. In other words, it reduced the negative impacts of borderline personality disorder in similar ways and to a similar extent as DBT. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR) was specifically designed to help people process and heal from trauma. In EMDR, people recall traumatic memories while tracking a visual or auditory signal. The way this particular mechanism works to help people re-process trauma is not clear, but research shows that EMDR is in treating trauma-related conditions, especially post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Other therapeutic interventions that have proven to be effective in treating trauma-related conditions are , (CPT) and trauma-focused CBT techniques like stress inoculation training (SIT). People with borderline personality disorder typically have histories of trauma and can benefit from these interventions when they are ready to address it. Treatments for Borderline Personality Disorder with Co-Occurring Conditions Almost half of the people with borderline personality disorder have simultaneous anxiety, mood or substance use disorders, and have at least one lifetime episode of these disorders. It is important that clinicians evaluate clients with borderline personality disorder for co-occurring conditions and address them in treatment. Most people with borderline personality disorder have comorbid . The combined effects of these co-occurring conditions can make interpersonal situations especially painful and distressing to navigate. The primary and most effective treatment plan for anxiety disorders includes SSRIs and CBT. These can be safely used in conjunction with interventions for BPD. Behavioral techniques for relaxation and grounding are especially effective for people with symptoms of anxiety and dissociation, helping them reconnect with their bodies and the present moment. Slightly more than half of the people with borderline personality disorder have co-occurring mood disorders. About 20 percent of people with borderline personality disorder also have . Comorbid borderline personality disorder and depression can be an especially destructive combination, significantly increasing the risk of suicide and lowering quality of life. As with anxiety, depression is most effectively treated with antidepressants and CBT, which can be incorporated into the integrated treatment of borderline personality disorder and depression. Almost half of the people with borderline personality disorder also have a substance use disorder. Treating can be even more complex than treating other comorbid disorders due to the particular qualities of the condition and the way they are affected by substance use. For people with co-occurring borderline personality and substance use disorders, life can become so chaotic and overwhelming that it seems like it can only get worse. However, with treatment, the chaos can clear and life can become not only manageable but joyful.

For example, in outpatient mental health settings, people with borderline personality disorder make up about 10 percent of the population. In inpatient psychiatric hospitals, the number climbs to 20 percent. Symptoms of BPD usually begin in early adulthood and may decrease later in adulthood as people in their 30s and 40s achieve stability. . About 75 percent of people diagnosed with BPD are women. BPD is a challenging condition to accurately diagnose quickly because the range of symptoms frequently results in The problem is BPD shares many symptoms with other like depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder, so it can be impossible for a professional to see the total clinical picture of the individual at first.

In fact, people with both BPD and PTSD often report earlier experiences of trauma compared to people who are only diagnosed with PTSD. The and unstable relationships common in people with BPD can place them at a greater risk for experiencing a traumatic event such as a motor vehicle accident, physical assault, or sexual assault.

Many people with experience paranoia or paranoid thinking under conditions of stress.﻿ Paranoia is a term generally used to refer to intense beliefs of mistrust or the malicious intentions of others. For example, someone with paranoia may have the belief that the government is listening to their phone calls, or that their spouse is having an affair. Episodes of paranoid thinking, or ideation, can range from mild and short-lived to very severe and chronic. Some individuals with psychotic disorders, such as or delusional disorder, tend to have severe, chronic paranoid ideation that has no relationship to reality.﻿ While many people with borderline personality disorder do experience paranoia since it is part of the , it tends to occur only under conditions of stress or interpersonal conflict.﻿ For example, an adolescent with BPD might see two of his friends talking in the hallway and develop the paranoid belief that his friends all secretly hate him and are planning to humiliate him. Or an adult with BPD might misread their partner’s cues that they want some alone time as a sign that the relationship is being terminated, and dwell on this belief even when a great deal of evidence to the contrary is presented. At least one study suggests that while individuals with BPD differ from those with psychotic disorders in terms of their psychotic reactivity, which is their tendency to have and other thinking and perceptual problems under stress, they do not necessarily differ from patients with psychotic disorders in terms of the intensity of the paranoia or other psychotic experience.﻿ So, while people with BPD have short-term psychotic symptoms, these symptoms are not necessarily mild. Because paranoia in BPD is worse when you are under stress, you may find it helpful to find ways to relax and . Some popular stress busters are:﻿ In biofeedback, you learn how to control things such as heart rate andcertain muscles by having monitors attached to you so you can visualize and hear what's going on in your body.

c04d2217-e4da-4d62-b93a-1d3a6162a774,"Personality disorders make up a group of in which a person displays long-term rigid patterns of behavior and thoughts that don’t adapt to a wide range of settings. Most people who have these disorders don’t seek treatment immediately, even if personality disorder treatment program options are available for them. If you are, or a person you know is, displaying behaviors that highly interfere with the ability to function normally in work or relationships, don’t hesitate to contact us at to get information on how you can help yourself or someone you love. Many different types of personality disorders exist, and the symptoms vary greatly according to each type. Commonly diagnosed personality disorders include: According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), about 9.1 percent of the US adult population experience a personality disorder in a 12-month prevalence period. Most of these people often suffer from a co-occurring major mental disorder, such as depression, , and others. No known definite cause of personality disorders exists, although researchers believe genetics and environmental factors play a huge role in developing the condition. In some studies, some malfunctioning genes might cause certain personality disorders, while another study links anxiety, fear and aggression to genetics. Other factors being explored as possible include: Childhood trauma. Many people who are diagnosed with borderline or schizotypal personality disorder experienced sexual trauma or bullying during childhood. Verbal abuse. Children who’ve suffered from insensitive parenting and verbal abuse during childhood are three times more likely to suffer from narcissistic personality disorder. High reactivity. Sensitivity to light, texture, noise and other stimuli might also cause a very young child to develop anxious personalities during their teenage years and into adulthood. However, only 10 percent of highly reactive infants develop a certain type of phobia. Peers. Strong bonds or relationships with family, relatives or friends might cause dependent personality disorder. Many psychologists narrow down the probable root of the disorder in order to design a therapy that can help treat a person’s specific disorder. It’s important to speak honestly with a doctor or psychologist when you or a person you love is undergoing assessment and diagnosis to make sure you or the person involved can get proper treatment. Personality disorders are difficult to cure because people who suffer from the condition often have abnormal thoughts and behaviors that prevent them from thinking and functioning as well as they should. Most have denial issues and reject the presence of their condition; however, these disorders don’t go away without proper treatment. According to the NIMH, 42.4 percent of people diagnosed with personality disorder are receiving treatment. The treatment depends on a person’s particular personality disorder. Treatments available include medications, hospitalization and psychotherapy. Call us at to get more information about various treatment and program options for specific types of personality disorder. Therapy is a general term for the application of techniques used to improve a person’s mental or physical well-being. Psychotherapy is the main way of dealing with and treating mental conditions like personality disorders. Also called “talk therapy,” therapists deal with the patients by encouraging them to talk about their condition, feelings, thoughts, mood and behavior. Several types of psychotherapy for mental illnesses include: Cognitive behavioral therapy, also known as CBT, helps patients to recognize and alter their inaccurate perception about themselves, other people and the world around them. Most therapists combine cognitive and behavioral therapies to replace a person’s unhealthy thoughts with positive and healthier perceptions. Aside from cognitive and behavioral, another branch of CBT is dynamic, or an examination of a person’s early childhood to identify the possible cause of that person’s personality disorder. CBT is ideal for individuals who can’t take medications for their disorder or for those who have thoughts and behavioral patterns that display a form of mental illness. It’s also used alongside antidepressants or medications during hospitalization, and it is a recommended therapy for people of all ages who have mental conditions. Other forms of CBT are also considered helpful in treating personality disorders. For example, dialectical behavior therapy is indicated for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, a disorder where suicidal thoughts and self-mutilation actions are common. During a DBT session, the therapist assures the patient that their behavior and actions are understandable and valid. By the end of the therapy, the patient should be able to change disruptive or unhealthy behavior. Interpersonal therapy focuses mainly on how patients interact with family and friends. This therapy is often used on a one-on-one basis as a way of addressing and . It’s based on the idea that a person’s way of communicating with others affects their moods and feelings, and improving communication skills might improve a person’s case of depression. On the other hand, family-focused therapy is mainly used in treating bipolar disorder. The therapy educates the patient’s family on their family member’s condition and informs them of ways to effectively handle or live with difficulties associated with the condition. Residential Inpatient Personality Disorder Treatment Centers Personality disorders tend to be chronic and often require long-term treatment. When the symptoms are severe or other physical or mental conditions are present, hospitalization inside a personality disorder facility could be required to treat the disorder. Residential or inpatient treatment centers can offer acute or long-term treatment program, depending on the type and severity of the personality disorder of the patient. Patients with borderline personality disorder, which make up about 6 percent of the US adult population, utilize inpatient treatment programs because of their inability to control and regulate their emotions and behaviors. Many people who have personality disorders require the care of skilled general psychiatrists and a disciplined staff due to their pervasive behavior and emotional problems. A residential treatment facility offers a supportive environment and 24-hour monitoring and medical care. The disorders also require complex handling, which can be managed immediately in an acute setting like a residential personality disorder facility. Most residential centers also provide therapeutic communities (TC) where patients undergo a more intensive form of therapy. Participating in TCs requires a high level of commitment as well as a willingness to take part in group therapy and activities.

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. If you or a loved one has a borderline personality disorder (), you may be wondering what caused it or if you are to blame. The development of this disorder is complex, and there are likely a variety of borderline personality disorder causes, and you should rest assured that no one person or thing is at fault. Most experts believe that BPD develops as a result of biological, genetic, and environmental factors.﻿ However, it is essential to keep in mind that the exact causes of BPD are not known yet. Right now, these are theories that have some support in support but are by no means conclusive. More research is needed to determine how and why the factors discussed below are related to BPD. Potential Environmental Borderline Personality Disorder Causes There is strong evidence to support a link between distressing childhood experiences, particularly involving caregivers, and BPD.﻿ The types of experiences that may be associated with BPD include: It is thought that interaction between biological factors (discussed below) and an invalidating childhood environment may work together in predisposing a person to develop BPD. An emotionally invalidating environment is one in which a child's emotional needs are not met.﻿ An is not always evident to those who have experienced it or to others around them. These painful experiences can be hidden and even disguised as praise. Not everyone who has BPD has had these types of childhood experiences (although a large number have). And not everyone who has these types of experiences will have BPD. It is likely that a combination of factors, rather than a single cause, is responsible for most cases of borderline personality disorder. Potential Genetic and Biological Borderline Personality Disorder Causes While early studies showed that , for some time, it was not known whether this was because of environmental influences or because of genetics. There is now some evidence that in addition to the environment, play a significant role.﻿ In particular, studies have shown that a variation in a gene that controls the way the brain uses (a natural chemical in the brain) may be related to BPD.﻿ It appears that individuals who have this specific variation of the serotonin gene may be more likely to develop BPD if they also experience difficult childhood events (for example, separation from supportive caregivers). One study found that monkeys with the serotonin gene variation developed symptoms that looked similar to BPD, but only when they were taken from their mothers and raised in less nurturing environments. Monkeys with the gene variation who were raised by nurturing mothers were much less likely to develop BPD-like symptoms.﻿ Several studies have shown that people with BPD have differences in both the structure of their brain and in brain function. BPD has been associated with excessive activity in parts of the brain that control the experience and expression of emotion.﻿ For example, people with BPD have more activation of the limbic system, an area of the brain that controls fear, anger, and aggression, than people without BPD. This may be related to the emotional instability symptoms of BPD. Newer studies are also findings associated with the hormone oxytocin and the development of BPD.﻿ Bottom Line on the Causes of Borderline Personality Disorder There is much to be learned about the causes of BPD, and it's likely that it is a combination of factors rather than any one specific finding which can lead to the disorder. Research is in progress and hopefully we will learn more in the coming years. Understanding the causes may help prevent the onset of the disorder, especially in those who have a genetic or biological predisposition to the disorder. As it is, an invalidating environment is harmful to a child whether or not it raises the likelihood of BPD in the future, and it is crucial for therapists to be alert for this setting in children. Although it can be challenging to be optimally validating to children who have the underlying biological vulnerabilities that may contribute to BPD. Sometimes an invalidating environment can be hidden, with many comments appearing to be comments of praise on the surface, emotions can easily be mistaken as just an oversensitivity on the part of the child. It's important for adults who experienced emotional invalidation as a child to learn to recognize the difference between validating and invalidating remarks from others to better protect themselves from further hurt and navigate these interpersonal interactions more effectively.

Emotions are easily triggered and are typically inappropriate or disproportionate to the circumstances.. Often, those with BPD are insecure in . They regularly assume that other people will leave them or reject them, potentially leading to frantic efforts to avoid this. : In response to some sort of stimulus, people with BPD often respond and may engage in dangerous behaviors. Many people with BPD cycle between emotions rapidly. In the morning, they may be happy, full of energy, and optimistic.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved 6 Common Myths About Borderline Personality Disorder Erin Johnston, LCSW is a therapist, counselor, coach, and mediator with a private practice in Chicago, Illinois. Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania.  (BPD) is a mental illness that is commonly misunderstood by the general population and even some healthcare professionals. It's also a disorder that has the potential to negatively impact the lives of others. Because of these two issues, there are many myths about BPD that exist. If you or someone you know has BPD, it's important to understand the truth about the illness in order to begin recovery. Below are some of the most common myths about BPD. Myth 1: Borderline Personality Disorder Is Not Treatable This is completely false; . If you think you have BPD, don't let this myth scare you away from therapy or make you feel helpless. Having a diagnosis does not mean that you will forever experience the symptoms of BPD. Hard work and effective treatment, such as psychotherapy, can greatly reduce the severity of BPD symptoms and may help you live a normal life.﻿ Even without treatment, the symptoms of the disorder will ebb and flow over time; some people with BPD are able to function at a higher level than others, so recovery is different for each person. Myth 2: All People With BPD Are Victims of Childhood Abuse Too often, well-meaning people who do not understand BPD believe it is caused by abuse experienced while the affected person was a child. This can change the way people interact with you or talk to you if you have BPD, which can be frustrating if you did not experience abuse. It can feel like your own experience isn't understood or is different. While some people who have BPD were abused, it is not true of all BPD patients and should be viewed with a more open mind.  There is no known  at this time. However, the cause is generally seen as a combination of biological and environmental factors, rather than linked to any one cause.﻿ Myth 3: Children and Adolescents Cannot Be Diagnosed With BPD Children and with borderline personality disorder. However, due to the generally accepted belief that personality is still forming throughout adolescence, diagnosing kids or teens with BPD has been controversial.﻿ The Diagnostic Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) lays out clear standards for a diagnosis for BPD. Caution must be used when giving any diagnosis, and this can be especially true for BPD as the symptoms can often mimic typical adolescent behavior. A professional therapist with experience with BPD can help distinguish the difference. Early diagnosis can be helpful in ensuring that an individual gets the intervention needed to begin recovery. are completely different disorders. Although the symptoms of bipolar and BPD may appear somewhat similar, they are two very distinct illnesses. Because even healthcare providers lack knowledge about BPD, people with BPD are often misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder,﻿ adding to the confusion. It is also important to note that medications used to treat bipolar disorder often do not work on BPD patients, so a therapist with a background in BPD is essential to get an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. While the previous school of thought was that women are more commonly diagnosed with BPD than men, more recent research has shown that the rates are comparable. But how someone shows signs of BPD can differ. While women tend to exhibit symptoms like mood swings and feelings of emptiness, men tend towards behavioral impulsivity.﻿ Myth 6: If You Know One Person With BPD, You Know Them All Every person is unique, and having BPD doesn't change that. According to the DSM-V, the standard for mental healthcare, certain criteria must be met for BPD to be diagnosed. The criterium includes impairment in personality functioning and in . The way these impairments show themselves is different in every individual. In addition, not all individuals experience specific symptoms in the same way. One person's difficulty with relationships may be different than yours. Each person experiences BPD in very different ways. Learn the best ways to manage stress and negativity in your life.

'SNL' Star Pete Davidson Was Diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder 'SNL' Star Pete Davidson Was Diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder Here's what it really means to live with the condition. ’s Pete Davidson made a surprising revelation this week: He was recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a serious mental health condition that's often confused with . The 23-year-old talked about his condition on the podcast, and detailed the long, trying process of getting diagnosed with the disorder. ""I've been a pothead forever,"" he said. “Around October [or] September last year, I started having these mental breakdowns where I would, like, freak out and then not remember what happened after. Blind rage."" Davidson says he originally thought weed was the issue. ""I never really did any other drugs, so I was like, 'I'm gonna try to go to rehab. Maybe that'll be helpful,' "" he said. ""So I go and I get off weed. They told me there, they're like, 'You might be bipolar,' and I was like, 'OK.' So they're like, 'We're gonna try you on these meds.'” When Davidson left rehab, he says he started smoking weed again and two months later he “just snapped” and had a ""really bad mental breakdown."" He figured his pot-smoking habit was the issue so he stopped smoking again. But after three months, he didn’t feel any differently. ""I found out I have BPD, which is borderline personality disorder,"" he said. ""One of my psychiatrists [diagnosed me]. He was always saying before this big meltdown, 'You're probably bipolar or borderline, we're just going to have to figure it out.' ... I'm depressed all the time."" Davidson is now undergoing therapy and taking new medication for his BPD. ""It is working, slowly but surely,"" he said. ""I've been having a lot of problems. This whole year has been a fucking nightmare. This has been the worst year of my life, getting diagnosed with this and trying to figure out how to learn with this and live with this."" is a serious mental health condition marked by a pattern of ongoing instability in a person’s moods, behavior, self-image, and functioning. It's estimated that up to 5.9 percent of adults in the U.S. has BPD, according to the (NAMI). “These are much more sensitive and emotionally reactive people than the general population,” Alec Miller, Psy.D., cofounder and clinical director of in Westchester and New York City, and author of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy with Suicidal Adolescents, tells SELF. People with untreated BPD often have unstable relationships and can have intense episodes of anger, , and anxiety, he says. It’s not uncommon for borderline personality disorder to be misdiagnosed as other disorders. Both BPD and bipolar disorder are characterized by extreme mood swings, which is why people may confuse the two, Simon Rego, Psy.D., chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, tells SELF. “There is a big overlap in this and the symptoms can often look quite similar,” he says. But one of the key differences between the two is how often those mood swings present. People with BPD will have shorter, more frequent mood changes than those with bipolar disorder, Jeffrey Borenstein, M.D., president and CEO of the , tells SELF. Whereas with bipolar disorder, someone may spend a longer period of time in a depressed or manic state, Miller says. With borderline personality disorder, Rego says “there are more chronic feelings of ‘I don’t know who I am,’ relationships are unstable, and there are often worries about being abandoned.” The name “borderline personality disorder” is still controversial. While the term ""personality disorder"" may infer that this is akin to having a difficult personality, that's not the case. “We all have personalities and bits of pieces of them that are helpful and unhelpful,” Rego says. “But it becomes a disorder when there are problems or significant interference in relationships and life caused by a person’s personality.” The term first surfaced in 1980 in the third edition of the , which professionals use as a guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders. “Before that there was no such term,” Nassir Ghaemi, M.D., professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine, tells SELF. The name is controversial because “it basically says that somebody’s personality is abnormal in some way,” he says. For years, BPD was a stigmatized disorder, Miller says, and doctors were reluctant to give the diagnosis for that reason. It was also seen as a condition that wasn’t treatable. “Now the field has moved along and we have effective treatments for borderline personality disorder,” he says. “People are feeling less stigmatized and more hopeful.” The National Institute of Mental Health even addresses the issue , noting that “while mental health experts now generally agree that the label ‘borderline personality disorder’ is very misleading, a more accurate term does not exist yet.” The standard of treatment for BPD is . With DBT, patients use the concept of mindfulness, (i.e. being aware of and paying attention to your current situation and moods) to learn to better control their emotions and reduce self-destructive behaviors, Miller says. “It’s essentially a skills-based approach which says that if our patients could do better, they would, but they’re lacking skills,” he says. “It’s so easy for us to tell people to stop problematic behaviors but it’s better to teach them new skills.” Cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and change core beliefs and behaviors that cause them to have inaccurate perceptions of themselves and others, and schema-focused therapy, which focuses on changing the ways people view themselves, can also be helpful, according to the NIMH. Still, DBT is seen as the gold standard when it comes to treating BPD, Rego says. Miller teaches DBT in a classroom setting in which patients learn new coping and life skills once a week (in addition to individual therapy). This typically goes on for a minimum of six months before patients “graduate.” Dr. Borenstein explains that DBT is often combined with medications to reduce impulsive and self-destructive behavior. However, medication isn’t needed or used in all cases, Rego adds. As with most mental health disorders, BPD can be a lifelong condition. But it's possible to get symptoms under control. “People can make great strides,” Rego says. “That doesn’t mean you’re not vulnerable down the road or susceptible to flare-ups, but people can get better.” Olympic Gold Medalist Kelly Holmes Gets Honest About Self-Harm Demi Lovato: 'It Is Possible to Live Well' with Bipolar Disorder You May Also Like: Do We Really Need Sports Drinks?

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved Research on Borderline Personality Disorder Subtypes Kristalyn Salters-Pedneault, PhD, is a clinical psychologist and associate professor of psychology at Eastern Connecticut State University. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. (BPD) is associated with a number of different . In order to be diagnosed with BPD, an individual must meet just five out of a total of nine , meaning that BPD in one person can look very different from BPD in another.﻿ This has led some experts to wonder whether there are actually distinct types of borderline personalities. In popular media and pop psychology books, there is a great deal of discussion of different BPD subtypes. For example, in her book , Dr. Christine Lawson, describes four subtypes of mothers with BPD: the Waif (helpless), the Hermit (fearful/avoidant), the Queen (controlling) and the Witch (sadistic). In The Essential Family Guide to Borderline Personality Disorder by Randi Kreger, people with BPD are grouped into lower-functioning/conventional types versus higher-functioning/invisible types. The conventional type is described as engaging in a lot of self-destructive behavior that requires frequent hospitalization, and being very low-functioning, meaning he or she may not be able to work or go to school. The author calls this self-destructive behavior ""acting in,"" an idea that correlates with the concept of . In contrast, the invisible type is described as functioning well in most contexts, but engaging in a great deal of ""acting out"" behavior, such as verbal abuse, criticizing others or becoming violent. This description correlates well with the concept of . These subtypes of BPD in popular literature were derived from the authors' own expert opinions on the existence of different types of borderline personalities. More recently, researchers have tried to take a quantitative approach to describe subtypes of BPD. The research on the topic paints a more complicated picture. The research on the existence of subtypes of BPD is mixed. Some research studies have found that BPD can be treated as a unified diagnostic entity without the presence of clear subtypes. But other studies have identified some subtypes of BPD. One study, which examined types of borderline personalities based on patterns of co-occurring personality problems, identified three subtypes of BPD that map onto the three clusters of personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Cluster A, , and Cluster C. Those in the Cluster A subgroup tended to engage in more paranoid thinking and eccentric behavior, those in B tended to have more dramatic or arrogant personalities, and those in C tended to be more fearful. Another study that examined BPD subtypes in adolescent boys and girls with BPD found reliable subtypes in girls, but not boys. Girls with BPD tended to fall into one of the following categories: high-functioning internalizing, depressive internalizing,  and angry externalizing. A third study found three BPD subtypes: withdrawn–internalizing, severely disturbed–internalizing and anxious–externalizing.﻿﻿ Interestingly, these last two studies suggest that the distinctions between internalizing versus externalizing symptoms and high versus low functioning may be an important one in BPD, and may in part validate some of the popular psychology literature on the topic. Because of the inconsistencies in the research literature, much more study is needed on this topic. At least one study has found that individuals with different presentations of BPD may respond differently to treatment. In this study, individuals from the severely disturbed-internalizing subtype did not see symptom improvement with treatment, whereas those in the anxious-externalizing and withdrawn-internalizing subtypes did.﻿ This suggests that the may be different depending on the subtype that an individual belongs to. However, much more research is needed before we can say anything definitive about differential treatment response. 6 Common Myths About Borderline Personality Disorder Learn the best ways to manage stress and negativity in your life.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved Comorbidities and Borderline Personality Disorder Kristalyn Salters-Pedneault, PhD, is a clinical psychologist and associate professor of psychology at Eastern Connecticut State University. David Susman, PhD is a licensed clinical psychologist with experience providing treatment to individuals with mental illness and substance use concerns. If you have (BPD), you may find that standard treatment plans are difficult to find. Treatment plans for many people with BPD will be individualized because few of these individuals have only one illness. Most people affected by BPD have other disorders, known as comorbidities. Research has shown that physical and psychiatric comorbidities are more common in individuals with borderline personality disorder.﻿ A comorbidity refers to the existence of two or more diseases or conditions in the same individual at the same time. Some of the most common comorbidities that occur alongside BPD are , , and .﻿ A person who has both BPD and depression would be referred to as having 'comorbid depression and BPD.'  While by definition comorbid disorders must exist at the same time, it may be the case that one of the conditions or disorders may have started before the other. For example, someone may develop PTSD in childhood, then later develop BPD as an adolescent. Or, both conditions may develop at the same time, but one may end while the other continues or worsens. For as long as the symptoms of both disorders overlap in time, they are considered to be comorbid. Comorbidities can lead to problems, particularly if you have BPD. The other illnesses, like depression or anxiety, are more easily recognized and are more regularly treated. Many people are not appropriately diagnosed with BPD because the other illnesses ""hide"" the BPD symptoms. This means that the personality disorder symptoms go untreated and unchecked. While depression and anxiety may be treated with medication, there are no medications currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat BPD. There are, however, several different medications that are often used ""off-label"" (without FDA approval) to treat BPD symptoms. If BPD is not recognized, your disorder can go undiagnosed and untreated for months or even years, making you feel even worse and putting your health at risk. Regardless of the comorbidities that exist, BPD needs to be addressed as a distinct and unique disorder. While other illnesses can be treated and managed with medications, BPD usually requires a more intensive approach. Many forms of psychotherapy have shown significant positive results in clinical studies, especially .﻿ Therapy is an essential part of managing BPD. Look for a therapist who understands comorbidities and who specializes in BPD to develop an effective treatment plan for you. In some cases of comorbidities, you may need multiple physicians and therapists to handle every aspect of BPD and the other disorders. In this case, it's important that all of your healthcare providers know what's going on with other aspects of your treatments. If there are any changes to your therapy plan or medication regimen, make sure everyone on your medical team is aware. Clear communication between all your health care providers can prevent misunderstandings or mix-ups that could interrupt your recovery. Keeping communication open between parties will ensure your therapy moves forward appropriately. While comorbidities can make BPD more difficult to diagnose and manage, understanding the other disorders and how they impact BPD is essential to developing an effective treatment plan. If you are unsure if you have other disorders or think you are at risk of developing a comorbidity, talk with your doctor or therapist to be evaluated.

ec3eb5cb-87c4-46cb-88a9-6fbc2f3ac964,"In the movie Silver Linings Playbook there are two main characters, Pat and Tiffany, whom portray a type of mental illness. Below, I will explain each character in regards to their symptoms and portrayal of mental illness and compare the information discussed in the Abnormal Psychology Textbook. Pat (Bradley Cooper): In the beginning, Pat was recently discharged from a mental health facility for dangerous aggression after witnessing his wife cheat on him with a co-worker. Personally, it seemed as though Pat Solitano meets the criteria for Bipolar I Disorder. Bipolar Disorder is the tendency of manic episodes to alternate with major depressive episodes, like a roller coaster. (Barlow, D., Durand, M., Stewart,S., & Lalumière, M., 2014, p. 222).According to the textbook, borderline personality disorder is one of the most common personality disorders. People with borderline personality disorder lead unrestrained lives. Their moods and relationships are unstable and they usually have a very poor self image, recurrent feelings of emptiness and fear of abandonment. (Barlow, D., Durand, M., Stewart, S., & Lalumière, M., 2014, p. 444). That said, Tiffany was not diagnosed nor mentioned to have borderline personality disorder in the movie, but she did portray some of the symptoms that are listed from theIt tells the story of a person, family and community in which individuals suffer from mental disorders much the same way as people do in the real world. Not only did I find this movie quite accurate concerning mental illness but I also established some important messages concerning mental illness in today’s society. The film takes into account that mental illness is a part of society and overall has a positive outlook on it. Their illnesses don 't define their identities nor are they even the main point of the story. In coming together, the characters find the mutual support that enables them to approach their struggles and redirect their lives in a more positive direction. To some degree, this film addresses stigma and the fact that persons with mental illness should be allowed to participate in society over being kept in a hospital, in other words, it gives Nursing should focus on patient and family centered care, with nurses being the patient advocate for the care the patient receives. Patient and family centered care implies family participation. This type of care involves patients and their families in their health care treatments and decisions. I believe that it is important to incorporate this kind of care at Orange Regional Medical Center (ORMC) because it can ensure that we are meeting the patient’s physical, emotional, and spiritual needs through their hospitalization. Treating the patient and family as one, can have improved outcomes, decrease hospital stays, increased patient satisfaction, and improved reimbursements for the hospital. This hope is that living a normal life with a mental health condition is possible. Other feeling he portrays is his ability to love and his passion. His passion was very evident when he talked about society accepting mental health diseases. He wants everyone to understand it’s not their fault and reducing the stigma Emotional Intelligence, Reflective Practice and Therapeutic Relationship in Nursing For nurses to be able to empathize with their patients and treat them with compassion, they have to be self-aware. When nurses are self-aware, they are able to positively change their attitude and actions in order to best understand how different people treat them, hence improving nurse- patient relationship. Relationships are easy until there is emotional turmoil. Thus, being self-aware is important to any health care professional that needs to manage their cognitive, affective and behavioural self in order to engage effectively in therapeutic relationship (Taylor, 2006). Self-awareness is important because it helps us to build a better understanding of ourselves. There are many parts of learning about bipolar disorder, such as; what it is, the types of bipolar, what can cause it, the symptoms and signs, diagnoses, treatments, and how to live with the illness. Leaning as much about it and the treatments for it, can make living with this disorder, more manageable. When people come across someone who is acting in the extreme, whether it be extremely depressed or on an extreme high, the first thing that comes to mind, more than likely, isn’t a medical condition. One acting in the extreme high, in this case, is known as a manic episode. Whereas, being extremely depressed is known as a depressive episode. While the movie does not explain how or why Nash is affected by paranoid schizophrenia, it does brilliantly portray the common symptoms and treatments of the disorder. Not only does it teach audiences the facts about this type of schizophrenia, the film allows audiences to truly understand the mental disorder from a medical, personal, and emotional perspective. John Nash is just one of many people who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and films such as A Beautiful Mind are an important way that their stories can be Bipolar Disorder: The Roller Coaster Ride From Hell Bipolar Disorder: The Roller Coaster Ride From Hell Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that is often misdiagnosed, left untreated and misunderstood by the patient, family and friends. Its treatment varies among the different types of the disorder. The forms of Bipolar are characterized by symptoms of the patient and the symptoms are treated according to the patient’s needs. However, many symptoms are often misdiagnosed and untreated. This mistreatment or lack of treatment can lead to devastating results. Stratta, D. Tempesta, R. L. Bonanni, S. de Cataldo, and A. Rossi Journal of Clinical Psychology 2014), indicates that bipolar disorder is well controlled with medication. According to the article “… Emotional reactivity in affectivity on affective disorders has received increasing attention because of the impact at an individual and social level that can lead to negative consequences in real-world setting (p. 1). In relation to the movie “Mr. Jones” (1993), the character Mr. Jones refuses treatment and he ends up having many episodes of mania which leads him to take unnecessary risks, having inappropriate behaviors and severely depressed, in contrast when Mr. Jones goes back to the hospital to get treated he was able to control his feelings and cope better with daily The movie Girl Interrupted is a true story about a young woman who was put into a mental institute and diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Winona Ryder plays Susanna, who was just a girl who had a hard time telling the difference between dreams and reality. She was put into the hospital because she tried to commit suicide by taking a bottle of aspirin and drinking a bottle of vodka at the same time. When Susanna first got to the hospital, she did not feel that she needed to be there. However, she did agree that she was depressed and needed to rest. 2013). ""Depression"" describes the opposite mood -- sadness, crying, sense of worthlessness, loss of energy, loss of pleasure, sleep problems (What is Bipolar Disorder? 2013).

The main character is Pat Solitano and he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he nearly beat his wife’s lover to death. As the movie goes on we are also introduced to Tiffany who seems just as “crazy” as Pat, but amazingly she helps him control his episodes through dancing. According to the DSM-5, a book published by the American Psychiatric Association, which helps psychologists diagnose a person with a mental illness, Pat does somewhat reach abnormality. His mood swings lead him to do things that would not be considered “ok” by society and his mood swings also interfere with his daily life as well as his relationship with the people around him.

If you have been recently diagnosed with (BPD), you may feel overwhelmed, scared and alone. But BPD is much more common than you probably think. Learning the facts about the disorder, including prevalence statistics, can help you feel more empowered to seek help through therapy and support groups. Here are some relevant BPD facts and figures. In the United States, recent research has shown that 1.6% of the population has BPD.﻿﻿ That number may seem small, but when you consider just how large the United States is, you may realize that 1.6% represents quite a large number of people. That percentage means that over four million people have BPD in America alone. While BPD is not as well known as other disorders, it is actually more common than illnesses like . Women are far more likely to be diagnosed with BPD than men. In fact, about 75% of people diagnosed with BPD are women; that's a ratio of 3 women to 1 man diagnosed with BPD.﻿﻿ Researchers do not know why there is this gender difference. It may be that women are more prone to BPD, women may be more likely to pursue treatment or that there are gender biases when it comes to diagnosis. For instance, men with symptoms of BPD may be more likely to be misdiagnosed with another condition like or major depressive disorder. Some of the most sobering borderline personality disorder statistics come from the research literature on BPD and suicidality. About 70% of people with BPD will make at least one suicide attempt in their lifetimes.﻿ If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the at for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our . In addition, between 8 and 10% of people with BPD will complete suicide; this rate is more than 50 times the rate of suicide in the general population. Why these rates are so high is currently unknown. It may because people with BPD don't know where to turn for treatment or are misdiagnosed and not treated appropriately. While 1.6% is the recorded percentage of people with BPD, the actual prevalence may be even higher. In a recent study, over 40% of people with BPD had been previously misdiagnosed with other disorders like bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder.﻿﻿ These illnesses are often cited, potentially because they are more well-known and more easily treated with medications than borderline personality disorder. It's also common for those with BPD to have comorbidities or other illnesses along with BPD. In fact, as many as 20% of people with BPD have also been found to have , making their diagnosis and treatment more complicated than treating one disease. While BPD is a serious mental illness, it is by no means a life sentence. Research has shown that the for BPD is actually not as bad at once thought. Almost half of people who are diagnosed with BPD will not meet the criteria for a diagnosis just two years later. Ten years later, 88% of people who were once diagnosed with BPD no longer meet the criteria for a diagnosis. Learn the best ways to manage stress and negativity in your life.

I think she has borderline personality disorder—she fits all the symptoms. I have heard BPD is a life-long illness. Is it in my best interest to divorce her?"" Should You Divorce Your Borderline Personality Disorder Spouse?​ Sadly, there is no easy answer to this one. Whether or not you choose to divorce your spouse is a big personal decision, and no one can tell you what is right for you. However, here are some things to consider. First, you haven't mentioned whether your wife has actually been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. There could be a variety of conditions that cause the symptoms you describe, and it is very important that she get a thorough to determine what exactly is going on. The second thing to consider is that a considerable proportion of people with borderline personality disorder do respond to treatment.﻿ Before thinking of divorce, it makes sense to see if your spouse is willing and able to engage in that may reduce symptoms. Even if your wife is definitively diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and is clearly in trouble, you shouldn't assume that the situation will remain so difficult. It is worth noting that even without treatment, the can be quite good. Many people who are diagnosed with borderline personality disorder do not meet criteria for the disorder within just a few years.﻿ If your spouse does have BPD, this is not necessarily a life sentence. Therapy may help the condition improve, or it may get better on its own. Finally, people who have borderline personality disorder often have much more intense symptoms when their are in turmoil.﻿ It is possible that working to build a more stable relationship will help your wife experience more . Of course, you need to think about whether you are willing to do this. Only you can make this decision, but I'd consider doing it with the help of a therapist of your own, if possible.

Akeem Marsh, MD, is a board-certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist who has dedicated his career to working with medically underserved communities. Personality disorders include 10 diagnosable psychiatric conditions that are recognized and described in the fifth and most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Each is a distinct mental illness defined by personality traits that can be troubling enough to create problems with relating to other people in healthy ways, and can lead to significant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. The DSM-5 organizes personality disorders into three groups, or clusters, based on shared key features. These personality disorders are characterized by odd or eccentric behavior. People with cluster A personality disorders tend to experience major disruptions in relationships because their behavior may be perceived as peculiar, suspicious, or detached. , which affects between 2.3% to 4.4% of adults in the U.S. Symptoms include chronic, pervasive distrust of other people; suspicion of being deceived or exploited by others, including friends, family, and partners. , which is characterized by social isolation and indifference toward other people. It affects slightly more men than women. People with this disorder often are described as cold or withdrawn, rarely have close relationships with other people, and may be preoccupied with introspection and fantasy. , which features odd speech, behavior, and appearance, as well as strange beliefs and difficulty forming relationships. The cluster B personality disorders are characterized by dramatic or erratic behavior. People who have a personality disorder from this cluster tend to either experience very intense emotions or engage in extremely impulsive, theatrical, promiscuous, or law-breaking behaviors. , which tends to show up in childhood, unlike most other personality disorders (most don't become apparent until adolescence or young adulthood). Symptoms include a disregard for rules and social norms and a lack of remorse for other people. , which is characterized by instability in interpersonal relationships, emotions, self-image, and impulsive behaviors. , which features excessive emotionality and attention seeking that often leads to socially inappropriate behavior in order to get attention. , which is associated with self-centeredness, exaggerated self-image, and lack of empathy for others and is often driven by an underlying fragility in the sense of self. Understanding Cluster B Personality Disorders in the DSM-5 Cluster C personality disorders are characterized by anxiety. People with personality disorders in this cluster tend to experience pervasive anxiety and/or fearfulness. is a pattern of social inhibition and avoidance fueled by fears of inadequacy and criticism by others. , which involves fear of being alone and often causes those who have the disorder to do things to try to get other people to take care of them. , which is characterized by a preoccupation with orderliness, perfection, and control of relationships. Though similarly named, it is not the same as . Personality disorders tend to appear in adolescence or early adulthood, continue over many years, and can cause a great deal of distress. They can potentially cause enormous conflict with other people, impacting relationships, social situations, and life goals. People with personality disorders often don't recognize that they have problems and are often confusing and frustrating to people around them (including clinicians). Certain symptoms of personality disorders can fall into two categories: self-identity and interpersonal functioning.﻿ Difficulty knowing boundaries between themselves and others Inconsistent, detached, overemotional, abusive, or irresponsible styles of relating According to the DMS-5, a person must meet the following criteria to be diagnosed with a personality disorder:﻿ Chronic and pervasive patterns of behavior that affect social functioning, work, school, and close relationships Symptoms that affect two or more of the following four areas: thoughts, emotions, interpersonal functioning, impulse control Onset of patterns of behavior that can be traced back to adolescence or early adulthood Patterns of behaviors that cannot be explained by any other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions Before a clinician can diagnose a personality disorder, they must make a  to rule out other disorders or medical conditions that may be causing the symptoms. A differential diagnosis is very important but can be difficult since personality disorders also commonly . A person who meets the criteria for one personality disorder will often also meet criteria for one or more additional personality disorders.﻿ One study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, found that about 85% of people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) also meet diagnostic criteria for at least one other personality or mood disorder. Mixed Personality Disorder Definition, Diagnosis, and Criteria Personality disorders don’t discriminate. Roughly 10% of the general population and up to half of psychiatric patients in clinical settings have a personality disorder.﻿ Although experts are yet to fully understand the causes of personality disorders, they believe that both genetic and environmental factors play a role. Roughly 50% of personality disorders are attributed to genetic factors and family history.﻿ Genetic vulnerabilities may make people more susceptible to these conditions, while experiences and other environmental factors may act as a trigger in the development of a personality disorder. There is also a significant association between a history of childhood trauma as well as verbal abuse. One study found that children who experience verbal abuse were three times more likely to have borderline, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive or paranoid personality disorders in adulthood.﻿ High reactivity in children, including sensitivity to light, noise, texture, and other stimuli, has also been linked to certain personality disorders.﻿ Compared to mood disorders such as clinical depression and bipolar disorder, there have historically been relatively few studies on how to effectively treat personality disorders. Many experts believe that personality disorders are difficult to treat because they are, by definition, long-standing patterns of personality. However, there are an increasing number of evidence-based treatments that are being found effective for personality disorders.

Personality disorders can be confusing since many have similar or even overlapping characteristics. In order to better differentiate one from the next, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) grouped the various disorders into three clusters, each of which is characterized by a shared and distinctive personality feature. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 9.1 percent of Americans over 18 have at least one personality disorder.﻿ Your personality is defined by how you think, behave, and feel. A personality disorder is not simply about thinking, feeling, or behaving differently than would be expected. It is a persistent deviation from cultural expectations that causes distress and makes it difficult to function.﻿ At its heart, a personality disorder characterized by an unhealthy and rigid pattern of behavior that interferes with the ability to perceive or relate to situations or people, enjoy life, maintain meaningful relationships, and do well at school or work. There are 10 specific types of personality disorders, which DSM-5 breaks into three clusters. Cluster A is defined as odd or eccentric behavior which has been estimated to affect 7.2% of adults in Western nations; cluster C personality disorders consist of fearful and anxious behaviors, affecting 6.7% of adults; cluster B personality disorders are characterized by dramatic, overly emotional, or unpredictable thinking or behaviors and reportedly affect 5.5% of adults.﻿ Cluster B personality disorders include antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and histrionic personality disorder. These tend to be the least common disorders but are often the most challenging to treat. As with any other number of personality and , conditions can overlap and coexist, requiring different approaches to treatment and care. The DSM-5 defines  as a pervasive pattern of disregard for the rights of others that begins in childhood and continues into adulthood. People with antisocial personality disorder have been described as lacking (the ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes in order to understand their feelings). They often act irresponsibly, lie, steal, or repeatedly break the law. is characterized by , aggression, recklessness, a disregard for the safety of yourself or others, and a lack of remorse for any harms done.﻿ (BPD) is associated with specific problems with , self-image, emotions, behaviors, and thinking. People with BPD tend to have unstable and  and are prone to frequent arguments and breakups. They are characteristically afraid of being abandoned and will have a strongly negative image of themselves. People with BPD will often say that they feel as if they're on an , shifting from elation to depression within a matter of minutes.﻿ Another hallmark of BPD is a tendency to engage in risky behaviors, such as going on shopping sprees, abusing alcohol or drugs, engaging in promiscuous sex, , or self-harm (such as cutting yourself or attempting suicide). If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the at for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our . The key features of , according to the DSM-5, include an inflated sense of self-importance, lack of empathy and attention-seeking behavior.﻿ People with this disorder often believe themselves to be exceptional and entitled to special treatment. They will demand excessive attention, take advantage of others, and have an inability to either perceive or demonstrate empathy. People with a narcissistic personality disorder will also exaggerate their achievements and fantasize about being powerful, attractive, and successful. While they will have no interest in others' feelings and needs, they will often have unreasonable expectations of what others should do for them. Jealousy of others is common, as is the belief that they are actively envied by others. The most telling characteristic of is a rapid shift between dramatic expressions of emotion and excessive attention-seeking behavior.﻿ People with this disorder don't like it when someone else is getting more attention and will engage in dramatic, seductive, or sexually provocative behavior and/or use physical appearance to regain the limelight. People with a histrionic personality disorder may believe that personal relationships are stronger than they really are, use dramatic statements to express opinions, and be easily influenced by others. They also tend to overly concerned about their physical appearance. Your personality—the way you think, feel, and behave—largely forms during childhood. Your temperament, environment, and personal experiences all work together to shape your personality. The exact causes of personality disorders remain unclear but are believed to be genetically influenced, suggesting that our temperament may be inherited to some degree. According to research from the University of Louisville School of Medicine, certain brain abnormalities are common in people with Cluster B personality disorders, suggesting that they may be inherently predisposed to mental health disorders from birth.﻿ Childhood trauma, abuse, chaos, instability, or a family history of personality disorders are also seen to be contributing factors, Avoid the temptation to try to diagnose yourself or a loved one for a personality disorder. Only a trained mental health professional can accurately make a diagnosis based on a review and characterization of symptoms. If you think you or a loved one has a personality disorder, talk to your doctor. Diagnosis includes a physical exam, psychiatric evaluation, and meeting specific criteria outlined in the DSM-5. Treatment can go a long way to helping you attain a better quality of life. The two most common treatments are psychotherapy and medication. If your situation requires it, you may need to be hospitalized or referred to a residential treatment program. We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. Usually, the best treatment for personality disorders is psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy or counseling.

If you have problems with anxiety or insomnia, these medications may help decrease the symptoms. However, they can also lead to increased impulsiveness in some.

It's true that if you have BPD, your kids are at greater risk of having the condition themselves. But, there is also a good chance that they will not have it. And, there are things you can do to reduce their risk. There is research showing that borderline personality disorder runs in families.﻿ This is likely due to a number of factors. First, some part of ; if these are your biological kids and they have inherited a certain combination of genes from you, they may be more at risk to develop BPD. Second, the types of environments that can put children at risk of developing BPD also run in families. For example, someone who is maltreated as a child is at greater risk to develop BPD. That person is also at greater risk of having difficulty parenting. It is hard to be an effective parent when you are struggling with BPD symptoms, and it does not help if you did not have good parenting models yourself. There is nothing you can do about genetics. But if your kids live with you, there is a great deal you can do about environmental factors.

Unfortunately, frequently co-occurs with other conditions that impact mental health. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one condition that is common among people with BPD. ﻿ There is a remarkable overlap between substance abuse disorders and borderline personality disorder. One recent study found that about 78% of adults who have been diagnosed with BPD will also have a co-occurring substance use disorder at some time in their lives, meaning the symptoms and course of BPD and the substance use disorder occur at the same time.﻿ Another recent study showed that about 63% of  participating in the study also had . Studies have also shown that alcohol use disorders are 3.35 times more likely to be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. It's clear the two often go hand in hand. The most common substance use disorder among people with BPD is alcoholism, followed by cocaine and opiates. ﻿ Unfortunately, there is also evidence that people with both BPD and AUD have more difficulties in their lives and are less responsive to treatment than people who have only one of the disorders. For example, people with AUD and BPD are less likely to stay in substance abuse treatment, have more distress and , and are more likely to engage in other addictive behaviors, such as or gambling, than those with AUD who do not also have BPD.﻿ If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the at for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. However, treatment can be very effective for those who stick with it. Most likely, several factors account for the high rate of co-occurrence of alcohol use disorder and borderline personality disorder. First, BPD and AUD may share common genetic pathways. That is, some of the genes that put people at higher risk for BPD may also create a higher risk for AUD. Secondly, there may be common environmental causes for AUD in BPD. For example, experiences of maltreatment in childhood, such as physical or sexual abuse, or emotional abuse or neglect, have been linked to both BPD and AUD.﻿ Another potential reason for the link is because individuals with BPD may use alcohol to decrease the that are a hallmark of BPD. Because people with BPD have strong emotions frequently, use of alcohol to self-medicate may lead to abuse or dependence. Another recent study referenced above mentions another possible explanation for the co-occurrence of BPD and alcohol use disorder, as well as opiate and cocaine abuse, all three of which are most closely linked with BPD.﻿ Evidently, alcohol, opiates and cocaine all stimulate the endogenous opioid system (EOS), whose function is to relieve pain and act in reward and reinforcement behaviors. BPD symptoms have been connected to the EOS not functioning well, so the link may be that people with BPD are more likely to abuse these three substances since they activate the EOS. If you or someone you care about is struggling with AUD and BPD, you need to get help. These two conditions are not easily tackled alone.

Many different kinds of close relationships are affected by (BPD), but perhaps none more than being married to a person with BPD. More specifically, marriages in which either one or both partners have BPD can be very tumultuous, conflict-laden, and dysfunctional. Learn more about how your marriage may be affected by BPD, and how you and your partner (surprisingly) may not be destined for divorce as you likely might have thought. Studies of marital status in people with BPD have found that about 60% are married (these studies were done in people with average ages around 40 years old).﻿ This suggests that people with BPD are less likely to be married than those in the general population—in the United States, about 85% of people are married by age 40.﻿ Unexpectedly, people with BPD do not have higher divorce rates than the general population. By an average age of about 40, the divorce rate for people with BPD is around 35%, and this is comparable to the divorce rate for the average U.S. citizen. However, people with BPD are far less likely to remarry after a divorce. In fact, only about 10% of people with BPD get remarried by around age 40 which is nearly half the national rate of remarriage. On an interesting note, research suggests that people with borderline personality disorder who develop a substantial reduction in their symptoms (defined as ) are more likely than non-recovered people with BPD to marry and become a parent and less likely to divorce or lose custody of a child.﻿ One way to judge whether being married to a person with BPD can be successful is by the divorce rate. Using this as a measure of “success,” it appears that marriages that consist of a partner with BPD are no more or less successful than the average marriage. However, this does not take into account the or the satisfaction of the partners. Unfortunately, there is limited hard research data on the quality of marriages in which one person has BPD. Of the research done, one study found a positive link between the severity of and marital distress, perpetration of marital violence, and marital disruption. This means that the more severe a person's BPD symptoms are (for example, fear of abandonment or intense and frequent mood changes) the more likely their marriage will be chaotic and unstable.﻿ Another study found that BPD symptoms were linked to poor problem-solving and communication skills in a marriage.﻿  There is more scientific data on which offers some potential insight. Research has shown that BPD symptoms are associated with greater chronic stress, more frequent conflicts, and less partner satisfaction in romantic relationships. Furthermore, some experts believe the quality depends a great deal on the personality of the non-BPD partner. Interestingly, there is research suggesting that people with BPD symptoms tend to marry partners who also report BPD symptoms—a phenomenon called assortative mating.﻿ This phenomenon brings about concerns. It seems like it would be even more difficult to manage a relationship effectively and happily when not one, but both partners, have intense mood shifts, engage in impulsive behaviors, and possess an unhealthy —all symptoms of having BPD. The take-home message here is that even though divorce rates are not as high as one might expect in marriages where one person has BPD, being in a relationship with someone with BPD can still be particularly stressful and challenging. This is why in addition to the BPD partner getting treatment, it's a good idea to seek out  or  to keep the marriage, relationship and family functioning intact.

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. The diagnostic system that was typically used to diagnose borderline personality disorder (BPD) and other personality disorders . BPD and other personality disorders were diagnosed as Axis II disorders in the last Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV). These axes are no longer used in the current edition of the DSM. Diagnosis of BPD in DSM-IV as an Axis II Disorder (BPD) and other  are typically diagnosed using the official guidebook for the diagnosis of , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (currently in its fifth edition, the DSM-5). The last DSM, DSM-IV-TR, used a system. This means that when a diagnosis was made, attention was paid to five different areas, or axes, that could affect the individual who was being diagnosed. was for the diagnosis of clinical disorders, the conditions that people most often think of when they think of psychiatric disorders. For example, major depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder would have been diagnosed on Axis I.﻿ Axis II was reserved for long-standing conditions of clinical significance, like personality disorders and mental retardation. These disorders typically last for years, are present before adulthood, and have a significant impact on functioning.﻿ The Rationale for Putting Personality Disorders on Axis II In theory, personality disorders were relegated to Axis II because this was a way to make sure that they did not get overlooked. If a person had multiple clinical disorders on Axis I, coding the personality disorders on Axis II helped make the contribution of the personality disorder stand out. Another reason that experts decided to put personality disorders on Axis II in DSM-IV relates to the course of these disorders. Whereas the Axis I disorders tend to be episodic, meaning they are are thought of as chronic, meaning they occur over years.﻿ DSM-5 did away with the axis system, relegating everything to one axis to ostensibly make diagnosing easier, as well as removing what was thought to be an artificial distinction among conditions. However, diagnosing, assessing, and treating personality disorders are basically the same as in DSM-IV, including the symptoms that need to be present in order to diagnose BPD.﻿ The hallmark BPD is a pervasive pattern instability in relationships, self-image, and moods.. To be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, you must have at least five of the following symptoms: Anger problems, including difficulty controlling anger, intense anger that may not fit the situation and/or angry outbursts A distorted and insecure concept of yourself that affects everything in your life, from relationships to goals to moods and opinions. An irrational fear of being abandoned that causes powerful emotions and going to extremes to make sure you aren't abandoned.﻿ A pattern of turbulent and unstable relationships with friends and family. Impulsive choices and behaviors that may result in risky behavior, such as gambling, shopping sprees, or engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners. Paranoid thoughts or dissociative feelings, as if you are not a part of your own life or you're out of your body, that can emerge under stress.  Powerful, changeable emotions and moods that may last from a few hours to a few days. Suicidal and/or self-harming behavior, like cutting.

Personality disorders are characterized by a skewed perception of the world and problematic relations with others and self. “Personality disorder” is not a diagnosis in and of itself but simply a category that several fall under. Those with personality disorders tend to have an inflexible and ineffective reaction to the world and have difficulty adjusting to everyday changes or demands. People with personality disorders believe their behavior is appropriate, view the world in a one-dimensional fashion and find social participation difficult or impossible. Personality disorders are diagnosed through close observation by a trained . Personality disorders are identified by a maladaptive pattern towards dealing with life that is deep-rooted and has led to excessive stress or sub-par functioning. This is evident through the patient’s thoughts, feelings and behavior. Personality disorders usually become evident during adolescence and persist as an adult usually becoming less noticeable throughout middle age. It is common for someone who is diagnosed with a personality disorder to exhibit traits of at least one other personality disorder. Some of the particular symptoms of personality disorders as a whole are: Many attribute personality disorders to a traumatic childhood experience. Others believe personality disorders occur because of a genetic predisposition. Most consider it to be a combination of both of these factors; both genes and childhood events lead to the formation of a personality disorder. Some factors which may heighten the risk for developing a personality disorder include: A family history of personality disorders or mental illness in general Loss of parents during childhood either through death or traumatic divorce Some co-occurring disorders or difficulties that coincide with personality disorders are: Personality disorders are split up into three sub-categories or “clusters”. Cluster A consists of personality disorders that involve bizarre or eccentric behavior. Schizoid Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Schizotypal Personality Disorder are the mental conditions that are contained in this cluster. Those with are introverted, favor isolation, and are unsociable. They tend to be preoccupied by their own thoughts and feelings and dread intimacy. Those that suffer from this disorder spend much time deep in thought and have trouble taking action. Individuals with perceive others actions as belittling or aggressive. They tend to have extreme difficulty trusting or forgiving others. People with this disorder often erupt with anger and rationalize their behavior with the belief that others are fake or disloyal. Paranoid Personalities often live ultra-private lives, experience jealousy and may give the impression of being emotionally distant or extremely solemn. [ADUNIT]People who have tend to have strange or eccentric habits of behavior and dressing. They have a far-fetched and bizarre thought process and experience paranoid delusions. Those diagnosed with this disorder have difficulty obtaining closeness with others and feel severe anxiety when confronted with a social situation. They may not react at all during a conversation or they may talk to themselves or respond inappropriately. “Magical thinking” is a characteristic that is attributed to this disorder and this involves beliefs such as being able to prophesize the future or read minds. Personality disorders that fall under Cluster B are characterized by intense emotional or erratic behavior. Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Histrionic Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder are the specific diagnoses that are described within this cluster. Those with act outside the typical social norms. They tend to be impulsive, reckless, and appear to have a blunted affect. Many experience trouble with the law, engage in chaotic behavior, and have hostile or even violent relationships. They are highly insensitive to others feelings and are shameless with all their actions. Antisocial Personalities are vulnerable to addiction because of drugs ability to temporarily relieve tension. is characterized by instability in relationships, behavior, mood, and self-image. Turbulent interpersonal relationships, extreme mood swings, transitory self-image, and self-destructive behavior are all symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Those suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder experience a problematic sense of self and view the world in a black and white fashion by either idolizing or demonizing others, ignoring a middle ground. Borderline personalities build an intense liking for someone which turns to hatred over a relatively insignificant occurrence interpreted as being disrespectful. They tend to become very codependent of others on account of a deep seeded fear of abandonment. Suicidal behavior or ideation may be employed by those with Borderline to gain attention or control others. Impulsivity, consistently feeling bored or empty, and episodes of extreme anger are also characteristics of this disorder. Borderline tends to occur more in females than males. consists of one being overemotional and compulsively seeking attention. They are at a near constant need for approval and are overly flirtatious. They may be capable of successfully functioning socially and vocationally. Histrionics tend to have above average social skills but use these abilities for manipulation. They may initiate relationships only to abruptly end them when it becomes too attached. It is somewhat similar to Borderline in that they swing between idealizing and devaluing their relationship partner. Histrionic tend to enjoy excitement and become bored easily which may lead to job loss or putting themselves in dangerous situations. Individuals with have a grandiose image of their own importance, seek attention excessively, and are consumed by delusions of infinite success. They are over-sensitive to failure or judgment and may suffer from hypochondria. Their self-image may fluctuate rapidly between a superiority complex and insecurity. In addition, Narcissists may take advantage of their interpersonal relationships. Anxious and fearful personality disorders are listed in Cluster C. These include Avoidant Personality Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder. Those with may be extremely sensitive to criticism or rejection and avoid involvement with others unless acceptance is guaranteed. Social anxiety and bashfulness are experienced by Avoidant Personalities which leads to an avoidance of occupations that require social contact. They carry great fear of saying the wrong thing, are nervous that they will blush or cry, and are hyper-vigilant and dramatically effected by perceived disapproval from others. is characterized by submissive and dependent behavior, relying on others for decision making. They require constant validation and are hyper-sensitive to rejection. They might have nervous breakdowns following a commencement of a relationship. Dependents lack the confidence necessary for independence and necessitate assistance even in relatively menial tasks. is not one in the same with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, which is an anxiety disorder. Obsessive-Compulsive Personalities aspire to be perfect. They tend to take on many responsibilities; however, they are never happy with their current achievements. Obsessive-Compulsives are reliable, organized, and precise; however, this rigidness causes them to have trouble adjusting to life’s changes. They are overly cautious, intently calculating the risks and rewards of every decision, which makes completing tasks challenging. When Obsessive-Compulsive Personalities cannot control the outcome of circumstances, they may experience loneliness or helplessness. When symptoms of these disorders occur for a prolonged period of time and interfere with day to day functioning, an assessment from a licensed mental health professional is recommended. Therapeutic options available for those with personality disorders are psychotherapy and medication. Psychotherapy may be carried out on an individual basis, in groups, or with the family. This option’s goal is to assist the patient in recognizing the unconscious struggles that are feeding or producing the particular disorder. It also attempts to give the patient flexibility and to moderate the patterns that hinder a well-adjusted lifestyle. Psychotherapy for those with personality disorders can give the patient a better sense of how his or hers conduct affects others. It can also help with the decision making process and improve the patient’s interpersonal relationships. Medications that have been applied successfully for the treatment of personality disorders include antidepressants, mood-stabilizers, anxiolytics, and anti-psychotics. may be helpful for depression, anger, impulsivity, irritability or hopelessness. Mood stabilizers can assist in the prevention of mood swings, provide impulse control, and lower aggressiveness. Anxiolytics reduce anxiety or hostility and treat insomnia. These should be used under close medical supervision because of their tendency to increase impulsivity. Anti-psychotics also known as neuroleptics may give the patient a better grasp of reality for those suffering from psychotic symptoms and in some cases they may reduce anxiety or manage anger. For severe cases of personality disorders, hospitalization may be required. This is typically necessary when one is incapacitated or is a threat to themself or others. Hospitalization may consist of around the clock inpatient care or which provides a secure living space.

These are grouped into three categories. Each personality disorder has its own set of diagnostic criteria. To get a specific diagnosis you must meet some of these criteria. The minimum amount you need to meet is different for different types, but it should always be more than one or two. If you meet criteria for more than one type this may be called .  It is also possible to get a diagnosis without meeting the full criteria for a specific type. This is known aspersonality disorder not otherwise specified (PD-NOS) orpersonality disorder trait specified. A wide range of people may get the same diagnosis, despite having very different personalities and different individual experiences. Your experience of living with a personality disorder will be unique to you. Our understanding of what it means to experience a personality disorder is constantly evolving. It is a. People have different views about these terms, and not everyone agrees with using them. The important thing to remember is that the feelings and behaviours associated with personality disorders are very difficult to live with. However you understand your diagnosis, and whatever terms you prefer to use, you deserve understanding and support. The thoughts, feelings and experiences associated with paranoia may cause you to: find it hard to confide in people, even your friends and family find it very difficult to trust other people, believing they will use you or take advantage of you read threats and danger (which others don't see) into everyday situations, innocent remarks or casual looks from others. This might become such a big problem in your life that you are given a diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder. See our page onfor more information.

However, as a result of the thoughts and feelings associated with this diagnosis you may: find difficulty forming close relationships with other people choose to live your life without interference from others have difficulty relating to or are emotionally cold towards others. Everyone has their own eccentricities or awkward behaviours. But if your patterns of thinking and behaving make relating to others very difficult, you may receive a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder. Unlike in, you usually would not experience. However, you may: find making close relationships extremely difficult think and express yourself in ways that others find 'odd', using unusual words or phrases, making relating to others difficult believe that you can read minds or that you have special powers such as a 'sixth sense' feeland tense with others who do not share these beliefs feel very anxious andin social situations, finding it hard to relate to others. See our pages onorfor more information on the feelings and symptoms associated with schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders. ""I always feel rather 'thrown' when someone doesn't do what I expect them to do. Knowing there are lots of ways in which the problem could be approached would have made me feel a lot more prepared for what came next."" It is natural to sometimes put our own needs, pleasure or personal gain before those of others around us. However, if these actions occur very frequently and you struggle to keep stability in your life, or you regularly act impulsively out of anger or lack of consideration for others, this could lead to a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. put yourself in dangerous or risky situations, often without thinking about the consequences for yourself or other people behave dangerously and sometimes illegally (you may have a criminal record) feel very easily bored and act on impulse – for example, you may find it difficult to hold down a job for long do things even though they may hurt people – to get what you want, putting your needs and desires above other people's have problems with empathy – for example, you may not feel or show any sense of guilt if you have mistreated others have had a diagnosis of conduct disorder before the age of 15. This diagnosis includes 'psychopathy' and 'sociopathy'. These terms are no longer used in thebut a 'psychopathy checklist' questionnaire may be used in your assessment. ""As a child anger seemed to be my only way to express how I felt."" Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD). We can all experience difficulties with our relationships, self-image and emotions. But you might get a diagnosis of BPD/EUPD if these feel consistently unstable or intense and cause you significant problems in daily life. feel very worried about people abandoning you, and either do anything to stop that happening or push them away have very intense emotions that can change quickly (for example, from feeling very happy and confident in the morning to feeling low and sad in the afternoon) not have a strong sense of who you are or what you want from life, with your ideas about this changing significantly depending on who you're with find it very hard to make and keep stable relationships or friendships act impulsively and do things that could harm you (such as binge eating, using drugs or driving dangerously) get very angry, and experience other mental health problems alongside BPD, including,,and. have,such as seeing or hearing things that other people don't feel numb or 'checked out' and not remember things very well after they've happened (known as). BPD is currently the most commonly diagnosed personality disorder. You can read more about it on our pages on. ""BPD is like having no emotional buffer. I can go from nothing to suddenly extremely overwhelming emotions and I struggle with expressing them healthily."" Most people enjoy being given compliments or positive feedback about their actions. But if you depend very heavily on being noticed, or are seeking approval so much that this affects your day-to-day living, you might get a diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder. feel very uncomfortable if you are not the centre of attention constantly seek, or feel dependent on, the approval of others flirt or behave/dress provocatively to ensure that you remain the centre of attention get a reputation for being dramatic and overemotional ""After being told my diagnosis I was then able to understand how and why I behaved the way I did: my life made a little bit more sense."" It is human nature to be aware of our own needs, to express them, and to want others to be aware of our abilities and achievements. These are not bad traits. However, if these thoughts, feelings and behaviours are very extreme and cause problems in relating to others, you may get a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. believe that there are special reasons that make you different, better or more deserving than others have fragile self-esteem, so that you rely on others to recognise your worth and your needs feel upset if others ignore you and don't give you what you feel you deserve put your own needs above other people's, and demand they do too be seen as selfish and dismissive or unaware of other people's needs.

See our pages onfor more information on how to cope with anxiety. It is natural to need other people to care for us or give us reassurance sometimes. A healthy balance involves being able to both depend on others as well as being independent from others sometimes. However, if feelings and thoughts about needing others become so overwhelming that they impact your daily life and relationships, you may get a diagnosis of dependent personality disorder. feel needy, 'weak' and unable to make decisions or function day-to-day without help or support from others allow or require others to assume responsibility for many areas of your life agree to things you feel are wrong or you dislike to avoid being alone or losing someone's support see other people as being much more capable than you are.

Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Histrionic personality disorder is a mental condition characterized by a pattern of extreme emotionality and attention-seeking behavior that begins by early adulthood and is obvious in different situations.﻿ HPD is one of 10 personality disorders recognized in the DSM-5. It is classified as one of the Cluster B disorders, which are characterized as dramatic, overly emotional, and/or erratic. The word  means “dramatic or theatrical."" Roughly 9% of the general population in the U.S. has at least one personality disorder, and histrionic personality disorder affects approximately 2% to 3% of the general population. The disorder is characterized by shallow emotions, attention-seeking, and manipulative behavior.﻿ In some cases, you may not realize that you have histrionic personality disorder because your way of thinking and behaving seems natural to you. And you may blame others for the challenges you face. People with histrionic personality disorder may:﻿ Display exaggerated symptoms of weakness or illness and may use threats of suicide to manipulate others Display excessive but shallow emotions and attention-seeking behaviors (i.e., they are constantly “performing” in order to gain attention) Experience fleeting moods, opinions, and beliefs; they are also very suggestible and quick to respond to fads Need others to witness their emotional displays in order to gain validation or attention Use sexually provocative behaviors to control others or gain attention Since HPD can have symptoms similar to other psychiatric disorders and medical illnesses, your doctor will likely first make a to rule out other disorders or medical conditions that may be causing the symptoms. According to the DSM-5, a person must have five or more of the following signs or symptoms to be diagnosed with HPD: Discomfort in situations in which you're not the center of attention Interaction with others that's often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior Rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotion Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self Style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail Shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion Is easily influenced by others or by circumstances Considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are There is a great deal of overlap between the features of histrionic personality disorder (HPD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD), so much so that some experts believe that HPD may not actually be distinguishable from BPD.﻿ According to DSM-5, ""although borderline can also be characterized by attention-seeking, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions, it is distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and chronic feelings of deep emptiness and identity disturbance"". Share the features of rapidly shifting and reactive emotions Are characterized by a very strong expression of emotion﻿ Some clinicians argue that the qualities of these symptoms are different in HPD versus BPD—specifically that the rapidly shifting emotions in HPD are not experienced with the same depth and intensity as those in BPD. Other experts, however, have argued that HPD and BPD are not necessarily distinct disorders. However, despite predictions that the HPD diagnosis would be dropped in DSM-5, it was not, and so it remains its own specific and unique diagnosis. Although the precise cause of histrionic personality disorder isn't known, it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Your genes may make you vulnerable to developing a personality disorder, and a life situation may trigger the actual development.﻿ : Certain personality traits may be passed on to you by your parents through ; these traits are sometimes called your temperament.﻿ : Your environment involves the surroundings you grew up in, events that occurred, and relationships with family members and others. Other factors linked to an increased risk of developing or triggering personality disorders include:﻿ , particularly inconsistent or over-indulgent boundaries A family history of psychiatric disorders, substance use, or personality disorders Histrionic personality disorder also tends to co-occur with other personality disorders, including:﻿ There are only a few studies that have examined the co-occurrence of HPD and BPD. One often-quoted study found that HPD frequently occurs with BPD.﻿ In another study that used a , about 10% of people with BPD also met criteria for HPD. Histrionic personality disorder is often difficult to treat, partly because people with the condition often seek treatment only when the disorder is causing them major problems or stress. When help is sought, treatment may include psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of the two along with lifestyle changes. can be effective in treating HPD, as it can help reduce emotional distress, improve self-esteem, and enhance the person's coping skills. Supportive psychotherapy is the preferred treatment of choice. This approach focuses on improving self-esteem, reducing emotional distress, and improving coping skills.﻿ and family therapy are generally not recommended since HPD symptoms like seeking attention from group members and exaggerating symptoms may be triggered or worsened in a group atmosphere. We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. While there are no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of histrionic personality disorder, medications may be used to treat affective dysregulation, or the mood swings, anger, tearfulness, anxiety, and depression that often accompany the disorder. Any associated depression or anxiety disorders could be treated with antidepressants.﻿ Mindfulness techniques, including yoga, tai chi, and biofeedback, may also help people with personality disorders control their inner feelings including impulsivity and emotional reactivity.﻿ People with HPD often go underdiagnosed and undertreated, so perhaps the best way to improve your symptoms is to first identify them. With appropriate treatment, you can learn to manage symptoms and come up with a self-care plan to improve quality of life, including: Establishing consistent eating and sleeping schedule Enlisting the help of trusted friends and family to keep you on track If a friend or family member has histrionic personality disorder, it is important to encourage that person to seek help. Without professional treatment, it is unlikely that the symptoms and their related impacts on relationships will improve. Do your best to learn about HPD, including symptoms and treatment, so you can better understand and support your loved one.

Akeem Marsh, MD, is a board-certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist who has dedicated his career to working with medically underserved communities. Histrionic personality disorder is a mental condition characterized by a pattern of extreme emotionality and attention-seeking behavior that begins by early adulthood and is obvious in different situations.﻿ HPD is one of 10 personality disorders recognized in the DSM-5. It is classified as one of the Cluster B disorders, which are characterized as dramatic, overly emotional, and/or erratic. The word  means “dramatic or theatrical."" Roughly 9% of the general population in the U.S. has at least one personality disorder, and histrionic personality disorder affects approximately 2% to 3% of the general population. The disorder is characterized by shallow emotions, attention-seeking, and manipulative behavior.﻿ In some cases, you may not realize that you have histrionic personality disorder because your way of thinking and behaving seems natural to you. And you may blame others for the challenges you face. People with histrionic personality disorder may:﻿ Display exaggerated symptoms of weakness or illness and may use threats of suicide to manipulate others Display excessive but shallow emotions and attention-seeking behaviors (i.e., they are constantly “performing” in order to gain attention) Experience fleeting moods, opinions, and beliefs; they are also very suggestible and quick to respond to fads Need others to witness their emotional displays in order to gain validation or attention Use sexually provocative behaviors to control others or gain attention Since HPD can have symptoms similar to other psychiatric disorders and medical illnesses, your doctor will likely first make a to rule out other disorders or medical conditions that may be causing the symptoms. According to the DSM-5, a person must have five or more of the following signs or symptoms to be diagnosed with HPD: Discomfort in situations in which you're not the center of attention Interaction with others that's often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior Rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotion Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self Style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail Shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion Is easily influenced by others or by circumstances Considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are There is a great deal of overlap between the features of histrionic personality disorder (HPD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD), so much so that some experts believe that HPD may not actually be distinguishable from BPD.﻿ According to DSM-5, ""although borderline can also be characterized by attention-seeking, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions, it is distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and chronic feelings of deep emptiness and identity disturbance"". Share the features of rapidly shifting and reactive emotions Are characterized by a very strong expression of emotion﻿ Some clinicians argue that the qualities of these symptoms are different in HPD versus BPD—specifically that the rapidly shifting emotions in HPD are not experienced with the same depth and intensity as those in BPD. Other experts, however, have argued that HPD and BPD are not necessarily distinct disorders. However, despite predictions that the HPD diagnosis would be dropped in DSM-5, it was not, and so it remains its own specific and unique diagnosis. Although the precise cause of histrionic personality disorder isn't known, it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Your genes may make you vulnerable to developing a personality disorder, and a life situation may trigger the actual development.﻿ : Certain personality traits may be passed on to you by your parents through ; these traits are sometimes called your temperament.﻿ : Your environment involves the surroundings you grew up in, events that occurred, and relationships with family members and others. Other factors linked to an increased risk of developing or triggering personality disorders include:﻿ , particularly inconsistent or over-indulgent boundaries A family history of psychiatric disorders, substance use, or personality disorders Histrionic personality disorder also tends to co-occur with other personality disorders, including:﻿ There are only a few studies that have examined the co-occurrence of HPD and BPD. One often-quoted study found that HPD frequently occurs with BPD.﻿ In another study that used a , about 10% of people with BPD also met criteria for HPD. Histrionic personality disorder is often difficult to treat, partly because people with the condition often seek treatment only when the disorder is causing them major problems or stress. When help is sought, treatment may include psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of the two along with lifestyle changes. can be effective in treating HPD, as it can help reduce emotional distress, improve self-esteem, and enhance the person's coping skills. Supportive psychotherapy is the preferred treatment of choice. This approach focuses on improving self-esteem, reducing emotional distress, and improving coping skills.﻿ and family therapy are generally not recommended since HPD symptoms like seeking attention from group members and exaggerating symptoms may be triggered or worsened in a group atmosphere. We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. While there are no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of histrionic personality disorder, medications may be used to treat affective dysregulation, or the mood swings, anger, tearfulness, anxiety, and depression that often accompany the disorder. Any associated depression or anxiety disorders could be treated with antidepressants.﻿ Mindfulness techniques, including yoga, tai chi, and biofeedback, may also help people with personality disorders control their inner feelings including impulsivity and emotional reactivity.﻿ People with HPD often go underdiagnosed and undertreated, so perhaps the best way to improve your symptoms is to first identify them. With appropriate treatment, you can learn to manage symptoms and come up with a self-care plan to improve quality of life, including: Establishing consistent eating and sleeping schedule Enlisting the help of trusted friends and family to keep you on track If a friend or family member has histrionic personality disorder, it is important to encourage that person to seek help. Without professional treatment, it is unlikely that the symptoms and their related impacts on relationships will improve.

Symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) Everyone can show narcissism from time to time — when we feel self-important or don't show empathy, or when we are selfish, aggressive, egotistical or insensitive. In extreme cases, people might have a narcissistic personality type, which means they feel very entitled, but their behaviour is still normal. Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a rare mental illness that affects all areas of life, since symptoms are present during work and at home. It can be hard for others to tolerate the symptoms of NPD, which can mean the sufferer becomes . People with NPD are significantly impaired. They might be looking excessively to others to boost their self-esteem, they can't feel empathy and they have trouble forming deep relationships. The difference between NPD and normal narcissism is that NPD doesn't change over time, and isn't caused by a medical condition or drugs. You don't grow out of it, and it can cause significant distress. People with NPD have a very exaggerate sense of their own importance. Key symptoms include: superiority, specifically towards people perceived as ‘lower’ in status great pride in the accomplishments of children or family expecting constant praise and recognition for achievements They have trouble handling criticism and can feel hurt easily. They may not be able to admit they have done anything wrong, and can get very angry if their orders or directions are not followed by others. lacking empathy, especially for perceived weaknesses envy for those perceived as being of a higher status distant, practical manner in regards to personal relationships can ‘write off’ friends permanently over small or imagined issues People with NPD are at increased risk of using and withdrawing socially. They may have feelings of deep insecurity beneath an arrogant exterior. With , it is possible for people to learn to change their behaviours and have more positive relationships.

Project Air Strategy Model of Stepped Care in Personality Disorder  This video describes a model of stepped care for personality disorder developed by the Project Air Strategy. Mental health clinicians discuss their experiences with implementing the stepped care model, the relationship between brief and longer term treatment, and how the model can benefits clients.  Welcome to this brief intervention program. It really is an opportunity to discuss our experience of staged care in the treatment of personality disorders. When clients come in in crisis they often see acute care and then many clients just need some psychological assistance to get back up on their feet, to reinforce some of the skills that they have, to give them some protective strategies to prevent them from coming back into crisis again and really, to help them integrate back into the community. So that's where the brief intervention program that we've developed is discussed today.  Here we have clinicians describing their experience of setting up this staged care, the brief intervention model, how it relates to the acute care services, and how it relates to the longer-term treatments.  Question: What is the role of the brief intervention clinic?  : The brief intervention is beautiful for changing, I guess, risk management into a therapy approach. So as a brief intervention offering three or four sessions that focus on practical skills that the person can actually use for the situation that they're in, and drawing together, I guess, in the presence of a caring other, their existing resources, assisting  families as well to have some information and provide support for their family member.  Question: Why are clients given a “Gold Card” and how do they get help?  : People could present in some kind of crisis they were literally given a gold card. We went with that. We kept up a roster and you were on the roster - you didn't have to be a crisis team worker. In fact, brief therapists came from the other community teams. Basically you're on a roster. So for me personally, I think I was on twice a month, the Monday and a Thursday twice a month, and I just went to the counter at that time and saw somebody showed up looking confused and carrying a gold , and if they did I registered them we got going. So it was very simple, which is one of the beauties of this service. It's such a simple and robust process - you present in crisis, somebody gives you some encouragement, gets you through. It gives you this thing, if you can find your courage and show up there's somebody just smiles it and gets working. It's probably a lot more simple for getting help and support for people than in a lot of other processes.  : I like the brief intervention because it offers an immediate treatment source for people presenting in crisis. And quite often in the public mental health system, understandably, we've got wait lists, and you know we don't always have available resources, so things can be one week, two weeks, four weeks wait, whereas with the gold card clinic we have two standing appointments all the time. So we have one on a Monday at 11:00 and one on a Thursday at 11:00, so we can immediately offer an appointment to someone without having to check, or to wait until the weekend is over. So I really find that helpful.  Question: Is it an easy model for clinicians to learn? I also find it helpful because it's manualized as well too, so you know once you've done the gold card clinic a couple of times you don't really have to prepare as much as well - so you've just kind of got a formula in your head. You go in you do the survey, you talk about the crisis, and you're working on the care plan. So in a way it's quite easy. As a clinician as well - you can walk into it without a lot of preparation, once you've done it a couple of times.  Well I think you need a coordinator. You certainly need a consultant and otherwise clinicians, and that's pretty much it. And our consultant really is available for those fortnightly consult meetings and also I guess if there's something that I feel like I cannot answer I need to have that extra support as well. So I would say coordinators, consultants and clinicians.    : The coordinator is not just somebody who keeps the stats - they do have to think a little bit strategically. They've got to think a little bit about the motivation of the people that are coming along. Again, it's context dependent whether you'd have a team leader do it or it's just somebody's job, or whatever, but whoever does it has got to have some sense of feel for people, and for how people progress, and for the fact that people, have what is that the ‘clinician fraud syndrome’, and all that kind of thing, and they need encouragement.  : There are lots of strengths with the brief intervention. I really like the structured nature of the whole model. It focuses on recent events for the consumers, which is often what they, the consumers want to talk about. They don't want to talk about what's been going on for them years and years ago. They want to focus on what's brought to this crisis. And it also provides a lot of tools and strategies for the consumers to take away. It empowers them to kind of take control of what's going on for them, and provides lots of tips to do so. It also includes the families and carers which is great to see that it's not, even in a brief intervention, that it’s not kind of disregarded.  Some of the things that clients say the most is that they find it helpful because we can immediately offer an appointment, and when people present in crisis they're really wanting something tangible. So people find it very helpful to be given an appointment card, and say, look you know we can see you again in two days. I think they also like that it's very practical as well - and can take away a care plan. And sometimes when people have completed the brief intervention and then they might call the acute care team back a month, or six months, or a year ago, anyone can prompt the person and say “look, do you still have your care plan?” or “we've got a copy of the care plan on file”, and actually go through the strategies - go through the early warning signs - and then they don't feel like they have to start their story all over again. It's very practical base because lots of the time people in crisis will say “look nothing's working. I don't know what to do.” So it's very grounding to have a piece of paper and say “try A, try B, try C”.  Question: How does the brief clinic relate to longer term treatment?  : The gold card clinic can be a referral pathway to longer term treatment as necessary, and so I guess some it really provides both. It's not like we lose the longer-term treatment options, but I think that the gold card clinic is really a better treatment option for those people that research tells us are just going to need three or four sessions in a situational crisis, and actually not require further intervention longer term intervention right at the moment. I think also it actually puts a warm and human face to a first-time user of services. It introduces the idea of a therapeutic approach, and I guess because, built in to the brief intervention is that idea of ongoing referral pathways as needed.  Question: What are some challenges in implementation?  I was sort of concerned at that time about workload primarily and what that with me, myself and the DBT team that existed, and then also around really whether the service would actually help clients that have these personality disorders traits because, I guess these are chronic long-term conditions. So you know what I found though is that in terms of the treatment I think there has been such a gap between, or for those people that are presenting in crisis, and between those people getting treatment -having appropriate treatment. So I think the BLIP program services those clients they feel like they've been you know they've been taken seriously. They listen to about what it was that happened for them, and then be given some skills to get them back on track, and I think the feedback has been really good in that regard. And in terms of our clinician workload, certainly I think you know when people we've got about ten clinicians on our team and everyone you know is asked to put their name down for a week when they're available. So I don't think it has added that much in terms of workload for clinicians. So I guess my fears have been allayed.  Question: How do brief and longer treatments relate to each other?  I've worked in community mental health for a number of years and so I provide longer-term interventions for the people, for clients, and when I first came into the brief intervention it was a cultural shift for me, I guess. It was a little shift for me in terms of my approach and I realized that I don't have a real lot of time here to be working with this person in front of me, but I still want to be hearing them. I want to be present. I'm want to validate. I'll be empathic. I want to have, I want to be able to teach them some skills as well. I don't want to just be responding to a crisis presentation. And so it was like - okay how do we, how do we get what we need to get done in three sessions? Three hour sessions - hourly sessions? And so at first it felt strange but it worked. It worked really well. And what I've found is that my approach in the short-term interventions has actually helped me in my longer-term treatments as well. So I sometimes think, okay, there are some things that I need to get - we need, to get done in this session today - this is in the long term treatment - what do I need to move toward? So brief intervention has influenced the way I work in longer term treatment. Long term treatment has somewhat into influence how I work in the brief intervention and what I mean by that is that that thing on empathy, validation, active listening skills and teaching skills etc. It's all doable. It can happen, whether it's brief or long term.  Question: Does the model benefit clients of a health service?  I think the intervention fills the gap for our service so certainly there's been clients historically that presented to the service with suicidal or self-harm behaviours or in crisis, that we're not seeing or followed up, and so you know at least in this program we offer them a service once they're presenting that they can be seen very quickly. There they can be taken seriously in terms of what what's happened, and can be offered some skills or some things to get them back on track very quickly. And you know, we find the results of doing that very effective. So I think it's nice and it's about our program, because I work on the DBT program as well to, I guess, orient those people that we feel might be appropriate for our longer-term treatment to talk about the diagnosis and orient them to longer term treatment options and then get them assessed for that as well.

And it also provides a lot of tools and strategies for the consumers to take away. It empowers them to kind of take control of what's going on for them, and provides lots of tips to do so. It also includes the families and carers which is great to see that it's not, even in a brief intervention, that it’s not kind of disregarded.  Some of the things that clients say the most is that they find it helpful because we can immediately offer an appointment, and when people present in crisis they're really wanting something tangible. So people find it very helpful to be given an appointment card, and say, look you know we can see you again in two days. I think they also like that it's very practical as well - and can take away a care plan. And sometimes when people have completed the brief intervention and then they might call the acute care team back a month, or six months, or a year ago, anyone can prompt the person and say “look, do you still have your care plan?” or “we've got a copy of the care plan on file”, and actually go through the strategies - go through the early warning signs - and then they don't feel like they have to start their story all over again. It's very practical base because lots of the time people in crisis will say “look nothing's working. I don't know what to do.” So it's very grounding to have a piece of paper and say “try A, try B, try C”.  Question: How does the brief clinic relate to longer term treatment?  : The gold card clinic can be a referral pathway to longer term treatment as necessary, and so I guess some it really provides both. It's not like we lose the longer-term treatment options, but I think that the gold card clinic is really a better treatment option for those people that research tells us are just going to need three or four sessions in a situational crisis, and actually not require further intervention longer term intervention right at the moment. I think also it actually puts a warm and human face to a first-time user of services. It introduces the idea of a therapeutic approach, and I guess because, built in to the brief intervention is that idea of ongoing referral pathways as needed.  Question: What are some challenges in implementation?  I was sort of concerned at that time about workload primarily and what that with me, myself and the DBT team that existed, and then also around really whether the service would actually help clients that have these personality disorders traits because, I guess these are chronic long-term conditions. So you know what I found though is that in terms of the treatment I think there has been such a gap between, or for those people that are presenting in crisis, and between those people getting treatment -having appropriate treatment. So I think the BLIP program services those clients they feel like they've been you know they've been taken seriously. They listen to about what it was that happened for them, and then be given some skills to get them back on track, and I think the feedback has been really good in that regard. And in terms of our clinician workload, certainly I think you know when people we've got about ten clinicians on our team and everyone you know is asked to put their name down for a week when they're available. So I don't think it has added that much in terms of workload for clinicians. So I guess my fears have been allayed.  Question: How do brief and longer treatments relate to each other?  I've worked in community mental health for a number of years and so I provide longer-term interventions for the people, for clients, and when I first came into the brief intervention it was a cultural shift for me, I guess. It was a little shift for me in terms of my approach and I realized that I don't have a real lot of time here to be working with this person in front of me, but I still want to be hearing them. I want to be present. I'm want to validate. I'll be empathic. I want to have, I want to be able to teach them some skills as well. I don't want to just be responding to a crisis presentation. And so it was like - okay how do we, how do we get what we need to get done in three sessions? Three hour sessions - hourly sessions? And so at first it felt strange but it worked. It worked really well. And what I've found is that my approach in the short-term interventions has actually helped me in my longer-term treatments as well. So I sometimes think, okay, there are some things that I need to get - we need, to get done in this session today - this is in the long term treatment - what do I need to move toward? So brief intervention has influenced the way I work in longer term treatment. Long term treatment has somewhat into influence how I work in the brief intervention and what I mean by that is that that thing on empathy, validation, active listening skills and teaching skills etc. It's all doable. It can happen, whether it's brief or long term.  Question: Does the model benefit clients of a health service?  I think the intervention fills the gap for our service so certainly there's been clients historically that presented to the service with suicidal or self-harm behaviours or in crisis, that we're not seeing or followed up, and so you know at least in this program we offer them a service once they're presenting that they can be seen very quickly. There they can be taken seriously in terms of what what's happened, and can be offered some skills or some things to get them back on track very quickly. And you know, we find the results of doing that very effective. So I think it's nice and it's about our program, because I work on the DBT program as well to, I guess, orient those people that we feel might be appropriate for our longer-term treatment to talk about the diagnosis and orient them to longer term treatment options and then get them assessed for that as well. Transference Focused Psychotherapy    Professor Otto Kernberg (New York) talks about transference focussed psychotherapy (TFP) for personality disorder. Question: What is Transference Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) for Personality Disorder? Well,  transference focused psychotherapy is psychoanalytic psychotherapy that utilizes the technical instrument of the psychoneurotic technique, in particular the interpretation transference analysis, technical neutrality, counter transference utilization and attempts to permit the activation in the therapeutic situation of this rate of internalized object relations of these patients - interpreting each of those that become dominant in the action in terms of self-representation and the object representation activated and played-out respectively by patient and therapist, considering that when these internalized object relations are split they rapidly tend towards reversal of roles in terms of patient not only enacting the self-representation projecting the object representation of the therapist, but identifying with the object representation and projecting the self-representation of the therapist.  We try to analyse systematically this internalized object relations that rapidly can be divided into idealized or good ones and the prosecutorial bad ones, and that initially split off from each other. But in each of these idealized and persecutory segments we try to analyse the role reversals that the patient carries out, the objective of which is the gradual developing awareness on the part of the patient that he really harbors identification, both with self and the author of the interaction, which makes it less frightening in the case of the persecutory relationships and makes it less of an unrealistic idealization with the idealist one.  Over time, as the patient has a better tolerance of the awareness that he  incorporates, these mutually split-off relationships ,we interpret the defensive function of those splitting operations in order to integrate them - permits a passage if you want to incline a language from paranoid schizoid position to a depressive one, gradually obtaining integration of total object relation the tolerating that the self is both good and bad and other sub both good and bad, leading eventually to an integrated sense of self, and an integrated sense of significant others.  In other words, to normal identity formation which is the strategic objective of the treatment. We want to transform borderline personality organization into normal identity by this method. So strategy consists in permitting the activation of this object relations rather than interpreting them. The techniques are the use of the psycho narrative techniques that have certain differences from the way in which they apply to standards or analysis. And then we have a number of so-called tactical manoeuvres which is dealing with frequent complications -psychotic regressions, severely paramount regressions in the transference, affect storms acting out repetition compulsion, and the complications in the behavioural complications in terms of eating disturbances, and the social behaviour of various degrees and types of depression and anxiety.  The external organization of the treatment is two sessions per week, 45-minutes each, so the frequency is significantly lower than that of psychoanalysis, higher than that of many types of supportive Aubrie and brief psychology psychotherapists, and we try at the beginning of the treatment to create a specific frame that consists of tasks given to the patient - free association -  and a attitude of the therapist’s evenly suspended attention modification to some extent of beyond supplementation to intervene without memory nor desire.  Question: What is Transference Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) for Personality Disorder?

Being in Psychotherapy: Mahlie Jewell’s experience  I was in a very volatile way at that time and my self-harm was out of control. And so I think what helped was that it never phased her, it never scared her, it was not something that she'd not seen before, so she was fine with it. She was very delicate in the way that she dealt with it. Her language was incredibly considered. That was one of the things that I really noticed with her is that she didn't, she didn't use language that other people did. She would actually get really angry when I call myself crazy. I'm invasive with that word, but she just knew, watching, and she's done it for a long time and she had all of that those internal boundaries there. She had boundaries and really clear boundaries and she knew all my tricks, and she doubled them before so you know she would outwardly say to me, you know, “I’ve been trying to test how far I'm going to go and I'm telling you that this is where I'm going to go, and that's not going to change”. And then I started to realize that boundaries are safety actually, and that I really like boundaries even though I didn't think I did. But it was just her experience and just the fact that I never got the feeling that I was too much for her, that I was too complex, you know, she was also very, very strong about continuity of care so she was really aware that she needed to be there and then and so she was able to give me really a firm commitment and say “look, I'm not going to go anywhere for this period of time and she did.  So I think there were a lot of things that made her wonderful, but I think her experience, her continued education, and she had a very good way of learning from the consumers as well, and she would always kind of say that to me and say “you know you're teaching me things here”. And yeah, I think little things like they ask my opinion about things, and you know about their processes, and wanting to get feedback about that, it just made me feel valued. And I think when I felt valued as well then that helped my self-esteem really, and it helped me get better.  It's funny because most people don’t realize the power of that relationship. My first clinician was the third person in my life who ever told me that they were proud of me, and that was massive for me. And so I needed to you know I was kind of for one for one moment I had someone who was proud of me and who was kind of on my side. And so I think there was lots of times when I could have slipped further backwards and I probably didn't do it because I wanted to keep their pride in me.  So that's a massive thing, when you don't have that, and then think, maybe a lot of people who don't realize, what a lot of clinicians maybe, don't realize, the people they're dealing with, probably have never felt that emotion either. They've never had somebody who thinks they're amazing and who thinks that they’re smart and articulate. You know, there's a lot of negativity that's geared towards people with borderline and they can be so powerful by just actually doing some really strength based work with people - so strength’s based is the key!

Recommendations for effective care NSW Health Clinical Nurse Consultant, Joe Russ, talks about his experience nursing borderline personality disorder (BPD) clients who present to the emergency department in crisis, and recommendations for effective care. Joe Russ talks about his experience nursing clients with personality disorder who present to the hospital emergency department in crisis  Question: How do you help a person when they are in crisis?  Firstly we'll identify why they came in, what was the initial trigger that brought them to hospital - brought them to a feeling of despair and distress, and then try to identify solutions; what's worked for them before, how we can identify other things that will make them feel safe, therapies or clinicians or activities they can partake in that's going to make them feel more comfortable with themselves rather than at odds with the world. I found this very successful so try very hard to meet the client's needs, or help them to find their own solutions, and that seems to be very effective also.  We generally have a high discharge rate for borderline personality disorder clients because it's been found admissions don't work, unless it's a critical issue. So identifying the problem, helping them to identify their own solutions, rather than telling them what they should do, is very, very effective.  Question: What else do you recommend in the emergency department?  What I always tell the nurses in ED is to lead with a cup of tea, because I find just that initial giving and showing human compassion is enormously effective in settling the client's, maybe agitated behaviour, or maybe demonstrative demanding behaviour. A cup of tea and a warm blanket or a sandwich makes a huge difference and brings them a feeling a sense of empathy. And they really relate to that really strongly. It's hugely successful, it works 99% of the time and I find even the most volatile situations, I can talk the client down with an offer of a cup of tea and a discussion about it.  Question: What is your advice to clinicians working in hospital emergency when a person with borderline personality disorder presents in crisis?  In terms of my fellow clinicians, and particularly in the emergency department, I think it's really important that they recognize, not just that a borderline personality is a human being, but they are human beings suffering, through no fault of their own, and they can actually have comorbid depression or other mental illnesses, or circumstances that are out of their control. Some of which they can attend, they can address, but some are out of their power or capacity to control at this point in time, and that everybody, everybody goes through periods of time in their lives when they are in crisis. Persons with borderline personalities have more crisis, they have more drama, and they have more demonstrative issues that they can't manage. It's really developing a compassion and awareness that we're all on this same trip. They suffer more than we do, and being aware of that helps people to just lend a little more compassion and empathy.

Professor Anthony Bateman (UK), consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist, talks about psychotherapy for antisocial personality disorder and challenges for therapists. Project Air Strategy talks to Professor Anthony Bateman about Psychotherapy for Antisocial Personality Disorder. Professor Bateman is Consultant Psychiatrist and Psychotherapist.  We developed mentalization based therapies specifically for antisocial personality disorder simply because it was useful in borderline personality disorder, but in effect we have a lot of people who comorbid for both disorders, and in our clinical services actually there was a problem with that overlap. So people who were more antisocial or actually quite distinct from those who are more borderline personality disorders. So we decided to separate them.  Having done that, we of course had to have some view about what the mind states of people with antisocial personality disorder were like - as people actually have a disregard for others. They actually have a disregard for their own safety very often. They're not very interested in other people's views and perspectives, or mental states.  We know that they misuse sort of emotions of other people. Generally they may trigger emotions and then use them or exploit them and so on. All this is described in the literature and we think that those sorts of attitudes, those sorts of behaviours, and those sorts of relational problems that they have, are fundamentally based on their problems in mentalizing. So, in fact, we used that to generate a treatment program for targeting areas of mentalizing problems for people with antisocial personality disorder.  We start the groups with agreements between us all, which we call a code of conduct. You know how we're going to relate here; what's our values as individuals in this group, and what are our values we're going to try to follow in the group? And we have a series of examples with them about what how we might behave and how we might not behave; how we expect each other to behave, and we specify those.  So we can always come back to that if it starts going wrong - that actually we simply don't do this here and so on, and they're quite good respecting their own codes of conduct if they've generated them.  Question: Do people with antisocial personality disorder want to change?  Well that's a great question because when you first see them they have no interest in thinking differently whatsoever. So the first task is always to actually try to engender a process whereby you're solely taking their mind states into account. You're simply exploring their views, their values, their perspective on what's happened to them - what is happening to them, their perspective on their current relationship, however they perceive it, and to take that absolutely seriously on face value and explore, you know, a lot of detail and depth until they have a sense that you see things from their perspective.  You can't do anything else at all. Once you've done that you then subtly or gently move away to actually push them to consider others’ mental states in various ways or well, in fact, others’ emotional states very often, because they're not very good at seeing other people's emotions, or at least responding to them in a feedback system. So, for example, if they see someone else is a little scared, they don't care. When people without antisocial personality disorder see someone they're making is anxious or scared they tend to get a feedback system which alters their behaviour so we spend a lot of time getting them to consider these sort of feedback loops, particularly about others’ emotional states. And we do that now primarily in groups, and the reason for that is of course that peer pressure and that your social personality disorder gangs, for example, actually can function incredibly well.  They're very good at gangs. They organize them. They have a proper hierarchy. They understand each other's roles. They know how someone's going to respond and so on. So we simply set up a gang, in a sense, except is called a therapeutic group. And then we get them to start considering each other - about what they're doing, what they're like, how they see each other and so on.  The low-hanging fruit you see early on is actually their recognition of other people's emotional states. When they start in the group they have no interest in looking at others particularly. Trying to read what their mental state might be from how they're presenting or how they're expressing something and we focus a lot on that early, and actually they begin to realize it's incredibly informative that if you bother to look at people, if you bother to say what's behind that smile, laughing at in a genuine curiosity, they actually begin to work out that this is quite useful actually. And they then of course they may try to misuse it later. You never know. But nevertheless, they're very quick at picking up that actually, you can ask people things, you can check things out, you can understand what people's emotions are a little bit, rather than just seeing them as a threat or something like that.  The vast majority of people with antisocial personality disorder spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to deactivate their attachment systems if possible because attachment creates a lot of trouble.  So once their attachment systems are activated they're in trouble. All sorts of things - dependency of need, desire you sort of mean of other people - and that, of course, is very problematic for them because they're very self-organized. They don't like to need someone else, if you like. They're autonomous in that sense, so mostly they tried to deactivate them.  The problem with antisocial personality disorder individuals is they can't, they don't know very well, because they tend to be disorganized so burst out all the time in different ways. So, in fact, what we do with this is get them first to begin to actually scrutinize and think about the relationship processes – just what are they like, how do they go, what happens. We get them to do that and we give them information about attachment and attachment processes, and then we get them to actually map them, and so on. And we actually give them what we call a relational passport. It is simply a little thing about their own attachment processes really. They discuss that in the group. And of course, in the group they actually are mostly activated so their dismissive processes are activated. Their attempts to deactivate are activated if you see what I mean and we alight on those in the group. One of the other focuses of the group is looking at those as they do them with us, and within, with each other.  The Safe Zone they step into is, to a large extent, they become less reactive to others, so they're less sensitive, they're less likely to make assumptions about other people's malign mental state, they don't assume somebody's against them too quickly, and things like that. So they're much less reactive. Once they're less reactive they're able to maintain the stability of their own mental state so they don't feel so threatened by other people, and they actually get better at reading other people. So they differentiate not everybody's an enemy - some people actually are friends or they've got benign motives and so on, and they feel better about that, generally speaking.    People worry about fearfulness and reactivity for the therapist and sense of feeling controlled or coerced or tricked or lied to, and these sorts of phenomena, which are sincerely an issue. But actually, the ones that cause quite a bit of trouble in terms of therapeutic work, one is that a reaction where the counter responsiveness is actually to start minimizing events we simply listen to these things and gradually you begin to get the sort of sense of well, “he only stabbed him once” and he said “ok, yeh, that’s okay then”.  You know, you sort of get drawn into this idea that certain events, actually they minimize - they say well it's only this”, they say “he only beat him up” and “oh that’s all right then” and you start generating this sort of response where things become minimized, all right. Now that can actually happen in things like your reactions to other things in borderline personality disorder of course, but it's quite common in antisocial personality. They minimize what they do, as if they're perfectly okay.  The second one, which links, is that they use a lot of humour and to be honest they're the best comedians you've ever met. They draw you into this comedic act sort of situation where you lose sight of the fact you're delivering therapy, and you have these sort of great jokes being made about things, often which I've a slight macabre element in them, and things like that, and it's very easy to create a certain humorous sort of action which actually avoids the seriousness of things and it's easy to lose that and you have to watch out for counter responsiveness down those two lines, certainly.

They organize them. They have a proper hierarchy. They understand each other's roles. They know how someone's going to respond and so on. So we simply set up a gang, in a sense, except is called a therapeutic group. And then we get them to start considering each other - about what they're doing, what they're like, how they see each other and so on.  The low-hanging fruit you see early on is actually their recognition of other people's emotional states. When they start in the group they have no interest in looking at others particularly. Trying to read what their mental state might be from how they're presenting or how they're expressing something and we focus a lot on that early, and actually they begin to realize it's incredibly informative that if you bother to look at people, if you bother to say what's behind that smile, laughing at in a genuine curiosity, they actually begin to work out that this is quite useful actually. And they then of course they may try to misuse it later. You never know. But nevertheless, they're very quick at picking up that actually, you can ask people things, you can check things out, you can understand what people's emotions are a little bit, rather than just seeing them as a threat or something like that.  The vast majority of people with antisocial personality disorder spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to deactivate their attachment systems if possible because attachment creates a lot of trouble.  So once their attachment systems are activated they're in trouble. All sorts of things - dependency of need, desire you sort of mean of other people - and that, of course, is very problematic for them because they're very self-organized. They don't like to need someone else, if you like. They're autonomous in that sense, so mostly they tried to deactivate them.  The problem with antisocial personality disorder individuals is they can't, they don't know very well, because they tend to be disorganized so burst out all the time in different ways. So, in fact, what we do with this is get them first to begin to actually scrutinize and think about the relationship processes – just what are they like, how do they go, what happens. We get them to do that and we give them information about attachment and attachment processes, and then we get them to actually map them, and so on. And we actually give them what we call a relational passport. It is simply a little thing about their own attachment processes really. They discuss that in the group. And of course, in the group they actually are mostly activated so their dismissive processes are activated. Their attempts to deactivate are activated if you see what I mean and we alight on those in the group. One of the other focuses of the group is looking at those as they do them with us, and within, with each other.  The Safe Zone they step into is, to a large extent, they become less reactive to others, so they're less sensitive, they're less likely to make assumptions about other people's malign mental state, they don't assume somebody's against them too quickly, and things like that. So they're much less reactive. Once they're less reactive they're able to maintain the stability of their own mental state so they don't feel so threatened by other people, and they actually get better at reading other people. So they differentiate not everybody's an enemy - some people actually are friends or they've got benign motives and so on, and they feel better about that, generally speaking.    People worry about fearfulness and reactivity for the therapist and sense of feeling controlled or coerced or tricked or lied to, and these sorts of phenomena, which are sincerely an issue. But actually, the ones that cause quite a bit of trouble in terms of therapeutic work, one is that a reaction where the counter responsiveness is actually to start minimizing events we simply listen to these things and gradually you begin to get the sort of sense of well, “he only stabbed him once” and he said “ok, yeh, that’s okay then”.  You know, you sort of get drawn into this idea that certain events, actually they minimize - they say well it's only this”, they say “he only beat him up” and “oh that’s all right then” and you start generating this sort of response where things become minimized, all right. Now that can actually happen in things like your reactions to other things in borderline personality disorder of course, but it's quite common in antisocial personality. They minimize what they do, as if they're perfectly okay.  The second one, which links, is that they use a lot of humour and to be honest they're the best comedians you've ever met. They draw you into this comedic act sort of situation where you lose sight of the fact you're delivering therapy, and you have these sort of great jokes being made about things, often which I've a slight macabre element in them, and things like that, and it's very easy to create a certain humorous sort of action which actually avoids the seriousness of things and it's easy to lose that and you have to watch out for counter responsiveness down those two lines, certainly. Project Air Strategy talks to Åse Line Baltzersen on her recovery journey: ‘Recovery from personality disorder is a journey’. A rich and inspiring story from lived experience. Project Air Strategy talks to Åse Line Baltzersen on her recovery journey: ‘Recovery from personality disorder is a journey’. Watch this rich and inspiring story from lived experience.  As I got deep diagnosis when I was about 20 years old, for the first time I realized or I learned more from my clinicians that, it wasn't something wrong with me, which is something I've felt my entire life-  that it was something I was just a failure, something was wrong with me since I couldn't fix myself. But as I got the diagnosis I realized that it's more about that I have certain issues or problems, but they are problems that can get better as I work with them, and with the clinicians, so together we could make things better when we knew where the problems were.  Question: Was there a turning point in your recovery, after reaching “rock bottom”?  Strange thing is that what I thought was rock bottom, it really wasn't, but that moment when I thought I had hit rock bottom I was on my way to do something insanely stupid. But then it hit me like ‘this is not who I am’. And that day I decided that I wanted to survive. I kind of realized that I'd been trying to die my entire life and I hadn't, and the sense was that I really didn't want to die, but I didn't know how to live either. So I kind of made the decision that day that I was going to give it a real shot and give recovery a real shot. And this kind of stayed with me through what essentially became rock bottom, and then later, in recovery, as I got treatment for this. So that decision was crucially important for me just to realize that I was going to fight, because recovery is a fight.  Question: What advice would you give others about the recovery journey?  My first advice would be to give yourself as many shots as possible, because recovering is not a process where you just go up and up and up and up and up. There will be…well I guess I'm not exaggerating when I said for everyone, it will be a battle, where sometimes you move forward, sometimes you can feel as if you're falling straight back to start. But as you slowly progress you will never go back to start. It keeps evolving and you keep learning new strategies and more things about yourself.  So not giving up as you have a relapse of any sort- just kind of, it's a balance between being self-compassionate - that shit happens, let's move forward. At the same time I find kind of not accepting excuses because at times it's hard to differentiate between an excuse and what is just pure, what's called ‘shit happens’. It's the personality disorder, kind of, in the steering wheel, so just give yourself as many shots as possible and learn from everything that you can.  You're not your diagnosis in any way. No matter where you are in the process; either starting the recovery process or maybe just coming to terms with having a personality disorder. It does not in any way define you. It says a little bit about certain areas that someone struggles with to a greater or lesser extent, but it doesn't say anything about anyone as a person or your future hope. When I started out - it's actually 10 years since I started treatment today - I would have never imagined being a CEO of two companies and actually working and getting a higher education. I never thought I was there. I couldn’t even read the newspapers’ headlines at that time. So that diagnosis did not define me but it gave me treatment options, which led me to where I am today. I was not able to do it on my own and I think that's the first step - to accept help or, if necessary, actually fight for that help.

Professor Alan Fruzzetti talks about families, carers & effective treatment Professor Alan Fruzzetti talks about families, carers & effective treatment  Question: How should families respond when a relative is diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder?  When a family member has recently been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder I think family members feel quite scared about what that means. There's a lot of terrifying information on the internet about this, most of which, by the way, is quite inaccurate. So what I tell families is this is actually a very hopeful moment because, to have an accurate assessment, to classify accurately as borderline personality disorder is actually quite hopeful. We have in 2015, for the first time, we have multiple treatments that work, and that wasn't true even 30 years ago. So it's actually good news, as surprising as that might sound.  Question: What is the most important skill for new therapists?  New therapists working with people with borderline personality disorder need a variety of skills to be effective, not least among them would be an open mind to actually bring themselves to the interpersonal situation so that they can enjoy the person - enjoy the human being that they're working with. In addition to understanding and seeing the suffering and the pain that's involved, actually to be able to have both sides of that is very important.  Question: What comments do you have about diagnosis?  Diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is very confusing. It's confusing to patients and their family members and, believe it or not, it's very confusing for therapists. Part of the reason is that there's an ongoing debate within the field of psychiatry and psychology about what borderline personality disorder is. That's confusing. It's a heterogeneous disorder that means that one person with borderline personality disorder can look very different and have a very different set of problems than somebody else with borderline personality disorder. And probably most importantly, the fact is that borderline personality disorder rarely stands by itself. People with borderline personality disorder typically have two, three, four or more, other diagnoses they carry around with the. This can be very confusing for everybody.  Stigma has been following borderline personality disorder around like a dark shadow for as long as there has been borderline personality disorder as a diagnosis. It comes from a lot of different reasons - probably most among them is the fact that for so many years the mental health community was so ineffective at treating borderline personality disorder. Now that we have effective treatments, stigma has started to go down and so, stigma has actually been reduced quite a bit in the last 25 years or so since the first randomized trials of dialectical behaviour therapy were published.  Question: What are the priorities to improve treatment?  I think the priorities and treatment for BPT today are to expand the number of treatments that actually work for people suffering with borderline personality disorder. The number of treatments that we have with very good results that endure is still relatively small and don't necessarily help everybody. Borderline personality disorder is a very heterogeneous disorder, so in order to help people who meet the criteria for BPD we are going to need to have multiple different approaches to treatment to be able to help them broadly.  Question: What do you wish you knew when you first started your career 30 years ago?  I remember when I first heard borderline personality disorder back in the mid-1980’s, and there was an enormous amount of stigma attached to it, and although the providers that I was working with - a psychiatrist and psychologists - were often very stigmatizing, very judgmental about people with BPD, and I wish I could have gone back and told myself, but also them, that you know we're all human beings and the differences between people with BPD and people without BPD are actually much smaller than the things that we have in common. Everybody gets emotionally dysregulated sometimes - everybody does. But people with borderline personality disorder get more intensively dysregulated more often, and so carry with them a lot more pain and suffering. But the nature of the dysregulation is quite the same as it is for anybody.

Project Air Talks to Delores Mosquera about treatment of personality disorder and trauma  Question: What is essential for good treatment of personality disorder?  Compassion, capacity to deal with intense emotions, being able to do supervision, being able to work in a team, and curiosity, really wanting to understand. I think that's crucial.  Question: Do most therapies integrate these same crucial ingredients?  I think that in many approaches we use the same interventions but we use different names to talk about the work we do. So I think a lot of the things that are being explained now maybe they're more clear or meaningful but they have been influenced by many authors that have been speaking about this from my age, my time.  I integrate. I have been influenced by like many approaches so I integrate DBT by conversation, schema therapy, but I mostly work with the MDR, I integrate everything from working with the MDR model.  Question: What do new therapists need to be aware of in treating personality disorder?  To be familiar with complex formalization. To be aware of the internal conflict. But it's not just about impulsive reactions or unstable changes. It is much more complex in some of the most severe cases. I need to understand what's happening inside, to get an idea of what's happening outside, and why.  Question: What should therapists be looking for in identifying trauma?  Yes, I always say that the criteria nine is one of the most ignored but I refer to the second part, this severe dissociative symptoms. I think that suspiciousness and it's very familiar for clinicians, but dissociation is not so familiar. So I think we really need to explore this aspect from the beginning.    Okay so we need to try to explore any traumatic situations from the beginning, but when we notice that the client is not really managing this okay or they are going into low psychosis, or getting overwhelmed, or they're not really connected to what they're answering, those might be signals, that person is not ready to go there. So we need to be attentive to the associative language so we can help them gradually to face.  Question: Why is it important to intervene early with young people?  So for younger people, although it can be more complicated because sometimes they don't have such a capacity for insight. It's also easier to work with them and have them involved in a normal life, go back to school, or get integrated, with people that have been like this for many years. It can be longer so I like I just try to be very honest about time and saying that the important issues can improve. I don't know how long it's going to take but I do know that they're likely better.  Question: Can you explain how “being curious” is so helpful in therapy? I don't know. I think that many times I have been saved by really wanting to understand being curious about what's happening when a client is doing something that doesn't seem to make sense. To become curious I said “Wow, why is this happening?” I think this is something that could be very helpful for us because it avoids judgments and jumping to conclusions.  Project Air Talks to Delores Mosquera about treatment of personality disorder and trauma  Question: What is essential for good treatment of personality disorder?  Compassion, capacity to deal with intense emotions, being able to do supervision, being able to work in a team, and curiosity, really wanting to understand.

Professor Jeffrey Hayes: Understanding therapist countertransference in personality disorder treatment.  Question: What is countertransference in personality disorder treatment?  I've defined countertransference as those reactions that we have to patients that are based primarily in our own unresolved, or partially resolved, conflicts as a result of our own developmental histories, our own idiosyncratic reactions to patients that perhaps aren't widely shared by other therapists  - that somehow there's some recognition that the work that we do with patients, and I think particularly with patients of personality disorders, inevitably it's going to stir up some of our own issues, and all therapists have these reactions - it's not a function of being a trainee, there's no point in our careers where we become immune to these kinds of reactions.  So the point is to understand that these reactions are going to be triggered within us, that they can get in the way of our work if we don't understand them, and it's really important to try and pay attention, not just to the client, but what's going on internally and between the client and myself in the moment, which is a tall order, but in terms of countertransference, you know, what am I feeling, what am I thinking, what's my body experiencing, sensing, and what am I actually doing with this client that raises some suspicions for me - that perhaps my own issues are at play here, and can I use my understanding of my own especially internal reactions to facilitate the work.  So for example, if the client is provoking some sort of rage in me or anxiety in me, it's this what might be called objective countertransference, where the reaction is typical that might be shared by one of my classmates who would be seeing the same client wear the same type of patient, or is this reaction somehow a reflection on me because of my own developmental history - there's some way in which what the client is talking about, what the client is doing, what the client looks like, reminds me of someone, including possibly myself, that causes me to react rather than respond. And in particular, if I find that I'm behaving or thinking or feeling in a way that's atypical for me - I don't usually react this way to clients and I don't usually react this way to this client in my work with them - then there's real grist for the therapeutic mill here. How can I try and reflect on those reactions in the moment, if possible, so that I don't act out defensively, and how do I reflect after the session on my reactions either in supervision or with a classmate or on my own, in a way that my understanding might shed some light on the patient dynamics, on the relationship, and even on the course of treatment?

Mahlie Jewel, consumer advocate with lived experience, talks about the essential elements for good treatment for personality disorder and what you can expect from your therapist. Mahlie Jewell talks about good treatment for personality disorder Question: What are the essential elements of good treatment? I think one of the main things to keep in mind is that we are human and a lot of us have been through some very traumatic experiences over a long period of time. And I think that compassion needs to be something they are thinking about in their dealings with us and I look at that as just treat me like you would treat your child or yourself or a member of your family. I think, also for health professionals that they do take an oath to ‘do no harm’, and to be really aware of the use of trauma informed practices should be the standard, and engaging with the consumer by asking what they need and not assuming what we need. And making sure they deliver that to the highest level they would give to someone in like, a cardiac ward or a neurological ward – to not look at it as any other type of illness, like cancer. Question: What should you expect from your therapist? It’s care. It’s the way that someone deals with you in a really genuine way, and genuinely wants to know what‘s wrong, how can I fix it, what do you need? I think that compassion to me, is understanding that perhaps you’ve had things in your life happen to you that were out of your control, and this is the only way you can be in control, and so, stop looking at it as a choice and look at it as a symptom of what might have happened in the past. So I think with compassion, you’ve got to put groups of people together, so someone who has trauma in their background isn’t any different to someone who’s been to war, and they shouldn’t have a different level of care and compassion around them. I can’t imagine them not being compassionate towards a soldier, not being compassionate towards a car accident victim, or someone who experiences an horrific crime. And so, I think compassion comes from within you and it’s genuine. I often tell people that they best way for them to navigate through the system is to work within the system – so, to know your rights and to know your responsibility for the people around you, but to tackle that with solutions and not just complaints. So, if somethings happening and you are unhappy about it go to that doctor/clinician/mental health tribunal member with a solution. And so, don’t just go “I don’t like this happening to me” but say “this is what I prefer, and be really vocal about things like who you want to support you. That’s a massive issue. Not everyone is going to want their family involved even if they have contact with them. Some people have friends, employers, that don’t even know what’s happening with them. And so the whole thing here can get very scary, so I’m always big in saying, “who do you want to be here?” “who’s going to make you feel safe?” Don’t let somebody else tell you that – you tell them that.

Question: What should you expect from your therapist? It’s care. It’s the way that someone deals with you in a really genuine way, and genuinely wants to know what‘s wrong, how can I fix it, what do you need? I think that compassion to me, is understanding that perhaps you’ve had things in your life happen to you that were out of your control, and this is the only way you can be in control, and so, stop looking at it as a choice and look at it as a symptom of what might have happened in the past. So I think with compassion, you’ve got to put groups of people together, so someone who has trauma in their background isn’t any different to someone who’s been to war, and they shouldn’t have a different level of care and compassion around them. I can’t imagine them not being compassionate towards a soldier, not being compassionate towards a car accident victim, or someone who experiences an horrific crime. And so, I think compassion comes from within you and it’s genuine. I often tell people that they best way for them to navigate through the system is to work within the system – so, to know your rights and to know your responsibility for the people around you, but to tackle that with solutions and not just complaints. So, if somethings happening and you are unhappy about it go to that doctor/clinician/mental health tribunal member with a solution. And so, don’t just go “I don’t like this happening to me” but say “this is what I prefer, and be really vocal about things like who you want to support you. That’s a massive issue. Not everyone is going to want their family involved even if they have contact with them. Some people have friends, employers, that don’t even know what’s happening with them. And so the whole thing here can get very scary, so I’m always big in saying, “who do you want to be here?” “who’s going to make you feel safe?” Don’t let somebody else tell you that – you tell them that. Mahlie Jewell is a consumer advocate with lived experience of borderline personality disorder. Sonia Neale, mental health peer support worker with lived experience, talks about living with BPD and working with health professionals and emergency departments. Sonia Neale talks about her lived experience of  Borderline Personality Disorder & working with health professionals & emergency departments  I wanted a diagnosis but some clients don't. I felt it was very helpful to me to go through all the nine criteria, realized that I fulfilled all of them, and then I worked on them and I found that that was the most integrating process for me. Not everyone wants to know their diagnosis and that's fine.  I think new therapists need to learn how to handle their own anxiety when talking to people with BPD. Essentially if they can hold their own anxiety in check then it's not going to be contagious to the person with BPD. I think validation skills, active listening skills, the ability to sit in those uncomfortable feelings, whether they're coming from the client or the therapist, need to be addressed and looked at. I think the new therapist needs to have his or her own therapy so that they can handle their own anxiety, know their own trigger points, and so the countertransference doesn't happen too often in therapy.  Stigma is a huge problem, especially when people go to emergency departments, mainly because clinicians and mental health nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists sometimes are not up-to-date with new information and new, which essentially says the people with BPD can get better, and do get better, with the right treatment, and it's also when people come to emergency departments to ask the right questions, not “why did you do this” but “what happened to you, what happened to you before you did this”, so the right questions need to be asked. As well there needs to be hope for recovery because people do recover from BPD.  Question: As a consumer, what would you like to tell emergency staff?  I think education is the way to go. Increasing up-to-date information for people, having people with BPD, the peers with lived experience, to go into ED and have a talk to people - to say when I come in dysregulated, my behaviour is not who I am, there are times when I function perfectly well at home, but when I'm dysregulated this is the only place I can come to, you are the only people who can help me at this moment before better or newer services come into it, so what I want you to do is to be able to listen to someone's story and understand where they're coming from. People do not want to come into ED and be thought of as manipulative or attention-seeking, because if we want to live a life, this is not how we want to live it by keep coming to emergency departments.

Parenting with personality disorder This short video follows the life of Sam and her three children. It shows the choices Sam has to make as a parent while struggling with personality disorder. It was developed as a training tool illustrating parenting strategies for caregivers with a personality disorder. Hi I'm Professor Brin Grenyer and I lead the Project Air Strategy for Personality Disorders.  We work with mental health professionals and researchers to help parents get the information they need to deal with the challenges they face. We all love being parents, but it can also be hard at times, and personality disorders can make it even harder.  Today we'll meet Sam. Sam is a single mother with personality disorder and she has three children; Ethan, Jack, and Mia. We look at the choices that Sam has and ways to care and support children when struggling with mental health problems.  Parenting with a Personality Disorder: A film for health professionals, parents, care givers & families  I know what I do affects my kids. I could say it, yeah ,sometimes I just see in their eyes how much they need me and I - just everything's just so intense. I can't even think about them, you know, like I just feel so filled up with so many emotions and it's really hard to think about anything else. I hate myself. I just hate myself.  (Girl) I need to find a way to regulate their environment. If they get too cold it might not work. (Boy) I’m working on something at home. I am. I've got to go. (Girl) Remember we need to get all this done by Thursday. (Boy) I know. (Girl) I'll call you.  : How are you feeling?  Mum. Mummy please open the door.  I'll let you in but you have to promise not to tell anyone, okay Jack, especially not Ethan. () Sometimes it just it just happens but I don't even realize what I'm doing and I've already done it and I can't go back. Then I know that if I can learn how to deal with my problems then I won't have to put that on to my kids. Okay. () Do you want to watch cartoons?  Thanks for looking after Mia, Jack. You’re a big help.  : You want to mount the sensor on the side of the warming chamber, way from the heat lamps. That way you get a more accurate temperature reading and have the best chance of a consistent result across……()  I'd pull myself out hole, haul myself out until I have nothing left.  No one gave me anything, you know, not me. Nobody helped me and I just keep thinking, why does Mia get everything when nobody gave me anything?  I just get so angry and then I don't even realize what I'm doing.  When I feel better, well when I feel better I to know that it's just about opening my eyes and really seeing her. You know, like really seeing her as her own little person, and when I can focus on her world and talk to Mia about what she's doing, that makes things a lot easier. I like the way you used the orange with the red ones over here and then the pink ones over here, with the green, that's very nice. I'm gonna do that too. I'm gonna use some pink like you did and some green. And, shall I get a brown one too?    (Ethan text message): No. Why would you think that? My mum has a personality disorder. It’s hard sometimes. (Ethan text message): It’s ok. See you tomorrow to finish our project? All right! I already told you I called in sick and I need you to come over. I don't know, just, just to be here, to look after me. You don't even care if I live or die Don’t say this to me right now when I really need you that is not true and never easy. Ethan, don’t leave me alone today. Can you stay with me? Please stay with me.  Yeah. Jack, let's go. Mia, here’s your bag. I'll just take Jack and Mia up to school and I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Okay.  I already told you I called in sick and I need you to come over, just to be here with me. ) Ethan is such a good kid. It's easy to rely on him too much. Sometimes I don't even realize how much he's doing around the house. I don't want him to miss out on being a kid. Just give me a minute. I'll get dressed to take you to school.  Mum, I’m not going. I'll stay here with you. I'll just take Jack and Mia up to school and I'll be right back, okay.  No, that's okay. You've got your science project to work on. I'll be okay. I'll call the clinic okay. I'll be here when you get home this afternoon.  Right, Mia get your bag. Mummy’s going to get dressed. I'll be back in two minutes.  : Parenting when you have a personality disorder provides extra challenges but it's important to know there are small steps you can take to make a positive difference. No one can be a perfect parent but it's important that our kids feel loved and protected. Our role is to talk to them about what is going on, protect them from harm, and ensure our children are able to be children. Talking these things over with a mental health worker can help you develop a treatment plan that's right for you and ensure a safe calm and loving family environment.  It always seems really weird to me that in the hundreds of conversations I've had with therapists, not once have I been asked about my kids. You know, being a mother as my main role and raising kids is really hard - full-stop - let alone trying to do it dealing with personality disorder. I feel like other people are judging me, especially other parents. I guess I've avoided getting to know the other parents at the kids’ school. But my kids are what I live for. They are the reason I stick with my therapy and they motivate me to get better - so that I can be a better mum, so that so that we can have a better life than I had, because my mum pretty much left my brother and I to raise ourselves and our household was pretty violent, so I'm determined that my kids won't grow up the way I did. My worst nightmare is if I would pass something on to them and I really don't want them to have to deal with the struggles that I have. But I'm me and I'm their parent so I just try and be good enough every day and just, you know, focus on the positive and take positive steps towards what really matters in my life.  I worry a lot that my kids could be taken from me but I know now that working with my therapists and being really honest about my struggles is the best way to keep us all together, because you know, my therapist and I work on my problems and that helps me be a better parent too. I just hope that I can keep making progress. You know, it's really hard, but I know that my kids really need me and I'm really important to them, and they bring just so much joy and happiness into my life.

Project Air Strategy in conversation with BPD expert, Dr Shelley McMain  Dr Shelley McMain is a Clinical Psychologist and Head of the Borderline Personality Clinic at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health - Canada's largest mental health and addiction teaching hospital. She is studying psychotherapy methods and outcomes for borderline personality disorder (BPD), concurrent BPD and substance use disorders (SIDs) and self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Recent projects have examined the effectiveness of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy for the treatment of concurrent BPD and SIDs.  Question: What is the most important ingredient in treatment for BPD?  I think the first message and I think, probably the most important ingredient, really to treatment delivery is being able to maintain compassion, and I think that that's been a key obstacle to effective treatment for BPD. And I think that health care providers need to learn how to be compassionate, especially when working with individuals who can challenge us, who can get us undone, who, you know, we can end up being very dysregulated with - to maintain compassion under those conditions. And I think there are ways of doing that, and I think several of the evidence-based treatments actually provide us with some guidance on how to maintain compassion.  Question: Are we getting any better at breaking down stigma?  I think unfortunately, I think stigma still continues to be a huge problem and barrier to treatment for people with the disorder. The situation has changed, dramatically, in a very short time span. I recall only 15 years ago it seems our, around that time, when in Canada anyways, that I'm assuming in Australia also, there were very few services for people with BPD, and part of that was due to the prevailing belief that people with the disorder weren't treatable, and what went along with that were a lot of negative attitudes towards this patient population.  Unfortunately I think many of those beliefs persist, although they've changed dramatically in many ways. We're still working on changing those and I think that increasing awareness about the disorder, providing people with education about the fact that the disorder is treatable,  things that when we're in the field now, people anybody who's studying about BPD is now very aware of, but there's lots of healthcare providers that haven't yet received that information. A lot of consumers aren't aware. A lot of family members aren't aware. So increasing awareness through education I think is going to be a key strategy to combat the stigma. I think it will also help to raise and support for, that might help increase additional funding in the area of treatment. The resource allocation also in terms of research funding.  Well I think that clinically, I think that putting aside the challenges in struggling or battling between what we should call this disorder, you know, what name to give it, or which symptoms should go along with it, I think that clinically there's real value in being able to attach a label to a set of symptoms. I think there's value in that, you know, we know that it's often very helpful for people to receive a diagnosis that can help validate their own experience.  So for consumers, it can be helpful for them - it can be therapeutic in itself to receive a diagnosis for symptoms that you can't make sense of and I think that for clinicians, I think it's helpful in terms of guiding our treatment and guiding interventions for individuals. So I think that the diagnosis is also helpful in terms of providing a framework for also furthering our understanding empirically, so getting a better handle on what's the constellation of these problems and what's the prognosis of individuals with this constellation of symptoms can be best understood if we have some framework for organizing those symptoms.  Question: What’s your view on the controversy around the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5? I think that everybody's aware in the field that change is needed and that there are things that aren’t satisfactory with the diagnosis. However I think that there certainly wasn't an agreement on how this field should move forward. I think that, part of the problem is that we're still in somewhat of an early phase in terms of actually understanding enough about the disorder to make empirically informed decisions.  Question: How can we best improve care for people with BPD?  Well we are, in in many ways, a terrific situation compared to where we were 15 years ago when we didn't have evidence-based treatment to offer people with borderline personality disorder, however the problem now that we're facing is we've got incredible demand for specialized services for people with BPD, which is terrific on the one hand, but the problem is we don't have enough of these services available. So we've got the problem of how to really increase access to specialized treatment for BPD, and I think one of the things we need to do is to increase the availability of specialized treatments, and this is going to involve doing more training and helping people helping ensure the healthcare providers are knowledgeable about how to deliver evidence-based treatment because we know that non specialized treatments aren't as effective as specialized treatments.  However, having said that, I don't think that we're ever going to have enough healthcare providers who are able to deliver specialized treatment services, so I think that the other part of the solution is going to involve doing a much better job than what we have done in terms of training primary care health providers in the delivery of BPD informed treatment.  Question: What are some of the good news stories in BPD treatment?  There's several good news stories in terms of training. First, I think just the access to information. It's so much easier for people who are seeking training, not only access to health care providers, but just with the internet, and with the explosion of really terrific materials on the , you could be in a remote community and access excellent training online, so that's really occurred in a fairly short timeframe.  I think that there's still lots to be done that, not only in training healthcare professionals, but also training people who can support people with the disorder, such as family members who can be trained to be more skilful with their loved ones, and certainly there's a lot being done in that regard. There are several peer support programs for family members. There's also peer support groups for consumers that can help them manage their own symptoms, and I think can be used effectively.  Question: Where do we need to go in the future to improve treatment?  I think that one of the biggest challenges right now, and it's largely being driven by the increase in demand for effective treatment, is that I think we need to work harder at improving efficiencies, and the challenge is, we don't actually have the data to guide our decisions about how to be more efficient. So we don't yet know what is the optimal length of treatment, nor do we really know much about what are the effective mechanisms of effective for empirically based treatments, and without that information we can't improve upon our existing treatments.  So, certainly there's work being done in that regard and we're, in many ways, in the early stage of beginning to get a better handle on what are some of the mechanisms that are associated with outcomes. But I think there's much more work to be done and if we're going to have a much broader impact on you know people affected by the disorder. I think that we need to do more and I think we need to do it more efficiently, and I think we need to do a better job.

So we don't yet know what is the optimal length of treatment, nor do we really know much about what are the effective mechanisms of effective for empirically based treatments, and without that information we can't improve upon our existing treatments.  So, certainly there's work being done in that regard and we're, in many ways, in the early stage of beginning to get a better handle on what are some of the mechanisms that are associated with outcomes. But I think there's much more work to be done and if we're going to have a much broader impact on you know people affected by the disorder. I think that we need to do more and I think we need to do it more efficiently, and I think we need to do a better job. Professor Kenneth Levy (USA) talks about narcissistic personality disorder. Dr Kenneth Levy Project talks to the Project Air Strategy about Narcissistic Personality Disorder  The concept of narcissism has a long history, going back to the early Greeks. Clinical writers began interest and began having interest in narcissism as a clinical entity in the mid 1800’s and in the early 1900's writers started talking about narcissism at the threshold of a disorder, and it wasn't though, until Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) 3 in 1980 that narcissism was included as an official disorder in the American Psychiatric Association diagnostic manual. Typically the conceptualization that was developed at that point was based on ideas that came from Otto Kernberg and Ted Milan as well as Heinz Kohut, but focused mainly on the overt grandiose aspects of the disorder - people's concerne with power and wealth and beauty and ideal love, essentially having a pathologically grandiose sense of oneself.  Although clinical writers had also talked about the other side of narcissism, this more vulnerable side and a number of critical varieties that also talked about the fact that the grandiosity that you see in narcissistic individuals serves a defensive function against the vulnerability in the end, the feelings of smallness. But the DSM at that time didn't include those aspects of it, and over a number of iterations of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the DSM, we now have a definition that is actually quite similar to the initial definitions that focus in on the grandiose pathological sense of self, which seems to be the defining characteristic. It seems as if future editions based on the research that's occurring will incorporate the more vulnerable side of narcissism, seeing these two aspects of honourable in the grandiose aspects of narcissism as two sides of the same coin.  Typically there are these oscillations between vulnerable and grandiose states. Kernberg wrote about this most centrally, however in the 1990’s in the early 2000’s there was a lot of research on subtyping narcissistic personality disorder where, through factor analytic studies, they identified the a grandiose subtype and a vulnerable subtype, and that led people to actually think of them as two different types.  Question: Can grandiose & vulnerable narcissism exist in the same person?  Yes, however in reality there are some people who might be predominantly grandiose or predominantly are over in their narcissism and some people are predominantly vulnerable or a covert in their narcissism, but typically patients vacillate between the two. That the grandiose narcissist when they face failure they become deflated and well aware of their deficiencies and in those moments they can actually be quite distressed and suicidal, and vulnerable narcissists, even in their presentation has being the most disturbed, the most upset, or the most aggressed upon, have a flavour of the grandiosity in terms of the worst in terms of having, in terms of their experiences.  Narcissism is probably, after antisocial personality disorder, the most difficult personality disorder to treat, and ironically it's more difficult to treat than borderline personality disorder. I say ironically, in part, because a lot of narcissism narcissistic personality disorder patients are actually functioning in many ways much better than patients with borderline personality disorder, but the there's such a strong defence against any feelings of vulnerability or weakness that it makes it very difficult for therapists to get through that and to actually be able to talk with patients about the kinds of difficulties that they might be having.

Dr Nancy McWilliams (USA) talks about borderline personality disorder, challenges, effective therapy and her experience as a therapist. Dr Nancy McWilliams talks to Project Air Strategy about Personality Disorder. Question: What are the current challenges to treating personality disorders effectively? Theoretically and in clinical experience we know that you can't just medicate a personality, it's psychotherapy that's the treatment of choice for problems in personality, and that takes a while. It takes a relationship of trust, it takes a capacity of collaboration between two individuals that become a unique team to try to understand and change very deep set patterns. Question: What has history taught us about effective therapy? We have a vast literature on different kinds of ways of experiencing in the world and what the implications are for a therapeutic relationship. Even on such a simple matter as whether the therapist moves in to sit closer to the patient, or gives the patient a lot of space. More depressive people feel better when you do the former, the more schizoid people feel intruded on when you do that and they much prefer having space. Even simple things like that are important for therapist to know.  Therapists who get taught about nothing but specific symptom syndromes, and what treatments have been found in some statistical majority of patients to be helpful, don't have nearly the repertoire of understanding of how to make a therapeutic relationship as those people who've been trained in individual differences. I've had a lot of therapists come to me, I do a lot of supervision and consultation over the years, saying I got a lot of training about how to apply different techniques, but I didn't get training in the differences among individuals that I would be applying the techniques to, and I'm learning through hard experience that it makes a huge difference. So, for example, somebody will read the literature on self-disclosure and find that in general the therapists saying something personal about the self, statistically speaking, gets a good response from most patients, but if you do that with somebody who's narcissistic they will feel resentful, as if are you talking about “you”, ‘why aren't you listening to me’, and it will make the therapy worse, not better. So there are numerous instances like that. With paranoid people you don't want to be as warm as you are with other patients, because they wonder why you're being so warm, what's your hidden agenda, why are you trying to seduce them, whereas if you're warm with a person who's depressive they think,’ finally I'm talking to a person that has a real feeling for me’. Those differences matter enormously and we need to put more emphasis on them. Question: What do therapists need to become effective? I advise young therapists to go as deeply as possible into their own knowledge of themselves via psychotherapy, but also via meeting about personality differences, finding supervisors that know how to talk this language. If you work with people with severe personality disorders, there's no surviving it without a lot of consultation and help from colleagues, because you get pulled into the painful affects, the painful feelings of the people who live in these difficult psychology's, whether it's paranoid or borderline or narcissistic, you need a lot of consultation. I’ve been practicing 40 years and I still talk to colleagues regularly about the difficulties of the work. I am extremely grateful to have worked on my own personality and my own psychoanalysis. It not only helped me understand myself and find places in myself of borderline stuff, possessive stuff, schizo stuff, paranoid stuff, so that I had a greater range of empathy. It also gave me the ‘deep in my bones’ conviction of how helpful psychotherapy is - how much of a difference it makes for people, so that when I'm sitting with somebody who's been trying all kinds of things to improve their life and has now become demoralized and despairing of really getting help, I have to carry the hope for the two of us for a while. I have to have confidence that this works, and that's where I got it from, my own experience in psychotherapy. My life is radically different from what it would have been if I hadn't had good psychotherapy. Question: What do therapists need to know after diagnosis? The DSM () describes differences in personality based on traits. You have a paranoid personality, you were suspicious and distrustful, for example. Those are traits. That's not wrong but it misses the fact that it's the theme that organizes the paranoid person. The theme of paranoia is trust versus distrust and paranoid people can be pathologically over trusting, not just pathologically under trusting. There are a lot of paranoid people that feel that their cult leader or their idealized political leader is perfect. That's being pathologically over trusting. In obsessive people they have the trait of neatness but that misses the theme of control, dis- control, neatness, messiness. The most of obsessive compulsive people I've ever worked with have a terrible mess somewhere but they coexist with all these efforts to be neat. People with hysterical psychologies are sometimes very seductive and sometimes very prudish, so the trait of seductiveness misses the dynamic of a theme about sexuality, gender, and power. Schizoid people are famous for the trait of withdrawal, but they will sometimes have moments of exquisite connection with people from which they then flee. So even the way we try to describe people based on the traits in our taxonomies, this is the internal experience of what it's like to see the world a certain way, to see the world as defined by who do you trust, or not, or as defined by whether you’re in control, or not, or as defined by gender and power, or as defined by closeness and distance. And you know, there are other themes for the other personalities and we don't go near that in our descriptions but for therapists, you have to have a feel for that. There are other ways of thinking about individual differences that take those internal experiences more into consideration. I know you've done a lot of work with people with borderline. Psychologists really describe borderline psychology very well as without a feeling for the terrible preoccupation with whether you're connected or disconnected, and the terrible anxiety if you feel rejected, and the terrible feeling of being controlled if you feel too connected. Those are internal experiences that are important to understand, and also you want to understand the way the persons with borderline psychology behave. You know, they will complain for years about their horrible partner, and you help them separate from the partner and then they get free and they go into abandonment terror. So if you don't understand that, you're working toward a goal that you don't fully understand. You don't know what to make of it when that doesn't help the person and you decide, okay, this kind of person isn't amenable to treatment so now I'll throw them out of treatment. You really need to understand what their internal experience is like, to understand what the nature of treatment is. Question: Has modern diagnostic methods minimised the importance of personality in treatment? Up until about 1980, when the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association made a major paradigm change, it was personality that preoccupied most clinical writing - individual differences, like whether you were more hysterical, obsessional, paranoid, ,narcissistic, schizoid  - there were many different sort of organizations of personality on which there was a fairly large clinical literature and in some cases a significant empirical literature, and those literature's were very helpful to therapists because an anxiety disorder in a person with hysterical psychology looks different in response to a different kind of therapeutic style than an anxiety disorder in an obsessional person, for example. But in DSM 3 and since then personality disorders were first of all kind of an afterthought, they were literally relegated to the back of the book because that manual was more interested in describing specific syndromes, especially depressive and anxiety syndromes, but also eating disorders addictions and other problems, and the personality in which those occurred were somewhat minimized. Question: What would you have liked to have known at the start of your career? I guess I would love to have known how powerful the emotional experience is, really getting inside another person's sense of the world. I don't think people who were not therapist have any sense of how exhausting it is to let yourself feel all the toxic emotions that come at you from people who suffer a lot. I would probably try to prepare myself for that and also give myself some advice to be sure that I had places in life that were free of that. You can't be in that space all the time. You have to have friends completely outside the psychotherapy network or some hobby or interest that nourishes. There's an awful lot of exhaustion from doing the work. I would certainly encourage myself as a young person to get a lot of group supervision to take advantage of listening to other people's struggles with their patients, and I would I would put much less emphasis on theoretical orientation and more on experience. You can learn from people of any theoretical orientation. We're all looking at the same suffering animal, we have different languages for what we are describing, but experienced therapists tend to work rather more similarly than new therapists – very different theoretical orientations. So the more interaction you have in the people who influence you, the more you can learn from different orientations, the better.

e2c9d599-c855-4301-929b-9c490727466e,"> > Personality disorders are a contentious diagnostic category that describe “an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment” (APA, 2013). Personality traits are enduring patterns, exhibited in wide range of contexts, of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and oneself. If personality traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment then they are said to constitute a personality disorder. The use of a ‘personality disorder’ diagnostic category is contentious because: many people feel judged or stigmatized by being given the label of ‘personality disorder’; many people fit diagnostic criteria for more than one personality disorder which makes some doubt the utility and reliability of diagnosis; historically, the label of personality disorder has been associated with the subtext ‘untreatable’ and ‘difficult.’ Communicating and acting assertively is an interpersonal skill that helps people to maintain healthy relationships, resolve interpersonal conflict, an ... https://www.psychologytools.com/resource/assertive-communication/ Being able to communicate assertively is an essential skill for developing and maintaining healthy relationships and positive self-esteem.

More specific diagnoses are made only if the general criteria are met. A general personality disorder is characterized in the DSM-5 as an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two or more of these domains: cognitions (including perceiving and interpreting: the self, other people, events); affectivity (range, intensity, lability, appropriateness); be inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations; leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning; is stable and of a long duration, with an onset in adolescence or early adulthood. ICD-10 Criteria for a General Personality Disorder General diagnostic guidelines for a personality disorder indicate that an individual’s presentation meet the following criteria. Markedly disharmonious attitudes and behavior, involving usually several areas of functioning, e.g., affectivity, arousal, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking, and style of relating to others. The abnormal behavior pattern is enduring, of long standing, and not limited to episodes of mental illness. The abnormal behavior pattern is pervasive and clearly maladaptive to a broad range of personal and social situations. The above manifestations always appear during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood. The disorder leads to considerable personal distress but this may only become apparent late in its course. The disorder is usually, but not invariably, associated with significant problems in occupational and social performance. Prevalence of paranoid personality disorder has been estimated at between 2.3% and 4.4%. Prevalence of schizoid personality disorder has been estimated at between 3.1% and 4.9%. Prevalence of schizotypal personality disorder has been estimated at between 0.6% to 4.6%. Prevalence of antisocial personality disorder has been estimated at between 0.2% and 3.3%. Prevalence of antisocial personality disorder is much higher in forensic populations. Prevalence of borderline personality disorder has been estimated to be 1.6% with a top range of 5.9%. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder is about 6% in primary care settings, 10% in outpatient mental health settings, and 20% among psychiatric inpatients. Prevalence of histrionic personality disorder has been estimated to be 1.84%. Prevalence of narcissistic personality disorder has been estimated at between 0% and 6.2%. Prevalence of avoidant personality disorder has been estimated to be 2.4%. Prevalence of dependent personality disorder has been estimated at between 0.49% and 0.6%. Prevalence of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder has been estimated at between 2.1% and 7.9%. Psychological Models and Theory of Personality Disorders Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is able to conceptualize and treat the problems of personality disorder (Beck, Davis, & Freeman, 2015). In a review of treatment for personality disorders Matusiewicz, Hopwood, Banducci and Lejuez (2010) argue: “From a cognitive behavioral perspective, personality disorders are maintained by a combination of maladaptive beliefs about self and others, contextual/​environmental factors that reinforce problematic behavior and/​or undermine effective behavior, and skill deficits that preclude adaptive responding. CBT incorporates a wide range of techniques to modify these factors, including cognitive restructuring, behavior modification, exposure, psychoeducation, and skills training. In addition, CBT for personality disorder emphasizes the importance of a supportive, collaborative, and well-defined therapeutic relationship, which enhances the patient’s willingness to make changes and serves as a potent source of contingency.” Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a modified form of cognitive behavioral therapy that was developed as a treatment for borderline personality disorder / emotional unstable personality disorder (BPD/​EUPD: Linehan, 2014). DBT is a biopsychosocial theory that proposes that some individuals have a biological predisposition for emotional dysregulation. If they are raised in emotionally invalidating environments they fail to develop emotional regulation skills which manifest in the characteristics of BDP/​EUPD. Schema-focused therapy proposes that personality disorders are the result of early maladaptive schemas (e.g., mistrust/​abuse, entitlement/​grandiosity, unrelenting standards / hypercriticalness) that interfere with the person’s ability to meet their core needs. Patterns of avoidance and compensation are developed in order to avoid triggering the core schema, but these strategies are rigid and become over-generalized. Schema-focused therapy employs cognitive, behavioral, imagery, experiential, and psychodynamic techniques (Young, Klosko & Weishaar, 2003).

People with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) may appear arrogant, with an inflated self-image and disregard for the feelings of others. This disorder can cause socially destructive behaviours that damage relationships. NPD is part of the cluster of personality disorders with symptoms of intense and unstable emotions and a distorted self-image. It’s a rare disorder, affecting more men than women and is usually evident by early adulthood. The nature of NPD symptoms means it’s hard for people who suffer from the disorder to realise they have a problem. When you believe you’re better than everyone else, why would you think there’s anything wrong? It is often the family or loved ones who are most aware of this problem and who also suffer the consequences. However, if left untreated, NPD can affect a person’s work, social and family life. The state of someone’s relationships can be the biggest indicator. can help people with NPD to understand themselves better, and relate to others more positively. With support and treatment, life can become more enjoyable for people with NPD and their loved ones. If you need help, talking to your doctor is a good place to start.

Alice is a 23 year old History graduate living in York who has experienced mental health problems. ""Being told I had emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) wasn’t a huge shock - but it certainly wasn’t easy to accept."" I think I knew before the diagnosis - I’d been frantically Googling and asking questions for months. The existing mental illnesses I’d been living with for years were no longer a good enough explanation. They didn’t explain why I would impulsively spend hundreds of pounds, or start smoking, or binge drink. They didn’t explain why I desperately craved love and care yet isolated myself for days at a time, switching off my phone and staying in bed. They didn’t explain the weeks of dissociation and lost memories that followed the rollercoasters of extreme emotions. So being told I had wasn’t a huge shock - but it certainly wasn’t easy to accept. Over the course of the seven years prior to the diagnosis, I’d been through generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), acute panic attacks, depression, and . I’d spent time on various anti-anxiety and , been referred to the community mental health team, had many sessions. I’d joined mental health awareness campaigns, stood up to those in my life who’d shown ignorance towards my illnesses and really worked hard to understand what it was I was facing. I would have considered myself an incredibly understanding person, and unashamed (as I should be) of what I’d been through - yet, the news that I was indeed experiencing EUPD turned everything on its head. It wasn’t even my psychiatrist who told me - the report of the findings, including the diagnosis, was sent through a couple of days later and I couldn’t bear to read it myself. Instead, I passed the report to my most trusted friend, who read through it before giving me a summary of the doctor’s conclusions. He relayed the important points, as sensitively as he could, ending with that acronym I expected and feared: “E-U-P-D”. I cried. I begged him not to tell anyone else, afraid of others’ opinions, and judgements, and the stigma I was certain I would face. The open and honest mental health advocate of the past seven years was gone, replaced by this scared little girl I didn’t recognise. ""If people knew me to be ‘emotionally unstable’, who would give me that love I so desperately craved?"" I was terrified of the phrase ‘’ - who would want to spend any time with me now that there was something wrong with my personality? If people knew me to be ‘emotionally unstable’, who would give me that love I so desperately craved? In that moment I was ignorant to my own illness, refusing to believe that those with personality disorders could be anything more than the ‘evil’ and ‘manipulative’ stereotypes so often seen on film and in traditional media. It seemed to me that there were two categories of mental illnesses: those becoming gradually more talked about and accepted in the mainstream, such as and , and those rarely mentioned outside of their connection to a crime or violent act - schizophrenia, bipolar, personality disorders. So initially, I was terrified of having to disclose or explain my EUPD to anyone. ""I’m slowly becoming more comfortable with talking about my personality disorder."" A few months down the line and I’m slowly becoming more comfortable with talking about my personality disorder. Social media and the internet in general contributed hugely to me getting to this point. Mind’s proved very helpful in understanding some of the symptoms individually, particularly when it came to dissociation, which I find the hardest part of EUPD to deal with. If you haven’t dissociated yourself it can be tricky to understand, so try and imagine you’re in front of a TV, watching your life play out – you’re part of the audience, and you might not like what you’re seeing – but it’s as though someone has stolen the remote control, so you have no say in what you see, you can’t pause it or lower the volume or change the channel. You could be sat in front of that TV for minutes or months at a time. Later – when you are no longer dissociating – you have vague memories of what you just watched, but you need the plot and finer details explaining to you. It’s a horrid thing to experience and can make you feel like you’ve missed so much of your own life. ""As with all mental illnesses, struggling with loneliness can be debilitating."" As with all mental illnesses, struggling with can be debilitating. I don’t know of anyone in my day to day life dealing with EUPD and as much as I can look up the statistics that tell me thousands of people have the same diagnosis, when I’m vulnerable these numbers are meaningless. I’d give anything to just be able to talk to one of these people in person. Social media has massively helped in dealing with the loneliness however - following individuals on Instagram and Twitter with Borderline personality disorder (BPD)/EUPD who post about what they experience, warts and all, helps me feel so much more ‘normal’, and provides a community of people who completely get it. They understand that there are months’ worth of my life I don’t remember, that so many relationships in my life have been altered or lost because of my illness, that I feel anger and sadness so intensely that it can start to physically hurt. ""I spend so much time wishing that I could get on a plane and fly away from my own mind."" I spend so much time wishing that I could get on a plane and fly away from my own mind, or just have one moment’s break from all the thoughts and emotions in my head. I’m due to begin before the end of the year and hopefully this will give me the tools I need to face life in as safe and rational a way as possible. Until then, my focus is accepting EUPD as a part of me, as just another mental illness that I am capable of living with as I am with all the others. I hope that I can share my experience of living with a personality disorder with anyone it might help, and surround myself with those who understand that there is nothing ‘wrong’ with my personality, but accept that I am merely unwell, and on my way to recovery.

Why Some Children Live With a Persistent Fear of Abandonment How Narcissism Distorts Self-Image via Self-Concept Clarity LEGO Braille Bricks Help Blind Children Learn to Read Do You Often Feel Disappointed in Your Relationship? The presentation of bipolar disorder symptoms is highly variable. In 1980 The American Association replaced the ’s (DSM) use of ""manic-"" with "".""  The bipolar label introduced the view that mood and accompanying emotion exist on a broad continuum and that individuals with bipolarity typically experienced symptom sets at both ends or polarities of the mood continuum.  Hence “bipolarity.” Despite the change that’s now been in place close to 40 years, I don’t perceive that the term ""bipolar disorder"" has helped to shift the public’s perception of the disorder.  Much of what’s found online continues to convey this notion that people with bipolarity live in an up-down roller coaster world where mood phases frequently transit between depression and mania.  Below are some examples of introductory descriptions taken from websites providing information about bipolar disorder. ""Bipolar disorder is a mental illness marked by extreme shifts in mood. Symptoms can include an extremely elevated mood called mania. They can also include episodes of depression..."" ""Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that causes dramatic shifts in a person’s mood, energy and ability to think clearly. People with bipolar experience high and low moods—known as mania and depression—which differ from the typical ups-and-downs most people experience."" ​Unfortunately much of what is offered as public doesn’t come close to conveying the complexities or subtleties of bipolar symptomatology.   Of the two poles, most people can better relate to depression as opposed to mood elevation. After all, many have experienced some aspects of it, or they know someone who has.  Based on data from the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) we see that 6.7% of Americans have experienced major depression. Women experience almost twice as much depression (8.5%) as do men (4.8%). Adults between 18 and 25 report even higher prevalence of depression – 10.5%. A recent 2018 article in cites a study from JAMA - Psychiatry (Journal of the American Medical Association), where it was reported that the lifetime prevalence of major depression (percent of people who have experienced a major depressive episode at least once in their lifetime) - is 21%. That's approximately one in every five people. What tends to be more common for bipolar depressed individuals are feelings of helplessness in response to the chronicity of their illness.  They’re not just having a bad week or a bad winter.  The person who has lived with their bipolarity for 10 years isn’t just saying “I’m depressed.”  More accurately, the message may be closer to – “I'm repeatedly depressed and it's difficult to envision a time when I'll be free of it.""   Depressed mood phases usually last longer than mood elevations.  I’ve seen some people remain depressed for up to six to nine months.  Others may only experience a brief depressive dip lasting a few days before returning to comfortable mid-range. That said, most living with bipolar disorder have had at least one major depressive episode lasting two weeks or longer.  Bipolar depressive acuity can range between mildly melancholic to soul sucking, energy flattening, acute depression.  Mood elevation is another story.  The strongest misconception is that elevated mood represents “happy.”  It can, but that's just a small piece.  Usually mood elevation conveys many more dimensions than just the upper end of the happy/sad continuum.  I encourage people to think of mood elevation more as mood intensification.  Below is a list of elevated mood symptoms.  It’s important to note that individuals will experience different clusters of these symptoms.  One individual's bipolar elevation may be quite different from another's.  If there's any unifying thread we typically see it through the presence of elevated energy, lessened sleep and accelerated thought processes.  Beyond these three, most mood elevation symptoms are very person specific.   Sustained and strong positive, euphoric mood lasting longer than a day or two  Difficulty sitting still (needing to move, exercise and discharge physical energy) Lessened need for sleep (feeling rested after less than usual amount of sleep) Experiencing one or more nights without any sleep while also not feeling fatigued Intense goal directed activity – sometimes becoming focused on an activity almost to the exclusion of everything else Compulsive cleaning or organizing, or excessive disorganization Not being able to stop talking – not making verbal “space” for the other.   Strong and (more than is usual) Unrealistic, grandiose perceptions of one’s capabilities Stronger to or religious beliefs (stronger than is common for the individual) Unrealistically positive perceptions about one’s creative endeavors Impulsive spending – purchasing things that are not needed Treating others harshly due to one’s irritable feelings Difficulty maintaining focused attention and thinking (distorted thoughts about reality) If we interviewed 100 people with bipolarity, we'd find the list would become even longer.  Each individual has their own list of symptoms that are unique.  I recall a patient once stating that she could always tell she was hypomanic when she had urges to bake chocolate chip cookies well into the early morning hours. Central to the understanding of elevated mood intensity is the recognition that mood intensity can vary greatly.  Low level elevation () can be subtle and only mildly above normal positive mood.  Elevation can arrive gradually over the course of several days.  Its presence may not appear strong enough to be identified as representing anything maladaptive.  In the first few years of living with the disorder, mild elevation can be difficult for an individual to identify as it doesn't necessarily feel like anything is wrong.  Conversely, elevation can also have rapid onset and progress towards such intensity that psychiatric hospitalization becomes necessary due to the reality that one is no longer in control of behavior (mania).  There is no one-size-fits-all with bipolarity. If we could graph the mood intensity of bipolarity, we’d find that different people’s graphs revealed very different patterns.  Some patterns would appear to have some regularity with regard to duration, intensity and frequency of elevated or depressed mood.  Others would be more chaotic and unpredictable.  Some individuals with bipolarity rarely experience any sustained mid-range experience.  They are mostly in depression with brief periods of mood elevation.  Some people with bipolarity who are more fortunate can remain in mid-range mood for many months without the presence of any symptoms that would be indicative of their bipolar disorder.  I’m recalling one patient I saw who had an initial manic episode at age 17, a second manic episode at age 40 and a third at 56.  He remained asymptomatic and off of throughout the intervals between .  Unfortunately for him, following the third onset of mania he went through a full year of mood instability with three hospitalizations – two for mania and one for acute depression.  I include this example simply to say that with bipolarity, there will always be individuals whose symptom patterns are atypical.    Last, bipolar mood shifts occur for many different reasons.  Sometimes they can be induced, which tends to most often be the case.  Sometimes there are seasonal components where the progression of mood is affected by changes in daylight and darkness concurrent with the changing seasons.  Mood shifts can be initiated by inadequate sleep, or even prescribed medications.  There are also those times when individuals experience significant mood shifts with no clearly identifiable reason why mood has progressed up or down, except for the fact that they live with bipolarity.  All are possible.   What is clear is that, in general, those living with bipolarity have difficulty maintaining relatively balanced mid-range mood.  When outside of mid-range, their symptoms present with a lot of variability.  Their mood instability tends to persist over time.  It can be helped through psychiatric medications, and healthy lifestyle choices.  But the fact that bipolarity typically persists through the life cycle isn’t reflective of a person’s lack of effort, lack of discipline or lack of character strength.   My point is that bipolar disorder presents with many different shapes and forms. People don't just transit between happy and sad.  They traverse a very broad continuum of mood symptoms and patterns that are unique to each individual. Submitted by Dan on February 18, 2018 - 1:03am I get a bit sick of psychologists, who are not medically trained, advising people to take medication. It should be illegal. Medication should always be the last resort, not the first. It has terrible side effects, is damaging in the long run, and independent studies often show it is no better than placebo. Aside from that, the article tells us nothing new at all. Like all varieties of mental illness, bipolar is a slippery customer with no clear boundaries. That would lead sensible people to see at as just a collection of symptoms, and not a specific disease with a specific cause. But not here. Submitted by André on February 18, 2018 - 4:18am The author did not push medication in any way or form. This article in fact is one of the best, most nuanced articles about bipolar disorder I have ever read, I have bipolar disorder so I do know.. Submitted by André on February 18, 2018 - 4:25am I read with interest your article. As I mentioned in a reply here one of the best articles I have read about bipolar disorder and I have read quite a lot. I have the pattern of depression with infrequent periods of normal or higher elevateded moods, and this since I was 11 or 12.. I have been hospitalised a few times but could have been more, especially after many suicide attempts..Not ever finding a suitable treatment plan, I have stopped all medication...time will tell if I was righ to. Submitted by Tom on February 25, 2018 - 7:57pm Oh please...there is nothing new here to anyone who struggles with the illness. Submitted by Belinda on February 27, 2018 - 7:46pm Perhaps the article's audience wasn't people who have suffered with the illness? It seems to me that it is very informative for someone trying to understand the illnes. I know my mom would find it useful. I think I will ask her to read it. Submitted by Russ Federman on February 27, 2018 - 8:08pm Perhaps the article's audience wasn't people who have suffered with the illness? It seems to me that it is very informative for someone trying to understand the illnes. I know my mom would find it useful. I think I will ask her to read it. I agree with Belinda's comment. The article was not meant for people living with bipolarity, but more for the general public that often has inaccurate views of the symptoms associated with bipolar disorder. Perhaps this should have been clarified better in the opening of the article. Submitted by Andrea on February 18, 2018 - 9:11am One of the best description of the symptoms of bipolar disorder I've ever read! The mistaken concept that people with bipolar disorder constantly bounce between states of ""happy"" and ""sad"" is ridiculous and does not begin to describe the effects of this exhilarating and debilitating condition. Submitted by Dina Niewood, L.C.S.W. on March 26, 2018 - 11:37am As mentioned, many people believe, as often it is portrayed this way in the media, that bipolar disease is simply being in two states: mania or depression. This is absolutely not the case. Submitted by Deanna Mullins, M.Ed. on June 12, 2018 - 10:41am After getting off of hormonal birth control at 16, I started having depression. That soon ""wore off"" but at 17, I was experiencing what I've read as a mixed episode or dysphoric mania. I was diagnosed the day before my 19th birthday, primarily due to seeing my father hospitalized twice as a child. I knew what to look for. I even exaggerated during my appointment so I could get support. Though I don't always agree with the information provided, I am grateful this exists. For years, I was in denial that I had this issue because my symptoms were more closely related to a phobia I have and GAD. After having my son, things kinda crashed. I lived in constant fear that I would go off the deep end and I would never ever feel any better. My biggest fear was to get worse and not be able to maintain my career or reach my goal of achieving (or at least starting) a doctorate by 30. Thank you for writing this. It has helped me accept that this is chronic but chronic does not mean that I have to live in fear of the next swing. Chronic can be asymptomatic or can be adapted to or it can mean that we just have to deal with what is coming. You wrote an article about the rare cases of bipolarity having limited lifetime symptoms. Though rare, it gave me a significant amount of hope. As a realist, hope is not something I can generally come by. Also, I read an article here about creating positive habits to indirectly treat bipolar, I have been as stable as I can be. Neurons that fire together wire together. My energy levels have improved. My mood still swings but in combination with becoming educated, reading about the neurology and psychology of the disorder, and taking a low dose of a mood stabilizer, I finally have positive thoughts of the future. The negative part of me wants to say it is just mania but I know that mania for me is never a ""good"" feeling. I've also been managing the idea of my son inheriting this better. If it happens, he will get support. This is something I don't always have but between my brother and I, we are not easily surprised by symptoms anymore.

It's a serious mental health condition that used to be referred to as manic depression. According to the , the guide used to diagnose mental illnesses, there are two main types of bipolar disorder that can be diagnosed based on the severity and nature of their symptoms:﻿ Individuals with bipolar I experience at least one manic episode in their lives. Although not required for the formal diagnosis, the vast majority will also experience major depressive episodes during the course of their lives.  – Individuals with bipolar II have at least one hypomanic episode (a less serious form of mania) and at least one major depressive episode. Being a mental health condition, blood draws or imaging exams won't help with diagnosing bipolar disorder but may sometimes be ordered to help rule out medical conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms. To confirm a diagnosis, a person must meet the criteria outlined above (symptoms and frequency), which will be assessed through a psychiatric assessment.﻿ Note that symptoms of bipolar disorder are the same in women and men, but societal and gender roles can affect how they manifest or how others perceive them. Manic episodes last at least seven days. Hypomanic episodes involve the same symptoms, but the individual's functioning isn't markedly impaired and psychotic symptoms cannot be present. Symptoms of a manic or hypomanic episode include:﻿ Impulsive risk behaviors (including gambling and lavish spending) During a depressive episode, an individual may experience the following symptoms:﻿ Crying for no reason or prolonged periods of sadness Loss of interest in activities that usually give you pleasure Extreme fatigue, including the inability to get out of bed Loss of interest in your health, nutrition, or physical appearance such as short-term memory trouble, difficulty concentrating, and indecision, may be the first things noticed by others when someone has bipolar depression. It can interfere with an individual's performance and make it difficult to complete tasks. Physical Symptoms Associated With Depressive Episodes During depressive episodes, individuals may experience a variety of physical symptoms, including unexplained aches and pains.﻿ Changes in weight are also common. While some people struggle to eat when they're feeling down, others turn to food for comfort. Thus, both weight loss and weight gain can be symptoms of a depressive episode.﻿ Psychomotor agitation, an increase in activity caused by mental rather than physical tension or psychomotor retardation, slowing of both thought and physical activities, may also occur.﻿ There are distinct diagnostic criteria that have been proposed for bipolar disorder, but even with these criteria, the diagnosis is far from easy. Psychiatric conditions that can manifest symptoms similar to bipolar disorder include: Hyperactivity and distractibility are two of the hallmark symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (). However, they are also quite predominant in bipolar disorder, especially as it relates to children. To further complicate things, these conditions can often co-occur.﻿ It is very common for those with bipolar disorder to struggle with alcohol and substance abuse issues.﻿ This is often an attempt, even on an unconscious level, to . Additionally, the effects of certain substance use (which may cause hallucinations or the inability to sleep) can be confused with the symptoms of bipolar disorder. In addition to these concerns,  with the medications used to treat bipolar disorder. The diagnostic criteria for  include impulsivity, suicidal behavior, reactivity of mood, inappropriate anger, and transient paranoia. All of these are also associated with bipolar disorder. It is possible for an individual to be diagnosed with both of these disorders as well. (Learn more about the similarities and  between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.)﻿ The hallmark of delusional disorder is non-bizarre delusions, meaning the situation may be possible. Mood episodes can be present but they are brief in duration relative to the delusion.﻿ The one thing that (unipolar depression) from bipolar disorder is .﻿ If a patient with depression swings into an episode of mania, the diagnosis becomes bipolar disorder. Many people who have undiagnosed bipolar disorder are found to have the disorder when medications such as some antidepressants are started and precipitate mania.﻿ It is not uncommon for those with bipolar disorder to experience .﻿ Moreover, depression, anxiety and irritability often result from eating disorders. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by an extreme fear of gaining weight or getting fat. Those with this disorder often have a body weight of less than 85 percent of that which is considered normal.﻿ Bulimia nervosa is typified by periods of binge eating followed by purging (purposely vomiting). Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, spontaneous . Panic disorder is often comorbid (occurs together) with mood and other psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, panic attacks are also common in those with bipolar disorder.﻿ Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that causes intense disturbances in cognition (thinking), behaviors, and emotions. It consists of two classifications of Symptoms—positive and negative.  include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and thinking, disorganized behavior, catatonic behavior, and inappropriate moods.  are flattened emotions, lack of speech and a reduction in goal-directed behavior. The symptoms of schizophrenia are with those of bipolar disorder.﻿ A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is given when there are symptoms of major depression or mania, along with certain symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the delusions or hallucinations must persist for periods when the mood symptoms aren’t present. As you might expect, there is a great deal of confusion and controversy surrounding differentiating this disorder from bipolar disorder.﻿ While specific, the assessment of bipolar criteria is also highly subjective. As such, cases are often missed. According to a study published in 2018, 60% of patients seeking care for recurring depression actually have bipolar disorder.﻿ On the other hand, over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder is also a concern. A 2013 review of clinical studies demonstrated that bipolar disorder was incorrectly diagnosed in:﻿ 40 percent of patients with borderline personality disorder 37 percent of cases where a clinician inexperienced in bipolar disorder made the call A study released in 2010 showed that, of 528 people receiving Social Security , only 47.6 percent met the strict diagnostic criteria. There are two important caveats that may further complicate the process of distinguishing the two types of bipolar disorder. One is that although present psychotic symptoms are one of the things that differentiate bipolar I mania from bipolar II hypomania, someone with bipolar II may experience hallucinations or delusions during depressive episodes without the diagnosis changing to bipolar I.﻿ The second is that someone with bipolar I disorder may also have hypomanic episodes. In fact, they commonly do. But, someone with bipolar II does not ever have a manic episode. If a manic episode occurs in someone with bipolar II, the diagnosis will be changed.﻿ If you or someone you know is , it's important to talk to your physician. Your physician may want to rule out any potential physical health issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. Your physician may refer you to a mental health professional for an evaluation.

This illness usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood and continues throughout life. Although it may come into affect at any time, most individuals with the disorder experience their first mood episode in their 20's. However, manic-depression quite often strike teenagers and has been diagnosed in children under 12. The risk of suicide among persons afflicted with bipolar illness is unrealistically high. As many as 1 in 5 people with this disorder have committed suicide. This rate is nearly 30 times greater than that of the general population. Research suggests that people who commit suicide, whether depressed or not, tend to be more impulsive in their behavior. Manic-depressives, due to their spontaneous nature, are more likely to commit suicide than depressives. Manic depression involves alternating episodes of serious mania and depression. An affected person's mood can swing from excessive highs (mania) to deep hopelessness (depression), usually with periods of normal mood in between. Some individuals may display mixed symptoms of both mania and depression at the same time, while others may have fewer symptoms of mania (also referred to as hypomania). The type severity, and duration of mood episodes may vary. Some individuals may experience excessive mania, or excessive depression, and some may experience an equal amount of both. The mood episodes can last for a few days to as long as several months, especially when left untreated or not treated effectively. Usually a person with bipolar disorder can expect an average of ten episodes of either mania or depression in their lifetime, but some individuals experience much more frequent mood episodes. Some characteristics of mania include: increased energy, activity, restlessness, racing thoughts, and rapid talking; excessive euphoria; extreme...

The treatments covered will involve psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs. Many refer to as manic-depressive . This causes people to swing from very low depressive states to extreme highs of “mania.” When people are depressed they may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in everyday activities. However, when their mood shifts in the other direction they may feel extremely happy and full of vigor. These shifts can occur several times in a year or in worse conditions on a daily basis. This can be quite disruptive long term to your life. However, with a good treatment plan and more importantly following it, this can be controlled. (Mayo Clinic) Let’s define these stages a little deeper. Mania - although less common than depression, it is when someone experiences an extreme euphoric state.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended. Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your bipolar disorder-related health concerns Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: Often, you'll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you're behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you're having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. You'll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it's usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn't work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don't make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you're taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes. A consistent routine allows for better mood management. People with bipolar disorder may benefit from establishing a daily routine for sleep, diet and exercise. The focus is identifying unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. CBT can help identify what triggers your bipolar episodes. You also learn effective strategies to manage stress and to cope with upsetting situations. Learning about bipolar disorder (psychoeducation) can help you and your loved ones understand the condition. Knowing what's going on can help you get the best support, identify issues, make a plan to prevent relapse and stick with treatment. Family support and communication can help you stick with your treatment plan and help you and your loved ones recognize and manage warning signs of mood swings. Depending on your needs, other treatments may be added to your depression therapy. During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. ECT may be an option for bipolar treatment if you don't get better with medications, can't take antidepressants for health reasons such as pregnancy or are at high risk of suicide. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an option for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. Treatments for children and teenagers are generally decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on symptoms, medication side effects and other factors. Generally, treatment includes: Children and teens with bipolar disorder are often prescribed the same types of medications as those used in adults. There's less research on the safety and effectiveness of bipolar medications in children than in adults, so treatment decisions are often based on adult research. Initial and long-term therapy can help keep symptoms from returning. Psychotherapy can help children and teens manage their routines, develop coping skills, address learning difficulties, resolve social problems, and help strengthen family bonds and communication. And, if needed, it can help treat substance abuse problems common in older children and teens with bipolar disorder. Psychoeducation can include learning the symptoms of bipolar disorder and how they differ from behavior related to your child's developmental age, the situation and appropriate cultural behavior. Understanding about bipolar disorder can also help you support your child. Working with teachers and school counselors and encouraging support from family and friends can help identify services and encourage success. testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease. You'll probably need to make lifestyle changes to stop cycles of behavior that worsen your bipolar disorder. Here are some steps to take: One of the biggest concerns with bipolar disorder is the negative consequences of risk-taking behavior and drug or alcohol abuse. Get help if you have trouble quitting on your own. Surround yourself with people who are a positive influence. Friends and family members can provide support and help you watch for warning signs of mood shifts. Having a regular routine for sleeping, eating and physical activity can help balance your moods. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. Eat a healthy diet. If you take lithium, talk with your doctor about appropriate fluid and salt intake. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about what you can do. Call the doctor who's treating you for bipolar disorder before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or any over-the-counter supplements or medications. Sometimes other medications trigger episodes of depression or mania or may interfere with medications you're taking for bipolar disorder. Keeping a record of your daily moods, treatments, sleep, activities and feelings may help identify triggers, effective treatment options and when treatment needs to be adjusted. There isn't much research on alternative or complementary medicine — sometimes called integrative medicine — and bipolar disorder. Most of the studies are on major depression, so it isn't clear how these nontraditional approaches work for bipolar disorder. If you choose to use alternative or complementary medicine in addition to your physician-recommended treatment, take some precautions first: Don't stop taking your prescribed medications or skip therapy sessions. Alternative or complementary medicine is not a substitute for regular medical care when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. Be honest with your doctors and mental health professionals. Tell them exactly which alternative or complementary treatments you use or would like to try. Alternative and complementary products aren't regulated the way prescription drugs are. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it's safe. Before using alternative or complementary medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks, including possible serious interactions with medications. Coping with bipolar disorder can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help: Education about your condition can empower you and motivate you to stick to your treatment plan and recognize mood changes. Help educate your family and friends about what you're going through. Learning to manage bipolar disorder can take time. Stay motivated by keeping your goals in mind and reminding yourself that you can work to repair damaged relationships and other problems caused by your mood swings. Support groups for people with bipolar disorder can help you connect to others facing similar challenges and share experiences. Explore healthy ways to channel your energy, such as hobbies, exercise and recreational activities. Yoga, tai chi, massage, meditation or other relaxation techniques can be helpful. You may start by seeing your primary care doctor or a psychiatrist. You may want to take a family member or friend along to your appointment, if possible, for support and to help remember information. including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for the appointment including any major stresses or recent life changes vitamins, herbs or other supplements you're taking, and the dosages Are there any other possible causes for my symptoms? What treatments are available? Which do you recommend for me? What side effects are possible with that treatment? What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting? I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together? Should I see a psychiatrist or other mental health professional? Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing? Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have? Don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment. Your doctor will likely ask you a number of questions. Be ready to answer them to reserve time to go over any points you want to focus on. Your doctor may ask: When did you or your loved ones first begin noticing your symptoms? Do you ever have suicidal thoughts when you're feeling down? Do your symptoms interfere with your daily life or relationships? Do you have any blood relatives with bipolar disorder or depression? What other mental or physical health conditions do you have? Do you drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or use recreational drugs? How much do you sleep at night? Does it change over time? Do you go through periods when you take risks that you wouldn't normally take, such as unsafe sex or unwise, spontaneous financial decisions? What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms? What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms? Reilly-Harrington NA et al. A tool to predict suicidal ideation and behavior in bipolar disorder: The Concise Health Risk Tracking Self-Report.

Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all — or almost all — activities Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out — and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number — in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity Bipolar disorder and alcoholism: Are they related? There's no sure way to prevent bipolar disorder. However, getting treatment at the earliest sign of a mental health disorder can help prevent bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions from worsening. If you've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, some strategies can help prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes of mania or depression: Addressing symptoms early on can prevent episodes from getting worse. You may have identified a pattern to your bipolar episodes and what triggers them. Call your doctor if you feel you're falling into an episode of depression or mania. Involve family members or friends in watching for warning signs. Using alcohol or recreational drugs can worsen your symptoms and make them more likely to come back. You may be tempted to stop treatment — but don't. Stopping your medication or reducing your dose on your own may cause withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return.

If you are a healthcare professional and you find any issue, please reach out to Despite the colloquial use of the term “bipolar” and references to the condition in popular culture, bipolar disorder is often misunderstood by the public. While the disorder does feature alternating moods, it is not simple moodiness or unpredictability. Bipolar disorder is defined by specific mood episodes on opposite poles of the mood spectrum: “manic,” or elevated, and depressed. These mood episodes come with many additional symptoms beyond changes in mood, including altered cognition, sleep and behavior. Bipolar disorder is a severe that sometimes requires to address life-threatening risks and to stabilize people so that in the future they can manage the condition on an . Psychiatrists have been diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder since the mid-1800s. The condition features alternating mood episodes. It was originally called “manic depression,” a term that persists to this day in popular culture and song, though clinicians no longer use it as a formal diagnosis. Bipolar disorder is defined by the presence of at least one distinct mood episode. While most people with bipolar disorder have depressive or mixed episodes, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) only requires people to have a history of manic episodes to receive the diagnosis. Manic and depressive episodes cause holistic changes to thinking and behavior. People who are depressed have less mental and physical energy, while people who are manic or hypomanic have more. The sudden intensity of a manic episode can be unpleasant and dangerous. Manic episodes are sometimes severe enough to lead to hospitalization, especially when they include psychotic features like delusions or hallucinations. Some of the people that originally defined bipolar disorder in the late 19th and early 20th century viewed it as a spectrum disorder, with there being stages of bipolar disorder rather than specific or discrete types of bipolar disorder. While this concept is not reflected in the way bipolar disorder is diagnosed, it can be helpful for some people who are trying to better understand their experience with the disorder. People who have more depressive episodes or symptoms and therefore fall on the depressive end of the spectrum may need different interventions than do people who frequently experience and need to manage manic or hypomanic symptoms. People can be confused by the different types of bipolar disorder and what is meant by terms like manic bipolar disorder, mild bipolar disorder and bipolar I versus bipolar II. For many people, these distinctions aren’t important. However, it can help to know that bipolar I disorder is more severe than bipolar II disorder and that the difference between them relates to the severity of associated manic episodes. Severe depressive episodes carry risks, but manic episodes are much more dangerous than hypomanic episodes. Bipolar I disorder is the most severe form of bipolar disorder. It is defined by the presence of manic episodes. There is no requirement regarding depressive episodes. However, most people with bipolar I disorder experience both manic and depressive episodes. Severe manic episodes are associated with many risks. These include impulsive behavior like reckless driving, excessive spending and unsafe sex. Sometimes people who are manic also experience psychosis. They may start having auditory hallucinations, such as “hearing voices,” or develop grandiose delusions. Someone who has bipolar I with psychotic features may believe that they are imbued with supernatural powers and act on those beliefs in ways that put them or others at risk of harm. People experiencing extreme manic symptoms usually require a brief period of inpatient hospitalization until they mentally recover to the point they no longer experience psychosis. For people to be diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, they must have experienced at least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode. While it is possible for them to experience psychosis during either kind of mood episode, people with bipolar II disorder are much less likely than people with bipolar I disorder to have a psychotic break. Hypomanic episodes affect people’s functioning but not to the same degree as manic episodes. People do not require hospitalization for hypomanic episodes. Many people with bipolar II disorder experience them as positive periods of increased energy and creativity. The pleasurable aspects of hypomanic episodes are what cause many people with bipolar disorder to avoid taking medications that control their disorder. However, hypomanic episodes often also have unpleasant aspects like racing thoughts and agitation. People with bipolar II rapid cycling type typically experience more mood episodes per year than people with other types of bipolar II disorder. When considering a diagnosis of cyclothymia versus bipolar disorder, the main distinguishing factor between the two is severity. Cyclothymia is even milder than bipolar II disorder. While people with bipolar II disorder have full episodes of hypomania and major depression, people with cyclothymia only have symptoms of hypomania and depression. People with bipolar cyclothymia have never had a full mood episode as defined in the DSM. They may not even recognize they have an underlying disorder and might experience their shifts of mood as seasonal or contextual. While untreated cyclothymia is less severe than untreated bipolar I or bipolar II disorder, it can affect relationships and work. It can also drive people to use substances to try to regulate their moods. People who experience a bipolar mixed episode are at increased risk for impulsive and self-destructive behavior, including self-harm and suicide attempts. While mixed state bipolar disorder might seem like a contradiction, it is actually relatively common for people who are depressed to experience sudden bursts of energy that make them feel irritable or agitated. Similarly, people experiencing manic symptoms can sometimes start feeling hopeless. What makes mixed episodes more dangerous is that people who are severely depressed often lack the energy or motivation to act on suicidal ideation, while people in a mixed state are more likely to act on depressed or hopeless thoughts. Episodes with mixed features can also include psychotic symptoms that make them even riskier and more likely to require hospitalization. Some people experience bipolar rapid cycling type, also known as rapid cycle bipolar disorder. It is important to understand that the term “rapid cycling” does not mean a person has sudden shifts in mood from one day to the next or mood swings throughout the day. That kind of mood lability typically indicates another disorder, such as borderline personality disorder. In bipolar cycling, people alternate between mood episodes that last a few weeks or one or two months instead of typical bipolar episodes that last for several months each. Signs of bipolar disorder can be subtle at first. Some people may experience alterations to cognition, such as bipolar memory loss before they experience any mood symptoms. They might notice they are having difficulty recalling words or remembering plans before more distinctive symptoms of depression or mania start to occur. Early bipolar signs often include disruptions in sleep and increased irritability. Episodes of what some people with the disorder called “bipolar anger” are often a precursor to a full bipolar mood episode. As brain chemistry shifts, increased irritability can spur people to snap or lash out at others. Bipolar rage attacks can occur in the context of depression or mania. that increased anger and aggression in bipolar disorder is independent of the polarity of the current mood episode but is more common in acute mood episodes, especially when psychotic features are present. While some bipolar symptoms are independent of mood episodes, most of the time, symptoms of bipolar disorder are indicative of one of three mood states: depression, mania or hypomania. – Bipolar depression symptoms are generally the same as symptoms of major depressive disorder, except in cases where mixed features are present. While worsening mood and hopeless thoughts are typically associated with , the onset of a depressive episode is often first signaled by a loss of energy and changes to appetite, sleep and cognition. People who are depressed have more difficulty making decisions or maintaining the motivation to pursue personally important activities. – The onset of bipolar is often indicated by increased energy level and mental activity. In the early stages of a manic episode, people may notice that their thoughts race from topic to topic. They may develop sudden new interests that progress to compulsive behavior as the manic episode develops. For example, a new interest that develops in the early phase of a manic episode can lead to someone spending thousands of dollars on items related to that interest in the acute phase of a manic episode. – The symptoms of are similar to the symptoms of mania, just more subtle. Many people experience feelings of inspiration at the onset of a hypomanic episode. They may feel more creative or adventurous and decide that they want to start a major new project. Pleasant symptoms like these cause some people to embrace their bipolar disorder even if it means accepting less pleasant episodes or symptoms. It’s important to note that not all hypomanic symptoms are benign — people can often feel irritable, anxious or out of control when they are hypomanic. Some people may ask, “Is bipolar genetic?” or “Is bipolar hereditary?” The disorder does have strong genetic components. Research published in Scientific American indicated that someone with a parent who has bipolar disorder is than others to struggle with the condition. The risk is even more pronounced if both parents have bipolar disorder. The most powerful bipolar disorder causes are biological differences that can be inherited. Research suggests that bipolar disorder is caused by changes in brain structure and function, including changes in levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. While environmental factors cannot cause bipolar disorder, they can increase the risk that a person will develop the disorder. They can also trigger its onset, causing people to experience bipolar symptoms earlier than they would have otherwise. Bipolar triggers include stress, sleep deprivation, trauma and substance abuse. As with any other mental health diagnosis, professionals make a bipolar disorder diagnosis through a series of clinical interviews. They may use a screening tool or bipolar test with targeted questions to determine if a person meets DSM criteria for a bipolar diagnosis. Some people might be diagnosed with bipolar disorder for the first time during an episode of . People with bipolar I disorder are often hospitalized after their first manic episode. Hospital staff makes observations over several days to determine the most appropriate diagnosis for people who exhibit both psychotic symptoms and elevated mood. It can be harder to diagnose bipolar disorder when a person is experiencing a depressive episode. Mental health professionals engage in a careful process of differential diagnosis to determine if a person who has symptoms of depression has also ever had symptoms of mania or hypomania. They must determine whether a person experiences the distinct mood episodes that indicate bipolar disorder or shorter-term mood instability, which may indicate another kind of disorder, such as a personality disorder. The risk factors for bipolar disorder include the following: A family history of bipolar disorder or other mood disorders Early experiences that affect brain function, such as head trauma Childhood trauma or growing up in an unstable or violent home Substance abuse in late childhood or early adolescence Substance abuse can cause changes in the brain that can trigger the onset of bipolar disorder. However, it is unlikely that anyone without genetic or biological risk factors will develop the disorder, even when several environmental risk factors are present. About of the United States population has bipolar disorder in a given year. Bipolar disorder usually emerges for the first time in early adulthood but can also arise in adolescence. People with bipolar disorder suffer from the most severe functional impacts of any mood disorder, with 83 percent of people experiencing serious impairment. Additional include the following: About 65 percent of people with bipolar disorder have a manic or hypomanic episode before they have a depressive episode. From of people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide at least once. Suicide is the cause of death for over of people with bipolar disorder. This means that the bipolar suicide rate is than the suicide rate in the general population.

The world is at your feet. You can do whatever you set your mind to and nothing could possibly go wrong. In fact, you're so full of energy that you decide you don't need to . Days, perhaps even weeks, go by -- nothing gets you down and nothing slows you down. But then, without warning, this feeling starts to wane. For no reason at all, you begin to feel bogged-down, depressed or even suicidal. Life is joyless and meaningless. For weeks you feel absolutely hopeless. And then, one day you wake up -- ready for anything. This cycle is characteristic of people who suffer from . According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), bipolar disorder, also known as , affects approximately 5.7 million adults in the U.S. (2.6 percent of the 18 and up population) [source: ]. The disorder causes intense, alternating episodes of mania and that go far beyond normal mood swings. Children and adolescents can develop the disorder as well, though their mood swings usually happen far more rapidly. ­People who have bipolar disorder face several obstacles as a result of the illness. In addition to the stress it can place on families and interpersonal , a bipolar patient is 40 percent less likely to have a job [source: ]. Someone with bipolar disorder is also 10 times more likely than the general population to or , which­ is unfortunate since alcohol and drugs have the potential to trigger episodes of the disorder [source: ]. Perhaps the most terrifying fact is that about 15 percent of bipolar patients succeed in committing , out of 25 percent to 50 percent who attempt it [source: ]. What do scientists know and what don't they know about this disorder? Keep reading to learn the signs and symptoms of manic and depressive episodes. Bipolar disorder includes periods of mania and periods of depression. The mood swings a bipolar patient experiences are more intense than the natural mood swings of a healthy person. The disorder typically shows up between the ages of 15 and 25 in both men and women and is characterized by periods of and periods of [source: ]. The (NIMH) lays out the symptoms that are common to a . These include: Risky decisions (spending sprees, risky investments) According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), a certain number of manic symptoms must be present for at least a week for those symptoms to add up to a manic episode. Manic episodes can affect people differently. For some, euphoric symptoms make it a wonderful, desirable experience. For others, mania makes them extremely irritable and easily angered. A less severe kind of mania is called , which may include a less intense form of any of the above symptoms. Hypomania does not interfere with one's daily life and relationships as much as a regular manic episode [source: ]. If left untreated, hypomania could progress into mania. The following is the NIMH's list of symptoms: For these symptoms to add up to a depressive episode, a certain number of these symptoms must persist for at least two weeks. It is possible for bipolar patients to actually experience manic and depressive symptoms at the same time. When this happens for at least a week, it is referred to as a [source: ]. In addition, some may experience which is characterized by a year of at least four episodes of mania, hypomania or depression [source: ]. During a more severe manic or depressive episode, a bipolar patient can experience . These can include delusions (false beliefs) and hallucinations (false sensations) [source: ]. Because these symptoms are usually associated with , doctors can easily misdiagnose these bipolar patients. The kinds of episodes patients experience determines the type of bipolar disorder they are diagnosed with. Classifications for the disorder include: : This is the most severe form of the disorder. It includes at least one manic or mixed episode and at least one depressive episode [source: ]. : Patients have had at least one depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. With this type, a patient could experience periods of normal moods as well. : This classification is used for cases in which bipolar patients experience patterns that don't fall into the I or II categories. : This is the least severe form of the disorder. It includes two years of episodes of hypomania and milder depression. Now that we can more easily recognize the disorder and what bipolar patients experience, let's take a look at what people think might cause this mysterious illness. Scientists are trying to find the chromosomes and genes that are involved in bipolar disorder. Researchers don't know exactly what causes bipolar disorder. Most likely, there's no single factor but rather multiple factors that cause bipolar disorder to develop. do play a role and increase the likelihood that someone will develop the disorder. But you can't always determine who will get it based on genetics. For example, although the disorder does run in families, one may develop the disorder while the other twin never does. Statistics show that the children of bipolar patients have a higher risk than the general population of developing it. Attempts to find the specific genes that lead to the disorder have failed, but research is ongoing [source: ].  Environmental factors might actually contribute to the development of the disorder in someone who is genetically predisposed. For instance, stressful periods and major life-altering events -- both good and bad -- can trigger the disorder. Other environmental factors have the potential to cause specific manic and depressive episodes in bipolar patients. These include drug and alcohol abuse, seasonal changes and even [source: ]. Chemicals in the brain could also predispose people to bipolar disorder [source: ]. Researchers suspect that the levels of neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) might be involved in the disorder. Because and , which release dopamine, can instigate mania, it is possible that high dopamine levels could lead to a manic episode [source: ]. This theory is supported by the evidence that manic and psychotic symptoms correlate with increased dopamine levels [source: ]. In addition, researchers have found low serotonin activity during manic and depressive episodes [source: ]. Also, hypomania often correlates with increased norepinephrine levels. Compared to healthy patients, bipolar patients have lower levels of an enzyme used in the transfer of GABA in the brain. It is thought this plays a role in causing the disorder because anticonvulsant drugs, which are effective in combating bipolar disorder, increase the levels of GABA [source: ]. The more scientists find out about the causes of the condition, the more progress they can make toward finding effective treatments. Luckily, many bipolar patients benefit from existing medications. Next, we'll take a look at the most common medications used to treat bipolar disorder. Could a test tell you if you have a mental disorder? If so, it would have huge implications. Researchers are trying to develop a blood test that attempts to measure if certain genes are active to precisely assess a patient's mood. Scientists hope that this process, once perfected, will replace the flawed process of diagnosing patients based on reports of their symptoms. It could also eliminate a lot of the frustration involved in finding the particular medications that will work for a given individual. Despite these advantages, however, many are worried how a test like this could make life harder for bipolar patients. For instance, a blood test for mental disorders could be used against patients if it were used to deny them opportunities for employment [source: ]. Lithium is one of the elements on the periodic table and can be found in the earth's crust. Because the cause of bipolar is largely unknown, the search for effective treatments is difficult. Though certain medications, such as lithium, prove helpful for many bipolar patients, scientists don't know why. Doctors have found that bipolar disorder is a long-term illness that requires consistent, long-term treatment. This usually includes taking prescribed medications even during periods of healthy moods. Because patients respond differently to the various drugs used to treat the disorder, adjusting the dosage or the kind of medication is often necessary to find the best treatment for an individual. The following is a list of the most popular medications used for bipolar disorder. : In the 1970s, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved lithium for treating bipolar disorder, and it is still one of the first lines of treatment for the condition. Lithium is a mood stabilizer, effective against both depressive and manic episodes. After starting on lithium, patients have to visit the doctor for frequent blood tests to monitor lithium levels. After finding a healthy dosage, patients won't have to take the blood tests as often. : Like lithium, anticonvulsants are also mood stabilizers. Anticonvulsants work by stabilizing the overactive parts of the . They also are commonly used to prevent seizures in patients. Different anticonvulsants work in different ways. Some work by increasing levels of the GABA neurotransmitter [source: ]. Used alone or with lithium, anticonvulsants can be effective for many bipolar patients. : For people who don't respond to lithium and anticonvulsants, doctors may prescribe atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine. These kinds of drugs, which are also used to treat schizophrenia, work by affecting the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, such as dopamine. : If a bipolar patient is having sleeping problems, benzodiazepines can help promote healthy sleeping routines. These should be used with caution, however, and usually for only a short period because of the possibility of [source: ]. : Because they can trigger manic episodes, antidepressants are not prescribed to treat bipolar disorder as commonly as they used to be [source: ]. Depending on the kind, antidepressants work by adjusting levels of serotonin or norepinephrine in the brain. To learn more about them, read In addition to the normal potential for side effects, it is dangerous for or mothers to take certain mood-stabilizing drugs. Lithium isn't likely to harm a in the womb, but certain anticonvulsants can cause birth defects [source: ]. Changing medications too much during pregnancy can cause negative effects as well [source: ]. Because unexpected pregnancy can make the choice difficult, it's best to discuss the options with a doctor. Medications are not the only option for fighting bipolar disorder. The National Institute of Mental Health maintains that the best treatment incorporates both medicines like those listed above and psychosocial treatment [source: ]. In the next section, we'll explore these and other kinds of treatments. If you suffer from bipolar disorder, not only are you not alone, but you are in great company. Creative types are supposedly more likely to have the condition than average folks. In fact, many believe there is a connection between the disorder and creativity. Here is a list of some notable creative people who have (or may have had) bipolar disorder: Group therapy has proven helpful for many. Various therapies have proven helpful for bipolar patients as a supplement to medicinal treatment. Taking part in any of the following can lessen the severity and give the patient more control over symptoms:   : Used for various disorders, this therapy aims to change the patient's perceptions and habits. By changing how bipolar patients think about the illness and encouraging positive attitudes, cognitive behavioral therapy can make effective improvements. This therapy also usually involves learning more about bipolar disorder, which helps patients become more confident and knowledgeable about how to treat it. : The patient's family participates in this therapy with the patient. By identifying sources of and conflicts, the family can learn to better address them and thereby offer the patient a better and more encouraging environment. : This therapy offers an opportunity for several people with bipolar disorder to gather in a group led by a psychologist. In the group sessions, the members discuss their experiences with the illness and offer feedback for one another.    : As the name implies, the purpose of this therapy is to improve relationships and encourage habits of regular routine (such as a sleep schedule). Both of these factors have a large impact on moods. Studies show that this therapy helps prevent relapse of bipolar disorder that might have been brought on by unhealthy relationships and irregular habits [source: ]. : Though it still carries a stigma, ECT is an effective treatment and is much safer than it used to be. Using ECT, doctors induce seizures in patients, which last up to a minute long [source: ]. After repeated treatment, ECT is effective against many mental disorders. It works by altering the behavior of chemicals in the brain. However, scientists don't quite know how or why it works. In addition to these therapies, it's a good idea to avoid drugs and alcohol, as they can potentially trigger an episode.  As we've seen, just learning more about the disorder might provide comfort and hope. Bipolar patients should realize that they are not alone and that it is a treatable condition. Various kinds of research and advancements in technology that allow for more precise studies of the brain offer promising signs that the disorder will continue to get more manageable. To learn more about related subjects, such as the brain and how it is studied, read the links on the next page. For someone diagnosed with bipolar disorder, deciding against treatment altogether could have dangerous consequences. Although treatment works better for some than for others, experts agree that it is better to be treated than not be treated. Studies have found different chemical activity in untreated bipolar patients, such as a deficiency of N-acetylaspartate in certain parts of the brain, which can impair functioning [source: ]. There is reason to believe that without treatment, the disorder not only gets worse but gets harder to treat [source: ]. Also, statistics show that those bipolar patients who go without treatment are two times as likely to both attempt and succeed in committing suicide [source: ].

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. The term  is sometimes used to refer to what is more frequently known as mental disorders or psychiatric disorders. Mental disorders are patterns of behavioral or psychological symptoms that impact multiple areas of life. These disorders create distress for the person experiencing these symptoms. While not a comprehensive list of every mental disorder, the following list includes some of the major categories of disorders described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The latest edition of the diagnostic manual is the and was released in May of 2013.﻿ The DSM is one of the most widely used systems for classifying mental disorders and provides standardized diagnostic criteria. Neurodevelopmental disorders are those that are typically diagnosed during infancy, childhood, or adolescence. These psychological disorders include: Sometimes called Intellectual Developmental Disorder, this diagnosis was formerly referred to as mental retardation.﻿ This type of developmental disorder originates prior to the age of 18 and is characterized by limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviors. Limitations to intellectual functioning are often identified through the use of , with an  under 70 often indicating the presence of a limitation. Adaptive behaviors are those that involve practical, everyday skills such as self-care, social interaction, and living skills.  This diagnosis is for developmental disabilities in children who are under the age of five. Such delays relate to cognition, social functioning, speech, language, and motor skills. It is generally seen as a temporary diagnosis applying to kids who are still too young to take standardized IQ tests. Once children reach the age where they are able to take a standardized intelligence test, they may be diagnosed with an intellectual disability. These disorders are those that impact the ability to use, understand, or detect language and speech. The DSM-5 identifies four different subtypes of communication disorders: language disorder, speech sound disorder, childhood onset fluency disorder (stuttering), and social (pragmatic) communication disorder.﻿ This disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in social interaction and communication in multiple life areas as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors. The DSM specifies that symptoms of autism spectrum disorder must be present during the early developmental period and that these symptoms must cause significant impairment in important areas of life including social and occupational functioning.﻿ is characterized by a persistent pattern of hyperactivity-impulsivity and/or inattention that interferes with functioning and presents itself in two or more settings such as at home, work, school, and social situations.﻿ The DSM-5 specifies that several of the symptoms must have been present prior to the age of 12 and that these symptoms must have a negative impact on social, occupational, or academic functioning. is characterized by shifts in mood as well as changes in activity and energy levels. The disorder often involves experiencing shifts between elevated moods and periods of depression. Such elevated moods can be pronounced and are referred to either as mania or hypomania. This mood is characterized by a distinct period of elevated, expansive, or irritable mood accompanied by increased activity and energy. Periods of are sometimes marked by feelings of distraction, irritability, and excessive confidence. People experiencing mania are also more prone to engage in activities that might have negative long-term consequences such as gambling and shopping sprees.  These episodes are characterized by feelings of a depressed or sad mood along with a lack of interest in activities. It may also involve feelings of guilt, fatigue, and irritability. During a depressive period, people with bipolar disorder may lose interest in activities that they previously enjoyed, experience sleeping difficulties, and even have thoughts of suicide. Both manic and depressive episodes can be frightening for both the person experiencing these symptoms as well as family, friends and other loved ones who observe these behaviors and mood shifts. Fortunately, appropriate and , which often include both medications and , can help people with bipolar disorder successfully manage their symptoms. Compared to the previous edition of the DSM, in the DSM-5 the criteria for manic and hypomanic episodes include an increased focus on changes in energy levels and activity as well as changes in mood. Anxiety disorders are those that are characterized by excessive and persistent fear, worry, anxiety and related behavioral disturbances.﻿ Fear involves an emotional response to a threat, whether that threat is real or perceived. Anxiety involves the anticipation that a future threat may arise. Types of anxiety disorders include: This disorderis marked by excessive worry about everyday events. While some stress and worry are a normal and even common part of life, involves worry that is so excessive that it interferes with a person's well-being and functioning.  This conditionis characterized by a pronounced fear a wide range of public places. People who experience this disorder often fear that they will suffer a in a setting where escape might be difficult. Because of this fear, those with often avoid situations that might trigger an anxiety attack. In some cases, this avoidance behavior can reach a point where the individual is unable to even leave their own home. is a fairly common psychological disorder that involves an irrational fear of being watched or judged. The anxiety caused by this disorder can have a major impact on an individual's life and make it difficult to function at school, work, and other social settings. These involve an extreme fear of a specific object or situation in the environment. Some examples of common specific phobias include the fear of spiders, fear of heights, or fear of snakes.  The four main types of specific phobias involve natural events (thunder, lightening, tornadoes), medical (medical procedures, dental procedures, medical equipment), animals (dogs, snakes, bugs), and situational (small spaces, leaving home, driving). When confronted by a phobic object or situation, people may experience nausea, trembling, rapid heart rate, and even a fear of dying. This psychiatric disorder is characterized by panic attacks that often seem to strike out of the blue and for no reason at all. Because of this, people with often experience anxiety and preoccupation over the possibility of having another panic attack. People may begin to avoid situations and settings where attacks have occurred in the past or where they might occur in the future. This can create significant impairments in many areas of everyday life and make it difficult to carry out normal routines. This condition is a type of anxiety disorder involving an excessive amount of fear or anxiety related to being separated from attachment figures. People are often familiar with the idea of separation anxiety as it relates to young children's fear of being apart from their parents, but older children and adults can experience it as well. When symptoms become so severe that they interfere with normal functioning, the individual may be diagnosed with . Symptoms involve an extreme fear of being away from the caregiver or figure. The person suffering these symptoms may avoid moving away from home, going to school, or getting married in order to remain in close proximity to the attachment figure. In one survey published in the , it was estimated that as many as 18 percent of American adults suffer from at least one anxiety disorder. Trauma and stressor-related disorders involve exposure to a stressful or traumatic event.﻿ These were previously grouped with anxiety disorders but are now considered a distinct category of disorders. Disorders included in this category include: is characterized by the emergence of severe anxiety for up to a one month period after exposure to a traumatic event. Some examples of traumatic events include natural disasters, war, accidents, and witnessing a death. As a result, the individual may experience dissociative symptoms such as a sense of altered reality, an inability to remember important aspects of the event, and vivid flashbacks as if the event were reoccurring. Other symptoms can include reduced emotional responsiveness, distressing memories of the trauma, and difficulty experiencing positive . can occur as a response to a sudden change such as divorce, job loss, end of a close relationship, a move, or some other loss or disappointment. This type of psychological disorder can affect both children and adults and is characterized by symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, worry, anger, hopelessness, and feelings of isolation.    can develop after an individual has experienced exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. Symptoms of PTSD include episodes of reliving or re-experiencing the event, avoiding things that remind the individual about the event, feeling on edge, and having negative thoughts. Nightmares, flashbacks, bursts of anger, difficulty concentrating, exaggerated startle response, and difficulty remembering aspects of the event are just a few possible symptoms that people with PTSD might experience. can result when children do not form normal healthy relationships and attachments with adult caregivers during the first few years of childhood. Symptoms of the disorder include being withdrawn from adult caregivers and social and emotional disturbances that result from patterns of insufficient care and neglect. Dissociative disorders are psychological disorders that involve a dissociation or interruption in aspects of , including identity and .﻿ Dissociative disorders include: This disorder involves a temporary loss of memory as a result of dissociation. In many cases, this memory loss, which may last for just a brief period or for many years, is a result of some type of psychological trauma. Dissociative amnesia is much more than simple . Those who experience this disorder may remember some details about events but may have no recall of other details around a circumscribed period of time. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, involves the presence of two or more different identities or personalities. Each of these personalities has its own way of perceiving and interacting with the environment. People with this disorder experience changes in behavior, memory, perception, emotional response, and consciousness. is characterized by experiencing a sense of being outside of one's own body (depersonalization) and being disconnected from reality (derealization). People who have this disorder often feel a sense of unreality and an involuntary disconnect from their own memories, feelings, and consciousness. Formerly referred to under the heading of somatoform disorders, this category is now known as somatic symptoms and related disorders.﻿ Somatic symptom disorders are a class of psychological disorders that involve prominent physical symptoms that may not have a diagnosable physical cause. In contrast to previous ways of conceptualizing these disorders based on the absence of a medical explanation for the physical symptoms, the current diagnosis emphasizes the abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that occur in response to these symptoms. Disorders included in this category: Somatic symptom disorderinvolves a preoccupation with physical symptoms that make it difficult to function normally. This preoccupation with symptoms results in emotional distress and difficulty coping with daily life. It is important to note that somatic symptoms do not indicate that individuals are faking their physical pain, fatigue, or other symptoms. In this situation, it is not so much the actual physical symptoms that are disrupting the individual's life as it is the extreme reaction and resulting behaviors. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive concern about having an undiagnosed medical condition. Those who experience this psychological disorder worry excessively about body functions and sensations are convinced that they have or will get a serious disease, and are not reassured when medical tests come back negative. This preoccupation with illness causes significant anxiety and distress. It also leads to changes in behavior such as seeking medical testing/treatments and avoiding situations that might pose a health risk. involves experiencing motor or sensory symptoms that lack a compatible neurological or medical explanation. In many cases, the disorder follows a real physical injury or stressful even which then results in a psychological and emotional response.  Factitious disorder used to have its own category, is now included under the somatic symptom and related disorders category of the DSM-5. A factitious disorder is when an individual intentionally creates, fakes, or exaggerates symptoms of illness. Munchausen syndrome, in which people feign an illness to attract attention, is one severe form of factitious disorder. Eating disorders are characterized by obsessive concerns with weight and disruptive eating patterns that negatively impact physical and mental health. Feeding and eating disorders that used to be diagnosed during infancy and childhood have been moved to this category in the DSM-5.﻿ Types of eating disorders include: is characterized by restricted food consumption that leads to weight loss and a very low body weight. Those who experience this disorder also have a preoccupation and fear of gaining weight as well as a distorted view of their own appearance and behavior. involves binging and then taking extreme steps to compensate for these binges. These compensatory behaviors might include self-induced vomiting, the abuse of laxatives or diuretics, and excessive exercise.  is marked by regurgitating previously chewed or swallowed food in order to either spit it out or re-swallow it. Most of those affected by this disorder are children or adults who also have a developmental delay or intellectual disability.  Additional problems that can result from this behavior include dental decay, esophageal ulcers, and malnutrition. Pica involves craving and consuming non-food substances such as dirt, paint, or soap. The disorder most commonly affects children and those with developmental disabilities.  was first introduced in the DSM-5 and involves episodes of binge eating where the individual consumes an unusually large amount of over the course of a couple hours. Not only do people overeat, however, they also feel as if they have no control over their eating. Binge eating episodes are sometimes triggered by certain emotions such as feeling happy or anxious, by boredom or following stressful events. Sleep disorders involve an interruption in sleep patterns that lead to distress and affects daytime functioning. Examples of sleep disorders include: Narcolepsy is a condition in which people experience an irrepressible need to sleep. People with narcolepsy may experience a sudden loss of muscle tone.

While all people experience sleeping difficulties and interruptions at some point, insomnia is considered a disorder when it is accompanied by significant distress or impairment over time. disorder is characterized by excessive sleepiness despite an adequate main sleep period. People with this condition may fall asleep during the day at inappropriate times such as at work and school. Breathing-related sleep disorders are those that involve breathing anomalies such as sleep apnea that can occur during sleep. These breathing problems can result in brief interruptions in sleep that can lead to other problems including insomnia and daytime sleepiness.  Parasomnias involve disorders that feature abnormal behaviors that take place during sleep. Such disorders include sleepwalking, sleep terrors, sleep talking, and sleep eating. Restless legs syndrome is a neurological condition that involves having uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an irresistible urge to move the legs in order to relieve the sensations. People with this condition may feel tugging, creeping, burning, and crawling sensations in their legs resulting in an excessive movement which then interferes with sleep. Sleep disorders related to other mental disorders as well as sleep disorders related to general medical conditions have been removed from the DSM-5. The latest edition of the DSM also provides more emphasis on coexisting conditions for each of the sleep-wake disorders.﻿ This change, the APA explains, ""underscores that the individual has a sleep disorder warranting independent clinical attention, in addition to any medical and mental disorders that are also present, and acknowledges the bidirectional and interactive effects between sleep disorders and coexisting medical and mental disorders."" Impulse-control disorders are those that involve an inability to control emotions and behaviors, resulting in harm to oneself or others.﻿ These problems with emotional and behavioral regulation are characterized by actions that violate the rights of others such as destroying property or physical and/or those that conflict with societal norms, authority figures, and laws.

Symptoms usually go away within a few day's following a woman's period. : This condition occurs when an individual experiences symptoms of a depressive disorder either while using alcohol or other substances or while going through withdrawal from a substance. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition: This condition is diagnosed when a person's medical history suggests that their depressive symptoms may be the result of a medical condition.

Neurocognitive disorders are characterized by acquired deficits in cognitive function.﻿ These disorders do not include those in which impaired cognition was present at birth or early in life. Types of cognitive disorders include: Delirium is also known as acute confusional state.

7355cbdb-cec7-4ca2-9606-8da5451610e1,"> > The Therapist’s Guide To Recognizing Bipolar Disorder The Therapist’s Guide To Recognizing Bipolar Disorder is the name given to a group of mental health problems that cause fluctuations in mood and behavior. Everyone experiences variations in their mood but in bipolar the highs and lows are extreme and are beyond what would be considered normal for that person. The changes in mood can be extremely distressing: a recent review of the first-person accounts of people with bipolar disorder revealed profound experiences of loss, stigma, uncertainty, and despair. Patients described how threatening it feels to receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, worry about relapsing, and the severe impacts bipolar disorder can have upon relationships and their ability to function [1]. An illustration of manic, hypomanic, and depressive mood episodes in bipolar disorder. The highs of bipolar disorder are called ‘manic’ or ‘hypomanic’ episodes and the lows are called ‘depressive’ episodes. The term ‘bipolar’ just refers to the way that mood can change between the two extremes and different types of bipolar disorder are diagnosed depending upon which combination of mood states are experienced. People with bipolar disorder experience increased rates of mortality – the World Health Organisation estimates that they are 35-100% higher than the general population [2], and up to 15% of people with bipolar end their own lives [3]. One critical problem is that many individuals with bipolar disorder experience extremely long delays before receiving formal diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The average delay from first presentation to a medical professional until receiving a diagnosis of bipolar disorder is nine years [4]. It is therefore essential that clinicians feel confident in recognizing bipolar symptoms in order to minimize this delay. Jeremy often has periods where he feels low and uninterested in the things that normally get him excited. When his mood is low, he isolates himself from his friends and withdraws from the world. Jeremy also experiences periods where he feels on top of the world and capable of anything. When he was eighteen he went through a period where he struggled very badly with suicidal thoughts. He spoke to his doctor, expressing his particular concern about his suicidal ideation, and was diagnosed with depression. It was only five years later, after his hypomanic episodes were recognized by a specialist, that Jeremy was diagnosed with bipolar II. Even expert clinicians experience difficulties in recognizing and treating bipolar disorder: It is difficult for clinicians to differentiate bipolar from unipolar depression. One survey of bipolar patients indicated that 69% were misdiagnosed, with the most frequent misdiagnosis being [5]. There is a reporting bias towards depressive episodes, and depression symptoms occur more frequently than manic or hypomanic episodes. Clients are more likely to present to services during depressed periods than during hypomanic or manic episodes, and individuals with bipolar often spend more of their lives in a depressed, rather than manic or hypomanic state [6, 7]. Symptoms of bipolar are particularly difficult to recognize in adolescents and children because fluctuations in mood and energy are more common at this life stage [8]. The DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnostic manuals differ in the way that they classify bipolar disorders. Non-expert clinicians often report that diagnosis of bipolar are among the most complex to make. Symptoms of are often misdiagnosed as bipolar. A study of patients with BPD revealed that almost 40% had been misdiagnosed, with bipolar disorder being a frequent misdiagnosis [9]. If hallucinations are present, then bipolar presentations are much more likely to be misdiagnosed as another condition. Clinicians often use heuristic ‘short-cuts’ to arrive at diagnoses, and hallucinations which can be a part of bipolar disorder can lead to misdiagnosis [10]. Given all of these complexities it is unsurprising that non-specialists struggle to . Our goal is to help you to understand the important features of bipolar disorder and to overcome some of the common pitfalls that clinicians face when assessing clients who report symptoms of bipolar. Diagnoses of bipolar and related disorders are made based on the presence of episodes of hypomania, mania, or depression. In order to confidently identify bipolar, it is essential that clinicians understand the ‘ingredients’ which comprise the different bipolar diagnoses. It would be a mistake to think that ‘normal’ moods are steady. We all have moods that fluctuate – some days we feel motivated, energetic, and ready to engage with the world, and other days we just want to curl up and hide away. Many of these fluctuations happen in response to things that are happening in our lives, but our moods can fluctuate with the seasons, our health, or our hormonal cycle [11, 12] . Someone having a manic episode might feel euphoric with a great sense of well-being, confident and adventurous, have an increase in sexual energy, and feel excited as though they can’t express ideas quickly enough. The way we feel affects the way we act, so when someone having a manic episode feels this way they are prone to behave in ways that are unusual for them such as being more outgoing or talkative, being much more active than normal, sleeping much less than before, being rude or aggressive, or even taking risks with their safety. At the severe end of a manic episode, some people experience psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations. They may for example develop odd beliefs with concerns that they are being watched or followed, or that they understand things that other people don’t. Someone having a manic episode might see or hear things that other people can’t. Manic episodes can be very serious and in some cases may require hospitalization. A hypomanic episode is essentially a milder version of a manic episode. The mood and behavior changes seen in a hypomanic episode are not as extreme and they often do not last as long as a manic episode, although the emotional and behavioural changes are still definitely abnormal for the individual. Hypomanic episodes can feel more manageable than manic episodes and may not interfere so much with daily life, although other people may notice changes in the individual’s behavior. Everyone has periods of low mood and these are especially common when we experience losses or struggle with other challenges in our lives. According to formal diagnostic criteria, a depressive episode is more severe and persists for longer than normal downward fluctuations in our mood. A depressive episode is a two-week period where five or more of the following depressive symptoms are present: a depressed mood, diminished interest in activities, lack of energy or fatigue, sleep disturbances, suicidal thoughts or behavior, loss of confidence or feelings of worthlessness, or psychomotor agitation. A mixed episode is a mixture of depressive and manic / hypomanic symptoms, or a rapid alternation between them. Individuals with bipolar often report that these are the most difficult episodes to cope with as they can be highly unpredictable and confusing for the individual to process. Symptoms of manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes. Diagnoses of bipolar disorder are made by identifying different combinations of the ‘ingredients’ of manic, hypomanic, depressive, and mixed episodes. The DSM-5’s categorizations of ‘bipolar I’, ‘bipolar II’ and ‘cyclothymia’ form the most up-to-date diagnostic classification [12] with the ICD-10 using the alternative terminology of ‘bipolar affective disorder’ [14]. it is likely however that there will be more concordance between the two diagnostic systems with the publication of the ICD-11. A diagnosis of bipolar I requires one lifetime manic episode to have occurred. Only a minority (around 5-16%) of those with bipolar I exhibit ‘unipolar’ mania and a much more common presentation is manic episodes ‘bookended’ by depressive or hypomanic episodes [15]. Bipolar II requires at least one lifetime hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode to have occurred. The occurrence of a manic episode is an exclusion criterion for a diagnosis of bipolar II and some clients find that their diagnosis of bipolar II is changed to bipolar I during the course of their illness. Bipolar II is commonly misdiagnosed as unipolar depression since detection of a hypomanic episode can be more difficult than a manic episode due to its less severe impact on functioning [15, 6, 16]. Cyclothymic disorder, or cyclothymia, is a chronic fluctuating mood disorder with numerous periods of mild hypomanic and mild depressive symptoms that are distinct from one another. Diagnostic criteria require that the periods must never have been severe enough to meet the full criteria for a hypomanic, manic, or depressive episode thus making it more difficult to recognize than bipolar disorder. Because of this, cyclothymic disorder frequently goes undiagnosed [17]. Instead of bipolar I and bipolar II the ICD-10 recognizes ‘bipolar affective disorder’. For a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder at least two lifetime episodes (manic, hypomanic, depressive, or mixed) must have occurred with at least one being manic or hypomanic. The diagnosis is typically sub-categorized according to the current affective episode the individual is experiencing. Bipolar disorder is associated with significant comorbidity. In particular, there is substantial overlap between bipolar disorder and . Rate of alcohol and substance misuse have been reported to be as high as 69%, with average rates thought to be around 30%. Rates of , , and  are also much higher than typical background levels [18]. Improving recognition of bipolar disorder in your clinical practice Ruling out bipolar disorders should be a routine part of the workup for all patients who present acutely with depressive symptoms or who report a history of depression Accurately diagnosing bipolar disorder in clinical practice can be difficult. Given the high rates of misdiagnosis it is incumbent upon clinicians to do all they can to familiarize themselves with the condition. Here are some practical steps you can take to help you to identify symptoms of bipolar disorder in your clients. Recognize that bipolar is often misdiagnosed as unipolar depression. Just knowing how frequently bipolar disorder is misdiagnosed means that you are more likely to ask the essential disambiguating questions that will allow you to accurately conceptualize your client’s difficulties. Familiarize yourself with the ‘ingredients’ and full diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. Research indicates that clinicians use heuristic biases (mental ‘short cuts’) which can lead to misdiagnosis [19]. Know that client reports of ‘frequent ups and downs’ are the most powerful predictor of bipolar disorder. Taking the time to explore what your clients mean when they describe having ‘ups and downs’ is an important way that you can understand what they are struggling with [20]. Use specific questions to explore whether your client has a history of mania, for example “would you say that you are one of those people who have frequent ups and downs?”. Explore even minor symptoms which point towards mania such as elevated mood, irritability, or racing thoughts [20]. Consider your client’s response to previous treatment. Patients with bipolar disorder may respond less effectively to anti-depressants than those with unipolar depression [7, 16]. Look at the history of your client’s illness. It is more common for those with bipolar to experience depressive symptoms at an earlier age [7]. Ask about life complications. Highly turbulent or complicated lives such as multiple marriages, or bankruptcy may indicate bipolarity [7]. Ask about their family history of bipolar as well as other mental health disorders such as schizophrenia which are a risk factor for bipolar disorder [7]. Structured interviews are the most reliable way to obtain a bipolar diagnosis [21] but some self-report measures may be helpful. The (GBI [22]) and the (MDQ [22]) are both recommended [24].

What can children and teens expect from treatment? How does bipolar disorder affect caregivers and families? Can children and teens with bipolar disorder have other problems? What can children and teens expect from treatment? How does bipolar disorder affect caregivers and families? Does your child go through extreme changes in mood and behavior? Does your child get much more excited or much more irritable than other kids? Do you notice that your child goes through cycles of extreme highs and lows more often than other children? Do these mood changes affect how your child acts at school or at home? Some children and teens with these symptoms may have , a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and day-to-day functioning. With treatment, children and teens with bipolar disorder can get better over time. Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that causes people to experience noticeable, sometimes extreme, changes in mood and behavior. Sometimes children with bipolar disorder feel very happy or “up” and are much more energetic and active than usual. This is called a . Sometimes children with bipolar disorder feel very sad or “down” and are much less active than usual. This is called a . Bipolar disorder, which used to be called manic-depressive illness or manic depression, is not the same as the normal ups and downs every child goes through. The mood changes in bipolar disorder are more extreme, often unprovoked, and accompanied by changes in sleep, energy level, and the ability to think clearly. Bipolar symptoms can make it hard for young people to perform well in school or to get along with friends and family members. Some children and teens with bipolar disorder may try to hurt themselves or attempt suicide. Most people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder in adolescence or adulthood, but the symptoms can appear earlier in childhood. Bipolar disorder is often episodic, but it usually lasts a lifetime. Signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder may overlap with symptoms of other disorders that are common in young people, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct problems, major depression, and anxiety disorders. Diagnosing bipolar disorder can be complicated and requires a careful and thorough evaluation by a trained, experienced mental health professional. With treatment, children and teens with bipolar disorder can manage their symptoms and lead successful lives. The exact causes of bipolar disorder are unknown, but several factors may contribute to the illness. For example, researchers are beginning to uncover genetic mechanisms that are linked to bipolar disorder and other mental disorders. Research shows that people’s chance of having bipolar disorder is higher if they have a close family member with the illness, which may be because they have the same genetic variations. However, just because one family member has bipolar disorder, it does not mean that other members of the family will have it. Many genes are involved in the disorder, and no single gene causes it. Research also suggests that adversity, trauma, and stressful life events may increase the chances of developing bipolar disorder in people with a genetic risk of having the illness. Some research studies have found differences in brain structure and function between people who have bipolar disorder and those who do not. Researchers are studying the disorder to learn more about its causes and effective treatments. Mood episodes in bipolar disorder include intense emotions along with significant changes in sleep habits, activity levels, thoughts, or behaviors. A person with bipolar disorder may have manic episodes, depressive episodes, or “mixed” episodes. A mixed episode has both manic and depressive symptoms. These mood episodes cause symptoms that often last for several days or weeks. During an episode, the symptoms last every day for most of the day. These mood and activity changes are very different from the child’s usual behavior and from the behavior of healthy children and teens. Show intense happiness or silliness for long periods of time. Have a very short temper or seem extremely irritable. Have trouble staying focused, and experience racing thoughts. Seem overly interested or involved in pleasurable but risky activities. Do risky or reckless things that show poor judgment. Children and teens having a may: Complain a lot about pain, such as stomachaches and headaches. Have difficulty communicating or maintaining relationships. Have little energy and no interest in activities they usually enjoy. Can children and teens with bipolar disorder have other problems? Young people with bipolar disorder can have several problems at the same time. These include: Young people with bipolar disorder are at risk of misusing alcohol or drugs. Children and teens who have both bipolar disorder and ADHD may have trouble staying focused. Children and teens with bipolar disorder also may have an anxiety disorder. Sometimes extreme behaviors go along with mood episodes. During manic episodes, young people with bipolar disorder may take extreme risks that they wouldn’t usually take or that could cause them harm or injury. During depressive episodes, some young people with bipolar disorder may think about running away from home or have thoughts of suicide. If your child shows signs of suicidal thinking, take these signs seriously and call your child’s health care provider. If you think your child is in crisis and needs immediate help, call 911. You also can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Lifeline) at 1‑800‑273‑TALK (8255), or text the Crisis Text Line (text HELLO to 741741). The deaf and hard of hearing can contact the Lifeline via TTY at 1-800-799-4889. These services are confidential, free, and available 24/7. A health care provider will ask questions about your child’s mood, sleeping patterns, energy levels, and behavior. There are no blood tests or brain scans that can diagnose bipolar disorder. However, the health care provider may use tests to see if something other than bipolar disorder is causing your child’s symptoms. Sometimes health care providers need to know about medical conditions in the family, such as depression or substance use. Other disorders have symptoms like those of bipolar disorder, including ADHD, disruptive mood regulation disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and anxiety disorders. It also can be challenging to distinguish bipolar disorder from depression that occurs without mania, which is referred to as “major depression.” A health care provider who specializes in working with children and teens can make a careful and complete evaluation of your child’s symptoms to provide the right diagnosis. Children and teens can work with their health care provider to develop a treatment plan that will help them manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. It is important to follow the treatment plan, even when your child is not currently experiencing a mood episode. Steady, dependable treatment works better than treatment that starts and stops. Several types of medication can help treat symptoms of bipolar disorder. Children respond to medications in different ways, so the right type of medication depends on the child. This means children may need to try different types of medication to see which one works best for them. Some children may need more than one type of medication because their symptoms are complex. Children should take the fewest number of medications and the smallest doses possible to help their symptoms. A good way to remember this is “start low, go slow.” Medications can cause side effects. Always tell your child’s health care provider about any problems with side effects. Do not stop giving your child medication without speaking to a health care provider. Stopping medication suddenly can be dangerous and can make bipolar symptoms worse. Different kinds of psychosocial therapy can help children and their families manage the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Therapies that are based on scientific research—including cognitive behavioral approaches and family-focused therapy—can provide support, education, and guidance to youth and their families. These therapies teach skills that can help people manage bipolar disorder, including skills for maintaining routines, enhancing emotion regulation, and improving social interactions. What can children and teens expect from treatment? With treatment, children and teens with bipolar disorder can get better over time. Treatment is more effective when health care providers, parents, and young people work together. Sometimes a child’s symptoms may change, or disappear and then come back. When this happens, your child’s health care provider may recommend changes to the treatment plan. Treatment can take time, but sticking with the treatment plan can help young people manage their symptoms and reduce the likelihood of future episodes. Your child’s health care provider may recommend keeping a daily life chart or mood chart to track your child’s moods, behaviors, and sleep patterns. This may make it easier to track the illness and see whether treatment is working. Help begins with the right diagnosis and treatment. Talk to your family health care provider about any symptoms you notice. If your child has bipolar disorder, here are some basic things you can do: Encourage your child to talk, and listen to your child carefully. Pay attention to your child’s moods, and be alert to any major changes. Understand triggers, and learn strategies for managing intense emotions and irritability. Remember that treatment takes time: sticking with the treatment plan can help your child get better and stay better. Help your child understand that treatment can make life better. How does bipolar disorder affect caregivers and families? Caring for a child or teenager with bipolar disorder can be stressful for parents and families. Coping with a child’s mood episodes and other problems—such as short tempers and risky behaviors—can challenge any caregiver. It is important that caregivers take care of themselves, too. Find someone you can talk to or consult your health care provider about support groups. Finding support and strategies for managing stress can help you and your child. If you’re not sure where to get help, your doctor, pediatrician, or other family health care provider is a good place to start. A health care provider can refer you to a qualified mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, who has experience treating bipolar disorder and can evaluate your child’s symptoms. You can learn more about getting help and finding a health care provider on the National Institute of Mental Health website. Hospital health care providers can help in an emergency. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has an online tool to help you find mental health services in your area.

While there are many types of depressive disorders, the most common types in children are major depressive disorder (MDD), persistent depressive disorder (PDD), and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). Depressive episodes are also a key feature of bipolar disorder in children. The good news is that are treatable. If you recognize the signs and symptoms in your child, a mental health professional can work with you and your family to find the right treatment plan to reduce symptoms and increase your child's quality of life. Here is a look at the different types of depressive disorders in children, along with the symptoms, causes, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and coping tips. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe condition in which a child experiences episodes of depression. Most teens have symptoms that last for at least two weeks. According to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), symptoms of childhood depression can include: Additionally, children with MDD may exhibit symptoms of anxiety, like shyness, fear, and unexplained physical complaints. Approximately 2% to 3% of children under age 10 meet the criteria for MDD, but between the ages of 10 and 14, the rate increases to 5% to 8% for children overall. Approximately twice as many girls will experience depression as boys by age 15. Prior to , boys have a higher rate of depression than girls. Recovery rates for MDD are high for children who receive treatment. However, so are recurrent episodes of depression. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) suggests early identification and , given the short- and long-term consequences, such as poor , substance misuse, risk-taking, poor academic performance, poor social development, and risk of suicide. , formerly known as dysthymia or dysthymic disorder, is a chronic but milder mood disorder than MDD. For adults, symptoms of depression must be experienced more often than not for at least two years to be diagnosed with PDD. For children, the requirement is lowered to one year. Children with PDD are more functional than children with MDD. Despite their symptoms, children with PDD can usually attend school and participate in activities that some children with MDD may not be able to. Children with PDD may have lived with depression for so long that they believe their depressed state is ""normal."" Parents or others close to the child may just think that they have a shy or introverted personality rather than a depressive disorder. Symptoms of PDD in children are similar to symptoms of MDD but less severe. The rate of PDD in children is 3%. According to a study published in the in 2008, 75% of those children go on to experience MDD.﻿ The combination of MDD and PDD is considered ""double depression."" Recovery rates for PDD are high in children, especially with appropriate treatment. Again, so are relapses. The same 2008 study found that relapse rates for PDD were approximately 70% over 10 years in children.﻿ Additionally, it was reported that the longer a child lives with PDD, the more likely they are to experience MDD. Added to the DSM-5, for children up to 18 years of age, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a condition characterized by extreme anger and irritability and frequent, intense temper outbursts. This pattern of behavior is beyond a child who is ""moody"" or who throws ""temper tantrums."" Instead, children display a pattern of abnormal, episodic, and frequently violent and uncontrollable social behavior without provocation. Symptoms of DMDD include irritable or angry mood most of the day (nearly every day), severe temper outbursts (three or more times per week), and trouble functioning due to irritability at home, school, or with peers. To be diagnosed, a child must exhibit these symptoms steadily for 12 or more months. The onset for DMDD is typically age 10, and children under 6 or over 18 can't be diagnosed with it. Since DMDD is a relatively new diagnosis, treatment is based on what has been proven to work to alleviate symptoms of MDD as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, and . An Overview of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder Depression can occur as part of bipolar disorder. This is a condition in which the child experiences manic or hypomanic as well as depressive episodes. There is some controversy over the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children because it is often misdiagnosed. The onset for bipolar disorder is typically late adolescence or early adulthood but can occur in young children. Symptoms of bipolar disorder in young children are different than in adults: Children before age 9 may show irritability and , increased or repetitive movements, paranoia, and psychotic symptoms. After the age of 9, the symptoms are similar to adults with bipolar disorder: elation or overly excited state; risk-taking; ability to function on little or no sleep; racing thoughts; fast or loud talking; disorganization; and exaggerated sense of abilities or accomplishments. Bipolar disorder occurs in 1% to 3% of adolescents and rates have increased forty-fold in the last decade, according to the NIMH. Treatment is always needed for children with bipolar disorder given its serious consequences, like poor academic performance, disturbed personal relationships, substance misuse, and suicide. Medication can be helpful in stabilizing a child's mood, but the disorder is often a lifetime disorder. There are various types of depressive disorders, and each can have a different impact on a child's life. In general, however, depressive disorders can cause sadness and irritability and make it difficult for children to keep up with daily tasks and demands of life and result in poor school performance, withdrawal from friends and family, and risky or delinquent acts. Depression often looks different in children compared to adults. How Teenage Depression Differs From Adult Depression No one knows the exact causes of depressive disorders in children, but a variety of factors seem to contribute, including genetics and chemical imbalances in the brain. Past trauma, sexual abuse, poor childhood relationships with parents, and a history of a can also trigger depression, especially if there's a family history. If you think your child may have a depressive disorder (or any other mental health issue), schedule an appointment with your child's pediatrician. The physician may run several blood tests to (such as infectious mononucleosis, thyroid disorders, drug use, etc.) that can cause or mimic symptoms of depression and refer you to a mental health treatment provider for a complete evaluation. There isn’t a that diagnosis depressive disorders. During your visit, it's important to offer as much information as you can about your child's mental health background and current symptoms, including mood, sleep patterns, energy levels, and behavior. This will allow the doctor to make an . Treatment for a depressive disorder may require adjustments over time and involve a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. A therapist may educate your child about their particular depressive disorder and may offer coping strategies to help manage the symptoms. Therapy may include cognitive behavioral therapy, supportive counseling, or interpersonal therapy as well as family therapy to address relationship issues, behavior management problems, and strategies to help the entire family cope. Treatment that involves the child, family, doctor, and school often works best, so it's important to attend your child's therapy appointments, ask questions, and communicate with their school and other treatment providers. Your therapist or psychiatrist may even ask you to log your child's progress to determine what's working and what's not. If your child is a safety risk (thoughts of suicide, a suicide attempt, self-harm, hallucinations, self-injury), a stay in a may be required. A psychiatrist may prescribe a stimulant, antidepressant, or atypical antipsychotic medication to stabilize your child's mood. Finding the right medication and the right dosage may take some time as there isn’t a single medication that works best for everyone. It’s important to monitor your child’s medication and be on the lookout for side effects. Make sure to call your doctor immediately if your child is exhibiting or suicidal behavior while taking an antidepressant. All antidepressants carry an of an increased risk in suicidal thinking for those under age 25, particularly in the first few weeks of starting treatment. Benefits of Antidepressants Can Outweigh the Risks Helping your child to make nutrition, regular exercise, proper sleep, and stress management part of their everyday lives can also help alleviate some of the symptoms of depressive disorders. It's also important for you to set a good example by making these healthy lifestyle habits part of your daily living, too. Depressive disorders impact the entire family, so it’s important for the parents, caregivers, and siblings to learn as much as they can about depressive disorders. This will ensure that everyone knows what to expect and what warning signs to watch for. Work closely with your child's mental health professional and be sure to ask questions and stay up-to-date on the latest treatment options. At some point, your child may , and it's important to validate their feelings and talk about why following the doctors' recommendations and sticking to their individualized treatment plan will increase their chances of feeling better. Taking time to take care of yourself will also help you better cope. Raising a child with a depressive disorder is stressful and challenging and you'll need emotional support and practical advice along the way. Consider joining a with children with mental illness. If you notice symptoms of a depressive disorder in your child, be willing to talk about it with your child and do your best to remain supportive and non-judgemental. While it can be terrifying to hear that your child has a depressive diorder, it is not a ""life sentence."" Early interventions can help kids get back on track before symptoms take a serious toll on their life and ability to function. Everything feels more challenging when you're dealing with depression.

If your perception of the illness is mainly shaped by pop culture depictions like Carrie’s counterterrorist exploits on then spoiler alert: The reality of bipolar disorder is much more nuanced than it may seem. Keep reading to learn 14 key facts about bipolar disorder that everyone should know. 1. Bipolar disorder is a mental illness characterized by dramatic shifts in mood and behavior. These shifts are referred to as “mood episodes,” according to the (NIMH). There are two main types of episodes: manic episodes and depressive episodes. (Hence why bipolar disorder used to be referred to as manic depression.) In between these episodes, a person with bipolar disorder may have periods without symptoms of either mania or depression. 2. Bipolar depressive episodes tend to look a lot like classic depression. Without knowing somebody’s medical history, it’s virtually impossible to determine whether their depression is the result of bipolar disorder or something like , , M.D., director of the Psychosis Program in the department of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF. But in general, the highlights these as the signs and symptoms of a bipolar depressive episode: Severe episodes of depression can also involve involving delusions or hallucinations, the notes. 3. Manic episodes are more complicated than simply being “up.” Experiencing doesn’t necessarily mean a person is running around feeling invincible and happy, says Dr. Malaspina. As the explains, there are many different signs and symptoms of mania: Engaging in risky behavior, such as taking sexual or financial risks you wouldn’t otherwise 4. Hypomania can involve many of the same symptoms of mania but on a less severe scale. “There are very different severities of the mood elevation,” , M.D., director of the Bipolar Disorders Specialty Clinic and an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, tells SELF. At the lower end of the spectrum is , which is when a person doesn’t experience a full-blown manic episode, but only some of the symptoms on a milder scale. “It can seem like useful, goal-oriented energy,” Dr. Malaspina says. Some people only ever experience hypomania, but it’s also possible to experience full mania, which can eventually become dangerous. “You can have too much belief in yourself…[and] very poor judgment,” says Dr. Malaspina. This can contribute to behavior like having unprotected sex or in a business venture, she says. This grandiose thinking can also escalate into delusion. “When someone has mania, they really need to be under a doctor’s care,” Dr. Malaspina says. 5. People can experience symptoms of mania and depression at the same time. These “” involve the high energy and activity of mania and the hopelessness and despair of depression. “That’s a really high-risk situation because people are miserable and they have all this extra energy,” says Dr. Marsh. These episodes are just as or more dangerous and life-threatening than severe mania, Dr. Marsh says, and require immediate care. The symptoms of bipolar disorder can present at different severities and in various combinations in different people, so there are actually four different conditions related to the disorder. Bipolar I consists of manic episodes lasting seven days or more—or manic symptoms that last any amount of time but are severe enough to warrant immediate hospitalization, according to the . Bipolar I typically also comes along with symptoms lasting at least two weeks, or it can cause those mixed episodes that include signs of depression and mania. With bipolar II, people experience depressive episodes along with episodes of hypomania, but not the full mania involved in bipolar I. Then there’s a condition called cyclothymia, which resembles a less severe form of bipolar disorder. People with cyclothymia experience symptoms of hypomania and symptoms of mild depression for at least two years, interspersed with symptom-free periods, but the symptoms aren’t severe enough to qualify as actual hypomanic or depressive episodes. “Cyclothymia has both pieces—a little bit too high and a little bit too low—but never so much that they really appear dysfunctional,” Dr. Malaspina explains. People with untreated cyclothymia are at an increased risk of eventually developing bipolar disorder, though. Finally, someone with symptoms of bipolar disorder that don’t fit neatly into the above buckets can have what is termed Other Specified and Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorders, the explains. 7. The length of these mood episodes can vary from person to person. Two weeks is the set minimum for a depressive episode, according to the but they often stretch out for months, Dr. Marsh says. Mania typically lasts for at least a week. However, “There’s not really a fixed range,” says Dr. Malaspina. 8. There is no known single cause of bipolar disorder. Scientists are still investigating the roots of the disorder, but they have identified three risk factors that contribute to your likelihood of developing the condition, according to the : genetics, brain structure and functioning, and family history. Experts have yet to pinpoint which genes may be involved here and to what extent. Same goes for brain structure and functioning; there’s a lot that’s still to be determined. What’s clearer is that bipolar disorder does tend to run in families, according to the . While most people with a family history of the condition will not develop it, having a parent or sibling with bipolar disorder does increase your odds. 9. It can take a while to receive a proper diagnosis of bipolar disorder, which is often misdiagnosed as depression. People who have bipolar disorder are typically more likely to reach out for help during a episode than a manic or hypomanic one, according to the . (Remember, mania can sometimes feel productive instead of like a problem that needs treatment.) Diagnosing bipolar disorder requires establishing a history of mania and depression, so if all the doctor sees during the first evaluation are signs of depression, a misdiagnosis is not unlikely, Dr. Malaspina says. Even if the person first presents with only symptoms of depression, a good clinician that sees them regularly should be able to recognize the mania over time and reassess their original diagnosis, Dr. Malaspina says. 10. Children and teenagers can have bipolar disorder too. Most people who have the condition develop it in their late teenage or early adult years, according to the . However, younger teenagers and children can develop it, too. Diagnosis can be even more difficult in children and teenagers because their symptoms may not fully fit the diagnostic criteria, according to the . Children and adolescents with bipolar disorder also often have co-occurring mental or behavioral health conditions, like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder , that make teasing out a bipolar diagnosis trickier. Finally, it can be hard to determine when mood swings and changes in activity level are simply part of growing up or something more. Specialized child psychiatrists can be helpful in these cases. 11. Treatment almost always involves medication, but effective drugs and dosages vary widely by individual. The main goal of medication is to stabilize a person’s mood over time in order to minimize the number of manic and depressive episodes they experience, says Dr. Malaspina. There are several kinds of medication that have been shown to be effective for bipolar disorder in various ways. Mood stabilizers work by decreasing the amount of abnormal activity in the brain, according to the . is a common one. Anticonvulsant or antiseizure medications, first developed to treat disorders like epilepsy, are also sometimes used as mood stabilizers. Another class of medications prescribed for bipolar disorder is antipsychotics to treat mania (during which psychotic episodes can occur), according to the . Some people will also benefit from antidepressants to manage the lower moods associated with bipolar disorder. However, antidepressants , Dr. Malaspina says. They are typically paired with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic or administered as a drug that works as both an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, according to the . Some people benefit from short-term use of antianxiety medications as well. Some of these medications are better at treating depressive or manic episodes, so combinations are often most effective, Dr. Malaspina says. Figuring out the best mix can be challenging at first, but people who work closely with their doctors will almost always find the right balance, Dr. Malaspina says, though the medicines may need to be adjusted over time. 12. Bipolar disorder medications can affect pregnancy and birth control. People with bipolar disorder who plan on becoming (or who already are pregnant) should talk to their doctors. Medications can , and various drugs used to treat bipolar disorder have been linked to an increased risk of birth defects, according to the . Additionally, certain bipolar disorder medications such as antiepilepsy drugs . Talk to your doctor if you’re taking medications for bipolar disorder and trying to . 13. Therapy can help people cope with bipolar disorder in a few different ways. can help people come to terms with the disparate ways they behaved during mood episodes, especially when someone first receives a diagnosis, Dr. Malaspina explains. “So many people have been suffering for years before they get the bipolar diagnosis, and some people will have made decisions based on a [manic or depressive] mood.” With the proper diagnosis and an understanding of their disorder, therapy can help someone reframe their experiences and self-understanding. Seeing a can also help people manage the stressors in their lives that may aggravate their condition, Dr. Malaspina says, and allow them to “catch” a mood episode before it gets more severe. 14. People with bipolar disorder can and do lead happy, healthy lives. There is no doubt that living with bipolar disorder presents its challenges. But it’s equally true that with proper treatment, people can achieve stability and happiness. “It’s something you get help for as if you had diabetes,” Dr. Malaspina says. “With care and time, people can do much, much better.” This Is What It's Actually Like to Live With Bipolar Disorder My Bipolar Disorder Makes Me Want to Spend Money I Don’t Have Carolyn covers all things health and nutrition at SELF.

While the three main states of mood disorders are depressive (depressed mood), manic (elevated mood) and bipolar (a mix of depressed and elevated moods), there are many types and subtypes of mood disorders that vary in intensity. Mood disorder statistics help paint a picture of the scope and severity of mood disorders. Current mood disorder statistics are changing as new studies are continually being carried out. The numbers and statistics provided in this article aim to reflect the most current studies available. As time goes on, these numbers may change as new research warrants. Statistics on Mood Disorders Treatment and Prognosis Estimates show that have a mental illness, mood disorders included. Around Americans adults aged 18 and older have a mood disorder. Data from the reveals the prevalence of mood disorders, showing that: Among U.S. adults 18 and older, around 9.7% had a mood disorder in the past year The prevalence of mood disorders in a given year was higher for females (11.6%) than males (7.7%) An estimated 21.4% of adults will experience a mood disorder at some point in their life 45% of those with a mood disorder will face severe impairment Mood disorders can affect anyone at any point in life. Many factors can contribute to the development of mood disorders, and while some of the population may appear more vulnerable, no ethnic or age group is left out.  Here are some statistics on mood disorder demographics: A showed that women had a higher prevalence (22.3%) of mental illness compared to men (15.1%) Depression is in women than men, with nearly of women experiencing a depressive episode at least once in their life More women (47.6%)  with mental illness received treatment compared to men (34.8%), according to a Women with bipolar disorder have higher rates of depressive episodes and are more likely than men to receive a misdiagnosis of unipolar depression instead of bipolar disorder Men are more likely to have a with depression than women Men appear to be less willing than women to discuss mental health problems or seek help Men may be more likely to exhibit in mood disorders such as depression Half of start by the age of 14, and 75% develop by the age of 24 Young have a higher prevalence of mental illness but a lower incidence of seeking treatment compared to older adults By the age of 18, 14.3% of adolescents will have experienced a mood disorder Mood disorders are broken down into different types based on a thorough evaluation of symptoms. Some common types of mood disorders and occurrences include: The most common among mood disorders in the U.S. is major depressive disorder. Approximately reported having at least one major depressive episode within the past year Currently, of US adults will experience bipolar disorder at some point in their life SAD affects 10 million Americans. More than half of people with SAD have a family member with a depressive disorder, and the condition is four times more common in women than men. Around 90% of women experience PMS symptoms, 20–50% experience moderate to severe symptoms, and meet the criteria for PMDD The lifetime prevalence of cyclothymic disorder is around in the U.S. While the condition occurs equally among women and men, women suffering from cyclothymic disorder are more apt to seek treatment. This form of chronic depression affects an estimated of the U.S. adult population. Of those who suffer from dysthymia, report serious impairment. Mood disorders can occur alone or alongside other health conditions. Certain physical illnesses may be worsened or precipitated by a mood disorder. Some of the most common related health conditions that may be seen alongside mood disorders include: Mood and can appear similar, as symptoms may overlap. For instance, a person with a can experience symptoms of depression, bipolar, and substance abuse problems. Research shows that people with high blood pressure are more susceptible to other cardiovascular diseases and can experience a lower quality of life, making them more at risk for psychological distress, including depression. One study linked depression and high blood pressure, concluding that 21.3% of people with high blood pressure had depressive symptoms. Depression and physical illness are commonly seen together, as prolonged physical illness can trigger or increase the risk for depression. Common physical illnesses that can trigger depression and symptoms of depression include stroke, heart disease, chronic pain syndromes, and chronic fatigue. Emotional disturbances or fluctuations are common in the early diagnosis of MS. While is the most common mood disorder manifestation, MS and bipolar occurrence is also well-established. are commonly seen together. Clinicians note that some people with mood disorders self-medicate with drugs or to combat unwanted mood disorder symptoms. Other people’s genes may make them more vulnerable to first-time drug use that leads to chronic abuse, which can eventually cause changes in the brain that lead to mood disorders. Regardless of the cause, it’s clear that there is a strong correlation between . Research shows that: Among those seeking dependence, around 20–67% had experienced depression and 6–8% had experienced bipolar disorder at some point in their lives Among those seeking , around 30–40% experienced depression and 10–30% experienced bipolar disorder at some point in their lives Individuals with depression are twice as likely to have a substance abuse problem People with bipolar disorder are seven times as likely to have a substance abuse problem in comparison to individuals with no mood disorders Having a mood disorder dramatically increases a person’s suicide risk. This fact, along with current statistics, makes seeking treatment a matter of urgency: Mood disorders account for one-half to two-thirds of all suicides Up to 90% of those who die from suicide have an underlying mental illness People with anxiety or depression have a 60% higher mortality rate and die an average of 8 years earlier than those without these conditions During major depressive episodes, suicide attempts increase 20–40 fold The lists depression, the most prevalent mood disorder, as the leading cause of disability worldwide. Mood disorders impact one’s ability to function in daily life and affect work performance, productivity and attendance. Mood disorder costs are complex and include direct costs for health care, medication, physician visits, and hospitalization, and indirect costs, like productivity losses, early retirement, income loss, mortality, and care-seeking. Data from a 2010 report estimates that the global direct and indirect costs for mental disorders accumulated to $2.5 trillion. Another approach estimating the same economic burden of mental disorders in 2010 estimated the worldwide cost of to be $8.5 trillion. Mental health disorders account for more economic costs than cancer or diabetes, and the cost is expected to double until 2030. In America alone, the cost of mental illness amounts to in lost earnings per year. A on federal disability revealed that 1,304,851 people with mood disorders received disability benefits. Statistics on Mood Disorders Treatment and Prognosis Mood disorders may make their first appearance early on in adolescence or teen years. However, is not usually received until several years later. According to the : Only 62.9% of adults who had a severe mental illness received treatment in the past year Only 41% of adults with a mental health condition received treatment in the past year Compared to Caucasians, African Americans and Hispanics used mental health services at half the rate, and Asians at one-third the rate. Hospitalization for any condition, including mood disorders, is intensive and expensive. The rates for mood disorders hospitalizations has steadily been climbing. Mood disorders are the leading cause of hospitalizations in children age 13 to 17 In 2014, nearly of all hospitalizations were associated with mental illness or substance abuse In 2014, the number of for mood disorders increased to 851,100, up by 23.2% compared to 2005 The prognosis for mood disorders is good, especially because doctors have a much better understanding of types and subtypes of mood disorders, including that could hinder treatment response.

32272d4d-efd6-4056-9005-7dc0c70e1f82,"A syndrome marked by a clinically significant disturbance in an individuals cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior Homosexuality was once classified by the American Psychiatric Association as a psychological disorder, When did this change and why? On december 10th 1973 The American Psychiatric Association no longer classified homosexuality as a psycological disorder because they no longer viewed same-sex attraction as a psychological problem, such as the power of shifting societal beliefs. A lawyer is distressed by feeling the need to wash his hands 100 times a day. He has no time to meet with clients, and his colleagues are wondering about his competence. His behavior would probably be labeled disordered, because it is ___________ - that is, it interferes with his everyday life. aims to reform hospitals into patient-friendly and humane places with minimum restrains, launched by the World Health Organization approach for mental health treatment influenced by Reformers such as Phillip Pinel based on the idea that curing illness requires ""moral treatment"", including boosting patient's morale by unchaining them and talking with them. He and others worked to replace brutality with gentleness, isolation with activity, and filth with clean air and sunshine the concept that diseases, in this case psychological disorders, have physical causes that can be diagnosed, treated, and in most cases, cured, often through treatment in a hospitalassumes that mental illness is diagnosed on the basis of its symptoms. It needs to be treated through therapy, which may include time in a psychiatric hospital the study of environmental influences on gene expression that occur without a DNA change They are more like, but are not destined to develop the same disorders. Their varying environmental factors influence whether certain culprit genes are expressed Why do identical twins (with the same genes) do not share the same risks of developing psychological disorders? Some psychological disorders are culture-specific. For example, depression and schizophrenia are universal. Where as anorexia nervosa occurs mostly in North American cultures where food is abundant, and taijin-kyofusho ( social anxiety about their appearance, combined with a readiness to blush and a fear of eye contact) appears largely in Japan. Are psychological disorders universal, or are they culture specific? Explain with examples. emphasized that biological, psychological, and social-cultural influences combine to produce psychological disorders. This broad perspective helps us understand that our well-being is affected by our genes, brain functioning, inner thoughts and feelings, and the influences of our social and cultural environment What is the Biopsychosocial approach, and why is it important in our understanding of psychological disorders? - evolution- individual genes- brain structure and chemistry What are biological influences of psychological disorders? - stress - trauma - learned helplessness - mood-related perceptions and memories What are psychological influences of psychological disorders? - roles- expectations - definitions of normality and disorder What are social-cultural influences of psychological disorders? The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth-Edition; a widely used system for classifying psychological disorders. It contains diagnostic labels and descriptions that provide a common language and shared concepts for communication and research.physicians and mental health workers use the detailed ""diagnostic criteria and codes"" to guide medical diagnostics and treatment. - predict the disorders future course - suggest appropriate treatment- prompt research into its causes What does diagnostic classification in psychiatry and psychology aim to do? Sally meets in the DSM-5 meets all of criteria listed below. What psychological disorder is she being diagnosed with?- Feeling unsatisfied with amount or quality of sleep ( trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or returning to sleep) - Sleep disruption causes distress or diminished everyday functioning - Happens three or more nights each week - Occurs during at least three consecutive months - Happens even with sufficient sleep opportunities - independant from substance use or abuse- independant from other mental disorders or medical conditions critics believe that the DSM editions have become to detailed and extensive. Others view DSM diagnoses as arbitrary labels that create preconceptions that which bias perceptions of the labeled person's past an present behavior - Autism and Asperger's syndrome have now been combine under the label ""autism spectrum disorder""- Mental retardation has become ""intellectual disability- Hoarding disorder and binge-eating disorder, have been added. a psychological disorder marked by extreme inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity. B) mental health Mental health is not a good predictor. Studies show that people with disorders are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence. The vast majority of violent6 crimes are committed by people with no diagnosed disorder. Which is NOT a good predictor of violence?A) access to a gunB) mental healthC) history of violenceD) use of alcohol and drugs Therapists and others use disorder labels to communicate with one anther using a common language, and to share concepts during research. Clients may benefit from knowing that they are not the only ones with these symptoms. The dangers of labeling people are that (1) people may begin to act as they have been labeled (2) the labels can trigger assumptions that will change our behavior toward those we label What is the value, an what are the dangers of labeling individuals with disorders? - academic failure - birth complications - low birth weight- stressful life events - trauma experience - substance abuse - parental mental illness - parental substance abuse - low socioeconomic status - neurochemical imbalance - medical illness - aerobic exercise - effective parenting - feelings of mastery and control - positive attachment and early bonding - self-esteem- social support from family and friends - resilient coping with stress and adversity- positive parent-child relationships - economic independence - feelings of security Usually strike by early adulthood. A study revealed that over 70% of their patients with any disorder had experienced their first symptom by age 24. D) Antisocial personality disorder (median age 8) - obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder (median age 20)- phobias (median age 10) - major depressive disorder (median age 25) Amongst the disorders, which one's symptoms appear the earliest?A) obsessive-compulsive disorder B) phobias C) major depressive disorderD) antisocial personality disorder Poverty-related stresses can help trigger disorders, but disabling disorders can also contribute to poverty. Thus poverty and disorders are often a chicken-and-egg situation, and it is hard to know which came first. What is the relationship between poverty and psychological disorders? Which psychological disorder can drive a person into poverty? D) Social anxiety disorder (6.8%)- generalized anxiety disorder (3.1 %)- PTSD (3.5 %)- ADHD (4.1 %) Which psychological disorder had the highest percentage rate of diagnoses amongst Americans last year?A) generalized anxiety disorder B)Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)C)ADHDD)social anxiety disorder Which country has the highest rates of mental disorders? Which country has the lowest rates of mental disorders? anxiety disorders, or for the two other disorders that involve anxiety: obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) When the brain's danger-detection system becomes hyperactive, we are at a greater risk for developing? psychological disorders characterized by distressing, persistent anxiety or maladaptive behavior that reduces anxiety an anxiety disorder in which a person is continually tense, apprehensive, and in a state of autonomic nervous system arousal. people with this condition worry continually, and are often jittery, agitated, and sleep deprived. Their tension and apprehension may show through furrowed brows, twitching eyelids, trembling, perspiration, or fidgeting from autonomic nervous system arousal. It is often accompanied by depressed mood. D) B & C women have a 2x higher risk than men of suffering from generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD Women are twice as likely to experience : A) panic disorderB)Generalized anxiety disorder C)PTSDD) B & C For the past 2 years,Tom, a 27-year-old electrician, has been bothered by dizziness, sweating palms, heart palpitations, and ringing in his ears. He feels on the edge and sometimes finds himself shaking. With reasonable success, he hides his symptoms from his family and co-workers. But he allows himself few other social contacts, and occasionally he has to leave work. Tom's unfocused, out-of-control, agitated feelings suggest which disorder? an anxiety disorder marked by unpredictable, minutes-long episodes of intense dread in which a person experiences terror and accompanying chest pain, choking, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, trembling, dizziness or other frightening sensations. Often followed by worry over a possible next attack fear or avoidance of situations in which escape might be difficult when panic strikes - smokers have at least double the risk of panic disorder- smokers show greater panic symptoms in situations that often produce panic attacks, such as when they hyperventilate this happens cause nicotine is a stimulant phobiaconsumed by persistent, irrational fear and avoidance of some object, activity or situation Marilyn, an otherwise healthy and happy 28-year-old, fears thunderstorms so intensely that she feels anxious as soon as weather forecasts mentions possible storms later in the week. If her husband is away and a storm is forecast, she may stay with a close relative. During a storm, she hides from windows and buries her head to avoid seeing the lighten. Marilyn is suffering from what disorder?A)PTSDB)generalized anxiety disorderC)phobiaD)Mania an anxiety disorder marked by a persistent, irrational fear and avoidance of a specific object, activity, or situation social anxiety disorder (formerly called ""social phobia"" extreme shyness. People with this disorder have an intense fear of other people's negative judgements. They may avoid potentially embarrassing social situations - such as speaking up, eating out, or going to parties - or they sweat and tremble when doing so Unfocused tension, apprehension, and arousal are symptoms of what disorder?A) ADHDB) generalized anxiety disorderC) panic disorder D) PTSD Those who experience unpredictable periods of terror and intense dread, accompanied by frightening physical sensations, may be diagnosed withA) phobia B) PTSDC) panic disorder D) generalized anxiety disorder If a person is focusing anxiety on specific feared objects or situations, that person may have A) panic disorderB) phobiaC) PTSDD) OCD a disorder characterized by unwanted repetitive thoughts (obsessions), actions (compulsions), or both C) concern with dirt, germs, or toxins Of the children with OCD studied, 40% reported having obsessions of concern with dirt, germs, or toxins Which is the most common obsession (repetative thoughts) amongst kids with OCD?A) symmetry, order, or exactnessB) something terrible happening (fire, death,illness)C) concern with dirt, germs, or toxinsD) none of the above B) excessive hand washing, bathing, toothbrushing, or groomingOf children with OCD studied, 85% reported having compulsions of excessive hand washing, bathing, toothbrushing, or grooming Which is the most common compulsion (repetitive behavior) amongst kids with OCD?A) repeating rituals (in/out of a door, up/down from a chair)B) excessive hand washing, bathing, toothbrushing, or groomingC) checking doors, locks, appliances, car brakes, homeworkD) avoiding particular places, people or situations a disorder characterized by haunting memories, nightmares, social withdrawal, jumpy anxiety, numbness of feeling, and/or insomnia that lingers for four weeks or more after traumatic experience - some people may have more sensitive emotion- processing limbic systems that floor their bodies with stress hormones- PTSD patients have smaller amygdala (brain region that governs fear) - genes and gender also matter, risk is 2x higher for women than for men Why do some people develop PTSD after traumatic events, and some people don't? Those who express anxiety through unwanted repetitive thoughts or actions may have ____________disorder. those with symptoms of recurring memories and nightmares, social withdrawal, jumpy anxiety, numbness of feeling, and/or insomnia for weeks after a traumatic event may be diagnosed with ______________ disorder This can happen through two part conditioning process: Stimulus generalization and reinforcementstimulus generalization occurs when a person experiences a fearful event and later develops a fear of similar events. All of us generalize our fears. Once fear and anxiety arise, Reinforcement helps maintain them. Anything that helps us avoid or escape the feared situation can be reinforcing because it reduces anxiety and gives us a feeling of relief. Reinforced by feeling calmer, we are likely to repeat that maladaptive behavior in the future. How can conditioning magnify a painful or frightening event into a phobia? Our thoughts, memories, interpretations, and expections all influence our anxiety level. By observing others, we can learn to fear what they fear. Humans often learn many of our own fears by observing others Our past experiences shape our expectations and influence our interpretations and reactions. How we interpret the creaky sound in the old house as the wind or a possible intruder determines whether we panic or not. People with anxiety disorders tend to be hypervigilant (increased state of awareness caused by fear or anxiety). Anxiety is especially common when people cannot switch off intrusive thoughts and perceive loss of control and a sense of helplessness. How does cognition influence our feelings of anxiety? - individual with an inherited high-strung temperament can has a greater risk of a phobia if experiences a traumatic event- genes variations can influence disorders by regulating neurotransmitters, such as the: ""anxiety gene"" that affects brain levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that influences sleep mood, and attention to negative images. Another gene variation regulates neurotransmitter glutamate, and with too much glutamate the brain's alarm centers become overactive - child abuse leaves long-term epigenetic marks, increasing the likelihood that a genetic vulnerability to the disorder will be exposed - Suicide victims show a similar epigenetic effect our experiences change our brain, paving new pathways,. Traumatic fear-learning experiences can leave tracks in the brain, creating new fear circuits within the amygdala. These fear pathways create easy inroads for more fear experiences. - when the OCD brain detects something is wrong, it generates a mental hiccup of repeated thoughts (obsessions) or actions (compulsions). - people with OCD reveal elevated activity in the anterior cingulate cortex in the brains frontal lobe during behaviors such as compulsive hand washing, checking, ordering, or hoarding. - the anterior cingulate cortex in OCD is not only enlarged but is especially likely to be hyperactive What did brain scans reveal about activity in the brain of OCD people? PTSD brains show higher-than-normal activity in the amygdala when they view traumatic images What did brain scans reveal about activity in the brain of PTSD people? We are biologically wired to fear threats faced by our ancestors. It is easy to condition these fears and hard to overcome such evolutionary fears such as spiders, snakes, heights, and enclosed spaces. These stimuli have been pre-wired in our brains as threats because they were dangers to our ancestors. our compulsive acts typically exaggerate behaviors that contributed to our species survival, for example washing up becomes ritual hand washing and checking territory becomes rechecking an already locked door - major depressive disorder- persistent depressive disorder - bipolar depressive disorder a disorder in which a person experiences, in the absence of drugs or another medical condition, two or more weeks with five or more symptoms, at least one of which must be either (1) depressed mood (2) loss of interest or pleasure major depressive disorder : a persistent state of hopelessness and lethargy Brain has had the following symptoms for the past 2 weeks, Which disorder would he be classified as in the DSM-5?- dramatically reduced interest or enjoyment in most activities most of the time- significant challenges regulating sleep-physical agitation or lethargy- feeling listless or with much less energy- feeling worthless and unwarranted guilt - significant challenges regulating appetite and weight - problems in thinking, concentrating persistent depressive disorder ( also called dysthymia): in which a person experiences milder depressive feelings Carmen has been experiencing a mildly depressed mood for the last 2 years along with feelings of poor self-esteem and feeling hopeless. What disorder is Carmen illustrating? a hyperactive, wildly optimistic state in which dangerously poor judgement is common bipolar disorder( formerly called manic-depressive disorder) a disorder in which a person alternates between the hopelessness and lethargy of depression and the over-exited state of mania. - typically have little need for sleep - positive emotions persist abnormally - their speech is loud, fighty, and hard to interrupt- they find advice irritating, yet they need protection from their own poor judgement, which may lead to reckless spending or unsafe sex What happens to bipolar people during the manic phase? for some people suffering from depressive disorders or bipolar disorder, symptoms may have a seasonal pattern. Depression may regularly return each fall or winter, and mania (or a reprieve from depression) may dependably arrive with spring what does it mean if an individual with a depressive disorder or bipolar disorder has symptoms that have a seasonal pattern? In milder forms, mania's energy and flood of ideas fuel creativity. Those who rely on precision and logic, such as architects and designers suffer bipolar disorder less often than do those who rely on emotional expression and vivid imagery. Composers, artists, poets, novelists and entertains seem especially prone. An analysis of over 1 millions individuals revealed that the only psychological disorder linked to working in a creative profession was bipolar disorder. - many behavioral and cognitive changes accompany depression- depression is widespread- women's risk of major depression is nearly double men's risk - most major depressive episodes self-terminate- stressful events related to work, marriage, and close relationships often precede depression - with each new generation, depression strikes earlier now (often in the late teens) and it affects more people, with the highest rates in developed countries among young adults What biological and social-cognitive perspectives help us understand depressive disorders and bipolar disorder? - genetic predisposition- child abuse- low self-esteem- marital problems - sexual assault- learned helplessness- tendency to ruminate (overthink) The depression gender gap is worldwide and begins in adolescence when girls often think and fret about their bodies. Factors ( such as genetic predispositions, child abuse, low self-esteem, sexual assault, marital problems) put women at risk for depression, similarly as they do for men. Yet women are more vulnerable to disorders involving internalized states, such as depression, anxiety and inhibited sexual desire. However women experience more situations that may increase their risk for depression such as gender unequal pay, juggling multiple roles, and caring for children and elderly family members. Men's disorders tend to more external - alcohol use disorder, antisocial conduct, lack of impulse control. When women get sad they often get sadder than men do. When men get mad they often get madder than women do. Why are women's risk of major depression nearly double men's risk? Anxiety is a response to the threat of a future loss, depression is often a response to past and current loss. Minor daily stressors can leave emotional scars. However it is the people who overreact to minor stressors, such as a broken appliance were often found to be depression 10 years later. Moving to a new culture can also increase depression, especially among younger people who have not yet formed their identities. How can stressful events related to work, marriage, and close relationship lead up to depression? - people in a depressed mood become inactive and feel unmotivated- they feel sensitive to negative events - they recall more negative information- they expect negative outcomes (my team will lose, my grades will fall, my love will fail)when the depression lifts, these behavioral and cognitive accompaniments disappear What behavioral and cognitive changes accompany depression? A) bipolar disorder biopolar disorder has the highest hereditary rates for people who have a family member with bipolar disorder. Which is the most hereditable psychological disorder?A)bipolar disorderB)schizophreniaC)major depressive disorderD)anorexia nervosa Depressive and bipolar disorders fun in families- the risk of major depression and bipolar disorder increases if you have a parent or sibling with the disorder- if one identical twin is diagnosed with major depressive disorder the chances are 1 in 2 that at some point the other twin will be too- this effect is even higher with bipolar: if one twin is bipolar, the chances are 7 in 10 that the other twin will be diagnosed similarly, even if the twins were raised apart What are genetic influences of depressive and bipolar disorder? studies used to identify the genes that put people at risk for depression. Process involves: (1) first geneticists find families i which the disorder appears across several generations.(2) Next the researchers examine the DNA from affected and unaffected family members, looking for differences. Linkage analysis points researchers to a chromosome neighborhood; ""A house-to-house search is then needed to find a culprit gene. They examine all the family members chromosomes until they find genes that put people at greater risk for depression. Many genes work together , produced a bunch of small effects that interact with other factors to put some people at a higher risk. So if culprit genes can be identified they can lead to more effective drug therapy. So far 3 genes have been identified in separate British and American studies. What is the benefit of linkage analysis for depression? there is diminished brain activity during slowed-down depressive states and there is more activity during periods of mania - left frontal lobe and an adjacent brain reward center become more active during positive emotions- brain energy consumption rises and falls with the patients emotional switches. A PET scan showed that in a manic state the brain rapidly consumed glucose. How does brain activity differ during depressed and manic states? - depressed people's frontal lobes are smaller than normal - the hipocampus (the memory-processing center linked with the brains emotional circuitry) is vulnerable to damage - there is altered brain structure in bipolar people, neuroscientists discovered white matter and enlarged fluid-filled ventricles What have MRI scans revealed about the brain structure in people with depressive disorders and bipolar disorder? - Norepinephrine, which increases arousal and boosts mood, is scarce during depression and overabundant during mania- serotonin imbalances can lead to depression if combined with a significant life stress How does the neurotransmitter system influence depressive disorders and bipolar disorders? once you have an urge to smoke, depression makes it more difficult to quit. This happens because smoking is then used as an attempt to self-medicate with the inhaled nicotine, which can temporarily increase norepinephrine and boost your mood. Why do many people with a history of depression have a history of habitual smoking? significant life stress and variation of a serotonin-controlling gene depression arose from the combination of an adverse environment plus a genetic susceptibility, but not one either one alone A study of New Zealand young adults found the recipe for depression combine two necessary ingredients, which are? they tend to increase norepinephrine or serotonin supplies by blocking either their reuptake (as Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil do with serotonin) or their chemical breakdowns because it increases serotonin, which affects mood and arousal. In one study, running for two hours increased brain activation in regions associated with euphoria (intense feelings of happiness) How does repetitive physical exercise, such as jogging, reduce depression? people with a ""mediterranean diet"" (heavy on vegetables, fish, and olive oil) have a low risk of developing, heart disease, stroke, late-life cognitive decline and depression - all of which are associated with inflammation excessive alcohol use correlates with depression - mostly because alcohol misuse leads to depression organic molecules that attach to our chromosomes and turn certain genes on or off. These molecular tags can be a result of diet, drugs, stress and other life experiences explores how peoples assumptions and expectations influence what they perceive the social cognitive perspecive explores how people's assumptions and expectations influence what they perceive. Depressed people view life through the dark glasses of low seld-esteem. Their negative assumptions about themselves, their situation and their future lead them to magnify bad experiences and minimize good ones. Expecting the worst, depressed people's self-defeating beliefs and their negative explanatory style feed depressions vicious cycle. How does the social-cognitive perspective influence depression? compulsive fretting; overthinking about our problems. rumination is staying focused on one problem (thanks to the continuous firing of a frontal lobe area that sustains attention). Relentless, self-focused rumination can divert us from thinking about other life tasks, and can increase negative moods. This is one of the reasons why women have double the risk of depression than men, because women have a tendency to ruminate or overthink. People's explanatory style (who or what they blame for their failures) explains why life's unavoidable failures only lead some people to become depressed. Depression-prone people respond to bad events in an especially self-focused, self-blaming way. For example: think of how you might feel if you failed a test. If you can externalize the blame (""what an unfair test"") , you are more likely to feel angry. If you blame yourself, you will probably feel stupid and depressed Depressed people often explain bad events in terms that are stable (""it's going to last forever""), global (""it's going to affect everything I do""), and internal (""its all my fault""). Depression-prone people respond to bad events in an especially self-focused and self-blaming way. What is the explanatory style of a depression prone person? C) ""i'll never get over this"" stable response is ""it's going to last forever"" mentality that depressed people have after bad events A depressed person is going through a breakup with a romantic partner. Which illustrates a ""stable"" response?A)""our breakup was all my faultB)""it takes two to make a relationship work and it wasn't meant to beC)""ill never get over this""D)"" without my partner, I cant seem to do anything right"" B) "" without my partner, I can't seem to do anything right"" Global response is ""it's going to affect everything I do"" mentality that depressed people have after bad events A depressed person is going through a breakup with a romantic partner. Which illustrates a ""global"" response?A) ""this is hard to take, but i will get through this""B) "" without my partner, I cant seem to do anything right""C) ""our breakup was all my fault"" D ""I miss my partner, but thankfully I have my family and other friends"" D) ""our breakup was all my fault""Internal response is ""it's all my fault"" mentality that depressed people have after bad events A depressed person is going through a breakup with a romantic partner. Which illustrates a ""internal"" response?A) ""it takes two to make a relationship work and it wasn't meant to be""B) ""I'll never get over this""C) ""This is hard to take, but I will get through this""D) ""our breakup was all my fault"" What did Martin Seligman believe was the recipe for severe depression? Seligman believed it was because of the rise of individualism and the decline of commitment of religion and family, which forces young people to take responsibility for failure or rejection. In non western cultures, where close-knit relationships and cooperation are the norm, major depression is less common and less tied to self-blame over personal failure Why is depression so common among young westerners? tendency to recall experiences that are consistent with one's current good or bad mood 1) stressful experiences2) negative explanatory style3) depressed mood4) cognitive and behavioral changes What are the 4 points of depressions vicious cycle? 1) negative, stressful events interpreted though 2) a ruminating, pessimistic explanatory style create 3) a hopeless, depressed state that 4) impact the way the person thinks and acts. This in turn, fuels 1) negative, stressful experiences such as rejection. depression is a snake that bites its on tail, and the cycle often just continues to repeat until therapists help depressed people break out of it. What happens during the vicious cycle of depressed thinking? therapists recognize the cycle and work to help the depressed person break out of it. Each of the bottom three points (2,3,4) offer an exit to work toward. Instead of 2) negative explanatory style, they must reverse self-blame and a negative outlookInstead of 3) depressed mood, they must turn their attention outwardInstead of 4) cognitive and behavioral changes, they must engage in more pleasant activities and more competent behavior How can a depressed person break the vicious cycle of depression - national differences- racial differences - gender differences - age differences and trends - other group differences - day of the week differences What factor differences have researchers found contribute to variation in suicidal rates? in the US whites and native americans kill themselves twice as often as blacks, hispanics and asians women are twice as likely than men to attempt suicide, but men are 4x more likely to actually end their lives in late adulthood, rate of suicide increase, peaking in middle age and beyond. suicide rates are much higher among the rich, the nonreligious and those who were single, widowed or divorcedwitnessing physical pain and trauma can increase risk of suicide which may help explain physicians elevated suicide ratesgay and lesbian youth facing an unsupportive environment risks are higheramong people with alcohol use disorder, 3% die by suicide how does income, religion, social support and trauma influence suicide rates? negative emotions tend to go up midweek. 25% of US suicides occur on Wednesday. how do days of the week influence differences suicide rates? - verbal hints- giving possessions away- withdrawal- preoccupation with death because suicide is often an impulsive act, environment barriers ( such as jump barriers on high bridges and the unavailability of loaded guns) can save lives. restrictions like these give the time for the person's self-destructive impulses to subside some people, especially adolescents and young adults may hurt themselves in various way (such as cut or burn their skin, hit themselves, insert objects under their nails or skin, or tattoo themselves) as a way to deal with distress NSSI people tend to be less able to tolerate emotional distressthey are extremely self-critical and often poor communication and problem solving skills What are some characteristics of people to engage in NSSI? - they find relief from intense negative thoughts from the distraction of pain- to attract attention and possibly get help- to relieve guilt by inflicting self-punishment- to get others to change their negative behavior (bullying, criticism)- to fit in with a peer group What reasons do people engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI)? usually not, those who engage in NSSI are typically gesturers and not suicide attempters. Suicide gesturers use NSSI as a desperate but non-threatening form of communication or when they are feeling overwhelmed Does nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) lead to suicide? many factors contribute to depression, including the biological influences of genetics and brain function. Social-cognitive factors also matter, including the interaction of explanatory style, mood, and our response to stressful experiences, and changes in our patterns of thinking and behaving. The whole body is involved What does it mean that ""depression is a whole-body disorder""? the word means split (schizo) mind (phrenia). In this disorder the mind suffers a split from reality that shows itself in disturbed perceptions, disorganized thinking and speech, and diminished, inappropriate emotions What does the word schizophrenia mean? how its meaning relate the disorder? schizophrenia patients can have positive symptoms other patients can have schizophrenia with negative symptoms - may experience hallucinations- talk in disorganized and deluded ways- exhibit inappropriate laughter, tears, and or rage - may have toneless voices- expressionless faces - mute and rigid bodies a disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and/or diminished, inappropriate emotional expression people with schizophrenia sometimes have hallucinations - they see, feel, taste,or smell things that only exist in their minds. Most often the hallucinations are sounds, frequent voices making insulting remarks or giving orders. What disturbed perceptions do people with schizophrenia experience? false beliefs. They are often of persecution or grandeur, that may accompany psychotic disorders. a mixture of familiar words and ideas put into random senseless order within sentences. example: one young man begged for ""a little more allegro in the treatment"" and suggested that ""liberationary movement with a view to the widening of the horizon"" will ""ergo extort some wit in lectures"" - their thinking is distorted by delusions (false beliefs)- They have difficulty with selective attention : leading them to focus on tiny irrelevent stimuli and distracting their attention from things that should have a persons undivided attention What are some causes of the disorganized thinking and speech of people with schizophrenia? Normally we have a remarkable capacity for giving our undivided attention to one set of sensory stimuli while filtering out others. People with schizophrenia cannot do this. Therefore, tiny, irrelevant stimuli, such as the grooves on a brick, or the inflections of a voice, may distract them from a bigger event or a speaker's meaning How does a person's attention differ from a person with schizophrenia? difficulty perceiving facial expressions and reading other's state of mind - some with schizophrenia lapse into an emotionless flat affect state of no apparent feeling - most with schizophrenia have an impaired theory of mind - in which they have difficulty perceiving facial expressions and reading other's state of mind what are causes of the diminished and inappropraite emotions in schizophrenia (also called process schizophrenia) a form of schizophrenia in which symptoms usually appear in late adolescence or eary adulthood. As people age, psychotic episodes last longer and recovery periods shorten. (also called reactive schizophrenia) a form of schizophrenia that can begin at ant ago, frequently occurs in response to an emotionally traumatic event, and has extended recovery periods In chronic (or process) schizophrenia, the disorder develops gradually and recovery is doubtful. In acute (or reaction) schizophrenia, the onset is sudden, in reaction to stress, and the prospects for recovery are brighter - those who experience childhood abuse are 3x more likely than an unabused person to develop schizophrenia - other types of childhood adversity such as bullying increases the risk people with schizophrenia have increased dopamine receptors, which may intensify brain signals, creating positive symptoms such as hallucinations and paranoia. Brain abnormalities associated with schizophrenia include enlarged, fluid-filled cerebral cavities and corresponding decreases in the cortex. Brain scans reveal abnormal activity in the frontal lobes, thalamus, and amygdala. The interacting malfunctions in multiple brain regions and their connections may produce schizophrenia symptoms What brain abnormalities are associated with schizophrenia? when people were hallucinating their brain became vigorously active in two areas. One was thalamus, the structure that filters incoming sensory signals and transmits them to the brain's cortex. The amygdala ( a fear-processing center) was increasingly active in people with paranoia What two areas of the brain did PET scans reveal were active during schizophrenia hallucinations? - some schizophrenic people have abnormally low frontal lobe activity (area that helps us reason, plan an solve problems)- there is a noticeable decline in the brain waves that reflect synchronized neural firing in the frontal lobes. Out-of-sync neurons may disrupt the integrated functioning of neural networks, possibly contributing to schizophrenia symptoms What did PET scans reveal about brain activity in the frontal lobes of schizophrenic people? possible contributing factors include: - low birth weight- oxygen deprivation during delivery- midpregnancy viral infection- famine conditions (mother not eating enough)- maternal diabetes - older paternal age (parents are old age) What prenatal events are associated with increased risk of developing schizophrenia? A) mothers who report being sick with influenza during pregnancy are more likely to bear children who develop schizophrenia ** there is only an increased risk when the infections occur during the second trimester. Maternal influenza infections during pregnancy also affects brain development in monkeys Which of the following facts about fetal-virus infections are FALSE?A) mothers who report being sick with the influenza during pregnancy in the third trimester are more likely to bear children who develop schizophreniaB) people born in densely populated areas, where viral diseases spread more readily are at a great risk for schizophreniaC) Those born during the winter and spring months, after the fall-winter flue season are at a increased riskD) blood drawn from a pregnant women whose offspring develop schizophrenia show higher-than-normal levels of antibodies that suggest a viral infection yes, the nearly 1 in 100 odds of any person being diagnosed with schizophrenia increases to 1 in 10 among those who have a sibling or parent with the disorder if the affected sibling is a identical twin the odds increase to 5 in 10, even when the twins are raised apartIf identical twins have a shared placenta then the odds increase to 6 in 10. However, if the identical twins had separate placentas (as do fraternal twins) the co-twins chance of developing schizophrenia drop to 1 in 10 can people inherit a predisposition to schizophrenia? studies show that schizophrenia is influenced by many genes, each with very small effects. Epigenetic factors influence whether or not genes will be expressed. Environmental factors such as viral infections, nutrition deprivation and maternal stress can ""turn on"" the genes for this disorder in those who are predisposed to it *environmental factors and genetic predispositions do not, by themselves, cause schizophrenia - a mother those schizophrenia was severe and long-lasting- birth complications, often involving oxygen deprivation and low birth weight- separation from parents- short attention span and poor muscle coordination - disruptive or withdrawn behavior - poor peer relations and solo play - childhood physical, sexual, or emotional abuse What are possible early warning signs of schizophrenia in children? A person with schizophrenia who has _____ symptoms may have an expressionless face and toneless voice. These symptoms are most common with __________ schizophrenia and are not likely to respond to drug therapy. Those with __________ symptoms are likely to experience delusions and to be diagnosed with _________________ schizophrenia, which is much more likely to respond to drug therapy. biological factors include abnormalities in brain structure and function, prenatal exposure to a maternal virus, and a genetic predisposition to the disorder. However, a high-risk environment, with many environmental triggers, can increase the odds of developing schizophrenia What factors contribute to the onset development of schizophrenia? controversial rare disorders in which conscious awareness becomes separated (dissociated) from previous memories, thoughts, and feelings a sudden loss of memory or change in identity, often in response to an overwhelmingly stressful situation a rare dissociative disorder in which a person exhibits two or more distinct and alternating personalities. Formerly called multiple personality disorder. psychodynamic theorists see DID symptoms as defences against the anxiety generated by unacceptable urges. In this view, a second personality enable the release of forbidden impulses How do psychodynamic perspectives view dissociative identity disorder (DID) symptoms? Learning theorists attempts to explain these symptoms as behaviors that have been reinforced by relieving of anxiety in the past. How do learning perspectives view dissociative identity disorder (DID) symptoms? - it is rarely found outside of north america - One side of the skeptics believe that multiple personalities are the desperate efforts of people trying to detach from a horrific experiences and they include DID under the umbrella of posttraumatic stress disorder. - on other side are the skeptics that think DID is a condition constructed out of the therapist-patient interaction and acted out by fanasty-prone, emotionally vulnerable people. Critics say therapists go fishing for multiple personalities and results in role playing by people who are vulnerable to the therapist's suggestions. What is the controversy over dissociative identity disorder (DID)? 1) anxiety2) eccentric or odd behaviors 3) dramatic or impulsive behaviors inflexible and enduring behavior patterns that impair social functioning. a personality disorder in which a person (usually a man) exhibits a lack of conscience for wrongdoing, even toward friends and family members; may be aggressive and ruthless or a clever con artist the genetic vulnerability of people with antisocial and unemotional tendencies apears as a fearless approach to life. - Awaiting aversive events such as electric shocks, they show little autonomic nervous system arousal- long-term studies show that their 13 year olds who had lower levels of arousal in a stressful situation were more likely to commit a crime- other studies have found that pre school boys who later became aggressive or antisocial adolescents tended to be impulsive, uninhibited, unconcerned with social rewards and low in anxiety How does fearlessness influence the development of antisocial personality disorder? twin adoption studies show that biological relatives of people with antisocial personality disorder are at a increased risk for antisocial behavior. Negative environmental factors such as poverty or childhood abuse, may channel genetic traits such as fearlessness in more dangerous directions - toward aggression and away from social responsibility. Neither a bad genes or a bad environment alone predispose later antisocial behavior. How do biological and psychological factors contribute to antisocial personality disorder? - the emotion-controlling amygdala is smaller - the frontal lobes are less active ( area in the brain that helps brake impulses and aggressive behavior)- repeated violent offenders had 11% less frontal lobe tissue than normal What did PET scans reveal about the brain activity in murderers minds? - displayed low heart rate and persperation responses - less activity in brain areas that typicall respond to emotional stimuli - they also have a larger and hyper-reactive dopamine reward system, which predisposes their impulsive drive to do something rewarding despite the consequences When antisocial disordered criminals were shown evocative pictures, such as a man holding a knife to a womens throat, what were the physiological and brain responses - anorexia nervosa - bulimia nervosa- binge-eating disorder an eating disorder in which a person (usually an adolescent female) maintains a starvation diet despite being significantly underweight; sometimes accompanies by excessive exercise an eating disorder in which a person alternates binge eating (usually of high-calorie foods) with purging by (vomiting or laxative use) or fasting. Preoccupied with food (craving sweet and high fat foods), and fearful of becoming overweight, binge-purge eaters experience bouts of depression, guilt and anxiety during the following binges. Unlike anorexia, this disorder is easy to hide because of the weight fluctuations within or above normal ranges. significant binge-eating episodes, followed by distress, disgust, or guilt, but without the compensatory purging or fasting that marks bulimia nervosa - mothers of daughters with eating disorders tend to focus on their own weight and on their daughter's weight and appearance- families of those with bulimia tend to have a higher-than-usual incidence of childhood obesity and negative self-evaluation- families of those with anorexia tend to be competitive, high-achieving, and protective What family environments influence the growth of eating disorders? people with _________ continue to want to lose weight even when they are underweight. Those with _________ tend to have weight that fluctuates within or above normal ranges cultural pressures, low self-esteem, and negative emotions interact with stressful life experiences and genetics to produce eating disorders How do biological psychological and social-cultural influences produce eating disorders? - heredity matters, identical twins share these disorders more often then fraternal twins- scientists are searching for culprit genes, which may influence the body's available serotonin and estrogen levels- studies showed that having a gene that reduced available serotonin increased a persons risk of anorexia or bulimia by 30%however no gene alone can cause eating disorders, the interaction between genes and environmental factors produce the disorder How do genetics influence a persons risk to developing an eating disorder? - low self-evaluation- set perfectionist standards- fret about falling short or expectations- intensely concerned with how others perceive them What characteristics do people with eating disorders usually have? - the most vulnerable to eating disorders are women and gay men, because they most commonly idealize thinness- ideal shapes vary across cultures; in impoverished areas of the world plumpness means prosperity and thinness signals poverty or illness. In western cultures they are ""weight obsessed"" and fat is considered bad - social media sets an impossible body standard, which has increased girls body dissatisfaction and encouraged eating disorders- peer influences such as teasing - increased marriage age, and competition for available mates how does cultural and gender influence eating disorders? Two disorders are found worldwide. One is _____________ and the other is ___________ No Annas behavior is unusual, causes her distress and may make her few minutes late on occasion, but it does not appear to significantly disrupt her ability to function. Like most of us, Anna demonstrates some unusual behaviors that are not disabling or dysfunctional, and thus do not suggest a psychological disorder. Anna is embarrassed that it takes her several minutes to parallel park. She usually gets out of the car once or twice to inspect her distance both from the curb and from the nearby cars. Should she would worry about having a psychological disorder? Susto is a condition marked by severe anxiety, restlessness, and fear of black magic. It is culture-specific to Latin Americas what is susto, and is this a culture-specific or universal psychological disorder? A therapist says that psychological disorders are sicknesses and people with these disorders should be treated as patients in a hospital. This therapist believes in the _____________ C) biopsychosocialbiopsychosocial approach - idea that our behaviors, thoughts and feelings are formed by the interaction between biological, psychological and social-cultural influences.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved What to Do If You Think Your Child Has Bipolar Disorder Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Can You Qualify for Disability Benefits With Bipolar Disorder? Up to 65% of adults with bipolar disorder experienced prior to the age of 18. So while the condition is often associated with adults, kids of any age can have bipolar disorder.﻿ Childhood-onset bipolar is associated with a more severe course of illness compared to people who don’t begin to experience symptoms until adulthood. Early intervention can be the key to getting symptoms under control.﻿ Even if you know an adult with bipolar disorder—or you have been diagnosed with it yourself—it might not look the same in a teenager. Teens tend to be more irritable than elated during manic episodes and their depressive episodes may involve more complaints of physical symptoms other than sadness. Watch Now: Understanding Bipolar Disorder Triggers Children and adolescents with bipolar disorder experience severe mood and behavior changes that are extreme and represent a major change from their typical mood and behavior. It might be difficult to know when the symptoms are severe enough to warrant evaluation and, potentially, diagnosis, so consider these three basic factors: functioning, feeling, and family.﻿ Here are some questions to ask yourself about your child's functioning: Are the problem behaviors of your child interfering with his daily functioning? Do the demands of her difficulties outweigh the needs of other members of the family, maybe including you? Here are some questions to ask yourself about your child's feelings: Does your child feel like there is something wrong with him? Does she feel overwhelmed handling normal activities other kids her age engage in? Does your child worry about things other kids don’t even think about? Is there a history of mental illness in your child’s family? Research indicates that having a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder , though this  may or may not be meaningful. If you've said YES to questions in at least two of the three items above (functioning, feeling, and family), you're probably curious about the specific symptoms of bipolar disorder. Experts disagree about the exact symptoms that may appear in childhood and adolescent bipolar disorder because they appear to manifest differently than the symptoms of adults, but some of these symptoms may include:﻿ Rages & explosive temper tantrums (lasting up to several hours) Getting involved in many projects or activities at once If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the at for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our . If you think your child may have bipolar disorder (or any other mental health issue), talk to his physician. Schedule an appointment to discuss your concerns. A physician may refer you to a mental health treatment provider for a complete evaluation. A mental health expert will likely want to interview you and your child to get a full picture of the signs and symptoms. There isn’t a lab test that identifies bipolar disorder.﻿ Sometimes other conditions such as depression or ADHD have similar presentations; so it’s important to offer as much information as you can about your child’s mood, sleep patterns, energy level, history, and behavior to help rule out other possibilities. Bipolar disorder must be managed throughout a person’s life.﻿ Treatment may require adjustments over time. Your teen’s treatment team may recommend:  A psychiatrist may prescribe medication to stabilize your child's mood. It’s important to monitor your child’s medication and be on the lookout for side effects. Finding the right medication and the right dosage may take some time as there isn’t a single medication that works best for everyone with bipolar disorder.﻿ A therapist may educate your child about bipolar and may offer coping strategies to help manage the symptoms.  often includes family members. Family therapy may address relationship issues, behavior management problems, or strategies to help the entire family cope with a .﻿ A psychiatric hospitalization may be required at one time or another if a child poses an acute safety risk. A serious suicide attempt, thoughts of suicide with a clear plan, self-injury, or psychosis are just a few of the possible reasons a child with bipolar disorder may need to stay in a hospital.﻿ Treatment works best when the child, parents, doctors, therapists, and other treatment providers work together as a team. So it’s important to attend your teen’s appointments, ask questions, communicate with other treatment providers, and continue to educate yourself about your child’s mental health needs.﻿ A therapist or psychiatrist may request that you log your teen’s moods, sleep patterns, or behavior. Charting your child's progress can help treatment providers determine how well therapy or medications are working to keep your child’s moods stable.﻿ Teens are already prone to , but that risk is multiplied when the teenager also has bipolar disorder. Keep an eye out for substance abuse, such as drinking or taking drugs, as well as .﻿ The risk for suicide in people with bipolar disorder is among the highest for all psychiatric disorders.﻿ Studies show that between 25 and 60% of adults with bipolar make at least one suicide attempt over the course of their lives and between 8 and 19% of individuals with bipolar disorder die from suicide.﻿ Studies have found that 72 percent of adolescents with bipolar disorder acknowledge thinking about suicide at one point or another. Research shows teens with both bipolar I and bipolar II are at an elevated risk for suicide. If your teen has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, take the risk of suicide seriously. Work with your teen’s treatment providers to assess your teen’s risks and to develop a safety plan. Many children with bipolar disorder have an additional mental illness, addiction, or behavior disorder. Some research has estimated that between 60 to 90% of youth with bipolar disorder may have  as well.﻿ Anxiety disorders, substance use, and disruptive behavior disorders are among the other most common issues children with bipolar disorder may experience.﻿ It’s important to work with your child’s school if he’s been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. School officials can assist with a plan that will best support your child’s education. Your child’s academic needs will depend on his symptoms and his academic issues. If he exhibits behavior problems at school, the teachers may create a behavior plan that will use appropriate disciplinary action. If he struggles academically, the school may provide services to help ensure he is able to get an education. The school may be able to offer things such as a modified schedule or a hall pass that lets your teen visit the guidance counselor whenever necessary. Encourage your child to participate in meetings to talk about how the school could support his education as well. Bipolar disorder affects the entire family so it’s important to work together to help your child manage the symptoms. Learn as much as you can about bipolar disorder and the latest treatment options—and make sure other family members learn about it too. It’s important for siblings to understand what to expect. Hold regular conversations with your child about treatment and treatment-related issues. There’s a good chance that at some point your child won’t want to take medication or attend therapy. Validate her feelings and talk about the importance of following doctors’ recommendations. It’s important to take care of yourself as well. Coping with the challenges of raising a child with bipolar disorder can be stressful. Consider joining a support group for parents with teens with bipolar disorder (or mental illness in general). Connecting with other parents may help you gain emotional support as well as practical advice about how to support your child. It is common for children to experience some of the symptoms listed above, and it doesn't necessarily mean they have bipolar disorder. If your child is having difficulty with daily functioning or if your child is struggling with feeling normal— especially over an extended period of time—an evaluation by a psychiatrist may be warranted. An unbiased, professional opinion could bring you some peace of mind and perhaps a few new parenting skills. Talk to your pediatrician and seek out advice for your precious one so that you are not carrying your worries or concerns alone.  Can You Qualify for Disability Benefits With Bipolar Disorder?

I am a licensed clinical psychologist and director of the psychological treatment program with the Mood Brain and Development Unit. Our lab is located within the Emotion and Development Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. I have nothing to disclose. All the opinions I am presenting are my own and they not intended as a substitute for medical or psychological diagnosis or treatment. And all this work is supported by the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program. The Mood, Brain and Development Unit is a lab that studies adolescent depression and is led by Dr. Argyris Stringaris. We work to improve understanding and treatment of adolescent depression.  In this short webinar, I’ll be talking a little bit about major depression—what it is, how frequently we see it in young people, signs and symptoms, and next steps if you think someone you care about may be experiencing depression. Major depression is an illness of brain circuitry and chemistry that causes and results from changes in mood, thinking, motivation and behavior. The core symptoms of mood changes are irritability or sadness and difficulty feeling pleasure. And all these symptoms can be clustered into these groups. Some so changes in thinking, some changes in mood, and some physical symptoms. And sadness is something we all experience. It’s a normal reaction to a loss or a setback but then passes with time. Depression is different. There is a range of symptoms that might start sticking around, more days than not, for multiple weeks at a time. Symptoms include: Feeling sad, anxious, or empty, feeling irritable much of the time, loss of interest or pleasure, feeling worthless, helpless, guilty, withdrawing from friends and family, grades dropping, risky behaviors, thoughts of death, suicide, or self-harm, difficulty concentrating, remembering information, or making decisions, eating or sleeping more or less than usual, feeling loss of energy, constantly tired, feeling restless, having trouble sitting still, and aches, pains, headaches, stomach problems. And you might not experience all these symptoms or may not even have multiple ones at the same time, but for more days than not, for multiple weeks, you might experience a range of some of these things. Major depression is among the world’s leading causes of illness and disability. It’s one of the most common mental disorders in the United States. What we know is that it rises during adolescence. In 2016, just under 13% of the US population ages 12-17 experienced at least one major depressive episode. In childhood, rates of depression are generally low, with equal numbers across boys and girls. In adolescence, a time of vast physical, brain, and social changes, there is a sharp rise in the rates of depression, particularly among girls. And while race or sexual orientation are not predictors of depression, social isolation, bullying and a persistent fear of being targeted or not feeling supported or accepted for one’s race, gender identity or sexual orientation are. When we think about what causes major depression, we know that’s it’s a brain disorder that affects circuits and chemistry. We know that depression can be genetic -  it often runs in families—but that it is a combination of genes and environment that contribute to a first major depressive episode, and that sometimes if parent or another family member in a household is depressed, a teen may be more vulnerable to depression. Stressful life experiences, such as abuse or being bullied or an injury can be factors that lead to depression, and additionally medical or psychological factors--endocrine disorders, substance abuse, underlying anxiety or learning issues can all lead to major depression. Without treatment, recurrence is likely. We often think of adults with major depression as having an onset during the teenage years. Depression is something that can wax and wane but often does come back without treatment. So what are some of the treatments. Treatment may include psychological or “talk” therapy – such as cognitive behavioral therapy, which addresses thoughts and behaviors or interpersonal therapy that addresses relationships, social skills, grief, and role transitions in life, or attachment-based family therapy. Additionally, for moderate or severe depression, sometimes medications can be helpful. The strongest evidence currently in treating depression in adolescents is for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs such as fluoxetine or sertraline, and medication may be effective when paired with psychological therapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT as this has been shown to be protective against possible side effects of medication-alone. For things to consider when choosing a mental health professional, see: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies/index.shtml So what are the steps if you are interested in getting help. First is to talk with your parent or guardian, or trusted adult— OR text the word “safe” and your current location to 4HELP (44357) to be connected with a live mental health professional. Step 2 is to make an appointment with your doctor for an evaluation to ensure there is no medical or safety issues that need to be addressed and to talk about what you are experiencing and ask for a referral to a mental health professional. If you are considering harming yourself or if you are in a crisis right now talk to your parents or a trusted adult.

Peterson, MD, PhD Medical Editor: How to Cope With the Loss of a Loved One to Suicide Suicidal ideations are troubling, but help is available to stop them. Suicide is intentionally acting to end one's life. Murder-suicide involves a person killing someone else, then himself or herself. This is a very dramatic, but fortunately rare, event. Suicide by cop involves a person trying to provoke police officers to kill him or herself. Self-mutilation is deliberate self-harm without an intent to end one's life. Self-mutilation is associated with an increased risk of suicide. Most individuals who suicide have a mental illness such as , , or . Decreased activity in the brain is associated with suicide risk. People who feel hopeless, helpless, or isolated are more likely to consider or attempt suicide. People who have serious losses -- deaths of close people, loss of jobs, a move -- are more at risk for suicide. Every 40 seconds, somewhere in the world, someone ends his or her life. In the U.S., about 100 people die every day of suicide. Young people and older adults are more likely to commit suicide. Guns are the most common method for completed suicide. or overdose and asphyxiation/hanging are the next most common methods. People who have experienced bullying, physical abuse, or sexual are more at risk for considering, attempting, or completing suicide. Treatment of mental-health conditions can reduce the risk of suicide and improve quality of life. Suicide is most simply defined as the act of intentionally killing one's self. The word may also be used to describe a person who has killed himself. Suicide is often considered a taboo subject, and people often feel uncomfortable discussing it. This sort of stigma may actually prevent individuals from telling others when they are experiencing suicidal thoughts, and it may also prevent people from asking friends and loved ones about suicidal thoughts, even when they may have concerns. Thoughts of ending a person's own life, or of killing one's self, are also known as suicidal thoughts or suicidal ideation. Some people may plan out suicide attempts, whereas others are impulsive and in the moment. There are other specific terms used to describe certain types or categories of suicide. Most suicides involve only a single person. Rarely, groups of people, such as members of an extreme religious sect or cult, may commit suicide together -- a mass suicide. An agreement between two or more people to commit suicide is a suicide pact. Although these are uncommon, they most often involve a husband and wife or other couple. When a person first kills another person (or persons) and then ends his or her own life, it is called a murder-suicide. The most common murder-suicide is after a breakup or divorce, when one member of the former couple kills the other and then himself or herself. Almost all of the perpetrators are men (>90%). Even more rarely, an individual may kill many other people before committing suicide. These cases are very uncommon (less than 0.3 per 100,000 people; <3% of all suicides), but because of the dramatic and horrible loss around these events, they receive a lot of attention and coverage in the news and other media. Suicide by cop describes a situation when someone commits a crime or threatens someone in an attempt to force police officers to kill him or her. It may be difficult to know for sure what the person intended when he or she is shot by police. Additionally, an individual's suicide in this way can greatly affect both the police involved as well as the community at large. should not be confused with suicide. In euthanasia, someone, usually a doctor, makes a decision to actively end someone's life. Most often this is a patient with a terminal illness (an illness that will result in death regardless of treatment) who has been deemed to be unable to make his or her own decisions. Euthanasia is not legal in the United States, but it is considered legal in a few European countries (Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands). In contrast, physician-assisted suicide refers to a doctor prescribing specific medicines that taken together are likely to result in death. Ethically, physician-assisted suicide also requires a person who can make his or her own decisions, a doctor who will serve this role, and someone who has a life-ending condition. Additionally, assisted suicide (or ""assisted dying"") is illegal in 46 of 50 states in the United States. Three states have laws permitting assisted suicide (OR, VT, WA) and one state permits assisted suicide based on a court ruling (MT). Internationally, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland also allow assisted suicide. A broader discussion of the ethics of euthanasia and assisted death is beyond the scope of this article. Self-mutilation, such as cutting, burning, or scratching, is deliberate self-harm usually without intending to cause death. Other common methods are hitting the head or other parts of the body, pinching, pulling hair, or picking skin. Although this common behavior is usually not considered suicidal (people usually say they aren't trying to cause death or serious harm), people who self-harm are more likely to eventually attempt suicide or even to eventually end their lives by suicide. , or parasuicidal behavior, is more difficult to define. Literally, parasuicide means ""like"" or ""near"" suicide. This could include suicide attempts in which someone survives, self-mutilation, or suicide attempts in which the method is not expected to cause death. Many people show warning signs or changes in behavior prior to a suicide attempt. While no specific behavior, or pattern of actions, can predict a suicide attempt, it is important to watch for signs and behaviors that are concerning. These warning signs parallel the risk factors described above. Changes or increases in these behaviors are particularly concerning: Looking for access to firearms, pills, or other means for committing suicide Statements of hopelessness, purposelessness, helplessness/feeling trapped Preparing a will or insurance policies; giving away important personal belongings; making arrangements for belongings, pets, etc., to be cared for. After a long period of and low energy, suddenly seems brighter or full of energy Any of these may be concerning, but they are particularly troubling when they are paired with recent losses, including deaths, breakups, job or financial losses, or medical diagnoses. If you see these warning signs, it is critical to talk to the person openly about any concerns and get him or her connected to help. This question is complex and difficult to answer -- our best information comes from people who have survived suicide attempts or by trying to understand what people who killed themselves may have in common. Alternately, some people leave a suicide note that may give some insight into their state of mind. Many people who attempted suicide indicate that they don't necessarily want to die but more often want to end their pain -- emotional or physical. Most, but not all, people who commit suicide have a mental illness. This includes , , , or . Additionally, mental illness also includes substance-abuse disorders. Substance-abuse disorders include (), (including binge drinking), as well as dependence on or abuse of any other drug such as , (""coke"", ""crack""), (""meth""), opiates/opioids (, hydrocodone, , ), or others. When people are using alcohol or drugs (they are drunk, high, or stoned), they can be more impulsive -- more likely to act without thinking about what might happen. Unfortunately, this is often when suicide attempts occur. Specific symptoms of mental illness are related to suicide attempts and completed suicide. A feeling of hopelessness -- being unable to imagine that things could get better -- is common in depression and related to suicide attempts. People may also describe this as feeling trapped or out of control -- this may or may not be related to a mental illness. Sometimes these feelings can be due to being bullied, abused, raped, or put through other trauma. Helplessness, a sense that nothing can be done to change things or to solve their problems, is also commonly described. Neuroscience researchers have tried to understand what biological factors are linked to suicide. Research on suicide is closely tied to research on depression, , schizophrenia, and other mental-health disorders with increased risk of suicide. The strongest evidence is linked to the serotonin system in the brain. Serotonin is a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) that is involved in mood, anxiety, and impulsivity. Serotonin levels have been found to be lower in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, or ""spinal fluid"") and brain of suicide victims. Neurotransmitters send their signals in the brain by binding to receptors, which are proteins on a nerve cell surface. Some types of serotonin receptors are also decreased. levels are also connected to suicide rates. The body's response to is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, a system that links part of the brain (hypothalamus) and parts of the endocrine (hormone) system (pituitary and adrenal glands). People who committed suicide have been found to have abnormally high activity of this stress activation system. Other brain chemicals, structures, and activity have also shown possible links to suicide, but the evidence is not as strong. There is still more that we don't understand about brain changes and suicide, but these findings point us in a direction to hopefully better treat disorders with increased risk of suicide and to possibly identify people at risk for suicide early enough to prevent attempts. People who feel isolated or different may turn to suicide attempts as an escape. People who have experienced sexual abuse or other types of trauma are more likely to attempt suicide. Similarly, veterans of the military, especially those who have served in combat or wartime, are at increased risk of suicide. Loss is also a reason people consider suicide. Loss could include the death of a friend, family member, or loved one. Other triggers may include a breakup, loss of a romantic relationship, a move to another place, loss of housing, a loss of privilege or status, or a loss of freedom. It could be financial losses such as losing a job, a house, or business. During times of economic problems (such as the Great Depression or the recent Great Recession), more people attempt suicide. If someone close to you commits suicide, you may be more likely to consider or attempt suicide yourself. Groups of suicides like this, especially in teenagers or young people, are often referred to as suicide clusters or copycat suicides. Certain religious beliefs may influence people to commit suicide. Some religions may leave people feeling guilty for things they have done and may lead them to believe they can't be forgiven. Some individuals may believe that sacrificing their lives (committing suicide for their beliefs) will earn them a reward (like going to heaven) or will be best for the religion. Some people will take their own lives for their religion (martyr themselves). Suicide bombers, often from extreme Muslim groups, are an example of this. In some cultures, such as traditional Japan, shame or dishonor might be a reason to end your life. This type of suicide, known as hara-kiri or seppuku, traditionally involves a specific ceremony and ritual knife. Even though suicide is a relatively common cause of deaths, it is extremely difficult to predict. People who attempt or commit suicide come from every race, country, age group, and other demographic. There are many factors that are common among people who died by suicide, but most other people with these same factors still do not attempt suicide. For example, even though most people who commit suicide have some mental disorder, such as depression, most people who have depression do not commit suicide. Even so, we can still learn about suicide, and hopefully do better at preventing suicides, by understanding risk factors. Globally, societal and cultural factors also affect suicide risks. Communities with limited access to health care or that discourage help-seeking behavior place people at higher risk. Countries involved in war or other violent conflicts, as well as natural disasters, also tend to have higher suicide rates. Ethnic groups who are facing significant discrimination, particularly with displacement or immigration, are also at risk. Certain demographic factors are associated with an increased suicide risk, and since they can't be changed, they are sometimes called non-modifiable risk factors. These include male gender, Caucasian ethnicity, age (under 25 or over 65), and relationship status (divorced, widowed, and single). Certain professions, such as physicians and dentists, may be more at risk for suicide. It is not clear if this is due to job stresses, knowledge of and access to lethal means, or other factors. Unemployment or recent job loss may also increase the risk of suicide attempts. Importantly, individuals with limited social supports are at higher risk of attempting suicide. Individuals with a family history of completed suicide are at higher risk of suicide themselves. This may be related to hereditary (genetic) factors but may also be due to the trauma and distress of losing a family member in this way. Lastly, one of the strongest predictors of future suicide attempts is past suicide attempts. Social factors, including current or past discrimination, abuse, or trauma also predispose people to suicidal acts. People who have been subject to bullying are more likely to consider or attempt suicide. This is true both for young people currently being bullied, as well as adults who were bullied when younger. It is likely that more recent tactics, such as cyberbullying, would have the same impact. A similar pattern is seen for those who have been sexually abused or assaulted, both women and men. For adults sexually abused as children, suicide attempts were two to four times more likely in women and four to 11 times more likely in men, compared to those not abused. People who identify as lesbian, gay, , or transgender (LGBT) also seem to have higher rates of suicide. People exposed to combat, either civilians or military personnel, have an increased risk of suicide as well. Although these stressors are very different, they likely have a similar impact on people; people can feel isolated and helpless in controlling or escaping these situations, and they may also feel more socially isolated and unable to reach out for help. A mental-health diagnosis is one of the most significant risk factors for suicidal thoughts or actions. Psychological studies identified one or more mental-health diagnoses in 90% of people who completed suicide. The most common diagnoses are depression (including bipolar depression), schizophrenia, or alcohol or drug dependence. The lifetime risk of suicide for individuals with these diagnoses is higher than in the general population, although reports vary from about two to 20 times the risk for the general population. Individuals diagnosed with certain personality disorders, such as antisocial, borderline, or narcissistic personality disorder, also have higher risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Alcohol dependence increases the risk of suicide by 50%-70% compared to those without alcoholism. In addition, at least one-third of suicides had alcohol in their system, 20.8% had opiates (including heroin, morphine or prescription pain killers), and 23% had . These statistics may support how common depression, , and are in those who commit suicide, however part of this may be people using these substances as part of their attempt to end their lives. Although the association between a mental-illness diagnosis and suicide risk is strong, it is important to remember that most people with mental illness do not attempt or complete suicide. In addition to formal mental-illness diagnoses, specific symptoms -- even without a full diagnosis -- increase the risk of suicidal actions. Certain symptoms of depression, particularly hopelessness and anhedonia, are more closely tied to increased suicidal thoughts than a depression diagnosis. Hopelessness describes a feeling that things cannot change or be better than they are now. Anhedonia means an inability to enjoy anything, or to feel interested in things that would usually give pleasure. Feelings of anxiety (often also described as worry, nervousness, or fear) are also linked to suicidal thoughts. Some studies suggest that feelings of anxiety or agitation may increase how likely someone is to act on thoughts of suicide. A study of people who committed suicide after discharge from a psychiatric hospital showed that 79% expressed ""extreme"" or ""severe"" anxiety, but only 22% had suicidal thoughts. Problems with , such as , are an acute risk for suicide, whether or not they are part of a depressive episode. It is important to note that increased the suicide risk, even after controlling for other variables such as gender, mood, and alcohol problems. Fortunately, recent studies suggest that managing can reduce suicide risk. Nonpsychiatric diagnoses may also increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions. A wide range of medical conditions, particularly those associated with long-term (chronic) pain, a terminal (life-ending) diagnosis, or limited treatment options, have a higher risk. Some of the diagnoses shown to have a higher risk include , , , ( disorder), , and Huntington's disease. Appropriate treatment of these conditions, and any concurrent depression, can help improve quality of life and reduce suicide risk. Despite the wide range of suicide risk factors discussed, there are also factors that can be protective against suicide. People who have good social supports, including family members, friends, or other connections with other people, have a lower risk of suicide. Cultural groups that value family and community relationships and are close-knit tend to have fewer suicides. For men and women, having children at home, and for women, a current , also are protective factors. Religious and spiritual practices and beliefs -- including a belief that suicide is wrong -- can also reduce suicide risks. Lastly, maintaining healthy lifestyle habits, including positive coping strategies, adequate , good and , can both maintain and improve physical and mental health, including suicide risk. Every 40 seconds, somewhere in the world, someone ends his or her life. In 2012, there were 804,000 deaths by suicide globally, accounting for about 50% of all violent deaths in the world (1.4% of all deaths). In 2010, for the U.S. alone, there were 38,364 reported suicide deaths (about 105 suicides daily; one suicide every 14 minutes). There are more deaths due to suicide than murder (homicide) every year. More men than women die of suicide every year, although the differences vary by country. In the U.S., there are four times as many men than women who complete suicide, about 79% of all suicide deaths. In poorer countries, the difference in suicide rates between genders is lower, with a ratio of about 1 1/2 men to every woman. Even though suicide may not be discussed as much as other issues, including murder, , , war, and violence, it is one of the most common causes of death. In the U.S., suicide is the 10th leading cause of death; more people kill themselves than die by murder (homicide) or other violence. Worldwide, suicides account for more deaths than wars or murders. Suicide is more common at certain ages: People in their teens and 20s, as well as older adults, are most likely to attempt or complete suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for people ages 15-24, and the second leading cause for people ages 25-34. Older men (>75 years old) have the highest suicide rates (36 deaths per 100,000 men). In women, the suicide rate is highest in those aged 45-54 (nine deaths per 100,000 women). Recently, some of these age patterns have changed, with suicide becoming more common in other age groups. From 1999-2010, suicide rates for middle-aged people (35-64) increased by 28% (from 13.7 per 100,000 in 1999 to 17.6 per 100,000 in 2010). Suicide rates vary among different racial and ethnic groups as well; however, differences in cultural beliefs, socioeconomic status, and family structure are far more complex than these numbers would suggest. Worldwide, suicide rates vary greatly among countries and continents. In the U.S., immigrants tend to have suicide rates similar to their country of origin. In the U.S., Caucasians and Native Americans have the highest age-adjusted rates of completed suicides (15.4 or 16.4 per 100,000), while African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Pacific Islanders have about half this rate (5.5, 5.7, or 5.8 per 100,000). There are many more suicide attempts than deaths by suicide. Because many attempts are not reported, estimates are likely lower than the actual number. Most reports suggest that for every suicide, there are probably at least 20-25 suicide attempts. In people ages 15-24, there may be as many as 100-200 people who survive for every completed suicide. Another statistic that is difficult to calculate is the number of people who are surviving family members, partners, or close friends of every victim of suicide -- also known as survivors of suicide. A low estimate is that at least six people are seriously affected by every suicide, which means there are about 230,000 new survivors of suicide in the U.S. every year. For every person who attempts or completes suicide, even more have serious thoughts or plans of committing suicide. When asked about suicidal thoughts and actions in the year 2008-2009, more than 8 million U.S. adults (3.7% of the population) reported serious suicidal thoughts, 2.5 million (1% of the population) reported making a suicide plan, and 1.1 million (<0.5% of the population) reported a suicide attempt. Among younger people, over 17% of high school students (teenagers in grades 9-12; 22.4% of females and 11.6% of males) have seriously considered suicide, 13.6% made a plan (16.9% of females and 10.3% of males), and 8% (10.6% of females and 5.4% of males) reported a suicide attempt at least once in the past year. Further, 2.7% of the teenagers surveyed had a serious suicide attempt that required treatment by a doctor or nurse. In general, men are more likely to use guns, knives, or other violent means. Women are somewhat more likely to take an overdose or some other form of poisoning. This gender difference in methods likely accounts for the higher suicide completion rate in males. Globally, limited data is available about suicide methods. The most common means in different countries are often related to what is accessible and are sometimes based on regional trends. The most extensive data on methods is from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Violent Death Reporting System. By far, firearms are the most common method of suicide death. Over half of U.S. suicide deaths are from a self-inflicted gunshot . Firearms accounted for 57% of suicide deaths in men and 33% in women. It is estimated that 90% of suicide attempts with a firearm are lethal. More U.S. gun deaths are a result of suicide than homicide (in 2009, 19,000 vs. 11,500). Areas where gun ownership is higher tend to have more gun suicides. Globally, high-income countries other than the U.S. have much lower gun ownership, and suicide with firearms accounts for only 4.5% of all suicide deaths. Deaths by hanging and suffocation (25.6%) and poisoning (including prescription drugs, street drugs, poisons, and carbon monoxide; 16.3%) are the next most common methods. Poisoning is the most common method of suicide in women, accounting for 36.5% of deaths. These three categories account for over 90% of U.S. suicide deaths in both men and women. Other less common methods include falls/jumping, motor vehicles, and cutting/stabbing. In other countries, other means are more common. In many low-income countries with a high percentage of rural citizens, self-poisoning with pesticides is a suicide method and is thought to account for around 30% of all suicide deaths globally. Because of easy access to means, hanging is also a common method in low-income countries. In Hong Kong and China, where much of the population lives in high-rise apartments, jumping off of high buildings is a common suicide method. Use of fires for has spread as a common means in China, Hong Kong, and other Asian countries over the past decade. One of the most important, but also most difficult, tasks that mental-health professionals do on a regular basis is the suicide risk assessment. Because suicide is relatively uncommon, even in those with mental-illness diagnoses, predicting who may attempt suicide, and when, is remarkably difficult. We know from research, however, that most people who commit suicide will see a doctor or mental-health professional within the month before they end their lives. Knowing this, we must continue to work to be better at identifying those at risk. Some professionals approach the suicide assessment by using structured interviews or rating scales to assess risk. Dr. Aaron Beck developed one of the earlier tools, the Scale of Suicidal Ideation (SSI). The SADPERSONS scale was easy to use and had fairly widespread acceptance. However, recent research showed that the SADPERSONS scale was not an accurate assessment for risk. More recently, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) has been used in a variety of settings. Validated rating scales have the advantage of being tested on many subjects and of providing an objective, often numeric score to use in making decisions. However, because suicide is a complex and low-frequency event, no scale can be completely accurate. Clinicians must still rely on good clinical judgment and account for factors not assessed in these scales. A broader approach, integrating a detailed clinical history along with a structured interview, provides a better basis for decisions about risk. However, pressures for clinicians to see patients more quickly can limit how practical this can be. One example of an interview-based approach, which can be adapted to different clinical situations, is the Chronological Assessment of Suicide Events (the CASE approach). The goal of this approach is to get a detailed account of suicidal thoughts, preparations and attempts, along with current psychiatric symptoms to best make treatment recommendations. For primary-care doctors, time is even more limited and must also be used to address a range of other medical issues. Screening every patient for suicide risk is impractical and has been shown to have limited value in preventing possible suicides. Current recommendations are to screen primary-care patients for depression and anxiety, and by providing appropriate treatment, suicide risk may be reduced. There are no treatments that specifically stop suicidal thoughts. However, for each individual, identifying and treating any mental illness, and dealing with any stressors can reduce the risk of suicide. Some treatments for mental illness, including and bipolar disorder, have been shown to reduce suicide risk. Certain medications have been shown to reduce the risk of suicide. (, ), a mood-stabilizing medication used for bipolar disorder or major depression, has been shown to decrease suicides associated with depression. Similarly, (, ), an medication, can reduce the risk of suicide in people with schizophrenia. It is not clear if these medications reduce suicide risk when used to treat people with other diagnoses. In contrast, there have been concerns that antidepressants actually increase the risk of suicidal thoughts. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts in children, teens, and adults in their 20s. There was no evidence that these medicines increased suicidal behavior in older people. This warning was based on a review of studies that suggested this increase. Some researchers and clinicians disagree with this warning and feel that not prescribing antidepressants has actually increased suicidal thoughts and attempts, since fewer people are treated for depression. Ongoing studies will hopefully answer these questions more clearly. In the meantime, it is important that people taking antidepressants know about this risk and are given information about how to get help if they have suicidal thoughts. People who frequently have suicidal thoughts may benefit from specific types of psychotherapy (""talk therapy"" or counseling). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) addresses negative thoughts and cognitive distortions. Cognitive distortions are ways that the mind reads things around us in an overly negative way (for example, if someone receives a critical comment from one person, the person believes everyone thinks badly about them). By repeated practice, people can learn to overcome these thought patterns and reduce depression and suicide risk. CBT has been shown in many research studies to help improve symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. Similarly, dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), a type of therapy developed to help people with , also can reduce suicidality. DBT uses mindfulness and other coping skills to decrease impulsive and destructive urges that can lead to suicide attempts. Take statements about suicide, wanting to die or disappear, or even not wanting to live, seriously -- even if they are made in a joking manner. Don't be afraid to talk to someone about suicidal thinking; talking about it does not lead to suicide. Discussing these thoughts is the first step in getting help, treatment, or safety planning. Help them to get help. Encourage or even go with them to get help. Call a hotline, clinic, or mental-health clinic. Remove risky items from their possession or home. It is particularly important to remove any firearms. The majority of suicide deaths used a gun, and most (90%) of suicide attempts with a gun are lethal. Other risky items may include razors, knives, and sharp objects. Prescription and over-the-counter medications should be secured. Avoid alcohol or other drugs; these can increase impulsive actions and suicidal thoughts. Alcohol is a ""depressant"" because it can make depression worse on its own. Almost one-quarter of suicide victims had alcohol in their system at their deaths. Practice methods to ""slow down."" If people can distract themselves, even for a short time, the worst suicidal thoughts may pass. This could involve anything from meditation, deep breathing, listening to music, going for a walk, or being with a pet. With a partner, friend, or family member, talking or even just being there may help. If someone is still feeling suicidal, it may be helpful to stay with the person or to help find others to stay nearby. This type of support or suicide watch can help keep someone safe until they can get help. If these strategies are not working, get help now. Go to a mental-health center, an emergency room, or even call 911. Suicide hotlines may also be able to connect you to local help. Suicide affects many people, young and old, in every country and culture of the world. Almost a million lives are lost every year to suicide, with at least 10 million other suicide attempts, and 5-10 million people affected by the suicide death of someone close to them. Suicide remains one of the most frequent causes of death around the world. The impact of suicide makes prevention an important public-health priority and has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as national, state, and local agencies. Some things to prevent suicide are best done on an individual level, like watching for signs of suicidal thoughts and talking to those you know. However, some changes can be implemented on the community, state, and even national level: Restrict access to means for suicide. If highly lethal items such as pesticides, poisons, and firearms are less available, many deaths can be prevented. Improve access to health care, including mental-health treatment. Educate people about mental illness, , and suicide. Work to reduce physical and sexual abuse. Advocate for reducing discrimination based on race, culture, gender, or sexual orientation. Provide support to vulnerable individuals. Fight stigma against mental illness and those suffering its effects. How to Cope With the Loss of a Loved One to Suicide Find a support group, such as a survivors of suicide (SOS) group. It helps to know you are not alone. is very different for everyone. Don't feel like you have to be on someone's schedule or timeline. It might take longer than you (or others) think it will. Get help for yourself, particularly if you have symptoms of depression or suicidal thoughts. : Many people worry about this, but there is no evidence to support this fear. It is important to speak openly about suicide, both to get help if you have suicidal thoughts, and to ask about suicidal thoughts in those close to you. Without open discussions about suicide, those suffering may continue to feel isolated, and are less likely to get the help they need. : The only people who are suicidal are those who have mental disorders. : Suicidal thoughts and actions indicate extreme distress and often hopelessness and unhappiness. While this may be part of a mental disorder, it isn't always. Many people with mental illness never have suicidal behavior, and not all people who commit suicide have a mental illness. : Increased thoughts or risk for suicide can come and go as situations and symptoms vary. Suicidal thoughts may return, but are not permanent, and suicide is not inevitable. : A suicidal person is determined to end his or her life. : People who have survived suicide attempts often state that they didn't want to die but rather didn't want to keep living with the suffering they were feeling. They are often ambivalent about living or dying. After an attempt, some people clearly indicate that they want to live on, and most people who survive an attempt do not end up ending their lives later. Access to help at the right time can prevent suicide. : When looking back, most people who committed suicide showed some signs in the things that they said or did in the weeks before. Some suicides may be impulsive and not planned out, but the signs of depression, anxiety, or substance abuse were present. It is important to understand what the warning signs are and look out for them. : Individuals who discuss suicide won't really do it. : People who talk about suicide may be reaching out for help or support. Most people aren't comfortable talking about suicide, so they might bring it up in a joking or offhand way. However, any mention of suicide should be taken seriously and viewed as an opportunity to help. Most people contemplating suicide are experiencing depression, anxiety, and hopelessness but may not have any support or treatment. : Suicide attempts are just a ""cry for help"" or a way to get attention. : Suicide attempts, even ""minor"" ones that don't require serious medical attention, are a sign of extreme distress. Suicide attempts should be taken seriously and are a reason to assess and treat any ongoing mental-health issues.

Get professional rehab and addiction education from a qualified doctor today! Many people with an addiction have a co-existing mental health condition such as bipolar disorder. Once known as “manic depression,” bipolar disorder causes mood swings between intense emotional highs and lows. In a study of people with bipolar disorder, approximately 60 percent had some history of substance abuse. Although it’s not fully understood why, bipolar disorder makes people more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. Drugs and alcohol often make the symptoms of bipolar disorder worse. People with no history of mental health issues can also develop bipolar disorder that were previously dormant as a result of drug abuse. to learn more about co-occuring mental health and substance use disorders. People with bipolar disorder experience radical shifts in mood. These “episodes” can last for days or weeks at a time. Episodes may happen as often as several times a week or as little as a few times a year. Bipolar disorder also causes major changes in energy and concentration. Imbalanced chemicals in the brain and genetics can cause bipolar disorder. A traumatic environment is also a risk factor for bipolar disorder. This disorder can lead to financial and legal troubles, addiction, relationship issues and suicide. Many people with bipolar disorder are tempted to abuse drugs to relieve the troubles caused by their condition. There are four types of episodes people with bipolar disorder may experience. They include: During a manic episode, someone with bipolar disorder may be excessively cheerful or hostile. These episodes last a week or more and may require hospitalization. There are only subtle differences between a hypomanic and manic episode. The main difference is that hypomanic episodes are shorter, lasting at least four days, and are less severe. These episodes leave people depressed and/or uninterested in activities. A person’s depressed mood has to last at least two weeks to meet the clinical definition of an episode. Some people with bipolar disorder have mixed episodes. These episodes include traits of manic, hypomanic and major depressive episodes. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines bipolar disorder in two categories. These categories are bipolar I and bipolar II disorder. People with bipolar I disorder experience one or more manic/mixed episodes followed by major depressive episodes or hypomanic episodes. Those with bipolar II disorder have one or more major depressive episodes followed by a hypomanic episode. Bipolar I disorder is more severe than bipolar II disorder. It’s common for people with bipolar disorder to self-medicate with drugs and alcohol. These substances seem to ease the symptoms of manic and depressive episodes at first, which partially explains why many people with bipolar disorder have an addiction. Frequent drug use causes physical changes in the brain. The most obvious change is to the brain reward system, which makes using drugs feel pleasurable. However, changes in the brain reward system lead to compulsive, drug-seeking behavior. Drugs can rewire other parts of the brain that affect mood and behavior. Drug abuse and addiction can cause changes in the brain that lead to bipolar disorder. Even people who were mentally healthy before their addiction can develop bipolar disorder. Don’t waste another second. Enter your number to receive a call from a compassionate treatment expert. The symptoms of bipolar disorder vary from person to person. There are also different symptoms for manic and depressive episodes. Those who also suffer from addiction usually have heightened bipolar symptoms. Some people experience manic episodes so severe that they are unable to function in a social or occupational setting. People having these episodes may require hospitalization. A typical manic episode is not caused by drug abuse. This makes it hard to diagnose bipolar disorder if an addiction also exists. Loss of interest or pleasure in once enjoyable activities Major depressive episodes leave people unable to function in social or occupational settings. A person’s depressed mood has to last at least two weeks to meet the clinical definition of an episode. Like manic episodes, a true major depressive episode is not the result of drug abuse. Diagnosing bipolar disorder in a person with an addiction is difficult. The symptoms of the episodes experienced by people with bipolar disorder mirror many symptoms of drug abuse and addiction. Doctors diagnose bipolar disorder through several tests to help distinguish between a bipolar disorder and addiction. A doctor evaluates the thoughts and feelings of the patient. The doctor looks for evidence of any manic or depressive behavior. Doctors may interview friends and family to learn more about the patient’s behavior. The doctor performs a physical exam to determine if there is anything causing imbalances in the brain. He or she also reviews the patient’s medical history and drug use. Pinpointing the cause of bipolar disorder can help treat the condition. The doctor may ask the patient to chart his or her mood. Mood charts help determine the frequency and length of episodes. Having a distinct record of a patient’s episodes and how long they last help make an accurate diagnosis. Doctors compare the symptoms of bipolar disorder against other conditions. Symptoms of bipolar disorder are common to other conditions. For instance, some people have major depressive episodes without having bipolar disorder. The signs of intoxication can also mimic some symptoms of bipolar disorder. The symptoms of bipolar disorder often resemble the signs of drug use and addiction. Someone going through a manic episode can look and act like someone on cocaine. Both experience an elevated mood and energy. Those having a major depressive episode can also have the same symptoms as someone in withdrawal. If someone with an addiction has a co-occurring bipolar disorder, they need the help of someone trained in making a . Because symptoms of both conditions can overlap, it’s important to see an experienced specialist. Someone with experience can distinguish between symptoms of addiction and bipolar disorder. Addiction Center is not affiliated with any insurance. Treating co-occurring disorders involves tackling both problems at once. Doctors use medications and therapy to treat these conditions. Addicted people with bipolar disorder can get treatment through an inpatient or outpatient rehab. Medication can help people with bipolar disorder and addiction. Addiction treatment medications stifle cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms. The type of addiction medication prescribed depends on the patient’s drug of abuse. Medications for bipolar disorder can calm mood shifts and bring equilibrium to a person’s life. Some medications for bipolar disorder include: Each of these medications helps with either a manic or depressive episode. Doctors may be careful to prescribe benzodiazepines because they are addictive. But benzos may simultaneously help with manic episodes and withdrawal symptoms. helps people with addiction and co-occurring bipolar disorder. CBT addresses the thoughts and feelings that people with these conditions face. By examining the thoughts and feelings that lead to manic and depressive behaviors, addicted people with bipolar disorder can better understand their actions. This helps them prepare for cravings and episodes, so they can manage their behavior. By comparison, it is easier to diagnose an addiction than it is to diagnose bipolar disorder. People who have a history of episodes prior to their drug use are more likely to recognize the underlying mental health issue. However, if the disorder developed as a result of an addiction, it can be harder to tell. The best treatment centers in the country have expertise making dual diagnoses. If you think there is more to your addiction than drug use, you should see an expert in dual diagnosis. to learn more about finding treatment for bipolar disorder and addiction.
