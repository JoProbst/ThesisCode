49571225-8b29-48db-a896-bbd95628e9a3,"What’s Causing My Scalp Psoriasis and How Do I Treat It? is a chronic skin condition causing a buildup of skin cells in different parts of the body. These excess skin cells form silvery-red patches that can flake, itch, crack, and bleed. When psoriasis affects the scalp, it’s called scalp psoriasis. Scalp psoriasis may also affect the back of the ears, forehead, and neck. Scalp psoriasis is a common condition. Experts estimate that psoriasis. If left untreated, it can cause more severe psoriasis symptoms. It also causes chronic inflammation that’s been linked to serious conditions such as: Treatment for scalp psoriasis varies based on its severity and location. Generally, psoriasis treatments to the head, neck, and face are gentler than treatments used on other parts of the body. There is anecdotal evidence that some home treatments may help reduce scalp psoriasis symptoms. These are best used in conjunction with medical treatments that have been proven effective in treating this condition. There are several types of psoriasis, ranging from mild to severe. Scalp psoriasis is a form of , which is the most common type. It causes silvery-red, scaly patches, known as plaques, and can affect any part of the body. Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis that affects the head, face, or neck. Scientists aren’t exactly sure what causes scalp and other kinds of psoriasis. They think it happens when a person’s immune system isn’t working properly. Someone with psoriasis may produce more of certain types of white blood cells called T cells and neutrophils. The job of T cells is to travel through the body, fighting off viruses and bacteria. If a person has too many T cells, they may begin to attack healthy cells by mistake and produce more skin cells and white blood cells. These cells appear on the skin where they cause inflammation, redness, patches, and flaking in the case of scalp psoriasis. Lifestyle and genetics may also be related to psoriasis. The following factors may increase your risk of scalp psoriasis: Having one parent with scalp psoriasis greatly increases your risk of having the condition. You have an even greater risk of developing the condition if both your parents have it. Those with excess weight appear to more commonly develop scalp psoriasis. Those who are also tend to have more skin creases and folds where some inverse psoriasis rashes tend to form. Your risk of psoriasis is increased if you . Smoking also worsens the severity of psoriasis symptoms in those who have it. High levels are linked to psoriasis because stress affects the immune system. Those with recurring infections and compromised immune systems, especially young children and those with HIV, have an increased risk of psoriasis. Those with scalp psoriasis may notice that their symptoms are worsened or triggered by a number of factors. These commonly include: infections, including or skin infections some medications, including lithium, beta-blockers, antimalarial drugs, and iodides Hair loss is a common side effect of scalp psoriasis. Fortunately, hair usually grows back once scalp psoriasis is treated and clears up. Treating scalp psoriasis can prevent severe symptoms, chronic inflammation, and hair loss. The types of treatments you need depends on the severity of your scalp psoriasis. A doctor may combine or rotate several different options based on your needs. Here are some common treatments for scalp psoriasis: The following medical treatments have been proven to treat scalp psoriasis: Anthralin is a cream applied to the scalp for minutes to hours before you wash it off. Follow your doctor’s application and dosage directions. Anthralin is sold under the following brand names in the United States: Drithocreme, Dritho-Scalp, Psoriatec, Zithranol, and Zithranol-RR. Calcipotriene is available as a cream, foam, ointment, and solution. It contains vitamin D, which can change how skin cells grow on parts of the body affected by psoriasis. It’s sold in the United States under the brand names Calcitrene, Dovonex, and Sorilux. This combination of corticosteroid () and vitamin D (calcipotriene) works to relive the redness, swelling, itching, and other symptoms of scalp psoriasis while also changing how skin cells grow on affected areas. In the United States this medication is sold as Enstilar, Taclonex, and Taclonex Scalp. Tazarotene comes as a foam or gel and can be applied to the scalp to ease redness and inflammation associated with scalp psoriasis. It’s sold under the brand names Avage, Fabior, and Tazorac. is an oral medication that can stop skin cells from overgrowing. It must be taken on a fixed schedule determined by your doctor. Brand names sold in the United States include Rheumatrex Dose Pack and Trexall. are oral medications made from vitamin A designed to reduce inflammation and cell growth. It can take anywhere from 2 to 12 weeks to work. It’s sold as acitretin (Soriatane) in the United States. works by calming the immune system and slowing the growth of some kinds of immune cells. It’s taken orally once daily at the same time every day. The efficacy of cyclosporine in treating psoriasis over a long period of time isn’t well understood. Cyclosporine is sold as Gengraf, Neoral, and Sandimmune in the United States. Biologics are injectable medications made from natural substances that reduce the body’s immune response. This can decrease the inflammation and redness caused by psoriasis. Examples include adalimumab () and (Enbrel). Phototherapy is a light therapy that exposes affected skin to ultraviolet light (UV). Ultraviolet B (UVB) is effective in treating psoriasis. Regular sunlight emits a broadband UV light but psoriasis treatment with artificial light is narrow band UVB. Tanning beds aren’t recommended because they use UVA light, not UVB. The use of tanning beds raises the risk of melanoma by . have recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are especially effective for scalp psoriasis. aren’t proven to alleviate scalp psoriasis symptoms. But some people say they can help reduce symptoms when used along with medical treatment. Here are some popular home remedies for scalp psoriasis: cream applied three times a day to the scalp and other effected areas solution, washing over effected areas baking soda and water paste, used to reduce scalp itchiness capsaicin cream, used to reduce flaking, redness, and inflammation or , to moisturize affected areas garlic, pureed and mixed with aloe vera and applied daily as a cream or gel and then rinsed off cream, an herbal treatment that can reduce the body’s immune response to reduce itchiness, inflammation, and flaking taken as fish or plant oil supplements to reduce inflammation sea or Epsom salt bath to reduce redness and inflammation Psoriasis shampoos are a popular home treatment. While you can get medicated shampoos from a doctor, there are many over-the-counter products that can reduce your symptoms without a prescription. Research suggests that the most effective shampoos contain one or many of the following: Avoid peeling your flakes, as that may result in hair loss. If you want to improve the appearance of your scalp psoriasis, experts suggest combing your flakes out gently. Some symptoms, such as redness and flaky skin, are shared by both scalp psoriasis and dermatitis. Both conditions can affect the scalp. While some of the treatments for these conditions overlap, they’re different conditions with different causes. With scalp psoriasis, you’ll notice silvery-red scales that may extend beyond the hairline that cause itching, flaking, and redness. In , scales are yellowish and accompanied by dandruff. Scalp psoriasis is caused by immune dysfunction. Dermatitis is caused by various skin irritants like allergens. A doctor can usually tell the difference between scalp psoriasis and dermatitis by taking a look at the affected area of your skin. In other cases, it might be trickier to tell the difference. Your doctor might perform a skin scrape or take a skin sample called a biopsy. Scalp psoriasis will show an overgrowth of skin cells, while dermatitis will show irritated skin and sometimes bacteria or fungi. See a doctor for any changes in your skin that don’t resolve on their own or with home treatment. They’ll be able to help design a treatment plan appropriate for you. Scalp psoriasis is a common skin disorder causing redness, inflammation, and flaking of the scalp as well as other parts of the head, neck, and face. Home treatments may be helpful in reducing symptoms when used in combination with medical treatments recommended by your doctor. Proper treatment of this condition can help reduce discomfort and risk of serious diseases that are linked to scalp psoriasis.

623cac2f-8c41-4b17-a236-9b10ea98dcd2,"Psoriasis, the skin disease that plagues around 7.5 million Americans, can lead to unsightly flare-ups anywhere on the body, but it can be particularly embarrassing when it occurs on the scalp, where it's harder to hide. Symptoms such as itchiness; redness; raised lesions; flaky, dandruff-like scales; a burning sensation; and temporary hair loss can make the person with psoriasis extremely self-conscious and possibly even depressed. As bad as the appearance of scalp psoriasis can seem, the unpredictability of the condition can be even worse. As a disorder of the immune system, it often goes into remission. Such an event, however, can't be planned -- nor can an outbreak. Another challenge of scalp psoriasis is addressing the many variations of severity. One outbreak might lead to a hardly noticeable patch while another one might cover the entire scalp and even extend to the forehead, back of the neck and the area behind the ears. There is good news, however. If you suffer from scalp psoriasis, you don't have to hang your head in shame or spend weeks covering your scalp with wigs and hats. There are effective treatments -- both medical, over-the-counter and home -- for this condition. To find out what they are and if they'll work for you, check out the following pages. Before you seek a treatment for your scalp psoriasis, it's best to understand what type of outbreak you're experiencing. Psoriasis is usually categorized as mild, moderate or severe. To determine how severe yours is, consider how much of your scalp (or body) is covered by the outbreak. As a general rule of thumb, a moderate psoriasis outbreak tends to cover between 3 percent and 10 percent of the body. To visualize this, look at the size of one of your palms; it's approximately 1 percent of your body. Now, imagine an area three to 10 times that size. If your outbreak is smaller than that visual standard, you probably have mild psoriasis; if it's larger, you can consider your case to be severe. A more straightforward way of evaluating the severity of your condition is to consider the impact it has on your life. If you find your scalp psoriasis symptoms to be particularly bothersome and limiting, then you can likely label your outbreak as severe. Either way, you will want to be sure to share the details of your scalp psoriasis with your doctor so that he or she can provide the best treatment to target your category of outbreak. Find out more about such treatments on the next page. Psoriasis is an immune system disorder in which a T cell (T lymphocyte) attacks healthy skin cells as if they were invaders like bacteria or viruses. As a result, the skin cell growth cycle speeds up. This rapid turnover is what leads to the undesirable symptoms of psoriasis. It makes sense that a treatment for a skin condition is one that would be put on the skin. In fact, one of the most frequently used remedies for scalp psoriasis is a topical medication known as anthralin. It's applied to the scalp, left on for a short period and then washed out. While anthralin is widely used, it does come with some side effects, which include skin irritation and staining. To reduce such complications, you can select a formula that comes with a smaller concentration of the medication. Other types of topical medication for scalp psoriasis include derivatives of vitamins A and D; corticosteroids; and products containing urea, lactic acid and phenol. These treatments are typically available as gels, foams or creams, and come in varying strengths. If you'd like to try a home remedy you can apply topically, consider heated olive oil. It can soften psoriasis scales while moisturizing the scalp and hair. The key is to let the treatment remain on your scalp a few hours while your head remains covered by a towel. You might have seen the next treatment advertised on television. Keep reading to learn more. Approximately one-third of people with psoriasis will develop a moderate form of arthritis known as psoriatic arthritis. If your psoriasis is present on areas of the body other than (or in addition to) the scalp, your doctor might prescribe a prescription medication. There are a variety of treatments he or she might recommend. Sometimes, drugs such as cyclosporine, methoterexate, injectible corticosteroids, oral retinoids or oral vitamin D derivatives are used individually or in combination. For severe cases of psoriasis, a class of drugs known as biologics might be prescribed. These medications, rather than directly targeting symptoms, work by blocking communication between the cells in your immune system. In doing so, they ultimately reduce inflammation. Biologics commonly prescribed for scalp psoriasis include alefacept, efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab. Such medications are highly effective but also potentially dangerous. Because biologics affect the immune system, side effects can include an increased risk for developing serious infections or cancer. On the next page, we'll take a look at treatments that don't require a prescription. There are several different types psoriasis, but the kind that affects the scalp is a form of the most common type of the disorder: plaque psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is known for causing red lesions and silvery scales. If you're experiencing a milder form of scalp psoriasis, you might want to explore the treatment options available at your local drug store. There are a number of potential remedies to consider. Salicylic acid is an ingredient in many medicated shampoos and cleansers. And although it can soften scales, making them easier to remove, it can also make hair more susceptible to temporary loss and breakage. Another popular treatment for scalp psoriasis is tar, which is often found in specially formulated shampoos. Tar is effective, but it does have a tendency to produce a strong odor and stain bedding, linens, clothing and white or gray hair. One way to combat the smell of a tar shampoo is to follow up a wash with a non-medicated conditioner. One more treatment to go. Keep reading to find out what it is. Common triggers for a psoriasis outbreak could include: an infection, scrape, sunburn, cold weather, alcohol consumption and stress and anxiety. Be sure to monitor these things closely if you're someone who suffers from psoriasis outbreaks. Phototherapy might sound complicated, but it's really quite simple. It involves exposing your skin to ultraviolet (UV) light. It's a treatment you can do on your own or have a medical professional perform. Do-it-yourself phototherapy is as simple as exposing your skin to natural sunlight. However, for the best way to do so without also putting yourself at greater risk for sun damage or skin cancer, you should ask your doctor for guidelines. Another option for treating yourself at home is a hand-held UV comb. If you'd like a more thorough treatment, however, you can have a doctor perform phototherapy on you with an excimer laser. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for scalp psoriasis. Talk to your doctor to see which remedies are likely to work best for you. If you undergo a therapy that's too harsh or causes side effects worse than the disease itself, you should consider trying another treatment. You should also be aware that no psoriasis treatment works right away. It can sometimes take up to eight weeks or more to get your symptoms under control. The exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, but there is believed to be a genetic factor to the disease. Other risk factors include obesity; infections like strep throat; smoking; stress; and certain medical conditions, such as HIV. Is the sodium lauryl sulfate in my shampoo killing me?

In very severe cases, there may be some temporary mild hair loss, but scalp psoriasis does not cause permanent balding. is an overlap between psoriasis and another common skin condition, . Sebopsoriasis tends to have less silvery scale than psoriasis and more yellowish, greasy scale. is characterised by thick, yellow-white densely coating the scalp skin and adhering to the hairs as they exit the scalp. The scales are arranged in an overlapping manner like tiles on a roof or flakes of asbestos, hence the name. The underlying scalp skin may appear normal, aside from the scale, or can be reddened or scaly. Pityriasis amiantacea is often present without any apparent underlying cause but may be associated with psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis or (another form of dermatitis). Most patients with scalp psoriasis do not lose hair despite thick plaques. However, and localised bald patches () can occur. Psoriatic alopecia often affects psoriatic plaques (ie, red, scaly, thickened skin) Scratching, combing, pulling off scale can contribute by pulling out clumps of hair The hair usually completely regrows after some time hair shedding can occur () Psoriasis may be associated with other diseases including Treatment might lead to hair loss, for example, due to the oral or Scalp psoriasis requires slightly different regimes from psoriasis affecting the skin elsewhere. This is due to hair, which makes the application of many products difficult and protects the scalp from the effects of ultraviolet light. Unfortunately, many scalp treatments for scalp psoriasis are messy and smelly. Most treatments will need to be used regularly for several weeks before a benefit is seen. Special medicated can be purchased from the chemist. shampoos are suitable for most patients with scalp psoriasis. , ciclopirox, zinc pyrithione and other antifungal shampoos are effective for dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis. They have a varying effect on sebopsoriasis and psoriasis. The shampoos work best if rubbed into the scalp well, and left in for 5 or 10 minutes and then reapplied. They are safe for daily use but may irritate if applied more than twice weekly. If you dislike the smell of , try shampooing again with a favourite brand, and use a conditioner. More severe cases require leave-on scalp applications. Alcohol-based, foam, or forms of and can reduce redness and itch, but they don't lift scale very well.

Reviewed By: Psoriasis is a genetically programmed inflammatory disease that primarily affects the skin in about 3% of people in the United States. Psoriasis is characterized by skin cells that multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. When these cells reach the surface and die, raised, red plaques form that are covered with white scales. Psoriasis begins as a small scaling papule. When multiple papules coalesce, they form scaling plaques. These plaques tend to occur in the scalp, elbows, and knees. Although psoriatic plaques can be limited to only a few small areas, the condition can involve widespread areas of skin anywhere on the body. Psoriasis symptoms vary depending on the type of psoriasis you have. Common psoriasis symptoms can include the following: Small bleeding points when the scale is peeled away Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis and it gets its name from the plaques that build up on the skin. There tend to be well-defined patches of red raised skin that can appear on any area of the skin, but the knees, elbows, scalp, trunk, and nails are the most common locations. There is also a flaky, white buildup on top of the plaques called scales. Possible plaque psoriasis symptoms include skin pain, itching, and cracking. There are plenty of over-the-counter products that are effective in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. 1% hydrocortisone cream is a topical steroid that can suppress mild disease and preparations containing tar are effective in treating plaque psoriasis. Scalp psoriasis is a common skin disorder that makes raised, reddish, often scaly patches. Scalp psoriasis can affect your whole scalp, or just pop up as one patch. This type of psoriasis can even spread to the forehead, the back of the neck, or behind the ears. Scalp psoriasis symptoms may include only slight, fine scaling. Moderate to severe scalp psoriasis symptoms may include dandruff-like flaking, dry scalp, and hair loss. Scalp psoriasis does not directly cause hair loss, but stress and excess scratching or picking of the scalp may result in hair loss. Scalp psoriasis can be treated with medicated shampoos, creams, gels, oils, ointments, and soaps. Salicylic acid and coal tar are two medications in over-the-counter products that help treat scalp psoriasis. Steroid injections and phototherapy may help treat mild scalp psoriasis. Biologics are the latest class of medications that can also help treat severe scalp psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis looks like small, pink dots or drops on the skin. The word guttate is from the Latin word ""gutta,"" meaning drop. There tend to be fine scales with guttate psoriasis that are finer than the scales in plaque psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis is typically triggered by streptococcal infection (strep throat) and the outbreak will usually occur two to three weeks after having strep throat. Guttate psoriasis tends to go away after a few weeks without treatment. Moisturizers can be used to soften the skin. If there is a history of psoriasis, a doctor may take a throat culture to determine if strep throat is present. If the throat culture shows that is present, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Many patients with psoriasis have abnormal nails. Psoriatic nails often have a horizontal white or yellow margin at the tip of the nail called distal onycholysis because the nail is lifted away from the skin. There can often be small pits in the nail plate, and the nail is often yellow and crumbly. The same treatment for skin psoriasis is beneficial for nail psoriasis. However, since nails grow slowly, it may take a while for improvements to be seen. Nail psoriasis can be treated with phototherapy, systemic therapy (medications that spread throughout the body), and steroids (cream or injection). If medications do not improve the condition of nail psoriasis, a doctor may surgically remove the nail. Psoriasis can be associated with a destructive arthritis called psoriatic arthritis. Damage can be serious enough to permanently damage the affected joints. Prevention of joint damage in such cases is very important. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic disease characterized by a form of inflammation of the skin and joints. About 15%-25% of patients with psoriasis also develop an inflammation of their joints. Psoriatic arthritis is a systemic rheumatic disease that can not only cause inflammation of the skin, but in the eyes, heart, kidneys, and lungs as well. Currently, the cause of psoriatic arthritis is unknown, but a combination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors is likely involved. Typically, a patient will have psoriasis months or years before they develop psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis usually involves the knees, ankles, and joints in the feet. There may also be a loss of range of motion of the involved joints as well as joint stiffness. Psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine and the sacrum, which causes pain and stiffness in the low back, buttocks, neck, and upper back. Treatment for psoriatic arthritis generally involves anti-inflammatory medications and exercise. It is important to stretch or take a hot shower before exercise in order to relax the muscles. Ice application after exercise can help minimize soreness and inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also reduce joint inflammation, pain, and stiffness. It is now clear that there is a genetic basis for psoriasis. This hereditary predisposition is necessary before the disease can be triggered by environmental factors. White blood cells called T-cells mediate the development of the psoriatic plaques that are present in the skin. When someone has psoriasis, their body is unable to offer protection from invaders. Instead, inflammation is promoted, and skin cells are on overdrive. When cell growth is increased, old skin cells pile up instead of flaking off, causing psoriasis to occur. Currently, most experts conclude that environmental, genetic and immunologic factors interact to cause this disease. If you have the genetic basis of psoriasis, a trigger can cause psoriasis to flare up. The following are triggers that may set off one’s psoriasis: Trauma to the skin (cut, scrape, bug bite, infection, sunburn) Certain drugs (lithium, high blood pressure and heart medications, beta blockers, antimalarials, indomethacin) No, psoriasis is not contagious. People used to believe that psoriasis was the same as leprosy, but that is not the case. You cannot get psoriasis by touching, kissing, or having sex with someone who has psoriasis. People get psoriasis because of their genes, not their hygiene, diet, lifestyle, or any other habits. Psoriasis is often diagnosed or at least suspected based on its appearance and distribution. However, psoriasis may resemble eczema or other skin diseases and further tests may be required. It may be necessary to remove a small piece of skin (a biopsy) and have it examined by a pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. If there are joint symptoms, X-rays and other laboratory tests may be in order. Psoriasis cannot be cured, but like many other medical conditions, it is controllable with treatment. Your doctor may have you seen by a consultant such as a dermatologist, rheumatologist or immunologist to help diagnose and treat your form of psoriasis. Since psoriasis mainly affects the skin, topical treatments are very useful because they are relatively safe, fairly effective, and can be applied directly to the affected skin. They take the form of lotions, foams, creams, ointments, gels, and shampoos. They include topical steroids, tar preparations, and calcium- modulating drugs. The precise drug used and the form in which it is delivered depends on the areas involved. In widespread disease in patients with more than 10% of the body surface involved, it may not be practical to use topical medication alone. For more extensive psoriasis, a useful option is ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. UV light can treat large areas of skin with few side effects, if performed in the physician’s office. It should be kept in mind that all UV light causes mutational events, which can lead to skin cancer. At this time, the most popular type of UV light for psoriasis is called narrow-band UVB. Only a small portion of the UV light spectrum is used, which seems to be particularly beneficial for psoriasis and may be less carcinogenic. This UVB is quite different from UVA, the wavelength available in tanning salons, which is not effective against psoriasis. Phototherapy can be used alone or with medications when treating psoriasis. Excimer lasers or pulsed dye lasers are used in laser therapy. A pulsed dye laser will create a concentrated beam of yellow light. When this light hits the skin, it converts to heat. The heat then destroys the extra blood vessels in the skin that contribute to psoriasis. Excimer lasers will deliver ultraviolet light to localized areas of the skin that help treat psoriasis. These lasers produce UV light in wavelengths similar to narrow-band UVB. Laser therapy uses intense doses of laser light to help control areas of mild to moderate psoriasis without damaging surrounding healthy skin. These can be quite effective for small plaques of psoriasis, but since only small areas of skin can be treated at once, they are not practical for extensive disease. There are a variety of drugs administered systemically that are useful in controlling psoriasis. As a generalization, most oral medications act by targeting portions of the immune system. One exception is a drug called acitretin (Soriatane), which is structurally similar to vitamin A. Since your immune system is necessary for survival, systemic treatments do have a downside. Drugs like methotrexate and cyclosporine are administered orally and can affect your liver, kidney, and bone marrow. One oral medication called Otezla (apremilast) selectively targets molecules inside immune cells and adjusts (reduces) the processes of inflammation within the cell, which in turn helps treat psoriasis. This drug appears to be considerably safer than most of its predecessors but may also be more expensive. A new class of drugs has recently been developed called biologics; they're called biologics because living cells synthesize them. Since these drugs are proteins, they cannot be administered orally and must be given by injection through the skin or by an intravenous infusion (IV). This treatment is recommended in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. These drugs target the immune response that leads to the rapid skin cell growth of psoriasis. This seems to have increased their safety profile as well as their effectiveness when compared to older drugs. However, they can be expensive. There are many home remedies in the treatment of psoriasis. It is very important to keep the skin moist to avoid dryness. Petroleum jelly, vegetable shortening, or olive oil can be used as moisturizers. Take fewer showers and baths to avoid stripping the skin of its natural oils. Adding salts, oil, or finely ground oatmeal to a bath can soothe the skin. Heliotherapy (medicinal sunbathing) can be effective in controlling psoriasis. There is also evidence that increased body mass is associated with psoriasis and that heavier individuals are more difficult to treat. At the edge of Israel's Dead Sea, there are a group of resorts that cater to psoriasis patients by offering a combination of graded solar exposure and the application of crude coal tar along with a spa-like experience. The Dead Sea is the lowest point on earth, more than 400 meters below sea level. Once the sun’s rays pass through the haze, the harmful ultraviolet rays are filtered out and the remaining rays are highly effective in treating psoriasis. For those with the time and the money, this is a reasonable alternative to standard medical treatment. Although there is no doubt that psoriasis is a potential cause of stress, the evidence that stress causes psoriasis is sparse. However, stress can make psoriasis worse. Dealing with stress with or without psoriasis is a challenge for most people living in the 21st century. The following are tips to reduce stress: The physical effects of psoriasis are frustrating, but the emotional effects can be much worse. Psoriasis may cause your relationships to change and people may treat you differently. Unfortunately, this may lead to stress, which then leads to worsening psoriasis. A doctor may prescribe antidepressant medications if psoriasis is diminishing your quality of life. Support groups can also help you cope with psoriasis by talking to other people who are suffering from the same disease. Take care of your skin and scalp: never pick at patched or scales Avoid medications that cause flare-ups (lithium, propranolol, and quinidine) Get some sun, but not too much: use sunscreen and soak up the sun in 20-minute increments Reduce stress: join a yoga class or get a massage Fall and winter may bring shorter days, colder temperatures, and dry air. These can all lead to worsening psoriasis symptoms. The sun’s ultraviolet light hinders the rapid growth of skin cells that is characteristic of psoriasis. Therefore, spending less time in the sun may cause psoriasis symptoms to flare. The dry weather may remove moisture in your skin so it is important to use moisturizer and/or a humidifier at home. There are many different remedies that may ease psoriasis symptoms. The following is a partial list of alternative medicine to help treat psoriasis: Apple cider vinegar to relieve itch from scalp psoriasis Always consult your doctor before trying new medications, including alternative or naturopathic medicines. There is plenty of evidence that extensive psoriasis can have a significant, negative effect on a patient’s self-image and emotions. This is especially true in social situations, although all aspects of life can be disturbed. Inverse psoriasis (which affects the genital skin) and scalp psoriasis can be particularly troubling. Psoriasis affecting the hands may make it difficult to interact normally with others. It is important to remember that there are ways to manage and treat psoriasis flares. It may seem as if one’s quality of life has diminished, but there are many organizations that offer support to psoriasis patients. The National Psoriasis Foundation is an excellent source of accurate information as well as emotional support for afflicted patients. ""Color Atlas of Cosmetic Dermatology""; Marc R.

3f90204c-507f-4862-a95e-4541fdf6c8b9,"Medically reviewed by — — rashes are difficult to treat, especially when they develop on your scalp. According to the , at least half of all people with psoriasis experience symptoms on the scalp. Given how quickly psoriasis develops and the difficulty of treating scalp psoriasis in particular, you may be considering alternative methods to alleviate the itch and pain. Coconut oil may offer some relief for scalp psoriasis, but it shouldn’t replace the treatment plan outlined by your doctor. Scalp psoriasis is often . Unlike the latter condition, psoriasis is characterized by red, silvery scales that result from increased skin cell turnover. These scales may itch like dermatitis, but they can also burn. Scalp psoriasis may start at one side of the scalp and quickly spread around your whole head. Patches and scales are often most prevalent behind the ears and at the edge of the hairline. This can make camouflaging the condition difficult. Scalp psoriasis outbreaks are usually treated with: The duration and effectiveness of these treatments vary. Psoriasis flare-ups can last for weeks, and even months. Some people use a combination of therapies to manage their psoriasis. This combination may include an such as coconut oil. People with more severe cases of scalp psoriasis may require . is derived from cold-pressed coconut kernels. It contains , a type of fatty acid that has been shown to reduce: Coconut oil is most prominently known as a cooking aid for people looking for a healthier alternative to vegetable oil. In solid form, coconut oil is also used as a skin moisturizer. It can be used as a topical treatment for psoriasis as well. The biggest benefit of the oil is its ability to moisturize the scalp. In fact, it’s sometimes used as a conditioner to hydrate dry scalp and skin, while getting rid of excess sebum (oil). This possibility brings hope to people experiencing dry scales that itch relentlessly. Coconut oil alone may not be a sufficient treatment for psoriasis, but adding such a thick cream to the scalp can potentially help in the removal of scales. Tips for treating scalp psoriasis with coconut oil It’s best to apply the oil after showering. This is when your skin is most capable of trapping in moisture. Leave the oil on for about a half an hour. To increase the benefits, wrap a warm towel around your head. You can warm up towels several different ways: put a damp towel on a plate and microwave for 30 seconds heat water in a tea kettle and pour the water on a towel in a bowl (but be careful, as this makes the towel very hot) When you rinse the coconut oil off of your scalp and out of your hair, massage your scalp with your hands. It’s important to do this gently. Ripping off scales can cause skin irritation and lead to infections. After you’ve finished rinsing, run a comb through your hair. This will help remove any scales caught in your hair. This method can give you temporary relief from excessive dandruff. Without other forms of treatment, the scales will likely come back. Coconut oil is unlikely to make psoriasis worse, but it may not be effective for everyone. Some people have an allergic reaction to coconut oil. Stop using coconut oil if your skin seems to become worse when you use it. You remain at risk of a psoriasis outbreak even when you’re using a moisturizing agent like coconut oil. This is because it can help remove current scales, but it doesn’t prevent new ones from developing. Coconut oil may also interfere with other topical treatments that you’re using, so be sure to ask your doctor before trying it out.

The patches are in places where skin touches skin, such as the armpits, buttocks, upper eyelids, groin and genitals, or under a girl's breasts. The exact cause of psoriasis isn't known. But experts do know that the body's , which fights and diseases, is involved.

For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Vivien Williams. Psoriasis is thought to be an immune system problem that causes the skin to regenerate at faster than normal rates. In the most common type of psoriasis, known as plaque psoriasis, this rapid turnover of cells results in scales and red patches. Just what causes the immune system to malfunction isn't entirely clear. Researchers believe both genetics and environmental factors play a role. The condition is not contagious. Many people who are predisposed to psoriasis may be free of symptoms for years until the disease is triggered by some environmental factor. Common psoriasis triggers include: Infections, such as strep throat or skin infections Injury to the skin, such as a cut or scrape, a bug bite, or a severe sunburn Certain medications — including lithium, high blood pressure medications and antimalarial drugs Rapid withdrawal of oral or systemic corticosteroids What are the risks of vaccinations for people living with psoriasis? Anyone can develop psoriasis. About a third of instances begin in the pediatric years. These factors can increase your risk: The condition runs in families. Having one parent with psoriasis increases your risk of getting the disease, and having two parents with psoriasis increases your risk even more. Because stress can impact your immune system, high stress levels may increase your risk of psoriasis. Smoking tobacco not only increases your risk of psoriasis but also may increase the severity of the disease. Smoking may also play a role in the initial development of the disease. If you have psoriasis, you're at greater risk of developing other conditions, including: Psoriatic arthritis, which causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints Eye conditions, such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis and uveitis Other autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease, sclerosis and the inflammatory bowel disease called Crohn's disease Mental health conditions, such as low self-esteem and depression Psoriasis: What if I get psoriatic arthritis, too?

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development In psoriasis, the life cycle of your skin cells greatly accelerates, leading to a buildup of dead cells on the surface of the epidermis. Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes red, itchy scaly patches, most commonly on the knees, elbows, trunk and scalp. Psoriasis is a common, long-term (chronic) disease with no cure. It tends to go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a while or going into remission. Treatments are available to help you manage symptoms. And you can incorporate lifestyle habits and coping strategies to help you live better with psoriasis. Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis. It usually causes dry, red skin lesions (plaques) covered with silvery scales. Guttate psoriasis, more common in children and adults younger than 30, appears as small, water-drop-shaped lesions on the trunk, arms, legs and scalp. The lesions are typically covered by a fine scale. Psoriasis causes red patches of skin covered with silvery scales and a thick crust on the scalp most often extending just past the hairline that may bleed when removed. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red, inflamed skin. It's more common in overweight people and is worsened by friction and sweating. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Pustular psoriasis generally develops quickly, with pus-filled blisters appearing just hours after your skin becomes red and tender. It can occur in widespread patches or in smaller areas on your hands, feet or fingertips. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover your entire body with a red, peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. Psoriasis signs and symptoms can vary from person to person. Common signs and symptoms include: Red patches of skin covered with thick, silvery scales Psoriasis patches can range from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas. The most commonly affected areas are the lower back, elbows, knees, legs, soles of the feet, scalp, face and palms. Most types of psoriasis go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a time or even going into remission. The most common form, plaque psoriasis causes dry, raised, red skin patches (lesions) covered with silvery scales. The plaques might be itchy or tender, and there may be few or many. They usually appear on elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe cases may cause the nail to crumble. This type primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling lesions on the trunk, arms or legs. This mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. This rare form of psoriasis causes clearly defined pus-filled lesions that occur in widespread patches (generalized pustular psoriasis) or in smaller areas on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover your entire body with a red, peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. Psoriatic arthritis causes swollen, painful joints that are typical of arthritis. Sometimes the joint symptoms are the first or only symptom or sign of psoriasis. And at times only nail changes are seen. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint. It can cause stiffness and progressive joint damage that in the most serious cases may lead to permanent joint damage. If you suspect that you may have psoriasis, see your doctor.

Integration of Homeopathy with Conventional medicine literally from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Godhara to Guwahati; from each state and city, and from thousands of villages as well. Committed to bring the best of homeopathy to you. Since 1985 Dr Rajesh Shah and his team have answered over million queries from patients across the globe Psoriasis on the scalp is a common , which is relatively more difficult to treat as compared to one on the skin. One may present with psoriasis only on the scalp or on the skin and scalp together. In many patients,  exists for several years before it appears on the body. Many times, mild psoriasis on the scalp may be wrongly diagnosed and treated as dandruff. In our experience, we have observed scalp psoriasis more in adults than in children. There is a rise in the diagnosis and detection of  in early teens, in the last five-ten years. Even small kids can be affected. It is equally noticed in both sexes, with a slightly higher percentage in women than men. Psoriasis on the scalp is slightly different than that on the skin. A patient may have psoriasis on the skin first and then the scalp may be affected, or both may be affected simultaneously. Psoriasis on the scalp can be differentiated into three categories, mild, moderate and severe. : The first change noticed may be dryness in the scalp and hair. The hair may feel dry to touch. The second change seen is the development of dandruff. The patient may typically exclaim, ""I thought it was dandruff!"" In such cases, itching may be mild or moderate, which is more irritating and disturbing, in the initial stages. Scratching leads to falling of fine dandruff on the neck and shoulders. The scalp itching is often awkward. The closest differential diagnosis at this stage is seborrhea dermatitis. In seborrhea the scalp is oily, and the dandruff is rather sticky, like sebum and yellowish.  is dry, silvery and scaly. : This stage may be seen a few years after the start of psoriasis. The scalp may show single or multiple patches of scales. The scales may be white or silvery, moderately thick. There may be more concentration behind the ears, temples, occipital and parietal areas. Scales are visible and beneath and surrounding them, the scalp is reddish. 10-20 % of the scalp may be affected. The eyebrows, beard, may show , dryness, and itching.  may be prominent. : In severe cases of scalp psoriasis, there are large crusty patches of scales all over the scalp. The scalp redness is very much marked and the scales and redness many times can be seen beyond the hairline, on the forehead, behind ears and on the back of the neck. Around 50-80 % or more area of the scalp may be affected. The scratching and suffering are unbearable. The scalp may bleed on scratching. There may be superadded fungal or bacterial infections. If the patient does not have psoriasis on the body, after this stage, psoriasis generally spreads to other parts of the body. Psoriasis on the scalp responds very well to homeopathy. The scalp redness reduces, the itching reduces and the scaling reduces. The recurrence is brought under good control. Homeopathy treats psoriasis by correcting the internal immune imbalance, irrespective of the location of psoriasis. There are certainly more commonly used medicines especially when psoriasis affects the scalp. The scalp psoriasis may respond slower, in comparison to psoriasis on the skin. If a patient has psoriasis on the skin and on the scalp, the skin form responds earlier, the scalp psoriasis responds later, however, that is not a rule. Homeopathy does not suggest any use of cortisone based medication for scalp psoriasis. Some patients have good relief by using scalp moisturizers; the best-being hair oil, some patients get severe discomfort by using hair oil. Each patient must use his or her own discretion.Tar shampoo and anti-dandruff shampoo are useful and can be used in association with homeopathic treatment.

Scalp psoriasis vs. seborrheic dermatitis: What's the difference? Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. How does a doctor tell the difference between scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp? Your doctor can usually tell whether you have scalp psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis or both based on an examination of your skin, scalp and nails. Scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis are common conditions that affect the scalp. In addition, they share some similar signs and symptoms, such as red, scaly skin. Most often, the scales of psoriasis are thicker and somewhat drier in appearance than are the scales of seborrheic dermatitis. Psoriasis has more of a tendency to extend beyond the hairline. In addition, psoriasis usually affects more than one area of the body. If you have scalp psoriasis, you may also have mild psoriasis on your elbows, knees, hands or feet or may notice subtle nail changes, such as pitting. Patches that may extend beyond the hairline or appear on other parts of the body Red skin covered with greasy-looking white or yellowish scales Skin flakes (dandruff) that may attach to the hair shaft Scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp share some similar treatments, including medicated shampoos and topical corticosteroid or antifungal solutions. Scalp psoriasis is often persistent and more difficult to treat than is seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. Additional treatments, such as phototherapy, may be required to bring psoriasis under better control. Sasseville D.

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Anyone with psoriasis knows how painful a flare-up can be. With its accompanying , psoriasis can seriously rain on your parade. But these eight beauty and fashion bloggers with psoriasis don’t let the condition cramp their style. In fact, they’ve found tricks and tools not only to cope with psoriasis but also look fabulous doing it. Once you read their tips, you’ll understand why they’ve amassed quite a following. Here’s how fashion and beauty pros manage their psoriasis flare-ups with enviable skills, and how you can too. Los Angeles-based beauty vlogger says she’d had psoriasis for 10 years when her father discovered her favorite product. He was researching ways to clear up scalp psoriasis when he stumbled on , which his daughter swears by. “It’s 100 percent natural and works great for psoriasis on your scalp and helping boost new hair growth,” she says. “I used to hate wearing black because my scalp psoriasis would show on my clothes. But since I started using neem oil, I can wear black as much as I like to.” When her scalp is particularly dry and itchy, she applies neem oil once a week for an hour before washing her hair. When she’s not having a flare-up, she uses Jamaican black castor oil instead to keep her scalp moisturized. On her skin, Hutchinson says African black soap and cortisone cream soothe breakouts. She also likes because it’s organic and made for sensitive skin. Hutchinson loves cotton clothes and avoids anything that doesn’t stretch. She says Whole Foods’s eco-friendly clothing line may be good for women with sensitive skin.

She says both products soothe itching. “They’re better than anything I’ve ever been prescribed by doctors,” she says. Owen has suffered with eczema, allergies, and asthma her entire life and was diagnosed four years ago with psoriasis. “Flare-ups used to be really terrible for me. I had psoriasis all over my body—23 patches to be precise. I once counted!” After having UV treatment, she’s temporarily rid her body of psoriasis, but she still has flare-ups on her face and scalp. “They’re both incredibly dry and itchy. Sometimes it can be unbearable.” To keep from irritating sore skin, Owen avoids makeup when she has psoriasis on her face. “I know it’s tough when you’re feeling self-conscious, but your skin needs to breathe and recover.” She also recommends not wear clingy or synthetic fabrics. Instead, she recommends natural fibers like cotton, which are kinder to sensitive skin. During flare-ups, she wears airy tops and dresses on warmer days and soft trousers on chillier ones to keep irritation to a minimum. She tops off every look with a handbag. “Sometimes I even base my outfits around handbags. Plus, you can never have enough of them!” I cover up breakouts with green concealer, priming spray, and setting spray British beauty vlogger says she never covers up her skin to please other people. “I don’t care if people stare or ask questions. I use it as an opportunity to educate them and raise awareness,” she says. Bateman loves beauty products and swears by moisturizing and priming skin, particularly during bad psoriasis breakouts. “It creates blank skin ready for foundation.” She turns to for her face. Then she applies Urban Decay B6 Vitamin-Infused Complexion Prep Priming Spray before applying makeup.

During flare-ups, she’ll hit the bath sometimes every day with an extra dose of sea salt. “When my psoriasis is bad, the only time I’m not in pain is in the bath.” She also applies coconut oil on her skin every morning and night and uses , which contains salicylic acid and coconut oil to help with flakes. To cover redness, Bateman uses , or prime and conceal creams before foundation. “I go through it like nobody’s business!” she says. For the best coverage, Bateman swears by and concealer. (She suggests testing them on a small patch of skin first to make sure they don’t irritate you). She finishes with a spritz of Urban Decay Chill Cooling and Hydrating Makeup Setting Spray. “It takes down the burning, and it’s super hydrating.” I prevent irritation by avoiding products with fragrances, parabens, and sulfates Sabrina Skiles, the 32-year-old style blogger of , says she loves and r because the line is fragrance-free. The oatmeal in the product soothes dry, itchy skin. “It leaves my face feeling soft and clean, not heavy and thick like other face cleansers.” For her hair, she sticks with the sulfate-free . On her face, she likes the line, which is paraben-free and sulfate-free. Some that paraben, a common ingredient in moisturizers, often causes skin allergies. Skiles says stress, alcohol, and environmental changes are triggers for her psoriasis. Over the past 15 years, her flare-ups have appeared in random patches on her elbows, knees, and scalp most severely. During flare-ups, moisturizing daily is key. “It makes it easier to apply makeup. And I don’t feel the need to pile it on thick.” She uses since it’s lightweight. “Once your skin’s hydrated, a little foundation and blush will go a long way,” she adds. As for her clothes, Skiles says fabrics like viscose, cotton, or jersey, look put-together while allowing your skin to breathe. Polyester and wool are no-no’s! Accessories like a bright scarf or statement necklace help take her mind off psoriasis flare-ups. “Embrace your flare-ups. If you’re not feeling like yourself, grab a light sweater, put on that chunky necklace, and grab a cute bag. Let these be the conversation starters!” When Helen Hanrahan, author of the Dublin, Ireland-based blog is having a psoriasis flare-up, she enjoys some me-time to take her mind off things. “The little bit of pampering gives you a lift, and your newly painted nails will give you something pretty to focus on and distract you from your skin.” For the past three years, Hanrahan has been on a biologic drug that has stopped her psoriasis flare-ups. But for nearly 20 years before, her skin was constantly problematic, especially during stressful times. To manage her psoriasis, Hanrahan swears by and . “It was created by someone who suffers from scalp psoriasis so it’s very gentle and non-irritating.” For her skin, she likes natural products that contain seaweed, like the Irish brands and face and body moisturizers. “Use tons and tons of moisturizer before applying makeup to ensure that your makeup stays in place and doesn’t dry out your skin too much.” Her go-to camouflage makeup: and . For those with scalp psoriasis, Hanrahan suggests skipping dark tops. “They highlight the problem. Make paler shades such as white, taupe, grey, cream, or beige your go-to colors.” She avoids lace too, since it can scratch and highlight inflamed skin. “I find accessories are great for distracting the eye if your psoriasis is bad — scarves, costume jewelry, jaunty fedoras.” I exfoliate psoriasis flakes with my Clarisonic brush Beauty vlogger says that while it won’t work for everyone with psoriasis, she swears by her . “The very gentle exfoliation helps to prep my skin for a smoother makeup application.” Branch’s go-to day and night cream is SheaMoisture African Black Soap Problem Skin Moisturizer. She says it’s hydrating without being too greasy. She loves the brand’s cleansers and shampoos as well, crediting the natural ingredients for their minimal irritation. To keep her scalp hydrated and flakes at bay, she says coconut, olive, and avocado oils are a must. During flare-ups, Branch tries to avoid makeup. When she does use it, she makes sure to moisturize with a heavy cream and then apply a face primer. “The extra barrier may help protect your skin from makeup, hopefully causing less irritation. When you’re done with your day, wash off the makeup as soon as you can.” I soak in a bentonite clay bath at least once a week Fashion blogger Katie Rose says one of her favorite psoriasis cures is bentonite clay baths. She buys a clay online and adds a few scoops to her bath. Then she soaks for a good 20 minutes once or twice a week. “The bentonite clay helps draw toxins out from my skin and improves my psoriasis symptoms. It’s cleared my skin up a few times and is definitely something I recommend for any skin problems, not just psoriasis,” she says. She also loves relaxing in a warm bath with sunflower and fractioned coconut oil, which also help soften psoriasis scales. To minimize flare-ups, Rose avoids skincare products with parabens, sulfates, and fragrance. “I’ve found they make my psoriasis a million times worse and irritate my skin, making it sore.” Instead, she moisturizes with the recommended by her doctor. To cover up psoriasis scars, Rose likes . “I’ve been using it for over 15 years now, and it’s a lifesaver. It hides everything, so I can wear my little black dress whenever I want. I love a good night out getting dolled up, and psoriasis won’t stop me looking good.” Glasgow-based blogger Jude Duncan of says moisturizer and mascara are all she needs when she’s having a flare-up. “Putting foundation or other products on your psoriasis will only make it worse! Keep it light, and your skin will be so grateful,” she says. For the past four years, Duncan has battled psoriasis on her face and scalp. To manage breakouts, Duncan uses Aveeno for Sensitive Skin shampoo twice a week and shower gel two times a day. They’re gentle on her skin and affordable. “They’re the only products that don’t irritate my psoriasis and don’t smell like tar.” For her face, she loves . “It’s so light but gives you amazing skin.” These eight fashion and beauty bloggers remind us to put our best foot forward, no matter what qualities we may not love about ourselves.

88e9d30d-3e4c-42a8-ba94-746b39e3f876,"Medically reviewed by — Psoriasis causes new skin cells to grow too fast, leaving a chronic buildup of dry, itchy, and sometimes painful skin. Prescription medication can treat the condition, but home management also makes a difference. One aspect of managing psoriasis at home is considering what soaps and shampoos you use. Some may actually help relieve dryness and itchiness — or at the very least avoid making them worse. Here are a few things to consider when searching for shampoos and soaps that are good for skin with psoriasis. Choosing the right soaps and shampoos may be just one part of your treatment plan, but it can play an important role in keeping your skin hydrated and easing your psoriasis symptoms. Selecting shampoos with the right ingredients depends on the type of psoriasis in the scalp, says Dr. Kelly M. Cordoro, a member of the Society of Pediatric Dermatology. “If it is very thick and stuck to the hair, look for salicylic acid (gently removes thick scales). If a patient also has dandruff, look for sulfur or zinc ingredients to help with the flaking and itching. These ingredients are contained in shampoos available without a prescription,” she explains. Cordoro also notes that a doctor may prescribe medicated shampoos that contain anti-inflammatory ingredients, such as cortisone, if the psoriasis itches and is very red and inflamed. The notes that coal tar shampoo can help ease the symptoms of psoriasis on the scalp. Some over-the-counter products contain low enough amounts of coal tar that they don’t require a prescription. Experts generally agree that those who have psoriasis should choose gentle, hydrating soaps and steer clear of formulas that can dry out or irritate the skin. “Anything gentle and moisturizing is best, and it is important to moisturize as soon as possible after bathing,” says Dr. Robin Evans, a dermatologist in Stamford, Connecticut. “Soap with glycerin and other lubricating ingredients would be best, and avoid fragrances and deodorant soaps.” Other gentle cleansing agents to consider include: “All of these would help cleanse psoriatic skin with little risk of overdrying,” says Dr. Daniel Friedmann, a dermatologist at Westlake Dermatology in Austin, Texas. Check the ingredient label on any shampoo or soap bottle and you’ll find an alphabet soup list of cleansing agents, fragrances, and pigments, including titanium dioxide, cocamidopropyl betaine, and sodium laureth sulfate. And while these ingredients can all assist with the spa-like enjoyment of cleansing the body, there are some that might not be great for people who have psoriasis. “There are no ‘harmful’ shampoo ingredients in general for patients with psoriasis, but some ingredients may sting, burn, or irritate the scalp,” Cordoro says. “We often ask patients to avoid shampoos with lots of fragrances and dyes.” Alcohols and retinoids are also ingredients that can inflame the skin, says Dr. Jessica Kaffenberger, a dermatologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. These ingredients can often be listed on a label as: There are plenty of shampoo brands available that can help ease the discomfort of psoriasis, including MG217 Therapeutic Sal Acid Shampoo + Conditioner and MG217 Therapeutic Coal Tar Scalp Treatment, says Kaffenberger. These formulas are recommended by the National Psoriasis Foundation. They include coal tar and salicylic acid, which are very helpful in dislodging the thick scales from the scalp, she says. People with psoriasis are also more likely to have heavy dandruff, so anti-dandruff shampoos, such as Head & Shoulders or Selsun Blue, are also helpful, according to Kaffenberger. If you have thick scaling spots on your scalp, elbows, knees, or buttocks, you may be dealing with more than stubborn dry skin. Kaffenberger notes that these symptoms indicate that it’s time to get checked by a doctor. She explains that untreated psoriasis can lead to systemic inflammation and potentially increase the risk of developing other conditions, such as: Friedmann also notes that the earlier someone begins treatment, the easier it may be to manage the signs and symptoms of the condition. “Scalp psoriasis may lead to persistent itching and scalp sensitivity, which may interfere with normal activities,” he says.

Scalp psoriasis, which involves red, itchy areas with silvery-white scales that often extend beyond the hairline, can be tricky to treat. Scratching can worsen the condition and your hair can prevent medication from reaching your scalp. A scale softener containing salicylic acid can help loosen scales on your scalp and allow medication to work better. Apply the scale softener directly to your scalp. Don't pick at your scalp scales. This can cause hair loss and trigger a scalp psoriasis flare. Over-the-counter medicated shampoos can be effective at treating scalp psoriasis. Choose one that contains coal tar or salicylic acid to ease itchiness and remove scales. Be gentle when washing your scalp to avoid irritation. Scratching your scalp can make your psoriasis worse, as well as cause bleeding and hair loss. Shampoos containing coal tar or menthol can help reduce itching. If itchiness continues, your doctor might recommend that you take an oral antihistamine medication to provide relief. Your doctor might recommend the topical treatments anthralin, calcipotriene (Dovonex), tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage) or a combination of betamethasone and calcipotriene (Taclonex). Side effects vary. Anthralin stains anything it comes into contact with and calcipotriene, tazarotene, and betamethasone and calcipotriene can cause skin irritation. Follow your doctor's directions for when and how long to use the medication. If your scalp psoriasis is severe, you might need a medication that affects your entire body (systemic). Light therapy also might be helpful. Talk to your doctor to see what treatment might work best for you. Psoriasis: How can I protect my skin during a workout? Feldman SR, et al.

Paediatric psoriasis — codes and concepts Psoriasis is a skin condition that occurs in children and adults. The typical appearance is of red, thickened, patches on the skin (). These plaques can vary in size and from person to person. In some people, it may affect small areas of skin while others may have large areas covering their body. Each of the patterns of psoriasis described in adults can be seen in children.

Psoriasis has a strong component and is due to abnormal processes involved in the regulation of the immune system. Individuals may have flares of psoriasis in response to , injury, medications and (particularly streptococcal tonsillitis). Psoriasis is not contagious, therefore, affected children do not need to be isolated from other children. The diagnosis of psoriasis is usually made clinically.

They favour certain sites such as scalp, elbows and knees; or; skin folds such as behind ears, armpits and groin.

A hospital-based course of treatment usually requires attendance 3 times weekly for 6 to 12 weeks. and are available in some centres. tablets prescribed off-label once weekly are useful in children that have not improved satisfactorily with topical preparations or phototherapy. The data on the use of methotrexate is less extensive in children compared to adults. However, several case reports have shown significant clinical improvement in children as young as 2 years old, with excellent tolerance. Regular blood tests are required to monitor safety. (e.g. and intravenous injections) should only be used in children with severe psoriasis that does not respond to other therapies. Biologics are considered to be safe in children although serious adverse effects (especially infection) have been reported.

Paediatric psoriasis — codes and concepts Psoriasis is a skin condition that occurs in children and adults. The typical appearance is of red, thickened, patches on the skin (). These plaques can vary in size and from person to person. In some people, it may affect small areas of skin while others may have large areas covering their body. Each of the patterns of psoriasis described in adults can be seen in children. These include: (thick found on areas of the scalp) (nail related to psoriasis) (small red plaques occurring after an ) (red plaques with occurring anywhere on the body) (severe reddening covering most or all of the body) (severe that arise acutely) psoriasis (affecting areas of sun exposure) , and psoriasis are particularly common in children. Psoriasis has a strong component and is due to abnormal processes involved in the regulation of the immune system. Individuals may have flares of psoriasis in response to , injury, medications and (particularly streptococcal tonsillitis). Psoriasis is not contagious, therefore, affected children do not need to be isolated from other children. The diagnosis of psoriasis is usually made clinically. This involves a doctor examining the skin and making the diagnosis based on the appearance of the affected areas. They favour certain sites such as scalp, elbows and knees; or; skin folds such as behind ears, armpits and groin. Occasionally, a may be necessary to distinguish psoriasis from other skin conditions that may appear similar. Assessing the severity of psoriasis can assist in deciding upon the most appropriate course of treatment. The severity of psoriasis can be determined in the following ways: estimate a (psoriasis area and severity index). See also  use a questionnaire to assess a person’s quality of life. Individuals with severe psoriasis are best managed by a specialist . Children and adolescents with psoriasis can experience significant and may require input from a dermatologist, paediatrician and counsellors. What treatment is available for children with psoriasis? Although there is no cure, several treatment options are available to manage psoriasis. Topical therapies are suitable for all children with psoriasis and may be all that is required for mild to moderate psoriasis. Vitamin D such as are applied to plaques twice daily are available in different potencies and and are usually used for short courses or no more often than 2-3 times per week long-term preparations are usually used short-contact but are tricky to use because they stain and can irritate the skin may be suitable for use in children with psoriasis that does not affect the face or genitals.

In (), the hair loss often presents itself as either a receding hairline, loss of hair on the () of the scalp or a combination of both, while in (), it typically presents as a thinning of the hair. Male pattern hair loss seems to be due to a combination of genetics and circulating . The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear. Management may include simply accepting the condition. Otherwise, common medical treatments include , , , or . Use of finasteride and dutasteride in women is not well-studied, and it may result in if taken during . Pattern hair loss by the age of 50 affects about half of males and a quarter of females. It is the most common cause of . Weight training and other types of physical activity cause baldness Baldness can be caused by emotional stress, sleep deprivation, etc. Bald men are more 'virile' or sexually active than others Classic male-pattern hair loss begins above the and at the vertex () of the . As it progresses, a rim of hair at the sides and rear of the head remains. This has been referred to as a 'Hippocratic wreath', and rarely progresses to complete baldness. Pattern hair loss is classified as a form of non-scarring hair loss. Female-pattern hair loss more often causes diffuse thinning without hairline recession; similar to its male counterpart, female androgenic alopecia rarely leads to . The grades severity of female-pattern hair loss. These include Grades 1, 2, 3 of balding in women based on their scalp showing in the front due to thinning of hair. Androgens can interact with the to cause hair loss is the only that is regulated by . This sensitivity to androgens was acquired by and is not shared with their great ape cousins. Although Winter et al. found that KRT37 is expressed in all the hair follices of chimpanzees, it was not detected in the head hair of modern humans. As androgens are known to grow hair on the body but decrease it on the scalp, this lack of scalp KRT37 may help explain the paradoxical nature of as well as the fact that head hair anagen cycles are extremely long. Research indicates that the initial programming of of hair follicles begins . The physiology is primarily , with (DHT) being the major contributor at the . Men with premature androgenic tend to have lower than normal values of (SHBG), (FSH), , and when compared to men without pattern hair loss. Although hair follicles were previously thought to be permanently gone in areas of complete hair loss, they are more likely dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the from which the follicles arose. have shown that growth and dormancy of hair follicles are related to the activity of (IGF) at the dermal papillae, which is affected by DHT. are important in male sexual development around birth and at puberty. They regulate , hair growth, and libido. With increasing age, androgens stimulate hair growth on the face, but can suppress it at the temples and scalp vertex, a condition that has been referred to as the 'androgen paradox'. Men with androgenic alopecia typically have higher , higher total testosterone, higher unbound/free testosterone, and higher free androgens, including DHT. 5-alpha-reductase converts free testosterone into DHT, and is highest in the scalp and prostate gland. DHT is most commonly formed at the tissue level by 5α-reduction of testosterone. The genetic corollary that codes for this enzyme has been discovered. has also been suggested to have different effects on the hair follicle across gender. Also, crosstalk occurs between androgens and the signaling pathway that leads to hair loss. At the level of the somatic , androgens promote differentiation of facial hair dermal papillae, but inhibit it at the scalp. Other research suggests the and its product (PGD2) in hair follicles as contributive. These observations have led to study at the level of the dermal papillae. are present at in papillae of individual . They catalyze formation of the androgens testosterone and DHT, which in turn regulate hair growth. Androgens have different effects at different follicles: they stimulate at facial hair, leading to growth, but can also stimulate , , , and at the scalp, leading to miniaturization. Hair follicles in express four different . Significant levels of inflammatory infiltrate have been found in transitional hair follicles. Interleukin 1 is suspected to be a cytokine mediator that promotes hair loss. The fact that hair loss is cumulative with age while androgen levels fall as well as the fact that finasteride does not reverse advanced stages of androgenetic alopecia remains a mystery but some possible explanations have been put forward: Higher conversion of testosterone to DHT locally with age as higher levels of 5-alpha reductase are noted in balding scalp, and higher levels of damage in the dermal papilla as well as of the dermal papilla due to androgen receptor activation and environmental stress. The mechanism by which the androgen receptor triggers dermal papilla permanent senescence is not known but may involve , TGFB-1 and oxidative stress. Senescence of the dermal papilla is measured by lack of mobility, different size and shape, lower replication and altered output of molecules and different expression of markers. The dermal papilla is the primary location of androgen action and its migration towards the hair bulge and subsequent signaling and size increase are required to maintain the hair follicle so senescence via the androgen receptor explains much of the physiology. and mesenchymal dermal papilla, labelled at top The diagnosis of androgenic alopecia can be usually established based on clinical presentation in men. In women, the diagnosis usually requires more complex diagnostic evaluation. Further evaluation of the differential requires exclusion of other causes of hair loss, and assessing for the typical progressive hair loss pattern of androgenic alopecia. can be used for further evaluation. Biopsy may be needed to exclude other causes of hair loss, and would demonstrate perifollicular fibrosis. The has been developed to grade androgenic alopecia in males by severity. is a medication of the 5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) class. By inhibiting type II 5-AR, finasteride prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in various tissues including the scalp. Increased hair on the scalp can be seen within three months of starting finasteride treatment and longer-term studies have demonstrated increased hair on the scalp at 24 and 48 months with continued use. Treatment with finasteride more effectively treats male-pattern hair loss at the vertex than male-pattern hair loss at the front of the head and temples. is a medication in the same class as finasteride but inhibits both type I and type II 5-alpha reductase. Dutasteride is approved for the treatment of male-pattern hair loss in and , but not in the United States. However, it is commonly used off-label to treat male-pattern hair loss. Minoxidil dilates small blood vessels; it is not clear how this causes hair to grow. Other treatments include combined with minoxidil, shampoo, dermarolling (), , , and (fluridil). There is evidence supporting the use of minoxidil as a safe and effective treatment for female pattern hair loss, and there is no significant difference in efficiency between 2% and 5% formulations. Finasteride was shown to be no more effective than placebo based on low-quality studies. The effectiveness of laser-based therapies is unclear. More advanced cases may be resistant or unresponsive to medical therapy and require . Naturally occurring units of one to four hairs, called , are excised and moved to areas of . These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in close proximity and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained from either (FUT) or (FUE). In the former, a strip of skin with follicular units is extracted and dissected into individual follicular unit grafts, and in the latter individual hairs are extracted manually or robotically. The surgeon then implants the grafts into small incisions, called recipient sites. Cosmetic scalp tattoos can also mimic the appearance of a short, buzzed haircut. Many people use unproven treatments. Regarding female pattern alopecia, there is no evidence for , minerals, or other dietary supplements. As of 2008, there is little evidence to support the use of lasers to treat male-pattern hair loss. The same applies to special lights. Dietary supplements are not typically recommended. A 2015 review found a growing number of papers in which plant extracts were studied but only one randomized controlled clinical trial, namely a study in 10 people of . Androgenic alopecia is typically experienced as a ""moderately stressful condition that diminishes satisfaction"". However, although most men regard baldness as an unwanted and distressing experience, they usually are able to cope and retain integrity of personality. Although baldness is not as common in women as in men, the psychological effects of hair loss tend to be much greater. Typically, the frontal hairline is preserved, but the density of hair is decreased on all areas of the scalp. Previously, it was believed to be caused by testosterone just as in male baldness, but most women who lose hair have normal testosterone levels. Female androgenic alopecia has become a growing problem that, according to the , affects around 30 million women in the . Although hair loss in females normally occurs after the age of 50 or even later when it does not follow events like , , , and among others, it is now occurring at earlier ages with reported cases in women as young as 15 or 16. Certain studies have suggested androgenic alopecia conveys survival advantage Studies have been inconsistent across cultures regarding how balding men rate on the attraction scale. While a 2001 South Korean study showed that most people rated balding men as less attractive, a 2002 survey of Welsh women found that they rated bald and gray-haired men quite desirable. One of the proposed social theories for male pattern hair loss is that men who embraced complete baldness by subsequently signaled dominance, high social status, and/or longevity. Biologists have hypothesized the larger sunlight-exposed area would allow more to be synthesized, which might have been a ""finely tuned mechanism to prevent prostate cancer"" as the malignancy itself is also associated with higher levels of DHT. However, this argument is weak considering the fact that baldness is very rare in East Asians. In addition, early hominins such as the do not possess any of the balding variants on the various association loci, who presumably would have been under positive selection for increased vitamin D synthesis. An ancient phenomenon:Greek philosophers with and without much hair (from left to right: , , , and , fifth to third centuries BC) Many myths exist regarding the possible causes of baldness and its relationship with one's , intelligence, ethnicity, job, , wealth, and many other characteristics. Weight training and other types of physical activity cause baldness Because it increases testosterone levels, many Internet forums have put forward the idea that weight training and other forms of exercise increase hair loss in predisposed individuals. Although scientific studies do support a correlation between exercise and testosterone, no direct study has found a link between exercise and baldness. However, a few have found a relationship between a sedentary life and baldness, suggesting some exercise is beneficial. The type or quantity of exercise may influence hair loss. Testosterone levels are not a good marker of baldness, and many studies actually show paradoxical low testosterone in balding persons, although research on the implications is limited. Baldness can be caused by emotional stress, sleep deprivation, etc. Emotional has been shown to accelerate baldness in genetically susceptible individuals. Stress due to in military recruits lowered testosterone levels, but is not noted to have affected SHBG. Thus, stress due to sleep deprivation in fit males is unlikely to elevate DHT, which is one cause of male pattern baldness. Whether sleep deprivation can cause hair loss by some other mechanism is not clear. Bald men are more 'virile' or sexually active than others Levels of free testosterone are strongly linked to libido and DHT levels, but unless free testosterone is virtually nonexistent, levels have not been shown to affect virility. Men with androgenic alopecia are more likely to have a higher baseline of free androgens. However, sexual activity is multifactoral, and androgenic profile is not the only determining factor in baldness. Additionally, because hair loss is progressive and free testosterone declines with age, a male's hairline may be more indicative of his past than his present disposition. Many misconceptions exist about what can help prevent hair loss, one of these being that lack of sexual activity will automatically prevent hair loss. While a proven direct correlation exists between increased frequency of and increased levels of DHT, as shown in a recent study by , the study suggests that ejaculation frequency may be a sign, rather than a cause, of higher DHT levels. Another study shows that although sexual arousal and masturbation-induced orgasm increase testosterone concentration around orgasm, they reduce testosterone concentration on average, and because about 5% of testosterone is converted to DHT, ejaculation does not elevate DHT levels. The only published study to test correlation between ejaculation frequency and baldness was probably large enough to detect an association (1390 subjects) and found no correlation, although persons with only vertex androgenetic alopecia had fewer female sexual partners than those of other androgenetic alopecia categories (such as frontal or both frontal and vertex). One study may not be enough, especially in baldness, where there is a complex with age. Marital status has been shown in some studies to influence hair loss in cross-sectional studies (NHANES1), although the direction of effect cannot be inferred from a cross sectional study. Male pattern hair loss is also known as androgenic alopecia, androgenetic alopecia (AGA), alopecia androgenetica, and male pattern baldness (MPB). Animal models of androgenic alopecia occur naturally and have been developed in ; (); (); and ( and ). Of these, macaques have demonstrated the greatest incidence and most prominent degrees of hair loss. Baldness is not a trait unique to human beings. One possible case study is about a male in the area. The Tsavo lion prides are unique in that they frequently have only a single male lion with usually seven or eight adult females, as opposed to four females in other lion prides. Male lions may have heightened levels of , which could explain their reputation for aggression and dominance, indicating that lack of mane may at one time have had an alpha correlation. Although primates do not go bald, their hairlines do undergo recession. In infancy the hairline starts at the top of the supraorbital ridge, but slowly recedes after puberty to create the appearance of a small forehead. Vary JC, Jr (November 2015).

8a2bc39a-b09a-4b68-a6a2-488ae2934e13,"Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT — Taking your medication as directed by your doctor is the first step in preventing psoriasis flare-ups. You can also do other things to minimize symptoms and get relief quickly. Here are 10 to consider. Keeping your skin lubricated can go a long way in preventing or worsening dry, itchy skin caused by a psoriasis flare-up. It can also help reduce redness and heal the skin, making your flare-up easier to manage. The recommends using heavy creams or ointments that lock in water. Look for moisturizers that are fragrance-free or alcohol-free. Fragrances and alcohol can actually dry out your skin. If you’re looking for a natural or cost-effective solution, you can use cooking oils or shortening to keep your skin moisturized. When in doubt, ask your dermatologist for a recommendation. Take shorter showers with lukewarm water to help protect your skin’s moisture. Be sure to use fragrance-free soaps. Always apply moisturizer after showering, washing your face, or washing your hands. Add oil to bathwater if you prefer taking baths, or are looking to soothe dry, itchy skin. Soaking in Epsom or Dead Sea salts is recommended for itchy skin. Be sure to limit your bath time to 15 minutes and moisturize immediately afterward. Try putting your creams or moisturizers in the refrigerator. This can help soothe the burning sensation that often accompanies the itching during a flare-up. Try to resist the urge to scratch or rub your scalp during a flare-up. Doing so can cause bleeding, scabbing, and even hair loss. Avoid using shampoos containing fragrance and alcohol. These products can dry out the scalp and worsen or even cause more flare-ups. When washing your hair, be gentle. Avoid scratching or scrubbing your scalp. A scale softener that contains salicylic acid can help soften and loosen patches of psoriasis plaque during a flare-up. Stress can cause flare-ups because your body copes with stress through inflammation. The immune systems of people with psoriasis release too many of the chemicals that are released during an infection or injury. Speak to your doctor if your psoriasis is causing you stress and anxiety. They may be able to offer suggestions for coping with stress. They can also refer you to a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or social worker. Practicing meditation or yoga, exercising, or spending time doing things you enjoy can also reduce your stress levels. You may find it helpful to connect with others who have psoriasis. Check with your local hospital for a psoriasis support group, or search online for one in your area. Researchers haven’t found a link confirming diet to psoriasis. However, evidence suggests that what you eat might increase your risk for psoriasis and could affect how well your psoriasis responds to treatment. Eating a healthy diet could also help reduce the severity of flare-ups. A found that people who had overweight or obesity and psoriasis experienced a reduction in the severity of their psoriasis with a healthier diet and more exercise. Nutritional supplements or foods containing omega-3 fatty acids may also help with your psoriasis, according to the . Omega-3 fatty acids have been linked to a decrease in inflammation. Speak with your doctor before increasing the amount of fish oil in your diet. High amounts may thin the blood and aren’t recommended for people taking blood thinners. Joining a local support group can help you connect with others who understand some of the challenges involved with living with psoriasis. Plus, a support group will help you realize you’re not alone. You’ll also have the opportunity to share ideas for managing psoriasis symptoms with others. 6. Choose an over-the-counter treatment that contains coal tar Coal tar solutions can ease psoriasis symptoms. They’re often found in local drugstores and include: Treatments you can buy without a doctor’s prescription often cost less. Your doctor may include coal tar as part of a treatment plan. psoriasis on the palms of hands and soles of feet (palmoplantar psoriasis) You’re taking medication that makes you more sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light. Quitting smoking can have the following benefits for people with psoriasis: reduced risk of inflammation that affects the heart, liver, blood vessels, and gums reduced chance of developing Crohn’s disease and other autoimmune conditions increased periods with little or no occurrence of flares If you decide to use a nicotine patch to help you quit smoking, ask your doctor first. Some nicotine patches can cause your psoriasis to flare. Alcohol can interfere with the effectiveness of your prescribed treatment plan. Here’s how: Your treatment may stop working or not work as effectively as it should. You may experience fewer remissions (lengths of time without flares). There are several benefits to limiting alcohol if you have psoriasis, including: for women, reduced risk of developing psoriatic arthritis lessened risk of liver damage due to psoriasis medications A sunburn causes injury to the skin, which then may cause psoriasis to flare. If you plan to spend time outdoors, apply sunscreen to all exposed skin before you go outside to prevent a flare. Water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher is best. For some people, psoriasis flares increase in fall and winter. Dry indoor heating can cause dry skin, which can worsen psoriasis. Moisturizing dry skin can reduce flares that occur during the coldest months of the year. Apply a quality moisturizer to your skin after your daily shower or anytime your skin feels dry. Use warm water when bathing or showering, not hot. Limit bath time to no more than 10 minutes. Plug in a humidifier to add moisture to indoor air to relieve dry skin.

Medical Editor: What Are Plaque Psoriasis and Risk Factors? When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Plaque Psoriasis? What Tests Do Health Care Professionals Use to Diagnose Plaque Psoriasis? What Is the Medical for Plaque Psoriasis? What Are Medical Treatments and Medications for Plaque Psoriasis? Where Can People Find More Information on Plaque Psoriasis? Plaque is an inherited systemic inflammatory disease of immune dysfunction that causes plaques of elevated, scaling, inflamed skin that is often quite itchy. The plaques are characteristically found on the , elbows, and knees. Plaque is relatively common; about 2%-3% of population of the United States is affected. It is not . What Are Plaque Psoriasis and Risk Factors? Like many other diseases, there is a significant interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Certain mutations pave the way for the development of the disease. It seems likely that more than one mutation in more than one gene must be present simultaneously to develop . Once the genes are inherited, some sort of environmental factor is necessary to activate it. Such a factor could be a common viral or bacterial infection or even a simple injury. The characteristic signs and symptoms of are small scaly, red . These bumps generally join together into elevated plaques of skin and most often are visible on the elbows, knees, and scalp, although any area of skin can be involved. Frequently, these plaques are quite itchy. Rarely, most of the patient's skin surface is affected. When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Plaque Psoriasis? Most dermatologists are able to confirm the diagnosis of psoriasis. The physician can provide helpful suggestions on how to minimize exacerbations of the condition and treatment options. In minimal disease, over-the-counter medications may be sufficient to control the condition. In more severe, extensive, and perhaps debilitating disease, physicians have a variety of treatments that can lessen but not permanently cure psoriasis. What Tests Do Health Care Professionals Use to Diagnose Plaque Psoriasis? Usually dermatologists and most primary-care professionals are able to diagnose classical psoriasis on the basis of the appearance of the individual lesions, the tendency to form plaques, and the distribution of those plaques on the elbows, knees, and scalp. Psoriasis can affect one or all the nails of the fingers and toes, causing changes that resemble . Psoriasis rarely involves the lips or mouth. Occasionally, atypical psoriasis may require a biopsy (a small piece of surgically removed involved skin) to be examined under the microscope to supplement the clinical evaluation. Blood tests are rarely helpful to confirm or support the diagnosis. What Is the Medical for Plaque Psoriasis? It must be remembered that psoriasis is a chronic health condition that is not curable in the usual sense. The disease is characterized by exacerbations and remissions that often seem to occur spontaneously. Patients often relate some incidental environmental event or psychological to changes in their disease's activity. This can complicate treatment. Since psoriasis is incurable, doctors treat the condition to enhance the patient's sense of well-being and independence. Treatment options are chosen that are appropriate to the severity of the condition. Mild, localized psoriasis is treated with topical therapy while more extensive, severe disease will require systemic, expensive, and potentially hazardous treatment. Types of Psoriasis: Medical Pictures and Treatments The good news is that there is a lot that can be done for mild cases of psoriasis. There are many over-the-counter products available that are effective for psoriasis -- 1% cream (, ) is very safe topical steroid that can suppress mild disease. Preparations containing tar (that gunky, smelly stuff that is a byproduct of oil extraction) can be beneficial. Tar can be found in many ointments and shampoos so it can be effective in treating scalp disease. Sunlight has well-documented beneficial effects on psoriasis. Careful sunbathing (no sunburns) can be quite effective in controlling the disease during seasons when sunlight is abundant and the weather is tolerable. When treating this disease, it must be remembered that topical medications and light will have difficulty penetrating through thick layers of scale. This scale must be removed by gentle washing techniques so as to minimize irritation. In plaques of psoriasis, the small cutaneous vessels are very close to the surface of the skin, just under the scale. If the scale is removed, may occur, producing irritation and that actually tends to activate psoriasis. What Are Medical Treatments and Medications for Plaque Psoriasis? Topical medications effective for psoriasis available by prescription include those that contain topical of various potencies. Typical steroid medications are halcinonide (, ), flurandrenolide (, , ), betamethasone (), desonide (), alclometasone (), mometasone (), fluocinonide (), and triamcinolone acetonide (). Tar-containing topicals and -like molecules (calcipotriol []/calcipotriene []) also can be helpful. Ultraviolet light administered under controlled conditions in a physician's office in various wavelengths (narrow-band UVB) with or without supplemental medication (8-methoxypsoralen) ( treatment) is a very effective therapy. Systemic therapies include a -like drug, (), short-term (, , ) therapy for severe flares, and (, ). A new oral drug, apremilast (Otezla), has recently become available that seems to work best for mild to moderate psoriasis. New and expensive targeted drugs called biologics, which include (), (), (), (), secukinumab (Cosentyx), and ixekizumab (Taltz), are now available. These newer products are produced by new technologies requiring their synthesis by living cells. They are proteins and all currently must be given by injection at various intervals into the subcutaneous tissue by the patient or by intravenous infusion in a medical facility. They are unique in that they have precise targets in the in the inflammatory pathway that they block. Since the biologics are very, very specific in their mode of action, they claim to offer increased safety and improved efficacy over older less specific immunosuppressive drugs. All of these treatments must be continued indefinitely because when they are stopped, the psoriasis will typically return. It has recently been appreciated that the presence of psoriasis is a sign of a systemic inflammatory predisposition. Patients with psoriasis are predisposed to being , having , and having a destructive and premature cardiovascular disease. If treated, it is reasonable to expect that individual plaques of psoriasis will diminish or disappear. It is also expected that new lesions will develop if treatment is abandoned. The best way for a patient with known psoriasis to prevent its reappearance or exacerbation is to treat the skin with care and avoid traumatic stimuli like sunburns or elective surgical procedures. It is important to avoid picking or rubbing off the scale. Where Can People Find More Information on Plaque Psoriasis? Picture of plaque psoriasis on the elbow.

What Does Psoriasis Look Like? What Psoriasis Creams and Topical Agents Can I Use? Psoriasis symptoms vary depending on the type of psoriasis you have. There are several different . is not , but it can be inherited. Research indicates that it is associated with a widespread defect in the inflammatory process. is a common and chronic incurable but treatable skin disorder. is the most common form and appears as elevated plaques of red skin covered with silvery scale that may itch or . The involved areas for are usually found on the arms, legs, trunk, or but may be found on any part of the skin. The areas where psoriasis is typically found are the: Factors such as , , , and infection may affect the severity and extent of the condition. A significant percentage of people with psoriasis also have . Individuals with have a destructive inflammation of their joints as well as other arthritic symptoms. Psoriasis affects children and adults. Men and women are affected equally. Females develop plaque psoriasis earlier in life than males. The first peak occurrence of plaque psoriasis is in people 16-22 years of age. Psoriasis can affect all races. Studies have shown that more people in western European and Scandinavian populations have psoriasis than those in other population groups. Occasionally psoriasis of one clinical type may evolve into another such as , , or . Clinical types of psoriasis include the following: the red areas on the skin contain small filled with pus. Pustular psoriasis. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. very extensive and diffuse areas of red and scaling skin are present. there are many isolated small scaling . Psoriasis can appear on any part of the skin, even the scalp. With scalp psoriasis, scalp plaques produce excess scales and can cause your scalp to itch. Symptoms of scalp psoriasis appear as the following: A small bump, called a , with a scale on top. The plaque typically is covered by thick layers of horny scale. When the scale sheds, it can look like . Sometimes these plaques can itch. Scratching these plaques can worsen the condition and lead to what's called the Koebner phenomenon, or isomorphic response, which can cause psoriasis to develop in areas where there's inflammation and .  The causes of scalp psoriasis, like all psoriasis, is related to genetic defects that affect the immune system. It is not known if causes or makes psoriasis worse.  In some severe cases, scalp psoriasis can cause , or a loss of hair, which is rare and may be controlled with treatment. Scalp psoriasis can be treated with topical medications, which can sometimes be difficult to apply when the scalp is covered with enough hair that can create a barrier. Research indicates that the disease results from a disorder in the inflammatory system. In psoriasis, T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) abnormally trigger inflammation in the body. These T cells also stimulate skin cells to grow faster than normal and to pile up in raised plaques on the outer surface of the skin. Those with a family history of psoriasis have an increased chance of having the disease. Some people carry genes that make them more likely to develop psoriasis. When both parents have psoriasis, their offspring have a 50% chance of developing psoriasis. About one-third of those with psoriasis can recall at least one family member with the disease. Certain risk factors may trigger a psoriasis flare. Injury to the skin has been associated with plaque psoriasis. For example, a skin infection, skin inflammation, or even excessive scratching can trigger psoriasis at the site of the skin injury. Can sunlight trigger psoriasis? Most people generally consider sunlight to be beneficial for their psoriasis and therapeutic phototherapy is a treatment option. However, a small minority find that strong sunlight aggravates their condition. A bad may worsen psoriasis. Streptococcal sore throats may trigger guttate psoriasis, a type of psoriasis that looks like small red drops on the skin. Guttate psoriasis. Red drop-like lesions are found on the skin. This type of psoriasis usually occurs after a streptococcal (bacterial) infection. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Psoriasis may worsen after an individual has been infected with . A number of medications have been shown to aggravate psoriasis. Some examples are as follows: : Drug that may be used to treat Beta-blockers: Drugs that may be used to treat Antimalarials: Drugs used to treat , , and NSAIDs: Drugs, such as ( and ) or (), used to reduce inflammation Many people note worsening of their psoriasis when emotionally stressed. smokers have an increased risk of chronic plaque psoriasis because may alter the immune system in such a way as to cause a flare of the condition. Alcohol is considered a risk factor for psoriasis. Even a moderate intake of beer may trigger or worsen psoriasis. The severity of psoriasis may fluctuate with hormonal changes. Disease frequency peaks during and . During , psoriatic symptoms are more likely to improve. In contrast, flares occur in the postpartum period. Types of Psoriasis: Medical Pictures and Treatments What Are Psoriasis ? What Does Psoriasis Look Like? The most common symptoms, plaque psoriasis (), usually produce: Plaques of red, raised, scaly skin affecting the scalp, elbows, and knees. Plaque psoriasis on the elbow. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. The flare-ups can last for weeks or months. Psoriasis can spontaneously resolve only to return later. They vary in size (1 centimeter to several centimeters) and may be stable for long periods of time. The shape of the plaque is usually round with irregular borders. Smaller plaques may merge, producing extensive areas of involvement. The skin in these areas, especially when over joints or on the palms or , can split and bleed. Plaques sometimes may be surrounded by a halo or ring of blanched skin (Ring of Woronoff). This is especially noticeable after effective treatment has begun and the lesions are resolving. The color of the affected skin reflects the inflammation present and is caused by increased blood flow. The scales are silvery white. The thickness of the scales may vary. When the scale is removed, the skin underneath looks smooth, red, and glossy. This shiny skin usually has small areas of pinpoint (Auspitz sign). Psoriatic plaques tend to appear symmetrically on both sides of the body. For example, psoriasis is usually present on both knees or both elbows. Nail psoriasis. Note the classic pits and yellowish color in the nails. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Nail changes are common in psoriasis. The nails may have small indentations or pits. The nails can be discolored and separate from the nail bed at the fingertip. (See .) This may be similar in appearance to fungal nail infections and may actually coexist with, a fungal infection. Plaque psoriasis may look slightly different in children. In children, the plaques are not as thick, and the affected skin is less scaly. Psoriasis may often appear in the region in infancy and in flexural areas in children. The disease more commonly affects the face in children as compared to adults. Although the most common body areas affected are the arms, legs, back, and scalp, psoriasis can be found on any body part. can be found on the genitals or buttocks, under the breasts, or under the arms and may not show the scale typically seen in other body areas. These areas can feel especially itchy or have a burning sensation. Since psoriasis is a systemic disease of inflammation with dramatic skin involvement, most people should seek medical advice early in its course when symptoms and signs appear. Besides arthritis, people with the condition are more likely to be and to have and/or . Psoriasis, if limited to small areas of skin, may be an inconvenience for some people. For others, it may be disabling. Those with psoriasis commonly recognize that new areas of psoriasis occur within seven to 10 days after the skin has been injured. This has been called the Koebner phenomenon. People should always see a doctor if they have psoriasis and develop significant , stiffness, or deformity. They may be in the reported 5%-10% of individuals with psoriasis who develop and would be a candidate for systemic (pill or injection) therapy. Psoriatic arthritis can be crippling and cause permanent deformity. Always see a doctor if signs of infection develop. Common signs of infection are red streaks or pus from the red areas, with no other cause, or increased pain. People need to see a doctor if they have serious side effects from their medications. (See Understanding .) Psoriasis is typically diagnosed on the basis of a physical examination by observing the appearance of the diseased skin. Although usually not necessary, skin biopsies can support the diagnosis of plaque psoriasis although they are not always definitive. Exposure to sunlight helps most people with psoriasis. This may explain why the face is so seldom involved. Keeping the skin soft and moist is helpful. Apply moisturizers after bathing. Avoid scratching that can cause bleeding or excessive irritation. Soaking in bathwater with oil added and using moisturizers may help. Bath soaks with or other agents remove scales. Be careful in bathtubs with oil added to the bathwater since the tub can become very slippery. cream can slightly reduce the itching of mild psoriasis and is available without a prescription. Some people use an ultraviolet B (UV-B) light unit at home under a doctor's supervision. A dermatologist may prescribe the unit and instruct the patient on home use, especially if it is difficult for the patient to get to the doctor's office for light treatment. Psoriasis Pictures, Symptoms, Causes and Treatments Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that may worsen and improve in cycles. Any approach to the treatment of this disease must be considered for the long term. Treatment regimens must be individualized according to age, sex, occupation, personal motivation, other health conditions, and available economic resources. Disease severity is defined by the thickness and extent of plaques present as well as the patient's perception and acceptance of the disease. Treatment must be designed with the patient's specific expectations in mind, rather than focusing only on the extent of body surface area involved. Many treatments exist for psoriasis. However, the construction of an effective therapeutic regimen is not necessarily complicated. There are three basic types of treatments for psoriasis: (3) systemic therapy (drugs taken into the body). All of these treatments may be used alone or in combination.  : Medications applied directly to the skin are the first course of treatment options. The main topical treatments are corticosteroids, vitaminD derivatives, coal tar, anthralin, or retinoids. There isn't one topical drug that is best for all people with psoriasis. Because each drug has specific adverse effects, it is common to rotate them. Sometimes drugs are combined with other drugs to make a preparation that is more helpful than an individual topical medication. For example, keratolytics (substances used to break down scales or excess skin cells) are often added to these preparations. Some drugs are incompatible with the active ingredients of these preparations. For example, salicylic acid inactivates calcipotriene (form of vitaminD). On the other hand, drugs such as anthralin (tree bark extract) require the addition of salicylic acid to work effectively. : The ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun slows the production of skin cells and reduces inflammation. Sunlight helps reduce psoriasis symptoms and signs in many people. If psoriasis is so widespread that topical therapy is impractical, then artificial light therapy may be used. Proper facilities are required for light therapy. The medical light sources in a physician's office is not the same as the light sources found in tanning salons, which are of no use for psoriasis. It must be remembered that all UV has a potential to cause mutations and skin cancers. Although the incubation period for these skin cancers is quite long, UV exposures should be carefully monitored. : Ultraviolet B (UV-B) light is commonly used to treat psoriasis. UV-B is light with wavelengths of 290-320 nanometers (nm). Within the last 15 years, a new form of UV therapy called narrow-band UV-B (NBUVB) that has a peak energy output at about 313 nm) that seems to be very effective with less burning potential than conventional broadband UV-B. It presumably contains the most therapeutic wavelengths and avoids the more toxic ones. (The visible light range is 400 nm-700 nm.) UV-B therapy is usually combined with one or more topical treatments. UV-B phototherapy is extremely effective for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The major drawbacks of this therapy are the time commitment required for treatments and the accessibility of UV-B equipment. The Goeckerman regimen uses the application of coal tar followed by UV-B exposure and has been shown to cause remission in more than 80% of patients. Patients often complain of the strong odor when coal tar is added, and it stains clothing, towels, and sheets. UV-B therapy can be combined with the topical application of corticosteroids, calcipotriene (), tazarotene (), or creams or ointments that soothe and soften the skin. : A laser that produces UV-B light in the same wavelength as full body phototherapy units can target smaller areas of psoriasis without affecting the surrounding skin. Because the light treats only the psoriasis plaques, a strong dose of light can be used, which may be useful to treat a stubborn plaque of psoriasis, such as on the scalp, feet, or hands. This is an impractical treatment for psoriasis that covers a large area and, like other forms of phototherapy, requires regular visits over several months. : PUVA is the therapy that combines a psoralen drug with ultraviolet A (UV-A) light therapy. Psoralen drugs make the skin more sensitive to light and the sun. Methoxypsoralen for example is taken by mouth an hour before UV-A exposure. UV-A contains light with wavelengths of 320 nm-400 nm that activate psoralen. The activated drug then is thought to inhibit the abnormal inflammatory response in the skin. More than 85% of patients report relief of disease symptoms with 20-30 treatments. Therapy is usually given two to three times per week on an outpatient basis, with maintenance treatments every two to four weeks until remission. Adverse effects of PUVA therapy include , itching, and burning. Long-term complications include increased risks of sensitivity to the sun, sunburn, , and . Availability of the psoralen medication in the United States has been a problem, with lack of availability of the medication periodically extending for weeks or months at a time. This has discouraged its use. What Psoriasis Creams and Topical Agents Can I Use? Medications applied directly to the skin are the first line of treatment options for psoriasis. For more detailed information on each medication, see Understanding Psoriasis Medications. Generic drug names are listed below with examples of brands in parentheses. : Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment in mild or limited psoriasis and come in a variety of forms. Foams and solutions are best for scalp psoriasis and other thickly hair-bearing areas, such as a hairy chest or hairy back. Creams are usually preferred by patients, but ointments are more potent than any other vehicles, even at the same percentage concentration. Super potent topical corticosteroids such as clobetasol propionate () and betamethasone dipropionate augmented () are commonly prescribed corticosteroids for use on non-facial, non-intertriginous areas (areas where skin surfaces do not rub together). As the condition improves, one may be able to use potent such as: mid-potency steroids such as triamcinolone acetonide (Aristocort, ) or betamethasone valerate (). These creams or ointments are usually applied once or twice a day, but the dose depends on the severity of the psoriasis as well as the location and thickness of the plaque. While it is best to use stronger, super potent corticosteroids on thicker plaques, milder steroids are recommended for skin folds (inverse psoriasis) and on the genitals. In skin folds or facial areas, it is best to use milder topical steroids such as hydrocortisone, desonide (), or alclometasone (). such as () and pimecrolimus () have less use in plaque type psoriasis than they do with but are sometimes effective on the face or occluded areas. Patients who are using one or more of the systemic agents discussed below will often still require some use of topical corticosteroids for resistant areas and ""hot spots."" Occasionally, when there is concern about the long-term use of a potent topical corticosteroid, pulse methods may be used with one of the or A analogs discussed below. An example would be to use the nonsteroidal topical agent (or a milder corticosteroid) during the week and more potent steroid on the weekends. Calcipotriene (Dovonex) is a form of vitaminD and slows the production of excess skin cells. It is used in the treatment of moderate psoriasis. This cream, ointment, or solution is applied to the skin twice daily. Calcipotriene combined with the betamethasone dipropionate () flattens lesions, removes scale, and reduces inflammation and is available as an ointment and a solution. As is the case with many combination medications, it may be much less expensive to apply the individual components sequentially than a single application of a prepackaged mixture. ointment (Silkis, ) contains calcitriol, which binds to the D receptors on skin cells and reduces the excessive production of skin cells, which helps to improve psoriasis. Calcitriol ointment should be applied to the affected areas of skin twice a day. Coal tar (DHS Tar, , , Zithranol) contains literally thousands of different substances that are extracted from the coal carbonization process. Coal tar is applied topically and is available as shampoo, bath oil, ointment, cream, gel, lotion, or paste. The tar decreases itching and slows the production of excess skin cells and is especially useful when used with or combined with a topical corticosteroid. It is messy and has a strong smell. Clobetasol (Temovate), fluocinonide (), and betamethasone (Diprolene) are examples of commonly prescribed corticosteroids. These creams or ointments are usually applied twice a day, but the dose depends on the severity of the psoriasis. Anthralin (Dithranol, Anthra-Derm, Drithocreme) is considered to be one of the most effective antipsoriatic agents available. It has the potential to cause skin irritation and staining of clothing and skin. Apply the cream, ointment, or paste sparingly to the skin plaques. On the scalp, rub into affected areas. Avoid the forehead, eyes, and any skin that does not have the lesions. Do not apply excessive quantities. Tazarotene (Tazorac) is a topical retinoid that is available as a gel or cream. Tazarotene reduces the size of the plaques and the redness of the skin. This medicine is sometimes combined with corticosteroids to decrease skin irritation and to increase effectiveness. Tazarotene is particularly useful for scalp psoriasis. Apply a thin film to the affected skin every day or as instructed. before using this medicine. Irritation may occur when applied to damp skin. Wash hands after application. Do not cover with a bandage. A useful addition to topical steroids is to add a keratolytic medication to remove overlying scale so that the steroid can reach the affected skin sooner and more effectively. Salicylic acid shampoos are useful in the scalp, and urea (either prescription strength or over-the-counter lower strengths) may be used on body plaques. Psoriasis causes the top layer of skin cells to become inflamed and grow too quickly and flake off. Systemic Medications (Those Taken by Mouth or Injection) () and trioxsalen (Trisoralen) are commonly prescribed drugs called psoralens. Psoralens make the skin more sensitive to light. These drugs have no effect unless carefully combined with ultraviolet light therapy. This therapy, called PUVA, uses a psoralen drug with ultraviolet A (UV-A) light to treat psoriasis. This treatment is used when psoriasis is severe or when it covers a large area of the skin. Psoralens are taken by mouth one to two hours before PUVA therapy or sunlight exposure. They are also available as creams, lotions, or in bath soaks. More than 85% of patients report relief of disease symptoms with 20-30 treatments. Therapy is usually given two to three times per week, with maintenance treatments every two to four weeks until remission. Adverse effects of PUVA therapy include nausea, itching, and burning. These drugs cause sensitivity to sunlight, risk of sunburn, , and and for this reason, the prescription of the medication for home use with natural sunlight is strongly discouraged. This drug is used to treat plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. It suppresses the immune system and slows the production of skin cells. Methotrexate is taken by mouth (tablet) or as an injection once per week. Women who are planning to become or who are pregnant should not take this drug. The doctor will order blood tests to check your blood cell count and and kidney function on a regular basis while on this medicine. After the patient has been on the medication for several years, a liver and lung examinations may be recommended to look for evidence of damage that was not apparent on routine blood tests. This drug suppresses the immune system and slows the production of skin cells. Cyclosporine is taken by mouth two or three times a day. A doctor will order tests to check your kidney function. Cyclosporine may increase the risk of , infection, or , and it may cause damage to the kidneys, producing . It is intended for short-term use. This drug is an oral retinoid, or a modified molecule. It is not as effective as methotrexate or cyclosporine in the treatment of plaque psoriasis, but it works for pustular psoriasis and in other patients with predominantly hand and foot psoriasis. In women of childbearing age, acitretin must be used with caution because of the risks of birth defects. Furthermore, because of the long time needed for the elimination of acitretin from the body, even after treatment is stopped, women must continue to avoid pregnancy for three years. Regular blood tests are required while taking this medication. Side effects include dryness and irritation of the skin, lips, eyes, nose, and mucous membrane surfaces. Other adverse side effects include thinning hair, elevation of and , liver toxicity, and bone changes. Do not donate blood while taking acitretin and for two years after stopping it. This is an oral medication that has been approved for use in psoriasis. is an occasional side effect of this medication. Some patients report while on Otezla. This medication does not require regular blood tests. Plaque psoriasis with fissures, which are splits in the skin. Fissures usually occur where the skin bends (joints). The skin may bleed and is more susceptible to infection. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. The following drugs are categorized under the term because they are all proteins produced in the laboratory by industrial cell culture techniques and must be given either subcutaneously or intravenously. The frequency of treatment depends on the specific drug. All of these medications are very precise in that they block only one or two parts of the inflammatory reaction and are moderately immunosuppresive. Biologics are expensive and do not cure psoriasis but as a group are quite effective and reasonably safe. If it is decided to start a patient on a biologic drug, the choice will depend on the particular physician's expertise, as well as insurance coverage and payment issues. This is the first drug that the FDA approved for treating psoriatic arthritis. It is a manufactured protein that works with necrosis factor (TNF) in order to reduce inflammation. Etanercept is given as an injection two times per week initially and then decreased to weekly in most patients. The drug can be injected at home. Enbrel affects your immune system and is especially hazardous to someone with untreated (TB) exposure or a history of . In both of these cases, patients receiving etanercept or any of the other ""biologics"" discussed below may experience a severe and life-threatening reactivation of their previously quiet disease. Etanercept is rarely associated with . Like other medicines of the ""biologic"" family, any use in patients with known or suspected () or other demyelinating diseases is done only after careful consideration of other options and with very careful monitoring. Humira is used to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults. It is a protein that blocks TNF-α, a type of chemical messenger in the immune system. In psoriasis, TNF-α overstimulates immune system cells (T cells) and causes psoriatic lesions to develop. Humira is taken by injection under the skin. The recommended dose for adults is one injection every two weeks. Side effects include severe infection, reactivation of TB or , rare allergic reactions, very rare serious , , and other cancers. This drug blocks two proteins called interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, which are parts of the immune system. Interleukins-12 and 23 promote the inflammation associated with psoriasis. Stelara is injected under the skin at the start of treatment, after four weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Ustekinumab may potentially increase the risk of malignancy or infection; it also may rarely cause allergic reactions, including skin , facial swelling, and difficulty with breathing. This was one of the original biologic medications used for psoriasis. Advantages are that onset of action is faster than many systemic treatments. Disadvantages are that it must be administered by infusion and, over time, antibodies may develop and decrease its effectiveness. It is an antibody that acts as an interleukin 17 (IL-17) antagonist and, after a loading dose, is administered monthly. IL-17 is another substance that promotes an inflammatory reaction. is an antibody that inhibits IL-17 with a similar mode of action to secukinumab. is another antibody that inhibits interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA). is another antibody that inhibits IL-23. Conventional therapy is one that has been tested with clinical trials or has other evidence of clinical effectiveness. The FDA has approved several drugs for the treatment of psoriasis as described above. Some patients look to alternative therapy, changes, , or stress-reducing techniques to help reduce symptoms. For the most part, alternative therapies have not been tested with clinical trials, and the FDA has not approved dietary for treatment of psoriasis. There are no specific foods to eat or to avoid (except for alcohol) for patients with psoriasis. However, some other therapies can be found on the National Psoriasis Foundation web site. Individuals should check with their doctors before starting any therapy. Some medications purchased online, both oral and topical, may actually contain pharmaceuticals that would normally require a prescription. This becomes a problem with unanticipated medication side effects and interactions. Caution should always be exercised in purchasing and using such products. If one is taking a systemic retinoid such as acitretin or covering large areas with a topical retinoid (Tazorac) or a vitamin D analog (calcipotriene, calcitriol), he or she should be careful about taking ""megadoses"" of the same as a supplement. In rare cases, vitamin toxicity can occur. A variety of herbal therapies have been reported in the lay press and on the Internet to help psoriasis. Some of these are oral and some topical, but none have been shown to have any predictable benefit at this time. Some, such as tea tree oil, coconut oil, and , are known to cause , which can transform a bothersome plaque into an oozing, blistering, intensely itchy one. There is no good evidence to support the use of apple cider vinegar or household cleaning products either. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic disease that goes away and returns. Follow-up care depends on the severity of the disease at any given time. If a patient has evidence of psoriatic arthritis, a consultation with a rheumatologist (a physician who specializes in arthritis) is helpful. Avoiding environmental factors that trigger psoriasis, such as smoking, and stress, may help prevent or minimize flare-ups of psoriasis. Sun exposure may help in many cases of psoriasis and aggravate it in others. Alcohol is considered a risk factor for psoriasis, even moderate amounts of beer. People should minimize alcohol use if they have psoriasis. This is especially important if they are taking medications such as methotrexate or acitretin. Specific dietary restrictions or supplements other than a well-balanced and adequate diet are not important in the management of plaque psoriasis. Recently, some data has supported that an ""anti-inflammatory"" diet that is high in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated and trans may help manage psoriasis, although the value in preventing its onset is less certain. Psoriasis is more of an inconvenience in most cases than it is threatening. However, it is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease for which there is no true cure. The itching and peeling of skin can lead to significant pain and self-esteem issues. By far, the patient's quality of life is affected most with plaque psoriasis. Self-consciousness and embarrassment about appearance, inconvenience, and high costs of treatment options all affect one's outlook when living with psoriasis. It has recently become apparent that many patients with psoriasis are predisposed to , , and premature cardiovascular disease. It is important that such patients seek good overall medical care aside from simply treating their skin disease. , , or stress may worsen symptoms and increase the tendency to itch. Most patients can expect significant improvement from the treatment of their psoriasis. Education of psoriasis patients is one of the foundations for managing this chronic and typically relapsing disorder. Patients should be familiar with the treatment options in order to make proper informed decisions about therapy. The National Psoriasis Foundation is an excellent organization that provides support to patients with psoriasis.

What Does Psoriasis Look Like? What Psoriasis Creams and Topical Agents Can I Use? Psoriasis symptoms vary depending on the type of psoriasis you have. There are several different . is not , but it can be inherited. Research indicates that it is associated with a widespread defect in the inflammatory process. is a common and chronic incurable but treatable skin disorder. is the most common form and appears as elevated plaques of red skin covered with silvery scale that may itch or . The involved areas for are usually found on the arms, legs, trunk, or but may be found on any part of the skin. The areas where psoriasis is typically found are the: Factors such as , , , and infection may affect the severity and extent of the condition. A significant percentage of people with psoriasis also have . Individuals with have a destructive inflammation of their joints as well as other arthritic symptoms. Psoriasis affects children and adults. Men and women are affected equally. Females develop plaque psoriasis earlier in life than males. The first peak occurrence of plaque psoriasis is in people 16-22 years of age. Psoriasis can affect all races. Studies have shown that more people in western European and Scandinavian populations have psoriasis than those in other population groups. Occasionally psoriasis of one clinical type may evolve into another such as , , or . Clinical types of psoriasis include the following: the red areas on the skin contain small filled with pus. Pustular psoriasis. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. very extensive and diffuse areas of red and scaling skin are present. there are many isolated small scaling . Psoriasis can appear on any part of the skin, even the scalp. With scalp psoriasis, scalp plaques produce excess scales and can cause your scalp to itch. Symptoms of scalp psoriasis appear as the following: A small bump, called a , with a scale on top. The plaque typically is covered by thick layers of horny scale. When the scale sheds, it can look like . Sometimes these plaques can itch. Scratching these plaques can worsen the condition and lead to what's called the Koebner phenomenon, or isomorphic response, which can cause psoriasis to develop in areas where there's inflammation and .  The causes of scalp psoriasis, like all psoriasis, is related to genetic defects that affect the immune system. It is not known if causes or makes psoriasis worse.  In some severe cases, scalp psoriasis can cause , or a loss of hair, which is rare and may be controlled with treatment. Scalp psoriasis can be treated with topical medications, which can sometimes be difficult to apply when the scalp is covered with enough hair that can create a barrier. Research indicates that the disease results from a disorder in the inflammatory system. In psoriasis, T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) abnormally trigger inflammation in the body. These T cells also stimulate skin cells to grow faster than normal and to pile up in raised plaques on the outer surface of the skin. Those with a family history of psoriasis have an increased chance of having the disease. Some people carry genes that make them more likely to develop psoriasis. When both parents have psoriasis, their offspring have a 50% chance of developing psoriasis. About one-third of those with psoriasis can recall at least one family member with the disease. Certain risk factors may trigger a psoriasis flare. Injury to the skin has been associated with plaque psoriasis. For example, a skin infection, skin inflammation, or even excessive scratching can trigger psoriasis at the site of the skin injury. Can sunlight trigger psoriasis? Most people generally consider sunlight to be beneficial for their psoriasis and therapeutic phototherapy is a treatment option. However, a small minority find that strong sunlight aggravates their condition. A bad may worsen psoriasis. Streptococcal sore throats may trigger guttate psoriasis, a type of psoriasis that looks like small red drops on the skin. Guttate psoriasis. Red drop-like lesions are found on the skin. This type of psoriasis usually occurs after a streptococcal (bacterial) infection. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Psoriasis may worsen after an individual has been infected with . A number of medications have been shown to aggravate psoriasis. Some examples are as follows: : Drug that may be used to treat Beta-blockers: Drugs that may be used to treat Antimalarials: Drugs used to treat , , and NSAIDs: Drugs, such as ( and ) or (), used to reduce inflammation Many people note worsening of their psoriasis when emotionally stressed. smokers have an increased risk of chronic plaque psoriasis because may alter the immune system in such a way as to cause a flare of the condition. Alcohol is considered a risk factor for psoriasis. Even a moderate intake of beer may trigger or worsen psoriasis. The severity of psoriasis may fluctuate with hormonal changes. Disease frequency peaks during and . During , psoriatic symptoms are more likely to improve. In contrast, flares occur in the postpartum period. Psoriasis causes the top layer of skin cells to become inflamed and grow too quickly and flake off. What Are Psoriasis ? What Does Psoriasis Look Like? The most common symptoms, plaque psoriasis (), usually produce: Plaques of red, raised, scaly skin affecting the scalp, elbows, and knees. Plaque psoriasis on the elbow. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. The flare-ups can last for weeks or months. Psoriasis can spontaneously resolve only to return later. They vary in size (1 centimeter to several centimeters) and may be stable for long periods of time. The shape of the plaque is usually round with irregular borders. Smaller plaques may merge, producing extensive areas of involvement. The skin in these areas, especially when over joints or on the palms or , can split and bleed. Plaques sometimes may be surrounded by a halo or ring of blanched skin (Ring of Woronoff). This is especially noticeable after effective treatment has begun and the lesions are resolving. The color of the affected skin reflects the inflammation present and is caused by increased blood flow. The scales are silvery white. The thickness of the scales may vary. When the scale is removed, the skin underneath looks smooth, red, and glossy. This shiny skin usually has small areas of pinpoint (Auspitz sign). Psoriatic plaques tend to appear symmetrically on both sides of the body. For example, psoriasis is usually present on both knees or both elbows. Nail psoriasis. Note the classic pits and yellowish color in the nails. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Nail changes are common in psoriasis. The nails may have small indentations or pits. The nails can be discolored and separate from the nail bed at the fingertip. (See .) This may be similar in appearance to fungal nail infections and may actually coexist with, a fungal infection. Plaque psoriasis may look slightly different in children. In children, the plaques are not as thick, and the affected skin is less scaly. Psoriasis may often appear in the region in infancy and in flexural areas in children. The disease more commonly affects the face in children as compared to adults. Although the most common body areas affected are the arms, legs, back, and scalp, psoriasis can be found on any body part. can be found on the genitals or buttocks, under the breasts, or under the arms and may not show the scale typically seen in other body areas. These areas can feel especially itchy or have a burning sensation. Since psoriasis is a systemic disease of inflammation with dramatic skin involvement, most people should seek medical advice early in its course when symptoms and signs appear. Besides arthritis, people with the condition are more likely to be and to have and/or . Psoriasis, if limited to small areas of skin, may be an inconvenience for some people. For others, it may be disabling. Those with psoriasis commonly recognize that new areas of psoriasis occur within seven to 10 days after the skin has been injured. This has been called the Koebner phenomenon. People should always see a doctor if they have psoriasis and develop significant , stiffness, or deformity. They may be in the reported 5%-10% of individuals with psoriasis who develop and would be a candidate for systemic (pill or injection) therapy. Psoriatic arthritis can be crippling and cause permanent deformity. Always see a doctor if signs of infection develop. Common signs of infection are red streaks or pus from the red areas, with no other cause, or increased pain. People need to see a doctor if they have serious side effects from their medications. (See Understanding .) Psoriasis is typically diagnosed on the basis of a physical examination by observing the appearance of the diseased skin. Although usually not necessary, skin biopsies can support the diagnosis of plaque psoriasis although they are not always definitive. Exposure to sunlight helps most people with psoriasis. This may explain why the face is so seldom involved. Keeping the skin soft and moist is helpful. Apply moisturizers after bathing. Avoid scratching that can cause bleeding or excessive irritation. Soaking in bathwater with oil added and using moisturizers may help. Bath soaks with or other agents remove scales. Be careful in bathtubs with oil added to the bathwater since the tub can become very slippery. cream can slightly reduce the itching of mild psoriasis and is available without a prescription. Some people use an ultraviolet B (UV-B) light unit at home under a doctor's supervision. A dermatologist may prescribe the unit and instruct the patient on home use, especially if it is difficult for the patient to get to the doctor's office for light treatment. Psoriasis Pictures, Symptoms, Causes and Treatments Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that may worsen and improve in cycles. Any approach to the treatment of this disease must be considered for the long term. Treatment regimens must be individualized according to age, sex, occupation, personal motivation, other health conditions, and available economic resources. Disease severity is defined by the thickness and extent of plaques present as well as the patient's perception and acceptance of the disease. Treatment must be designed with the patient's specific expectations in mind, rather than focusing only on the extent of body surface area involved. Many treatments exist for psoriasis. However, the construction of an effective therapeutic regimen is not necessarily complicated. There are three basic types of treatments for psoriasis: (3) systemic therapy (drugs taken into the body). All of these treatments may be used alone or in combination.  : Medications applied directly to the skin are the first course of treatment options. The main topical treatments are corticosteroids, vitaminD derivatives, coal tar, anthralin, or retinoids. There isn't one topical drug that is best for all people with psoriasis. Because each drug has specific adverse effects, it is common to rotate them. Sometimes drugs are combined with other drugs to make a preparation that is more helpful than an individual topical medication. For example, keratolytics (substances used to break down scales or excess skin cells) are often added to these preparations. Some drugs are incompatible with the active ingredients of these preparations. For example, salicylic acid inactivates calcipotriene (form of vitaminD). On the other hand, drugs such as anthralin (tree bark extract) require the addition of salicylic acid to work effectively. : The ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun slows the production of skin cells and reduces inflammation. Sunlight helps reduce psoriasis symptoms and signs in many people. If psoriasis is so widespread that topical therapy is impractical, then artificial light therapy may be used. Proper facilities are required for light therapy. The medical light sources in a physician's office is not the same as the light sources found in tanning salons, which are of no use for psoriasis. It must be remembered that all UV has a potential to cause mutations and skin cancers. Although the incubation period for these skin cancers is quite long, UV exposures should be carefully monitored. : Ultraviolet B (UV-B) light is commonly used to treat psoriasis. UV-B is light with wavelengths of 290-320 nanometers (nm). Within the last 15 years, a new form of UV therapy called narrow-band UV-B (NBUVB) that has a peak energy output at about 313 nm) that seems to be very effective with less burning potential than conventional broadband UV-B. It presumably contains the most therapeutic wavelengths and avoids the more toxic ones. (The visible light range is 400 nm-700 nm.) UV-B therapy is usually combined with one or more topical treatments. UV-B phototherapy is extremely effective for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The major drawbacks of this therapy are the time commitment required for treatments and the accessibility of UV-B equipment. The Goeckerman regimen uses the application of coal tar followed by UV-B exposure and has been shown to cause remission in more than 80% of patients. Patients often complain of the strong odor when coal tar is added, and it stains clothing, towels, and sheets. UV-B therapy can be combined with the topical application of corticosteroids, calcipotriene (), tazarotene (), or creams or ointments that soothe and soften the skin. : A laser that produces UV-B light in the same wavelength as full body phototherapy units can target smaller areas of psoriasis without affecting the surrounding skin. Because the light treats only the psoriasis plaques, a strong dose of light can be used, which may be useful to treat a stubborn plaque of psoriasis, such as on the scalp, feet, or hands. This is an impractical treatment for psoriasis that covers a large area and, like other forms of phototherapy, requires regular visits over several months. : PUVA is the therapy that combines a psoralen drug with ultraviolet A (UV-A) light therapy. Psoralen drugs make the skin more sensitive to light and the sun. Methoxypsoralen for example is taken by mouth an hour before UV-A exposure. UV-A contains light with wavelengths of 320 nm-400 nm that activate psoralen. The activated drug then is thought to inhibit the abnormal inflammatory response in the skin. More than 85% of patients report relief of disease symptoms with 20-30 treatments. Therapy is usually given two to three times per week on an outpatient basis, with maintenance treatments every two to four weeks until remission. Adverse effects of PUVA therapy include , itching, and burning. Long-term complications include increased risks of sensitivity to the sun, sunburn, , and . Availability of the psoralen medication in the United States has been a problem, with lack of availability of the medication periodically extending for weeks or months at a time. This has discouraged its use. What Psoriasis Creams and Topical Agents Can I Use? Medications applied directly to the skin are the first line of treatment options for psoriasis. For more detailed information on each medication, see Understanding Psoriasis Medications. Generic drug names are listed below with examples of brands in parentheses. : Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment in mild or limited psoriasis and come in a variety of forms. Foams and solutions are best for scalp psoriasis and other thickly hair-bearing areas, such as a hairy chest or hairy back. Creams are usually preferred by patients, but ointments are more potent than any other vehicles, even at the same percentage concentration. Super potent topical corticosteroids such as clobetasol propionate () and betamethasone dipropionate augmented () are commonly prescribed corticosteroids for use on non-facial, non-intertriginous areas (areas where skin surfaces do not rub together). As the condition improves, one may be able to use potent such as: mid-potency steroids such as triamcinolone acetonide (Aristocort, ) or betamethasone valerate (). These creams or ointments are usually applied once or twice a day, but the dose depends on the severity of the psoriasis as well as the location and thickness of the plaque. While it is best to use stronger, super potent corticosteroids on thicker plaques, milder steroids are recommended for skin folds (inverse psoriasis) and on the genitals. In skin folds or facial areas, it is best to use milder topical steroids such as hydrocortisone, desonide (), or alclometasone (). such as () and pimecrolimus () have less use in plaque type psoriasis than they do with but are sometimes effective on the face or occluded areas. Patients who are using one or more of the systemic agents discussed below will often still require some use of topical corticosteroids for resistant areas and ""hot spots."" Occasionally, when there is concern about the long-term use of a potent topical corticosteroid, pulse methods may be used with one of the or A analogs discussed below. An example would be to use the nonsteroidal topical agent (or a milder corticosteroid) during the week and more potent steroid on the weekends. Calcipotriene (Dovonex) is a form of vitaminD and slows the production of excess skin cells. It is used in the treatment of moderate psoriasis. This cream, ointment, or solution is applied to the skin twice daily. Calcipotriene combined with the betamethasone dipropionate () flattens lesions, removes scale, and reduces inflammation and is available as an ointment and a solution. As is the case with many combination medications, it may be much less expensive to apply the individual components sequentially than a single application of a prepackaged mixture. ointment (Silkis, ) contains calcitriol, which binds to the D receptors on skin cells and reduces the excessive production of skin cells, which helps to improve psoriasis. Calcitriol ointment should be applied to the affected areas of skin twice a day. Coal tar (DHS Tar, , , Zithranol) contains literally thousands of different substances that are extracted from the coal carbonization process. Coal tar is applied topically and is available as shampoo, bath oil, ointment, cream, gel, lotion, or paste. The tar decreases itching and slows the production of excess skin cells and is especially useful when used with or combined with a topical corticosteroid. It is messy and has a strong smell. Clobetasol (Temovate), fluocinonide (), and betamethasone (Diprolene) are examples of commonly prescribed corticosteroids. These creams or ointments are usually applied twice a day, but the dose depends on the severity of the psoriasis. Anthralin (Dithranol, Anthra-Derm, Drithocreme) is considered to be one of the most effective antipsoriatic agents available. It has the potential to cause skin irritation and staining of clothing and skin. Apply the cream, ointment, or paste sparingly to the skin plaques. On the scalp, rub into affected areas. Avoid the forehead, eyes, and any skin that does not have the lesions. Do not apply excessive quantities. Tazarotene (Tazorac) is a topical retinoid that is available as a gel or cream. Tazarotene reduces the size of the plaques and the redness of the skin. This medicine is sometimes combined with corticosteroids to decrease skin irritation and to increase effectiveness. Tazarotene is particularly useful for scalp psoriasis. Apply a thin film to the affected skin every day or as instructed. before using this medicine. Irritation may occur when applied to damp skin. Wash hands after application. Do not cover with a bandage. A useful addition to topical steroids is to add a keratolytic medication to remove overlying scale so that the steroid can reach the affected skin sooner and more effectively. Salicylic acid shampoos are useful in the scalp, and urea (either prescription strength or over-the-counter lower strengths) may be used on body plaques. Types of Psoriasis: Medical Pictures and Treatments Systemic Medications (Those Taken by Mouth or Injection) () and trioxsalen (Trisoralen) are commonly prescribed drugs called psoralens. Psoralens make the skin more sensitive to light. These drugs have no effect unless carefully combined with ultraviolet light therapy. This therapy, called PUVA, uses a psoralen drug with ultraviolet A (UV-A) light to treat psoriasis. This treatment is used when psoriasis is severe or when it covers a large area of the skin. Psoralens are taken by mouth one to two hours before PUVA therapy or sunlight exposure. They are also available as creams, lotions, or in bath soaks. More than 85% of patients report relief of disease symptoms with 20-30 treatments. Therapy is usually given two to three times per week, with maintenance treatments every two to four weeks until remission. Adverse effects of PUVA therapy include nausea, itching, and burning. These drugs cause sensitivity to sunlight, risk of sunburn, , and and for this reason, the prescription of the medication for home use with natural sunlight is strongly discouraged. This drug is used to treat plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. It suppresses the immune system and slows the production of skin cells. Methotrexate is taken by mouth (tablet) or as an injection once per week. Women who are planning to become or who are pregnant should not take this drug. The doctor will order blood tests to check your blood cell count and and kidney function on a regular basis while on this medicine. After the patient has been on the medication for several years, a liver and lung examinations may be recommended to look for evidence of damage that was not apparent on routine blood tests. This drug suppresses the immune system and slows the production of skin cells. Cyclosporine is taken by mouth two or three times a day. A doctor will order tests to check your kidney function. Cyclosporine may increase the risk of , infection, or , and it may cause damage to the kidneys, producing . It is intended for short-term use. This drug is an oral retinoid, or a modified molecule. It is not as effective as methotrexate or cyclosporine in the treatment of plaque psoriasis, but it works for pustular psoriasis and in other patients with predominantly hand and foot psoriasis. In women of childbearing age, acitretin must be used with caution because of the risks of birth defects. Furthermore, because of the long time needed for the elimination of acitretin from the body, even after treatment is stopped, women must continue to avoid pregnancy for three years. Regular blood tests are required while taking this medication. Side effects include dryness and irritation of the skin, lips, eyes, nose, and mucous membrane surfaces. Other adverse side effects include thinning hair, elevation of and , liver toxicity, and bone changes. Do not donate blood while taking acitretin and for two years after stopping it. This is an oral medication that has been approved for use in psoriasis. is an occasional side effect of this medication. Some patients report while on Otezla. This medication does not require regular blood tests. Plaque psoriasis with fissures, which are splits in the skin. Fissures usually occur where the skin bends (joints). The skin may bleed and is more susceptible to infection. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. The following drugs are categorized under the term because they are all proteins produced in the laboratory by industrial cell culture techniques and must be given either subcutaneously or intravenously. The frequency of treatment depends on the specific drug. All of these medications are very precise in that they block only one or two parts of the inflammatory reaction and are moderately immunosuppresive. Biologics are expensive and do not cure psoriasis but as a group are quite effective and reasonably safe. If it is decided to start a patient on a biologic drug, the choice will depend on the particular physician's expertise, as well as insurance coverage and payment issues. This is the first drug that the FDA approved for treating psoriatic arthritis. It is a manufactured protein that works with necrosis factor (TNF) in order to reduce inflammation. Etanercept is given as an injection two times per week initially and then decreased to weekly in most patients. The drug can be injected at home. Enbrel affects your immune system and is especially hazardous to someone with untreated (TB) exposure or a history of . In both of these cases, patients receiving etanercept or any of the other ""biologics"" discussed below may experience a severe and life-threatening reactivation of their previously quiet disease. Etanercept is rarely associated with . Like other medicines of the ""biologic"" family, any use in patients with known or suspected () or other demyelinating diseases is done only after careful consideration of other options and with very careful monitoring. Humira is used to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults. It is a protein that blocks TNF-α, a type of chemical messenger in the immune system. In psoriasis, TNF-α overstimulates immune system cells (T cells) and causes psoriatic lesions to develop. Humira is taken by injection under the skin. The recommended dose for adults is one injection every two weeks. Side effects include severe infection, reactivation of TB or , rare allergic reactions, very rare serious , , and other cancers. This drug blocks two proteins called interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, which are parts of the immune system. Interleukins-12 and 23 promote the inflammation associated with psoriasis. Stelara is injected under the skin at the start of treatment, after four weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Ustekinumab may potentially increase the risk of malignancy or infection; it also may rarely cause allergic reactions, including skin , facial swelling, and difficulty with breathing. This was one of the original biologic medications used for psoriasis. Advantages are that onset of action is faster than many systemic treatments. Disadvantages are that it must be administered by infusion and, over time, antibodies may develop and decrease its effectiveness. It is an antibody that acts as an interleukin 17 (IL-17) antagonist and, after a loading dose, is administered monthly. IL-17 is another substance that promotes an inflammatory reaction. is an antibody that inhibits IL-17 with a similar mode of action to secukinumab. is another antibody that inhibits interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA). is another antibody that inhibits IL-23. Conventional therapy is one that has been tested with clinical trials or has other evidence of clinical effectiveness. The FDA has approved several drugs for the treatment of psoriasis as described above. Some patients look to alternative therapy, changes, , or stress-reducing techniques to help reduce symptoms. For the most part, alternative therapies have not been tested with clinical trials, and the FDA has not approved dietary for treatment of psoriasis. There are no specific foods to eat or to avoid (except for alcohol) for patients with psoriasis. However, some other therapies can be found on the National Psoriasis Foundation web site. Individuals should check with their doctors before starting any therapy. Some medications purchased online, both oral and topical, may actually contain pharmaceuticals that would normally require a prescription. This becomes a problem with unanticipated medication side effects and interactions. Caution should always be exercised in purchasing and using such products. If one is taking a systemic retinoid such as acitretin or covering large areas with a topical retinoid (Tazorac) or a vitamin D analog (calcipotriene, calcitriol), he or she should be careful about taking ""megadoses"" of the same as a supplement. In rare cases, vitamin toxicity can occur. A variety of herbal therapies have been reported in the lay press and on the Internet to help psoriasis. Some of these are oral and some topical, but none have been shown to have any predictable benefit at this time. Some, such as tea tree oil, coconut oil, and , are known to cause , which can transform a bothersome plaque into an oozing, blistering, intensely itchy one. There is no good evidence to support the use of apple cider vinegar or household cleaning products either. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic disease that goes away and returns. Follow-up care depends on the severity of the disease at any given time. If a patient has evidence of psoriatic arthritis, a consultation with a rheumatologist (a physician who specializes in arthritis) is helpful. Avoiding environmental factors that trigger psoriasis, such as smoking, and stress, may help prevent or minimize flare-ups of psoriasis. Sun exposure may help in many cases of psoriasis and aggravate it in others. Alcohol is considered a risk factor for psoriasis, even moderate amounts of beer. People should minimize alcohol use if they have psoriasis. This is especially important if they are taking medications such as methotrexate or acitretin. Specific dietary restrictions or supplements other than a well-balanced and adequate diet are not important in the management of plaque psoriasis. Recently, some data has supported that an ""anti-inflammatory"" diet that is high in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated and trans may help manage psoriasis, although the value in preventing its onset is less certain. Psoriasis is more of an inconvenience in most cases than it is threatening. However, it is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease for which there is no true cure. The itching and peeling of skin can lead to significant pain and self-esteem issues. By far, the patient's quality of life is affected most with plaque psoriasis. Self-consciousness and embarrassment about appearance, inconvenience, and high costs of treatment options all affect one's outlook when living with psoriasis. It has recently become apparent that many patients with psoriasis are predisposed to , , and premature cardiovascular disease. It is important that such patients seek good overall medical care aside from simply treating their skin disease. , , or stress may worsen symptoms and increase the tendency to itch. Most patients can expect significant improvement from the treatment of their psoriasis. Education of psoriasis patients is one of the foundations for managing this chronic and typically relapsing disorder. Patients should be familiar with the treatment options in order to make proper informed decisions about therapy. The National Psoriasis Foundation is an excellent organization that provides support to patients with psoriasis.

Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis and is characterized by red skin covered with silvery scales and inflammation. Patches of circular to oval shaped red plaques that itch or burn are typical of plaque psoriasis. The patches are usually found on the arms, legs, trunk, or scalp but may be found on any part of the skin. The most typical areas are the knees and elbows.

3be5b353-ea9b-4d92-b615-b9f4ac2397c6,"Psoriasis is just one possible cause of scalp sores. Do you know the rest? They can be unsightly, uncomfortable and even painful. And, to add insult to injury, they have the potential to cause -- at least temporarily. Fortunately, scalp sores are typically treatable, although a doctor's expertise may be needed. Generally speaking, the small wounds result from fungal, bacterial or viral infections. Blocked hair shafts can also cause the sores. Serious immune disorders, such as , are responsible in some instances. may indicate one of the following skin conditions: This condition arises when bacteria enter a cut on the scalp. Antibacterial soap can keep the cut clean to prevent it. An uncommon disease of the immune system, pemphigus occurs when the immune system turns on healthy cells. A dermatologist can diagnose the condition. When new skin cells are produced before existing skin cells have matured, they create an overload that results in sores that have a tendency to itch. Psoriasis, like pemphigus, is an immune system disease. This fungal infection can lead not only to sores, but also black spots and loss of hair. Treatments for scalp sores vary depending on the source of the problem. Antifungal medication taken in conjunction with the use of an antifungal shampoo is often prescribed by doctors for ringworm. Antibiotics are used for bacterial infections such as impetigo. Sores created by immune system diseases tend to be more stubborn, and require oral or injected medications and topical creams. Medication plus phototherapy, which limits cell turnover, may be called upon to treat psoriasis. In each of these instances, you'll want to consult a doctor, but there are home remedies that are helpful in preventing or minimizing the effect of scalp sores. If you have reason to believe you've been exposed to ringworm, try an over-the-counter antifungal shampoo for two weeks. These shampoos won't eliminate the condition if it's already set in but can ward off the problem. When it comes to viral, bacterial or fungal infections, cleanliness is the key. Shampoo after workouts to eliminate sweat, don't allow your scalp to stay moist for an extended period of time, and clean cuts with a sanitizing liquid. You can also guard against the spread of infections by not sharing hair accessories, hats or scarves. In addition, don't use someone else's comb or brush since some scalp conditions are easily passed from one person to another. American Academy of Dermatology.

Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by raised red patches and flaky, silvery scales. Generally seen in adults, psoriasis can develop at any age. Symptoms can be permanent or intermittent. How do you get psoriasis? A trigger (e.g. emotional stress, local injury to skin, systemic infection or the use of some medications) may cause a flare-up or even lead to the development of psoriasis. The exact cause of psoriasis is not quite understood but experts tend to agree that this disease begins with a malfunction of the immune system and resulting inflammation. Something triggers the white blood cells found in the immune system, inflammation ensues, and skin cells rise to the surface, shedding at an unusually fast rate (30 days for normal skin cells vs. 3–4 days for psoriasis skin cells). What triggers psoriasis in one person is likely different from another person. Psoriasis triggers may include stress, injuries to the skin (e.g. vaccinations, sunburns and scratches), certain medications (e.g. lithium, an antidepressant; quinidine for heart conditions), beta blockers (antihypertensive) and infections (e.g. earache, bronchitis, tonsillitis or a respiratory infection). The weather may affect psoriasis positively or negatively; the winter months often dry and irritate the skin, while the summer sun often helps psoriasis plaques fade.

It can make your skin extremely sensitive to certain skin products. “Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition in which the body has increased turnover of skin cells, which results in scaling red patches on areas such as the elbows, the knees, and the scalp,” says Rajani Katta, MD, board-certified dermatologist and author of “Glow: The Dermatologist’s Guide to a Whole Foods Younger Skin Diet.” The good news, says Michael Kassardjian, MD, board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles, is that topical treatments used in the shower can greatly improve your symptoms. If you have psoriasis, these dermatologist-recommended ingredients and products will keep flare-ups at bay and help clear up your skin. “These have been found helpful when used in prescription strength shampoos,” says Dr. Katta. “Salicylic acid helps remove the scales and urea helps thin out thick plaques and soften the skin,” says Dr. Joshua Zeichner, MD, and Director of Cosmetic & Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital. “Zinc pyrithione is useful in more mild cases to help reduce inflammation and flaking,” says Dr. Zeichner. “It is thought that yeast on the skin may be a driving factor for inflammation, leading to flaking and dandruff.” More research is needed, but these products could help: “Tar helps skin cells mature properly and has been used for decades to treat psoriasis,” says Dr. Kassardjian Essential oils for use in treating inflammatory conditions, including dermatitis, eczema, and lupus. However, according to the , these natural remedies are effective when used in conjunction with traditional treatment methods. It notes that tea tree oil has not been scientifically proven to effectively treat psoriasis, but that some people find tea tree oil shampoos relieve their scalp psoriasis. Aloe vera has been in the treatment of psoriasis. One study found that applying a .5 percent aloe vera extract 3 times a day for 4 weeks saw 25 out of 30 patients with improved symptoms. : on fish oil is mixed. However, found that taking at least 3 grams of it per day may show some benefits. It’s psoriasis care 101, but ditch the soaps and shampoos with fragrance additives, as they can trigger allergic reactions, advises Dr. Katta. Also, keep an eye out for products with methylisothiazolinone — a ridiculously named preservative that is also linked to allergic reactions. Anything with an alkaline pH should also stay out of your shower, says Dr. Zeichner, because it can disrupt the outer skin layer. Last but not least, say goodbye to products that require frequent use, which are a one-way ticket to dryness and irritation. “When you use shampoos, think of them more as short contact therapies,” says Dr. Zeichner. “While they will clean the hair, the goal with psoriasis shampoo is to treat the scalp.” Here are his rules for application: Using your fingertips, massage a dollop of shampoo into your scalp. Let it work its magic while you sing Happy Birthday — or any other song that lasts about 20–30 seconds. Rinse — don’t repeat. Until your next shower, that is. Now that you know how to , pick up any of these doctor-approved options: , $10“Salicylic acid is particularly useful if you have thick scales on the scalp,” says Dr. Zeichner. “It can be used every day or as needed.” , $11Ketoconazole shampoo contains an anti-fungal ingredient and may help with some of the scalp inflammation seen in psoriasis. Neutrogena T/Gel Extra Strength Therapeutic Shampoo, $11“This contains a purified version of tar, which may help reduce some of the [flaking] of the scalp,” says Dr. Katta. , $16Yeast is a big component behind inflammation and scale-like symptoms on the scalp. The zinc in this shampoo takes care of that nasty yeast, says Dr. Zeichner. “This shampoo is useful if you have dandruff or mild forms of psoriasis. It can even be used as a face cleanser in areas like the eyebrows and around the nose where psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis show up.” For soaps, reach for products that don’t contain common allergens. Some suggestions: Aveeno Skin Relief Gentle Scent Body Wash Soothing Oat & Chamomile, $22“Especially if the skin is dry or itchy, look for hydrating and skin protecting ingredients like colloidal oatmeal, which is found in this soap,” says Dr. Zeichner. , $14This soap has a gentle foaming formula that won’t strip the skin of its natural barrier. , $12Dr. Katta recommends this liquid cleanser to anyone with super sensitive skin. One note: It doesn’t foam, so don’t go crazy trying to lather it up. , $10There’s no fragrance or formaldehyde preservatives, which is great for people with psoriasis. , $15“This cleanser contains salicylic acid and helps thin out thick, bothersome psoriasis plaques,” says Dr. Zeichner. While you should always keep your healthcare provider in the loop, if your joints start hurting you should make an appointment ASAP. About 30 percent of people with psoriasis will also develop , which causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in and around the joints. There’s also another form of psoriasis called palmoplantar pustular psoriasis, which causes deep blisters or pustules within psoriasis patches and usually requires medical treatment, Dr. Katta explains. Finally, if your psoriasis is worsening, spreading, or preventing you from social or professional obligations, it’s time to check in with your dermatologist, adds Dr. Katta. At the end of the day, managing your psoriasis should be easy-peasy with the help of your doctor and a psoriasis-friendly skin care/cleansing routine.

aaed35f2-15df-4d30-b5e8-b0519a2b37f3,"Chapped lips are a pain, and a runny nose is annoying. An itchy scalp is another common ailment, but one whose cause can be a little harder to determine. It isn't considered good manners to scratch your head in public, and no one wants to look in the mirror and see skin flakes all over their shirt. Some scalp ailments aren't just itchy -- they're painful. Certain skin conditions can cause scalp tenderness or burning, and scratching too hard can lead to open wounds that are vulnerable to infection. It's also tough to get a good night's sleep when an itch is driving you nuts. What causes an itchy scalp? And how can you make it stop? See the next page to get started. If you're an adult, there's a good chance your itchy scalp is resulting in dandruff -- oily, dead skin flakes that fall from your scalp. Some cases of dandruff are mild and can be fixed by simple changes to your hygiene regimen. Infrequent hair washing, for example, lets oil and dead skin cells accumulate, which can result in flakes, while overwashing can strip away oils and cause itchiness. There are also several skin conditions that can cause dandruff, including seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis and eczema. A new hair washing routine won't do the trick in these cases -- a trip to a dermatologist to discuss treatment is a better bet. ID'ing the cause of your itchy scalp is crucial to finding the right treatment. What works for mild dandruff isn't going to be effective on a serious skin condition. Let's take a look at the possibilities: If your skin is sensitive to certain ingredients or dyes, your solution is simple: Switch products. Scalp psoriasis is caused by a malfunctioning immune system. Its hallmark is red, scaly patches. A fungal infection related to athlete's foot, scalp ringworm results in scaly or bald patches ]. Ringworm isn't the only fungus that infests the scalp. A yeast-like organism called malassezia can cause dandruff, too. In children, an itchy scalp is often the sign of , a common childhood disease that spreads easily. The parasites feed on blood, and an allergic reaction to their saliva is what causes the itch [source: ]. The answer to your itchy scalp may be at the nearest drugstore. Dandruff shampoos, which can also treat some cases of seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis, have different active ingredients. You may have to try a few to find the one that works -- or even alternate between them. Some of your choices include: zinc pyrithione (Selsun Salon and Head & Shoulders) You can usually get rid of lice with over-the-counter insecticide shampoos (pediculicides) such as Rid or Nix. In some cases, shampoo isn't going to do the trick. If your itchy scalp proves stubborn, make an appointment with a health care professional. For example, if Rid or Nix didn't finish the job with head lice, there are also prescription remedies (Sklice and Ulesfia) that can kill the parasites. Psoriasis treatment progresses in stages. A doctor may start with a topical medication that goes on the scalp. The next step is light therapy, either with lasers or without. Excimer lasers can treat plaques without harming the surrounding skin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved several medications for psoriasis -- some are injected, while others are infused or simply swallowed [source: ]. Ringworm treatment can take awhile -- six weeks or more. The usual fix is an oral antifungal medication, such as Grifulvin V, Gris-Peg or Lamasil, that can be sprinkled on food. The worst-case scenario for itchy scalp is a condition that results in hair loss. Ringworm is often marked by round patches of broken-off hair, but if there are no complications, it will grow back. In some instances, ringworm can result in a painful bump with a thick yellow crust, known as a kerion. These can cause scarring and permanent hair loss, but they are rarely found in kids older than 10. Psoriasis-related hair loss, which is usually temporary, can happen if there's too much scratching or if scales are removed too vigorously. Gentle treatment is best when it comes to the product and how it's used. Is the sodium lauryl sulfate in my shampoo killing me? American Academy of Dermatology. ""Seborrheic Dermatitis.""

843a6968-0c27-41ca-a226-86983244b7ad,"Itchy scalp in adults is often caused by dandruff. See more . ©/dawn liljenquist An itchy scalp is a common ailment, one that may be the result of a skin condition or not. Beyond the discomfort of the itchiness, an itchy scalp can cause several problems. For some people, the condition can be embarrassing. It might be socially unacceptable scratch one's head in public, and the fear of unattractive flakes in the hair or on the shoulders can make some uncomfortable and self-conscious. A common cause of itchy scalp for adults is dandruff. Typically caused by a number of skin conditions, including seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema and other factors, dandruff refers to the characteristic flakes of itchy, oily dead skin that can fall from the scalp. It's a symptom of numerous scalp disorders, including scalp fungus, eczema, psoriasis and other causes [source: ]. Dandruff also can be mild or extremely severe. In mild cases, some simple lifestyle changes can eliminate the problem; extreme cases, on the other hand, may require some treatment. In children, an itchy scalp is often the sign of a different condition altogether. As many parents can probably attest, an infestation of head lice is a common childhood disease that spreads easily. The scientific name, , describes the tiny parasite that feeds on blood from the victim's scalp. The scalp itches because the saliva from the pests causes an allergic reaction [source: ]. Children are also likely to get scalp ringworm, another contagious condition that causes itchiness. Some scalp ailments aren't just itchy -- they can hurt due to painfully tender spots or a burning sensation in places. Sometimes the itchiness can be so severe that the sufferer breaks the skin. When that happens, there's a risk that the open wounds will get infected and lead to further problems. An itchy scalp can also be so uncomfortable that the victim has trouble sleeping. Another potential consequence is hair loss, although it's usually temporary. See the next page to learn how to lower your odds of falling victim to some types of itchy scalp. Itchy scalp due to dandruff can have many causes. For example, how often you wash your hair can lead to the condition. Infrequent washing can cause a buildup of oil and skin cells and lead to dandruff flakes. Hair that's washed too often, on the other hand, can also lead to itchy scalp, because the oil that protects the scalp gets stripped away. Cold weather and the dry indoor air can also lead to a dry scalp [source: ]. Stress can affect dandruff, too. For instance, it can cause conditions like seborrheic dermatitis, which is characterized by an oily, waxy scalp and white or yellowish-brown flakes, to flare up [source: ]. One major contributor to itchy scalp is the skin condition called . Caused by a malfunction in the body's immune system where overactive white blood cells mistakenly heal healthy skin cells, psoriasis can lead to a buildup of itchy, red, swollen patches on the body. The malfunction may have its roots in both genes and the environment [source: ]. Unlike lice and despite its name, scalp ringworm is not caused by a small pest. It's a mold-like fungal infection and related to athlete's foot and jock itch. The name comes from its resulting round patches of baldness or scaliness [source: ]. Another fungus, a yeast-like one known malassezia, can cause dandruff. Many people have this fungus but experience no problems. For others, some additional factors, including an oily scalp, stress, hormones or illness, may play a part in turning the fungus from a benign presence to an issue. For example, people with Parkinson's disease or those recovering from a heart attack or stroke are more susceptible to dandruff [source: ]. Sometimes an itchy scalp will heal over time -- an infant's cradle cap or a sunburned scalp, for example, tend to go away after a while. Some itchy scalp conditions can be resolved easily with a simple change of daily habits. Other problems require medical intervention. Read on to find out when you should see a doctor. Both of these scalp conditions are easily transmitted by head-to-head contact. They can also spread from object to human; a common occurrence is when children share caps or brushes. Towels and pillows can also facilitate transmission [source: ]. The right treatment to soothe that itchy scalp depends, of course, on the cause. The first line of defense against most itchy scalp conditions will be an at-home remedy such as a shampoo. Often, the success rate is high, but stubborn situations will require medical advice and prescription treatments. For example, folliculitis, an infection of a hair follicle, might be so mild that it clears up in a few days without any treatment whatsoever. In other cases, a doctor may need to prescribe an antibiotic or antifungal medication. Ringworm always requires medical attention, but lice can often be eliminated with over-the-counter remedies. Moreover, treatment for ringworm may last six weeks or more. The usual treatment for ringworm is an oral antifungal medication in liquid, tablet or granular form that is sprinkled on food. Three approved ringworm medications are Grifulvin V, Gris-Peg and Lamasil [source: ]. In some cases, over-the-counter medications won't do the trick for lice, and prescription lotions or shampoos are necessary. These medications must be prescribed with care, because they have potentially serious side effects [source: ]. Some cases of psoriasis can be treated by over-the-counter medications. If those are not effective, a doctor initially will prescribe a topical medication that you apply to the scalp instead of the hair. If that isn't successful, the next step is light therapy. Both non-laser and laser treatments can be used. One example of laser therapy is an excimer laser. It treats patches of psoriasis without harming unaffected areas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved a number of medications for psoriasis, which may be injected, infused or swallowed [source: ]. Over-the-counter shampoos often work to clear up dandruff. However, if these shampoos don't deliver results after several weeks of use, a prescription shampoo or steroid lotion might be required. Read on to learn more about some home remedies for dandruff and other itchy scalp conditions. Scalp psoriasis and eczema have similar symptoms, although psoriasis scales are typically thicker and drier than eczema. Another clue is that psoriasis can usually also be found on other parts of the body such as the elbows, knees, buttocks or fingers. There is some overlap in treatments of the two conditions, although scalp psoriasis can be harder to treat effectively [source: ]. If you should see flakes of dandruff on your hair and clothes, don't panic. First, try to determine the cause. Contact dermatitis, a sensitivity to products or dyes, may be the problem -- if this is the issue, simply use a different product. In other cases, cutting down on the usage of a product might be all that is required. Is your dandruff caused by too frequent or infrequent washings? Again, all you usually need to do is to make a slight adjustment in daily hygiene habits. If flakes and flecks don't seem to be a reaction to a hair product or a question of how often you wash your hair, start to explore shampoo choices. You can find different types of medication in a variety of dandruff shampoos: zinc pyrithione (Selsun Salon and Head & Shoulders) Over-the-counter dandruff shampoos can be used to treat seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis and the general instances of dandruff. Different cases respond to different types of shampoo, and experimentation may be the only way to find out what works for a particular case. Some people find that using one type of shampoo one day and another the next time is effective. To maximize the chance of success, leave the shampoo on for the recommended amount of time. A healthy diet and less stress may also help bring positive results. Lice can usually be eliminated with over-the-counter insecticide shampoos such as Rid or Nix. For a child with lice who is under the age of two, or for people who would rather avoid chemicals, doctors recommend using a nit comb on wet hair. This careful procedure needs to be repeated every few days for about two weeks. In some unfortunate cases, an itchy scalp can lead to hair loss. Read on to find out some things you can do to reduce your chances of losing hair when you have scalp psoriasis. Lice survival depends on being fed regularly. If they are forced to skip meals for a couple of days, they'll die. Additionally, the eggs, or nits, need the warmth of the scalp. Without either or those, they can only survive a few days [source: ]. A characteristic of ringworm is its round patches of broken-off hair. The patches may look like they have dots, because the hair often breaks off near the scalp and leaves a bit of stubble. If there are no complications, hair lost because of ringworm will grow back. In some instances, ringworm can result in an inflammation called a . A kerion is a painful bump with a thick yellow crust. The spongy bumps may ooze pus, and the victim may experience a fever and swollen lymph nodes, too. Kerion is most frequently a complication of ringworm in young children, but it's rarely seen in anyone older than elementary school age. The side effect can lead to scarring and permanent hair loss, so it's important to seek medical attention if the problem is suspected. In addition to the antifungal topical medications for ringworm, a doctor may prescribe an antibiotic and an oral corticosteroid to reduce swelling [source: ]. Psoriasis can also lead to hair loss, but it doesn't come from the psoriasis itself. Psoriasis-related hair lost can be a result of too much scratching, which can pull on the hair. Second, hair loss may result if the sufferer is too forceful in removing the psoriasis scales. Gentle treatment -- brushing and combing rather than picking -- is the best way to deal with the thick scales. Moreover, some psoriasis treatments can be too harsh for some people. The harshness can stem from the product itself or how it's used. Finally, stress is a factor in psoriasis-related hair loss. It may ease a victim's stress to know that psoriasis-related hair loss is usually a temporary problem [source: ]. Modern medicine can do a great deal to bring relief from itchy scalp and minimize the chance of permanent hair loss. For lots more information, visit the links on the next page.

Guidelines for the management of psoriasis — codes and concepts This document incorporates and summarises information from a number of publications, including guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [1,4], UpToDate [2,7,10,16,17,23,26] and the NZ Formulary [20,22]. It is relevant to the treatment of psoriasis in New Zealand. In this guideline, psoriasis refers to psoriasis, unless otherwise specified. Psoriasis is a chronic  skin disorder that is characterised by disfiguring,  and   that may be itchy or painful. Although once thought of as a  dermatological condition with few serious complications, psoriasis is now considered a inflammatory disease that is associated with, or increases, the risk of other comorbidities. Psoriasis can be both emotionally and physically debilitating and significantly impact the quality of life [1,2]. The of psoriasis worldwide is 0.5% to 11.4% in adults, and 0% to 1.4% in children [3]. Psoriasis is at a higher prevalence with increasing distance from the equator [2]. The prevalence of psoriasis in New Zealand has not yet been established. Studies have shown the prevalence of psoriasis in adults to be 2.3% to 6.6% in Australia, and 1.3% to 2.2% in the United Kingdom [3,4]. Rates of psoriasis vary between ethnic groups. A small study suggests that Maori and Pacific Islander peoples may be overrepresented in New Zealand compared to New Zealand Europeans [5]. While most cases of psoriasis present before age 35, psoriasis can at any age [4]. Males and females are equally affected by psoriasis [2]. Psoriasis is a complex immune-mediated disease. , , and factor are key in the [2]. A contributes to the of psoriasis. Approximately 40% of people with psoriasis or psoriatic have an affected family member [2]. psoriasis has been associated with changes in the , and [6]. Other risk factors for psoriasis include smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption [2]. Medications can psoriasis or cause a psoriasis-like . Examples include beta-blockers, lithium and antimalarial drugs. Certain and viral have also been linked to psoriasis [2]. The clinical features of typical patterns of psoriasis are described below. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis in children and adults, accounting for 55–90% of cases [2,4]. The scalp, elbows, knees and are the most frequently involved sites. Plaques are erythematous with defined margins and often have a silvery . Scale is less evident after bathing or after the application of a moisturiser. The plaques are frequently . In people with darker skin, may be present [2]. Guttate psoriasis is characterised by an of psoriatic plaques and , typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The main sites involved are the trunk and extremities. Guttate psoriasis is strongly associated with a preceding , most frequently streptococcal . Typically, it arises in children and young adults who have not had psoriasis before [2]. Pustular psoriasis has the potential to be life-threatening. It is characterised by rapid-onset generalised , scaling and superficial [2]. Erythrodermic psoriasis is uncommon, can be acute or chronic, and involves erythema and scaling from head to toe [2]. Inverse psoriasis is characterised by psoriasis affecting the regions, including the axillary, inframammary, , , genital and areas. This type of psoriasis can easily be misdiagnosed, as there is often no visible scale. It affects children more commonly than adults [2,7]. Signs of disease include , , red spots on the and crumbling of the . Signs of nail bed involvement include the , , and splinter haemorrhages [2]. Koebnerised psoriasis is psoriasis arising in areas of  injury [8,9]. Approximately 7–42% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis [10]. Comorbidities associated with psoriasis include obesity, metabolic , cardiovascular disease, , disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and diabetes), chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), depression, and alcohol abuse [8,10]. Severe psoriasis can cause death, particularly extensive erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis [2]. Psoriasis is a clinical diagnosis. A skin can be considered when there is diagnostic uncertainty [2]. Its severity, using both objective and subjective measures An objective assessment of psoriasis severity can be made using the static Physician’s Global Assessment (see below) or the . The PASI is generally used in specialist settings [1]. 0 - no plaque elevation above the normal skin1 - minimal plaque elevation, ~ 0.25mm2 - mild plaque elevation, ~0.5 mm3 - moderate plaque elevation, ~0.75mm4 - marked plaque elevation, ~1 mm5 - severe plaque elevation, > 1.25 mm 0 - no evidence of erythema, hyperpigmentation may be present1 - faint erythema2 - light red colouration3 - moderate red colouration4 - bright red colouration5 - dusky to deep red colouration 0 - no evidence of scale1 - minimal; occasional fine scale over < 5% of the 2 - mild; fine-scale predominates3 - moderate; coarse-scale predominates4 - marked; thick, non-tenacious scale predominates5 - severe; very thick tenacious scale predominates 0 = clear, 1 = nearly clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 = very severe The patient's assessment of the severity of their psoriasis can be assessed using the static Patient's Global Assessment (graded as clear, nearly clear, mild, moderate, severe or very severe) [1] or a validated self-assessed or patient-oriented PASI score. Body surface area (BSA) affected can be classified as: (Note: 0.5% of BSA in adults is approximately equal to the palm of the patient’s hand, excluding fingers [11]) The following features may indicate severe psoriasis due to the impact on the quality of life: Involvement of visible areas, major parts of the scalp, genitals, palms or soles Onycholysis or onychodystrophy of at least two fingernails When assessing the impact of psoriasis on physical, psychological and social wellbeing, questions to consider include: How does having psoriasis affect the patient’s daily life at home, work or at school? How is the patient coping with psoriasis and are they using any treatments? How does the patient feel — depressed, anxious, worthless, lonely? How is psoriasis affecting the patient’s relationship with their partner, family, friends, and carers? Does the patient need further advice or support? [1] Quality of life measurement is important to properly assess the full effect of an illness such as psoriasis on patients. Two  specific tools to assess the impact on the quality of life are: Dermatology Life Quality Index (): a self-reported questionnaire that consists of 10 items. The final score ranges from 0 to 30. DLQI ≤ 10 indicates mild to moderate disease, and DLQI > 10 indicates severe disease [12]. Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI): adapted for children age 4 to 16, and identical in structure to the DLQI. The child can complete it independently or with help from their caregiver [1]. People with psoriasis should be screened for psoriatic arthritis annually. This is best achieved in care and specialist settings through the use of a validated tool, such as the Psoriasis Screening Tool (PEST) [1]. Consider a non-urgent referral or seeking rheumatology advice if the score is > 2 [1,8]. Has a doctor ever told you that you have arthritis? Do your fingernails or toenails have holes or pits? Have you had a finger or toe that was completely swollen and painful for no apparent reason? Consider referral to rheumatology with a score > 2 Assess risk factors and comorbid disease of psoriasis at presentation and as indicated thereafter.  Cardiovascular risk factors, and management of these (eg, smoking ) Measure blood pressure, studies and fasting at least annually. Risk of and its management [1]. Signs of , skin , and tumours, according to guidelines for age, , and phototherapy [10] Children with psoriasis may have higher rates of associated comorbid disease. Recommended screening for risk factors and comorbid disease depend on the child’s age [15]. All ages — psoriatic arthritis, , annually for depression and anxiety From age 2 — annually for elevated body mass index (BMI) From age 10 — 3 yearly for diabetes in patients who are obese or overweight and have 2 or more risk factors for diabetes; screen for NAFLD in those who are obese or overweight with additional risk factors for NAFLD. From age 11 — annual substance abuse screening [15] Eye conditions may occur more commonly in people with psoriasis (blepharitis, , , corneal and ). Consider asking patients about symptoms at each follow-up appointment [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — seborrhoeic dermatitis presents with erythematous patches with overlying scale. The scalp, ears and intertriginous areas are commonly affected. Differences from psoriasis — seborrhoeic dermatitis has a fine, greasy scale. The eyebrows, nasolabial folds, central chest and postauricular area are generally involved [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — atopic dermatitis commonly presents as excoriated areas with erythema, hyperpigmentation and scale. may be present. Differences from psoriasis — atopic dermatitis generally lacks the thick, coarse-scale and well- borders of psoriasis. Itch is a more prominent feature of atopic dermatitis, and in infants, the napkin area is usually spared. Occasionally patients are affected by both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis [2,7]. Similarities to psoriasis — fungal infections present with erythematous plaques and pustules. Onychomycosis may be mistaken for nail psoriasis. Differences from psoriasis — a skin scraping or nail clipping show fungal elements on and the causative is confirmed by [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — cutaneous T-cell lymphoma usually presents with erythematous, plaques and variable itch, and sometimes as (Sézary syndrome). Differences from psoriasis — the plaques of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tend to be less and less scaly, and they are not distributed symmetrically. and are common in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [8,16]. The differential diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis also includes: Pityriasis rosea is an important differential for guttate psoriasis [7]. While psoriasis is treatable, there is no cure [8]. Successful management is  on the patient understanding the chronic nature of psoriasis and the  options that are available to them. Points to consider include: Reassuring the patient and the patient’s family that psoriasis is not contagious. Determining how the patient perceives their disability and their preference and commitment to therapy. Discussing the risks and benefits of treatment options. Providing general advice regarding the benefits of not smoking, avoiding excessive alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight and blood pressure [1,17]. Advice to avoid direct pressure on areas of psoriasis where possible. An acceptable treatment response is either BSA ≤ 3% or an improvement in BSA ≥ 75% from , 3 months after treatment initiation [18]. The ideal target for treatment response is BSA ≤ 1% 3 months after treatment initiation maintained at every 6-month assessment interval during maintenance therapy. Referral to a for advice or face-to-face assessment is recommended in the following circumstances: Children with psoriasis at the time of diagnosis [1] Erythrodermic or generalised pustular psoriasis (emergency referral) or unstable psoriasis (urgent referral).  symptoms ( and ) may indicate unstable forms of psoriasis. Difficult to treat sites (face, genitalia, palms and soles) with inadequate response to initial treatment [1,8] Moderate to severe psoriasis likely to require phototherapy or systemic treatment Acute guttate psoriasis, for consideration of phototherapy Nail psoriasis with a significant functional or cosmetic impact [1] Significant impact on the quality of life, including a DLQI score > 9 [1,8] Any person who has psoriasis challenging to manage in the general practice (GP) setting [1,8]. Note: Public hospital dermatology services in NZ may have more stringent referral criteria due to a dermatology workforce shortage. Patients with ocular symptoms that may indicate an eye condition associated with psoriasis should be referred to an [2,8]. Patients with arthritis and PEST score ≥ 3 should be referred to a . Patients may also require assessment by a gastroenterologist if they have NAFLD or abnormal liver function tests on systemic medications for psoriasis. Consider patient preferences, cosmetic and practical aspects of treatment, and the body surface area affected [1]. Discuss the different available. An is preferred for plaques with thick scale [1]. Discuss referral for phototherapy or systemic therapy if patients are unlikely to respond adequately to topical therapy alone, including those with: Ensure the patient understands: Once a satisfactory outcome has been achieved, treatments can be reduced to the amount needed to maintain psoriasis control [1] They should seek medical advice if the therapy is not tolerated, as the dose should be reduced or the therapy changed to an alternative [20]. After a new topical therapy is started, arrange to review adults in 4 weeks and children in 2 weeks to: Assess the response to treatment, and how it has been tolerated Highlight the importance of a break between courses of potent and very potent Identify the need for daily use of topical corticosteroids, which indicates that systemic therapy should be considered Discuss treatment alternatives if the response has been unsatisfactory [1]. If the response has been unsatisfactory, consider the following: Difficulties with current therapy, such as tolerance, practical aspects of the application and cosmetic acceptability Review psoriasis patients at least annually to assess for adverse effects of steroid therapy, if: An adult is using potent or very potent corticosteroids Recommend to all patients with psoriasis [19]. They improve dryness, scaling and cracking and may have their own properties. They can be used with other treatments [20]. Emollients may be all that is required to treat mild psoriasis. Emollients are especially beneficial for psoriasis of the palms and soles [20]. Ointments and thick are most effective, particularly when applied straight after a shower or bath [17]. A soap substitute such as aqueous can help improve symptoms. The formulation of aqueous cream funded in NZ can also be prescribed as an as it is sodium lauryl sulphate free [8]. Coal tar has and anti-scaling properties [20]. Its use may be limited because it stains skin and clothes, is messy to apply, and has a strong smell [17]. Coal tar sometimes causes irritation, contact , and sterile folliculitis [20]. Highlight the importance of shampoo formulations reaching the scalp [17]. It is useful for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in adults. include acute psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and skin . It can cause irritation and staining of skin, and clothing. It is effective on large, thick plaques as ‘short-contact therapy’, where it is applied daily, initially with a contact time of 10 minutes which is steadily increased to 30 minutes over 7 days. Salicylic acid is a  agent that reduces scaling and increases penetration of other topical treatments. It can be prescribed in combination with a topical or emollient. It is often already present in coal tar formulations. Salicylic acid is in women who are pregnant. Use with caution in children under 5 years of age (a concentration < 0.5% can be used on limited areas), patients with psoriasis, and patients with or impairment [21]. Calcipotriol is often used as first-line therapy for plaque psoriasis. It is also available in combination with topical betamethasone dipropionate and is available as , ointment and foam formulations. Contraindications to calcipotriol include calcium disorders and . Use with caution in generalised pustular, guttate and erythrodermic psoriasis where there is an increased risk of hypercalcaemia [20]. Calcipotriol may cause irritation when applied to sensitive sites (eg, the groin). To avoid inactivation of calcipotriol: Apply calcipotriol and salicylic acid at different times, for example, one in the morning and the other in the evening Maximum dose of calcipotriol in adults is 100 g/week, in children 12–18 years is 75 g/week, and in children 6–12 years is 50 g/week [20,22]. Monitor calcium and renal function before commencing calcipotriol and 3-monthly following this if maximum doses may be exceeded [20,22]. Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and properties through their effect on [17]. Match the strength and formulation to the patient’s preference and need [1]. Improvement generally occurs with topical corticosteroids but the response is usually incomplete and the length of remains difficult to predict [17]. Prolonged potent or very potent corticosteroid use may result in: Potent corticosteroids should not be used continuously at any site for more than 4 weeks without a break. They can be used long term intermittently. Very potent corticosteroids should not be used for more than 4 weeks continuously. The advice of a dermatologist should be sought for ongoing use. A 4-week break is recommended between courses of potent or very potent corticosteroids (including when combined with calcipotriol). Offer an alternative topical treatment option during this time to maintain control of psoriasis if required (eg, calcipotriol or coal tar). Do not apply topical corticosteroids to more than 10% of BSA. Very potent corticosteroids are not suitable for children [1]. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are calcineurin . They will normally be initiated by a dermatologist or doctor with expertise in treating psoriasis. They are used in adults for the treatment of facial, or genital psoriasis if other therapies have not been successful. The most common side effects of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are burning and itching that generally reduces with ongoing usage. Adverse effects also include erythema and skin infections. Tacrolimus is expensive and needs to be specially compounded off-label in New Zealand (2019) [20]. It is best used in combination with topical corticosteroids. The most common side effect is skin irritation [17]. Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the trunk, limbs or scalp Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the trunk, limbs or scalp Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas Phototherapy appears to slow and reduce the activity of implicated in the formation of psoriatic plaques [17]. It is suitable for most people with an inadequate response to topical therapy [24]. It can be given as monotherapy or in combination with topical or systemic agents [20]. The types of phototherapy are narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB), broadband UVB, and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) [1,17]. Potential short-term side effects of phototherapy include: Nausea with psoralen tablets (used in systemic PUVA) [25]. Potential long-term side effects of phototherapy include: Skin cancer. Cancer risk has not been reported with narrowband UVB, however, it is possible that risk will be identified with longer follow-up [25,26]. Phototherapy may not be an option for young children (< 5 years) or people with psychological or physical difficulties that preclude standing in the treatment booth. Narrowband UVB phototherapy is the most commonly used form of phototherapy [24]. It is especially useful for people with guttate or chronic plaque psoriasis [1,20]. UVB phototherapy is given 2 to 3 times a week for 6–12 weeks. Exposures are initially under a minute and are increased over time [1,24]. UVB phototherapy can exacerbate inflammatory psoriasis [20]. The absolute contraindications to UVB phototherapy are lupus erythematosus and xeroderma pigmentosum [26]. PUVA may be suitable for selected patients, such as those with localised [1,20,24]. Psoralen amplifies the effect of UVA therapy and can be given orally or [20]. The following should be discussed before commencing PUVA for psoriasis: The risk of skin cancer, which increases with the number of exposures [1] The total dose of phototherapy can be reduced by combining phototherapy with topical or systemic treatments (eg, coal tar, calcipotriol or oral acitretin) [1]. The following are indications for systemic treatment:  Rapid relapse after completion of phototherapy (> 50% of the baseline severity of psoriasis within three months) The patient has difficulty attending for phototherapy [1]. Systemic therapy should be initiated in a specialist setting. Monitoring and supervision can occur in non-specialist settings when these arrangements have been formalised and agreed upon [1]. The NICE guidelines suggest systemic non-biologic therapy should be offered to people with any type of psoriasis if [1]: Psoriasis cannot be controlled with topical therapy; and; It has a significant impact on physical, psychological or social wellbeing; and; One or more of the following apply: The psoriasis is extensive (eg, >10% BSA is affected or a PASI score > 10)  The psoriasis is localised and associated with significant functional impairment or high levels of distress (eg, severe nail psoriasis or involvement of high-impact sites)  Phototherapy has been ineffective, cannot be used, or has resulted in rapid relapse. Non-biologic systemic therapy outcomes can be optimised with the use of topical therapy [1]. All patients using non-biologic systemic therapy need close monitoring for adverse effects, as per local protocols [20,22,24]. Non-biologic systemic agents include methotrexate, ciclosporin, acitretin and apremilast. Methotrexate is the first-line treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis [24]. It is given as a once-weekly oral dose in adults and children. Contraindications include pregnancy, lactation, severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment and bone marrow depression [20]. Patients require ongoing monitoring for , and infection [20,24]. Ciclosporin can be used in adults and children [20,22]. It is used as a second-line treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis following methotrexate [24]. It is also used for rapid control of psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis and those contemplating conception (males and females) who cannot avoid systemic treatment [1]. Monitoring for and hypertension is essential [20,22,24]. Acitretin is an oral retinoid agent, particularly useful for pustular psoriasis and as a third-line treatment after methotrexate and ciclosporin [1]. It can be used in adults and children and is considered the treatment of choice in -positive patients with psoriasis [17,20,22]. Due to its high , it is contraindicated in pregnancy and has very limited use in women of childbearing age (strict contraception during treatment and for 2 years after stopping treatment). Acitretin has a number of adverse effects, including dryness of membranes [24]. It is a treatment option for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults [20]. Evidence suggests apremilast is less effective than biologic agents [17]. Biologic agents are effective in treating moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Studies show excellent short and long term results, and treatment is generally well tolerated [17]. While they are often more efficacious than non-biologic systemic therapies, the long term risks are still largely unknown. In addition, biologic systemic therapy is expensive, hence their use in clinical practice remains limited. Etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab the activity of tumour necrosis factor (). Etanercept and adalimumab can be used in NZ for severe chronic plaque psoriasis to standard treatments in both children and adults. Infliximab, secukinumab (an -17A inhibitor) and ustekinumab (an inhibitor of 12 and 23) are approved for severe plaque psoriasis refractory to standard treatments in adults only. Ustekinumab is not subsidised in NZ [20,22]. In New Zealand, a special authority application is required for a subsidy of biologic treatments [20,22]. A dermatologist is required to apply on behalf of the patient. The eligibility criteria include having 'whole body' severe chronic plaque psoriasis with a PASI score of > 10 (> 15 for infliximab) or severe chronic plaque psoriasis of the face, palm or sole. The patient must also have had psoriasis for greater than 6 months and have trialled (or have contraindications to) at least three of the following treatments: phototherapy, methotrexate, ciclosporin and acitretin [27–30]. General practitioners can renew applications if ongoing treatment is recommended by a dermatologist [24]. Psoriasis often has an unpredictable clinical course. Plaque psoriasis is generally a chronic disease, with fluctuating severity over time. Guttate psoriasis may resolve, relapse or develop into chronic plaque psoriasis. Generalised pustular psoriasis frequently has a variable and protracted course without intervention [2]. As mentioned above, psoriasis is now recognised as a multisystem inflammatory disease. People with psoriasis have an increased risk of compared to those unaffected by psoriasis [2,31]. Specifically, studies suggest an increased liver, kidney, infectious disease and chronic lower respiratory disease mortality risk. Patients with severe psoriasis also appear to have higher cardiovascular disease and mortality risk [31]. The cause of the increased mortality risk is unknown. Postulated contributing factors include systemic inflammation, adverse effects of systemic treatments, comorbid conditions and behavioural risk factors [2,31]. Screening and holistic care may help minimise these risks.

Guidelines for the management of psoriasis — codes and concepts This document incorporates and summarises information from a number of publications, including guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [1,4], UpToDate [2,7,10,16,17,23,26] and the NZ Formulary [20,22]. It is relevant to the treatment of psoriasis in New Zealand. In this guideline, psoriasis refers to psoriasis, unless otherwise specified. Psoriasis is a chronic  skin disorder that is characterised by disfiguring,  and   that may be itchy or painful. Although once thought of as a  dermatological condition with few serious complications, psoriasis is now considered a inflammatory disease that is associated with, or increases, the risk of other comorbidities. Psoriasis can be both emotionally and physically debilitating and significantly impact the quality of life [1,2]. The of psoriasis worldwide is 0.5% to 11.4% in adults, and 0% to 1.4% in children [3]. Psoriasis is at a higher prevalence with increasing distance from the equator [2]. The prevalence of psoriasis in New Zealand has not yet been established. Studies have shown the prevalence of psoriasis in adults to be 2.3% to 6.6% in Australia, and 1.3% to 2.2% in the United Kingdom [3,4]. Rates of psoriasis vary between ethnic groups. A small study suggests that Maori and Pacific Islander peoples may be overrepresented in New Zealand compared to New Zealand Europeans [5]. While most cases of psoriasis present before age 35, psoriasis can at any age [4]. Males and females are equally affected by psoriasis [2]. Psoriasis is a complex immune-mediated disease. , , and factor are key in the [2]. A contributes to the of psoriasis. Approximately 40% of people with psoriasis or psoriatic have an affected family member [2]. psoriasis has been associated with changes in the , and [6]. Other risk factors for psoriasis include smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption [2]. Medications can psoriasis or cause a psoriasis-like . Examples include beta-blockers, lithium and antimalarial drugs. Certain and viral have also been linked to psoriasis [2]. The clinical features of typical patterns of psoriasis are described below. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis in children and adults, accounting for 55–90% of cases [2,4]. The scalp, elbows, knees and are the most frequently involved sites. Plaques are erythematous with defined margins and often have a silvery . Scale is less evident after bathing or after the application of a moisturiser. The plaques are frequently . In people with darker skin, may be present [2]. Guttate psoriasis is characterised by an of psoriatic plaques and , typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The main sites involved are the trunk and extremities. Guttate psoriasis is strongly associated with a preceding , most frequently streptococcal . Typically, it arises in children and young adults who have not had psoriasis before [2]. Pustular psoriasis has the potential to be life-threatening. It is characterised by rapid-onset generalised , scaling and superficial [2]. Erythrodermic psoriasis is uncommon, can be acute or chronic, and involves erythema and scaling from head to toe [2]. Inverse psoriasis is characterised by psoriasis affecting the regions, including the axillary, inframammary, , , genital and areas. This type of psoriasis can easily be misdiagnosed, as there is often no visible scale. It affects children more commonly than adults [2,7]. Signs of disease include , , red spots on the and crumbling of the . Signs of nail bed involvement include the , , and splinter haemorrhages [2]. Koebnerised psoriasis is psoriasis arising in areas of  injury [8,9]. Approximately 7–42% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis [10]. Comorbidities associated with psoriasis include obesity, metabolic , cardiovascular disease, , disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and diabetes), chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), depression, and alcohol abuse [8,10]. Severe psoriasis can cause death, particularly extensive erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis [2]. Psoriasis is a clinical diagnosis. A skin can be considered when there is diagnostic uncertainty [2]. Its severity, using both objective and subjective measures An objective assessment of psoriasis severity can be made using the static Physician’s Global Assessment (see below) or the . The PASI is generally used in specialist settings [1]. 0 - no plaque elevation above the normal skin1 - minimal plaque elevation, ~ 0.25mm2 - mild plaque elevation, ~0.5 mm3 - moderate plaque elevation, ~0.75mm4 - marked plaque elevation, ~1 mm5 - severe plaque elevation, > 1.25 mm 0 - no evidence of erythema, hyperpigmentation may be present1 - faint erythema2 - light red colouration3 - moderate red colouration4 - bright red colouration5 - dusky to deep red colouration 0 - no evidence of scale1 - minimal; occasional fine scale over < 5% of the 2 - mild; fine-scale predominates3 - moderate; coarse-scale predominates4 - marked; thick, non-tenacious scale predominates5 - severe; very thick tenacious scale predominates 0 = clear, 1 = nearly clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 = very severe The patient's assessment of the severity of their psoriasis can be assessed using the static Patient's Global Assessment (graded as clear, nearly clear, mild, moderate, severe or very severe) [1] or a validated self-assessed or patient-oriented PASI score. Body surface area (BSA) affected can be classified as: (Note: 0.5% of BSA in adults is approximately equal to the palm of the patient’s hand, excluding fingers [11]) The following features may indicate severe psoriasis due to the impact on the quality of life: Involvement of visible areas, major parts of the scalp, genitals, palms or soles Onycholysis or onychodystrophy of at least two fingernails When assessing the impact of psoriasis on physical, psychological and social wellbeing, questions to consider include: How does having psoriasis affect the patient’s daily life at home, work or at school? How is the patient coping with psoriasis and are they using any treatments? How does the patient feel — depressed, anxious, worthless, lonely? How is psoriasis affecting the patient’s relationship with their partner, family, friends, and carers? Does the patient need further advice or support? [1] Quality of life measurement is important to properly assess the full effect of an illness such as psoriasis on patients. Two  specific tools to assess the impact on the quality of life are: Dermatology Life Quality Index (): a self-reported questionnaire that consists of 10 items. The final score ranges from 0 to 30. DLQI ≤ 10 indicates mild to moderate disease, and DLQI > 10 indicates severe disease [12]. Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI): adapted for children age 4 to 16, and identical in structure to the DLQI. The child can complete it independently or with help from their caregiver [1]. People with psoriasis should be screened for psoriatic arthritis annually. This is best achieved in care and specialist settings through the use of a validated tool, such as the Psoriasis Screening Tool (PEST) [1]. Consider a non-urgent referral or seeking rheumatology advice if the score is > 2 [1,8]. Has a doctor ever told you that you have arthritis? Do your fingernails or toenails have holes or pits? Have you had a finger or toe that was completely swollen and painful for no apparent reason? Consider referral to rheumatology with a score > 2 Assess risk factors and comorbid disease of psoriasis at presentation and as indicated thereafter.  Cardiovascular risk factors, and management of these (eg, smoking ) Measure blood pressure, studies and fasting at least annually. Risk of and its management [1]. Signs of , skin , and tumours, according to guidelines for age, , and phototherapy [10] Children with psoriasis may have higher rates of associated comorbid disease. Recommended screening for risk factors and comorbid disease depend on the child’s age [15]. All ages — psoriatic arthritis, , annually for depression and anxiety From age 2 — annually for elevated body mass index (BMI) From age 10 — 3 yearly for diabetes in patients who are obese or overweight and have 2 or more risk factors for diabetes; screen for NAFLD in those who are obese or overweight with additional risk factors for NAFLD. From age 11 — annual substance abuse screening [15] Eye conditions may occur more commonly in people with psoriasis (blepharitis, , , corneal and ). Consider asking patients about symptoms at each follow-up appointment [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — seborrhoeic dermatitis presents with erythematous patches with overlying scale. The scalp, ears and intertriginous areas are commonly affected. Differences from psoriasis — seborrhoeic dermatitis has a fine, greasy scale. The eyebrows, nasolabial folds, central chest and postauricular area are generally involved [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — atopic dermatitis commonly presents as excoriated areas with erythema, hyperpigmentation and scale. may be present. Differences from psoriasis — atopic dermatitis generally lacks the thick, coarse-scale and well- borders of psoriasis. Itch is a more prominent feature of atopic dermatitis, and in infants, the napkin area is usually spared. Occasionally patients are affected by both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis [2,7]. Similarities to psoriasis — fungal infections present with erythematous plaques and pustules. Onychomycosis may be mistaken for nail psoriasis. Differences from psoriasis — a skin scraping or nail clipping show fungal elements on and the causative is confirmed by [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — cutaneous T-cell lymphoma usually presents with erythematous, plaques and variable itch, and sometimes as (Sézary syndrome). Differences from psoriasis — the plaques of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tend to be less and less scaly, and they are not distributed symmetrically. and are common in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [8,16]. The differential diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis also includes: Pityriasis rosea is an important differential for guttate psoriasis [7]. While psoriasis is treatable, there is no cure [8]. Successful management is  on the patient understanding the chronic nature of psoriasis and the  options that are available to them. Points to consider include: Reassuring the patient and the patient’s family that psoriasis is not contagious. Determining how the patient perceives their disability and their preference and commitment to therapy. Discussing the risks and benefits of treatment options. Providing general advice regarding the benefits of not smoking, avoiding excessive alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight and blood pressure [1,17]. Advice to avoid direct pressure on areas of psoriasis where possible. An acceptable treatment response is either BSA ≤ 3% or an improvement in BSA ≥ 75% from , 3 months after treatment initiation [18]. The ideal target for treatment response is BSA ≤ 1% 3 months after treatment initiation maintained at every 6-month assessment interval during maintenance therapy. Referral to a for advice or face-to-face assessment is recommended in the following circumstances: Children with psoriasis at the time of diagnosis [1] Erythrodermic or generalised pustular psoriasis (emergency referral) or unstable psoriasis (urgent referral).  symptoms ( and ) may indicate unstable forms of psoriasis. Difficult to treat sites (face, genitalia, palms and soles) with inadequate response to initial treatment [1,8] Moderate to severe psoriasis likely to require phototherapy or systemic treatment Acute guttate psoriasis, for consideration of phototherapy Nail psoriasis with a significant functional or cosmetic impact [1] Significant impact on the quality of life, including a DLQI score > 9 [1,8] Any person who has psoriasis challenging to manage in the general practice (GP) setting [1,8]. Note: Public hospital dermatology services in NZ may have more stringent referral criteria due to a dermatology workforce shortage. Patients with ocular symptoms that may indicate an eye condition associated with psoriasis should be referred to an [2,8]. Patients with arthritis and PEST score ≥ 3 should be referred to a . Patients may also require assessment by a gastroenterologist if they have NAFLD or abnormal liver function tests on systemic medications for psoriasis. Consider patient preferences, cosmetic and practical aspects of treatment, and the body surface area affected [1]. Discuss the different available. An is preferred for plaques with thick scale [1]. Discuss referral for phototherapy or systemic therapy if patients are unlikely to respond adequately to topical therapy alone, including those with: Ensure the patient understands: Once a satisfactory outcome has been achieved, treatments can be reduced to the amount needed to maintain psoriasis control [1] They should seek medical advice if the therapy is not tolerated, as the dose should be reduced or the therapy changed to an alternative [20]. After a new topical therapy is started, arrange to review adults in 4 weeks and children in 2 weeks to: Assess the response to treatment, and how it has been tolerated Highlight the importance of a break between courses of potent and very potent Identify the need for daily use of topical corticosteroids, which indicates that systemic therapy should be considered Discuss treatment alternatives if the response has been unsatisfactory [1]. If the response has been unsatisfactory, consider the following: Difficulties with current therapy, such as tolerance, practical aspects of the application and cosmetic acceptability Review psoriasis patients at least annually to assess for adverse effects of steroid therapy, if: An adult is using potent or very potent corticosteroids Recommend to all patients with psoriasis [19]. They improve dryness, scaling and cracking and may have their own properties. They can be used with other treatments [20]. Emollients may be all that is required to treat mild psoriasis. Emollients are especially beneficial for psoriasis of the palms and soles [20]. Ointments and thick are most effective, particularly when applied straight after a shower or bath [17]. A soap substitute such as aqueous can help improve symptoms. The formulation of aqueous cream funded in NZ can also be prescribed as an as it is sodium lauryl sulphate free [8]. Coal tar has and anti-scaling properties [20]. Its use may be limited because it stains skin and clothes, is messy to apply, and has a strong smell [17]. Coal tar sometimes causes irritation, contact , and sterile folliculitis [20]. Highlight the importance of shampoo formulations reaching the scalp [17]. It is useful for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in adults. include acute psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and skin . It can cause irritation and staining of skin, and clothing. It is effective on large, thick plaques as ‘short-contact therapy’, where it is applied daily, initially with a contact time of 10 minutes which is steadily increased to 30 minutes over 7 days. Salicylic acid is a  agent that reduces scaling and increases penetration of other topical treatments. It can be prescribed in combination with a topical or emollient. It is often already present in coal tar formulations. Salicylic acid is in women who are pregnant. Use with caution in children under 5 years of age (a concentration < 0.5% can be used on limited areas), patients with psoriasis, and patients with or impairment [21]. Calcipotriol is often used as first-line therapy for plaque psoriasis. It is also available in combination with topical betamethasone dipropionate and is available as , ointment and foam formulations. Contraindications to calcipotriol include calcium disorders and . Use with caution in generalised pustular, guttate and erythrodermic psoriasis where there is an increased risk of hypercalcaemia [20]. Calcipotriol may cause irritation when applied to sensitive sites (eg, the groin). To avoid inactivation of calcipotriol: Apply calcipotriol and salicylic acid at different times, for example, one in the morning and the other in the evening Maximum dose of calcipotriol in adults is 100 g/week, in children 12–18 years is 75 g/week, and in children 6–12 years is 50 g/week [20,22]. Monitor calcium and renal function before commencing calcipotriol and 3-monthly following this if maximum doses may be exceeded [20,22]. Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and properties through their effect on [17]. Match the strength and formulation to the patient’s preference and need [1]. Improvement generally occurs with topical corticosteroids but the response is usually incomplete and the length of remains difficult to predict [17]. Prolonged potent or very potent corticosteroid use may result in: Potent corticosteroids should not be used continuously at any site for more than 4 weeks without a break. They can be used long term intermittently. Very potent corticosteroids should not be used for more than 4 weeks continuously. The advice of a dermatologist should be sought for ongoing use. A 4-week break is recommended between courses of potent or very potent corticosteroids (including when combined with calcipotriol). Offer an alternative topical treatment option during this time to maintain control of psoriasis if required (eg, calcipotriol or coal tar). Do not apply topical corticosteroids to more than 10% of BSA. Very potent corticosteroids are not suitable for children [1]. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are calcineurin . They will normally be initiated by a dermatologist or doctor with expertise in treating psoriasis. They are used in adults for the treatment of facial, or genital psoriasis if other therapies have not been successful. The most common side effects of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are burning and itching that generally reduces with ongoing usage. Adverse effects also include erythema and skin infections. Tacrolimus is expensive and needs to be specially compounded off-label in New Zealand (2019) [20]. It is best used in combination with topical corticosteroids. The most common side effect is skin irritation [17]. Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the trunk, limbs or scalp Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the trunk, limbs or scalp Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas Phototherapy appears to slow and reduce the activity of implicated in the formation of psoriatic plaques [17]. It is suitable for most people with an inadequate response to topical therapy [24]. It can be given as monotherapy or in combination with topical or systemic agents [20]. The types of phototherapy are narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB), broadband UVB, and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) [1,17]. Potential short-term side effects of phototherapy include: Nausea with psoralen tablets (used in systemic PUVA) [25]. Potential long-term side effects of phototherapy include: Skin cancer. Cancer risk has not been reported with narrowband UVB, however, it is possible that risk will be identified with longer follow-up [25,26]. Phototherapy may not be an option for young children (< 5 years) or people with psychological or physical difficulties that preclude standing in the treatment booth. Narrowband UVB phototherapy is the most commonly used form of phototherapy [24]. It is especially useful for people with guttate or chronic plaque psoriasis [1,20]. UVB phototherapy is given 2 to 3 times a week for 6–12 weeks. Exposures are initially under a minute and are increased over time [1,24]. UVB phototherapy can exacerbate inflammatory psoriasis [20]. The absolute contraindications to UVB phototherapy are lupus erythematosus and xeroderma pigmentosum [26]. PUVA may be suitable for selected patients, such as those with localised [1,20,24]. Psoralen amplifies the effect of UVA therapy and can be given orally or [20]. The following should be discussed before commencing PUVA for psoriasis: The risk of skin cancer, which increases with the number of exposures [1] The total dose of phototherapy can be reduced by combining phototherapy with topical or systemic treatments (eg, coal tar, calcipotriol or oral acitretin) [1]. The following are indications for systemic treatment:  Rapid relapse after completion of phototherapy (> 50% of the baseline severity of psoriasis within three months) The patient has difficulty attending for phototherapy [1]. Systemic therapy should be initiated in a specialist setting. Monitoring and supervision can occur in non-specialist settings when these arrangements have been formalised and agreed upon [1]. The NICE guidelines suggest systemic non-biologic therapy should be offered to people with any type of psoriasis if [1]: Psoriasis cannot be controlled with topical therapy; and; It has a significant impact on physical, psychological or social wellbeing; and; One or more of the following apply: The psoriasis is extensive (eg, >10% BSA is affected or a PASI score > 10)  The psoriasis is localised and associated with significant functional impairment or high levels of distress (eg, severe nail psoriasis or involvement of high-impact sites)  Phototherapy has been ineffective, cannot be used, or has resulted in rapid relapse. Non-biologic systemic therapy outcomes can be optimised with the use of topical therapy [1]. All patients using non-biologic systemic therapy need close monitoring for adverse effects, as per local protocols [20,22,24]. Non-biologic systemic agents include methotrexate, ciclosporin, acitretin and apremilast. Methotrexate is the first-line treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis [24]. It is given as a once-weekly oral dose in adults and children. Contraindications include pregnancy, lactation, severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment and bone marrow depression [20]. Patients require ongoing monitoring for , and infection [20,24]. Ciclosporin can be used in adults and children [20,22]. It is used as a second-line treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis following methotrexate [24]. It is also used for rapid control of psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis and those contemplating conception (males and females) who cannot avoid systemic treatment [1]. Monitoring for and hypertension is essential [20,22,24]. Acitretin is an oral retinoid agent, particularly useful for pustular psoriasis and as a third-line treatment after methotrexate and ciclosporin [1]. It can be used in adults and children and is considered the treatment of choice in -positive patients with psoriasis [17,20,22]. Due to its high , it is contraindicated in pregnancy and has very limited use in women of childbearing age (strict contraception during treatment and for 2 years after stopping treatment). Acitretin has a number of adverse effects, including dryness of membranes [24]. It is a treatment option for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults [20]. Evidence suggests apremilast is less effective than biologic agents [17]. Biologic agents are effective in treating moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Studies show excellent short and long term results, and treatment is generally well tolerated [17]. While they are often more efficacious than non-biologic systemic therapies, the long term risks are still largely unknown. In addition, biologic systemic therapy is expensive, hence their use in clinical practice remains limited. Etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab the activity of tumour necrosis factor (). Etanercept and adalimumab can be used in NZ for severe chronic plaque psoriasis to standard treatments in both children and adults. Infliximab, secukinumab (an -17A inhibitor) and ustekinumab (an inhibitor of 12 and 23) are approved for severe plaque psoriasis refractory to standard treatments in adults only. Ustekinumab is not subsidised in NZ [20,22]. In New Zealand, a special authority application is required for a subsidy of biologic treatments [20,22]. A dermatologist is required to apply on behalf of the patient. The eligibility criteria include having 'whole body' severe chronic plaque psoriasis with a PASI score of > 10 (> 15 for infliximab) or severe chronic plaque psoriasis of the face, palm or sole. The patient must also have had psoriasis for greater than 6 months and have trialled (or have contraindications to) at least three of the following treatments: phototherapy, methotrexate, ciclosporin and acitretin [27–30]. General practitioners can renew applications if ongoing treatment is recommended by a dermatologist [24]. Psoriasis often has an unpredictable clinical course. Plaque psoriasis is generally a chronic disease, with fluctuating severity over time. Guttate psoriasis may resolve, relapse or develop into chronic plaque psoriasis. Generalised pustular psoriasis frequently has a variable and protracted course without intervention [2]. As mentioned above, psoriasis is now recognised as a multisystem inflammatory disease. People with psoriasis have an increased risk of compared to those unaffected by psoriasis [2,31]. Specifically, studies suggest an increased liver, kidney, infectious disease and chronic lower respiratory disease mortality risk. Patients with severe psoriasis also appear to have higher cardiovascular disease and mortality risk [31]. The cause of the increased mortality risk is unknown. Postulated contributing factors include systemic inflammation, adverse effects of systemic treatments, comorbid conditions and behavioural risk factors [2,31]. Screening and holistic care may help minimise these risks.

Guidelines for the management of psoriasis — codes and concepts This document incorporates and summarises information from a number of publications, including guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [1,4], UpToDate [2,7,10,16,17,23,26] and the NZ Formulary [20,22]. It is relevant to the treatment of psoriasis in New Zealand. In this guideline, psoriasis refers to psoriasis, unless otherwise specified. Psoriasis is a chronic  skin disorder that is characterised by disfiguring,  and   that may be itchy or painful. Although once thought of as a  dermatological condition with few serious complications, psoriasis is now considered a inflammatory disease that is associated with, or increases, the risk of other comorbidities. Psoriasis can be both emotionally and physically debilitating and significantly impact the quality of life [1,2]. The of psoriasis worldwide is 0.5% to 11.4% in adults, and 0% to 1.4% in children [3]. Psoriasis is at a higher prevalence with increasing distance from the equator [2]. The prevalence of psoriasis in New Zealand has not yet been established. Studies have shown the prevalence of psoriasis in adults to be 2.3% to 6.6% in Australia, and 1.3% to 2.2% in the United Kingdom [3,4]. Rates of psoriasis vary between ethnic groups. A small study suggests that Maori and Pacific Islander peoples may be overrepresented in New Zealand compared to New Zealand Europeans [5]. While most cases of psoriasis present before age 35, psoriasis can at any age [4]. Males and females are equally affected by psoriasis [2]. Psoriasis is a complex immune-mediated disease. , , and factor are key in the [2]. A contributes to the of psoriasis. Approximately 40% of people with psoriasis or psoriatic have an affected family member [2]. psoriasis has been associated with changes in the , and [6]. Other risk factors for psoriasis include smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption [2]. Medications can psoriasis or cause a psoriasis-like . Examples include beta-blockers, lithium and antimalarial drugs. Certain and viral have also been linked to psoriasis [2]. The clinical features of typical patterns of psoriasis are described below. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis in children and adults, accounting for 55–90% of cases [2,4]. The scalp, elbows, knees and are the most frequently involved sites. Plaques are erythematous with defined margins and often have a silvery . Scale is less evident after bathing or after the application of a moisturiser. The plaques are frequently . In people with darker skin, may be present [2]. Guttate psoriasis is characterised by an of psoriatic plaques and , typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The main sites involved are the trunk and extremities. Guttate psoriasis is strongly associated with a preceding , most frequently streptococcal . Typically, it arises in children and young adults who have not had psoriasis before [2]. Pustular psoriasis has the potential to be life-threatening. It is characterised by rapid-onset generalised , scaling and superficial [2]. Erythrodermic psoriasis is uncommon, can be acute or chronic, and involves erythema and scaling from head to toe [2]. Inverse psoriasis is characterised by psoriasis affecting the regions, including the axillary, inframammary, , , genital and areas. This type of psoriasis can easily be misdiagnosed, as there is often no visible scale. It affects children more commonly than adults [2,7]. Signs of disease include , , red spots on the and crumbling of the . Signs of nail bed involvement include the , , and splinter haemorrhages [2]. Koebnerised psoriasis is psoriasis arising in areas of  injury [8,9]. Approximately 7–42% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis [10]. Comorbidities associated with psoriasis include obesity, metabolic , cardiovascular disease, , disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and diabetes), chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), depression, and alcohol abuse [8,10]. Severe psoriasis can cause death, particularly extensive erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis [2]. Psoriasis is a clinical diagnosis. A skin can be considered when there is diagnostic uncertainty [2]. Its severity, using both objective and subjective measures An objective assessment of psoriasis severity can be made using the static Physician’s Global Assessment (see below) or the . The PASI is generally used in specialist settings [1]. 0 - no plaque elevation above the normal skin1 - minimal plaque elevation, ~ 0.25mm2 - mild plaque elevation, ~0.5 mm3 - moderate plaque elevation, ~0.75mm4 - marked plaque elevation, ~1 mm5 - severe plaque elevation, > 1.25 mm 0 - no evidence of erythema, hyperpigmentation may be present1 - faint erythema2 - light red colouration3 - moderate red colouration4 - bright red colouration5 - dusky to deep red colouration 0 - no evidence of scale1 - minimal; occasional fine scale over < 5% of the 2 - mild; fine-scale predominates3 - moderate; coarse-scale predominates4 - marked; thick, non-tenacious scale predominates5 - severe; very thick tenacious scale predominates 0 = clear, 1 = nearly clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 = very severe The patient's assessment of the severity of their psoriasis can be assessed using the static Patient's Global Assessment (graded as clear, nearly clear, mild, moderate, severe or very severe) [1] or a validated self-assessed or patient-oriented PASI score. Body surface area (BSA) affected can be classified as: (Note: 0.5% of BSA in adults is approximately equal to the palm of the patient’s hand, excluding fingers [11]) The following features may indicate severe psoriasis due to the impact on the quality of life: Involvement of visible areas, major parts of the scalp, genitals, palms or soles Onycholysis or onychodystrophy of at least two fingernails When assessing the impact of psoriasis on physical, psychological and social wellbeing, questions to consider include: How does having psoriasis affect the patient’s daily life at home, work or at school? How is the patient coping with psoriasis and are they using any treatments? How does the patient feel — depressed, anxious, worthless, lonely? How is psoriasis affecting the patient’s relationship with their partner, family, friends, and carers? Does the patient need further advice or support? [1] Quality of life measurement is important to properly assess the full effect of an illness such as psoriasis on patients. Two  specific tools to assess the impact on the quality of life are: Dermatology Life Quality Index (): a self-reported questionnaire that consists of 10 items. The final score ranges from 0 to 30. DLQI ≤ 10 indicates mild to moderate disease, and DLQI > 10 indicates severe disease [12]. Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI): adapted for children age 4 to 16, and identical in structure to the DLQI. The child can complete it independently or with help from their caregiver [1]. People with psoriasis should be screened for psoriatic arthritis annually. This is best achieved in care and specialist settings through the use of a validated tool, such as the Psoriasis Screening Tool (PEST) [1]. Consider a non-urgent referral or seeking rheumatology advice if the score is > 2 [1,8]. Has a doctor ever told you that you have arthritis? Do your fingernails or toenails have holes or pits? Have you had a finger or toe that was completely swollen and painful for no apparent reason? Consider referral to rheumatology with a score > 2 Assess risk factors and comorbid disease of psoriasis at presentation and as indicated thereafter.  Cardiovascular risk factors, and management of these (eg, smoking ) Measure blood pressure, studies and fasting at least annually. Risk of and its management [1]. Signs of , skin , and tumours, according to guidelines for age, , and phototherapy [10] Children with psoriasis may have higher rates of associated comorbid disease. Recommended screening for risk factors and comorbid disease depend on the child’s age [15]. All ages — psoriatic arthritis, , annually for depression and anxiety From age 2 — annually for elevated body mass index (BMI) From age 10 — 3 yearly for diabetes in patients who are obese or overweight and have 2 or more risk factors for diabetes; screen for NAFLD in those who are obese or overweight with additional risk factors for NAFLD. From age 11 — annual substance abuse screening [15] Eye conditions may occur more commonly in people with psoriasis (blepharitis, , , corneal and ). Consider asking patients about symptoms at each follow-up appointment [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — seborrhoeic dermatitis presents with erythematous patches with overlying scale. The scalp, ears and intertriginous areas are commonly affected. Differences from psoriasis — seborrhoeic dermatitis has a fine, greasy scale. The eyebrows, nasolabial folds, central chest and postauricular area are generally involved [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — atopic dermatitis commonly presents as excoriated areas with erythema, hyperpigmentation and scale. may be present. Differences from psoriasis — atopic dermatitis generally lacks the thick, coarse-scale and well- borders of psoriasis. Itch is a more prominent feature of atopic dermatitis, and in infants, the napkin area is usually spared. Occasionally patients are affected by both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis [2,7]. Similarities to psoriasis — fungal infections present with erythematous plaques and pustules. Onychomycosis may be mistaken for nail psoriasis. Differences from psoriasis — a skin scraping or nail clipping show fungal elements on and the causative is confirmed by [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — cutaneous T-cell lymphoma usually presents with erythematous, plaques and variable itch, and sometimes as (Sézary syndrome). Differences from psoriasis — the plaques of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tend to be less and less scaly, and they are not distributed symmetrically. and are common in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [8,16]. The differential diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis also includes: Pityriasis rosea is an important differential for guttate psoriasis [7]. While psoriasis is treatable, there is no cure [8]. Successful management is  on the patient understanding the chronic nature of psoriasis and the  options that are available to them. Points to consider include: Reassuring the patient and the patient’s family that psoriasis is not contagious. Determining how the patient perceives their disability and their preference and commitment to therapy. Discussing the risks and benefits of treatment options. Providing general advice regarding the benefits of not smoking, avoiding excessive alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight and blood pressure [1,17]. Advice to avoid direct pressure on areas of psoriasis where possible. An acceptable treatment response is either BSA ≤ 3% or an improvement in BSA ≥ 75% from , 3 months after treatment initiation [18]. The ideal target for treatment response is BSA ≤ 1% 3 months after treatment initiation maintained at every 6-month assessment interval during maintenance therapy. Referral to a for advice or face-to-face assessment is recommended in the following circumstances: Children with psoriasis at the time of diagnosis [1] Erythrodermic or generalised pustular psoriasis (emergency referral) or unstable psoriasis (urgent referral).  symptoms ( and ) may indicate unstable forms of psoriasis. Difficult to treat sites (face, genitalia, palms and soles) with inadequate response to initial treatment [1,8] Moderate to severe psoriasis likely to require phototherapy or systemic treatment Acute guttate psoriasis, for consideration of phototherapy Nail psoriasis with a significant functional or cosmetic impact [1] Significant impact on the quality of life, including a DLQI score > 9 [1,8] Any person who has psoriasis challenging to manage in the general practice (GP) setting [1,8]. Note: Public hospital dermatology services in NZ may have more stringent referral criteria due to a dermatology workforce shortage. Patients with ocular symptoms that may indicate an eye condition associated with psoriasis should be referred to an [2,8]. Patients with arthritis and PEST score ≥ 3 should be referred to a . Patients may also require assessment by a gastroenterologist if they have NAFLD or abnormal liver function tests on systemic medications for psoriasis. Consider patient preferences, cosmetic and practical aspects of treatment, and the body surface area affected [1]. Discuss the different available. An is preferred for plaques with thick scale [1]. Discuss referral for phototherapy or systemic therapy if patients are unlikely to respond adequately to topical therapy alone, including those with: Ensure the patient understands: Once a satisfactory outcome has been achieved, treatments can be reduced to the amount needed to maintain psoriasis control [1] They should seek medical advice if the therapy is not tolerated, as the dose should be reduced or the therapy changed to an alternative [20]. After a new topical therapy is started, arrange to review adults in 4 weeks and children in 2 weeks to: Assess the response to treatment, and how it has been tolerated Highlight the importance of a break between courses of potent and very potent Identify the need for daily use of topical corticosteroids, which indicates that systemic therapy should be considered Discuss treatment alternatives if the response has been unsatisfactory [1]. If the response has been unsatisfactory, consider the following: Difficulties with current therapy, such as tolerance, practical aspects of the application and cosmetic acceptability Review psoriasis patients at least annually to assess for adverse effects of steroid therapy, if: An adult is using potent or very potent corticosteroids Recommend to all patients with psoriasis [19]. They improve dryness, scaling and cracking and may have their own properties. They can be used with other treatments [20]. Emollients may be all that is required to treat mild psoriasis. Emollients are especially beneficial for psoriasis of the palms and soles [20]. Ointments and thick are most effective, particularly when applied straight after a shower or bath [17]. A soap substitute such as aqueous can help improve symptoms. The formulation of aqueous cream funded in NZ can also be prescribed as an as it is sodium lauryl sulphate free [8]. Coal tar has and anti-scaling properties [20]. Its use may be limited because it stains skin and clothes, is messy to apply, and has a strong smell [17]. Coal tar sometimes causes irritation, contact , and sterile folliculitis [20]. Highlight the importance of shampoo formulations reaching the scalp [17]. It is useful for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in adults. include acute psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and skin . It can cause irritation and staining of skin, and clothing. It is effective on large, thick plaques as ‘short-contact therapy’, where it is applied daily, initially with a contact time of 10 minutes which is steadily increased to 30 minutes over 7 days. Salicylic acid is a  agent that reduces scaling and increases penetration of other topical treatments. It can be prescribed in combination with a topical or emollient. It is often already present in coal tar formulations. Salicylic acid is in women who are pregnant. Use with caution in children under 5 years of age (a concentration < 0.5% can be used on limited areas), patients with psoriasis, and patients with or impairment [21]. Calcipotriol is often used as first-line therapy for plaque psoriasis. It is also available in combination with topical betamethasone dipropionate and is available as , ointment and foam formulations. Contraindications to calcipotriol include calcium disorders and . Use with caution in generalised pustular, guttate and erythrodermic psoriasis where there is an increased risk of hypercalcaemia [20]. Calcipotriol may cause irritation when applied to sensitive sites (eg, the groin). To avoid inactivation of calcipotriol: Apply calcipotriol and salicylic acid at different times, for example, one in the morning and the other in the evening Maximum dose of calcipotriol in adults is 100 g/week, in children 12–18 years is 75 g/week, and in children 6–12 years is 50 g/week [20,22]. Monitor calcium and renal function before commencing calcipotriol and 3-monthly following this if maximum doses may be exceeded [20,22]. Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and properties through their effect on [17]. Match the strength and formulation to the patient’s preference and need [1]. Improvement generally occurs with topical corticosteroids but the response is usually incomplete and the length of remains difficult to predict [17]. Prolonged potent or very potent corticosteroid use may result in: Potent corticosteroids should not be used continuously at any site for more than 4 weeks without a break. They can be used long term intermittently. Very potent corticosteroids should not be used for more than 4 weeks continuously. The advice of a dermatologist should be sought for ongoing use. A 4-week break is recommended between courses of potent or very potent corticosteroids (including when combined with calcipotriol). Offer an alternative topical treatment option during this time to maintain control of psoriasis if required (eg, calcipotriol or coal tar). Do not apply topical corticosteroids to more than 10% of BSA. Very potent corticosteroids are not suitable for children [1]. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are calcineurin . They will normally be initiated by a dermatologist or doctor with expertise in treating psoriasis. They are used in adults for the treatment of facial, or genital psoriasis if other therapies have not been successful. The most common side effects of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are burning and itching that generally reduces with ongoing usage. Adverse effects also include erythema and skin infections. Tacrolimus is expensive and needs to be specially compounded off-label in New Zealand (2019) [20]. It is best used in combination with topical corticosteroids. The most common side effect is skin irritation [17]. Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the trunk, limbs or scalp Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the trunk, limbs or scalp Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas Phototherapy appears to slow and reduce the activity of implicated in the formation of psoriatic plaques [17]. It is suitable for most people with an inadequate response to topical therapy [24]. It can be given as monotherapy or in combination with topical or systemic agents [20]. The types of phototherapy are narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB), broadband UVB, and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) [1,17]. Potential short-term side effects of phototherapy include: Nausea with psoralen tablets (used in systemic PUVA) [25]. Potential long-term side effects of phototherapy include: Skin cancer. Cancer risk has not been reported with narrowband UVB, however, it is possible that risk will be identified with longer follow-up [25,26]. Phototherapy may not be an option for young children (< 5 years) or people with psychological or physical difficulties that preclude standing in the treatment booth. Narrowband UVB phototherapy is the most commonly used form of phototherapy [24]. It is especially useful for people with guttate or chronic plaque psoriasis [1,20]. UVB phototherapy is given 2 to 3 times a week for 6–12 weeks. Exposures are initially under a minute and are increased over time [1,24]. UVB phototherapy can exacerbate inflammatory psoriasis [20]. The absolute contraindications to UVB phototherapy are lupus erythematosus and xeroderma pigmentosum [26]. PUVA may be suitable for selected patients, such as those with localised [1,20,24]. Psoralen amplifies the effect of UVA therapy and can be given orally or [20]. The following should be discussed before commencing PUVA for psoriasis: The risk of skin cancer, which increases with the number of exposures [1] The total dose of phototherapy can be reduced by combining phototherapy with topical or systemic treatments (eg, coal tar, calcipotriol or oral acitretin) [1]. The following are indications for systemic treatment:  Rapid relapse after completion of phototherapy (> 50% of the baseline severity of psoriasis within three months) The patient has difficulty attending for phototherapy [1]. Systemic therapy should be initiated in a specialist setting. Monitoring and supervision can occur in non-specialist settings when these arrangements have been formalised and agreed upon [1]. The NICE guidelines suggest systemic non-biologic therapy should be offered to people with any type of psoriasis if [1]: Psoriasis cannot be controlled with topical therapy; and; It has a significant impact on physical, psychological or social wellbeing; and; One or more of the following apply: The psoriasis is extensive (eg, >10% BSA is affected or a PASI score > 10)  The psoriasis is localised and associated with significant functional impairment or high levels of distress (eg, severe nail psoriasis or involvement of high-impact sites)  Phototherapy has been ineffective, cannot be used, or has resulted in rapid relapse. Non-biologic systemic therapy outcomes can be optimised with the use of topical therapy [1]. All patients using non-biologic systemic therapy need close monitoring for adverse effects, as per local protocols [20,22,24]. Non-biologic systemic agents include methotrexate, ciclosporin, acitretin and apremilast. Methotrexate is the first-line treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis [24]. It is given as a once-weekly oral dose in adults and children. Contraindications include pregnancy, lactation, severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment and bone marrow depression [20]. Patients require ongoing monitoring for , and infection [20,24]. Ciclosporin can be used in adults and children [20,22]. It is used as a second-line treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis following methotrexate [24]. It is also used for rapid control of psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis and those contemplating conception (males and females) who cannot avoid systemic treatment [1]. Monitoring for and hypertension is essential [20,22,24]. Acitretin is an oral retinoid agent, particularly useful for pustular psoriasis and as a third-line treatment after methotrexate and ciclosporin [1]. It can be used in adults and children and is considered the treatment of choice in -positive patients with psoriasis [17,20,22]. Due to its high , it is contraindicated in pregnancy and has very limited use in women of childbearing age (strict contraception during treatment and for 2 years after stopping treatment). Acitretin has a number of adverse effects, including dryness of membranes [24]. It is a treatment option for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults [20]. Evidence suggests apremilast is less effective than biologic agents [17]. Biologic agents are effective in treating moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Studies show excellent short and long term results, and treatment is generally well tolerated [17]. While they are often more efficacious than non-biologic systemic therapies, the long term risks are still largely unknown. In addition, biologic systemic therapy is expensive, hence their use in clinical practice remains limited. Etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab the activity of tumour necrosis factor (). Etanercept and adalimumab can be used in NZ for severe chronic plaque psoriasis to standard treatments in both children and adults. Infliximab, secukinumab (an -17A inhibitor) and ustekinumab (an inhibitor of 12 and 23) are approved for severe plaque psoriasis refractory to standard treatments in adults only. Ustekinumab is not subsidised in NZ [20,22]. In New Zealand, a special authority application is required for a subsidy of biologic treatments [20,22]. A dermatologist is required to apply on behalf of the patient. The eligibility criteria include having 'whole body' severe chronic plaque psoriasis with a PASI score of > 10 (> 15 for infliximab) or severe chronic plaque psoriasis of the face, palm or sole. The patient must also have had psoriasis for greater than 6 months and have trialled (or have contraindications to) at least three of the following treatments: phototherapy, methotrexate, ciclosporin and acitretin [27–30]. General practitioners can renew applications if ongoing treatment is recommended by a dermatologist [24]. Psoriasis often has an unpredictable clinical course. Plaque psoriasis is generally a chronic disease, with fluctuating severity over time. Guttate psoriasis may resolve, relapse or develop into chronic plaque psoriasis. Generalised pustular psoriasis frequently has a variable and protracted course without intervention [2]. As mentioned above, psoriasis is now recognised as a multisystem inflammatory disease. People with psoriasis have an increased risk of compared to those unaffected by psoriasis [2,31]. Specifically, studies suggest an increased liver, kidney, infectious disease and chronic lower respiratory disease mortality risk. Patients with severe psoriasis also appear to have higher cardiovascular disease and mortality risk [31]. The cause of the increased mortality risk is unknown. Postulated contributing factors include systemic inflammation, adverse effects of systemic treatments, comorbid conditions and behavioural risk factors [2,31]. Screening and holistic care may help minimise these risks.

Guidelines for the management of psoriasis — codes and concepts This document incorporates and summarises information from a number of publications, including guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [1,4], UpToDate [2,7,10,16,17,23,26] and the NZ Formulary [20,22]. It is relevant to the treatment of psoriasis in New Zealand. In this guideline, psoriasis refers to psoriasis, unless otherwise specified. Psoriasis is a chronic  skin disorder that is characterised by disfiguring,  and   that may be itchy or painful. Although once thought of as a  dermatological condition with few serious complications, psoriasis is now considered a inflammatory disease that is associated with, or increases, the risk of other comorbidities. Psoriasis can be both emotionally and physically debilitating and significantly impact the quality of life [1,2]. The of psoriasis worldwide is 0.5% to 11.4% in adults, and 0% to 1.4% in children [3]. Psoriasis is at a higher prevalence with increasing distance from the equator [2]. The prevalence of psoriasis in New Zealand has not yet been established. Studies have shown the prevalence of psoriasis in adults to be 2.3% to 6.6% in Australia, and 1.3% to 2.2% in the United Kingdom [3,4]. Rates of psoriasis vary between ethnic groups. A small study suggests that Maori and Pacific Islander peoples may be overrepresented in New Zealand compared to New Zealand Europeans [5]. While most cases of psoriasis present before age 35, psoriasis can at any age [4]. Males and females are equally affected by psoriasis [2]. Psoriasis is a complex immune-mediated disease. , , and factor are key in the [2]. A contributes to the of psoriasis. Approximately 40% of people with psoriasis or psoriatic have an affected family member [2]. psoriasis has been associated with changes in the , and [6]. Other risk factors for psoriasis include smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption [2]. Medications can psoriasis or cause a psoriasis-like . Examples include beta-blockers, lithium and antimalarial drugs. Certain and viral have also been linked to psoriasis [2]. The clinical features of typical patterns of psoriasis are described below. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis in children and adults, accounting for 55–90% of cases [2,4]. The scalp, elbows, knees and are the most frequently involved sites. Plaques are erythematous with defined margins and often have a silvery . Scale is less evident after bathing or after the application of a moisturiser. The plaques are frequently . In people with darker skin, may be present [2]. Guttate psoriasis is characterised by an of psoriatic plaques and , typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The main sites involved are the trunk and extremities. Guttate psoriasis is strongly associated with a preceding , most frequently streptococcal . Typically, it arises in children and young adults who have not had psoriasis before [2]. Pustular psoriasis has the potential to be life-threatening. It is characterised by rapid-onset generalised , scaling and superficial [2]. Erythrodermic psoriasis is uncommon, can be acute or chronic, and involves erythema and scaling from head to toe [2]. Inverse psoriasis is characterised by psoriasis affecting the regions, including the axillary, inframammary, , , genital and areas. This type of psoriasis can easily be misdiagnosed, as there is often no visible scale. It affects children more commonly than adults [2,7]. Signs of disease include , , red spots on the and crumbling of the . Signs of nail bed involvement include the , , and splinter haemorrhages [2]. Koebnerised psoriasis is psoriasis arising in areas of  injury [8,9]. Approximately 7–42% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis [10]. Comorbidities associated with psoriasis include obesity, metabolic , cardiovascular disease, , disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and diabetes), chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), depression, and alcohol abuse [8,10]. Severe psoriasis can cause death, particularly extensive erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis [2]. Psoriasis is a clinical diagnosis. A skin can be considered when there is diagnostic uncertainty [2]. Its severity, using both objective and subjective measures An objective assessment of psoriasis severity can be made using the static Physician’s Global Assessment (see below) or the . The PASI is generally used in specialist settings [1]. 0 - no plaque elevation above the normal skin1 - minimal plaque elevation, ~ 0.25mm2 - mild plaque elevation, ~0.5 mm3 - moderate plaque elevation, ~0.75mm4 - marked plaque elevation, ~1 mm5 - severe plaque elevation, > 1.25 mm 0 - no evidence of erythema, hyperpigmentation may be present1 - faint erythema2 - light red colouration3 - moderate red colouration4 - bright red colouration5 - dusky to deep red colouration 0 - no evidence of scale1 - minimal; occasional fine scale over < 5% of the 2 - mild; fine-scale predominates3 - moderate; coarse-scale predominates4 - marked; thick, non-tenacious scale predominates5 - severe; very thick tenacious scale predominates 0 = clear, 1 = nearly clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 = very severe The patient's assessment of the severity of their psoriasis can be assessed using the static Patient's Global Assessment (graded as clear, nearly clear, mild, moderate, severe or very severe) [1] or a validated self-assessed or patient-oriented PASI score. Body surface area (BSA) affected can be classified as: (Note: 0.5% of BSA in adults is approximately equal to the palm of the patient’s hand, excluding fingers [11]) The following features may indicate severe psoriasis due to the impact on the quality of life: Involvement of visible areas, major parts of the scalp, genitals, palms or soles Onycholysis or onychodystrophy of at least two fingernails When assessing the impact of psoriasis on physical, psychological and social wellbeing, questions to consider include: How does having psoriasis affect the patient’s daily life at home, work or at school? How is the patient coping with psoriasis and are they using any treatments? How does the patient feel — depressed, anxious, worthless, lonely? How is psoriasis affecting the patient’s relationship with their partner, family, friends, and carers? Does the patient need further advice or support? [1] Quality of life measurement is important to properly assess the full effect of an illness such as psoriasis on patients. Two  specific tools to assess the impact on the quality of life are: Dermatology Life Quality Index (): a self-reported questionnaire that consists of 10 items. The final score ranges from 0 to 30. DLQI ≤ 10 indicates mild to moderate disease, and DLQI > 10 indicates severe disease [12]. Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI): adapted for children age 4 to 16, and identical in structure to the DLQI. The child can complete it independently or with help from their caregiver [1]. People with psoriasis should be screened for psoriatic arthritis annually. This is best achieved in care and specialist settings through the use of a validated tool, such as the Psoriasis Screening Tool (PEST) [1]. Consider a non-urgent referral or seeking rheumatology advice if the score is > 2 [1,8]. Has a doctor ever told you that you have arthritis? Do your fingernails or toenails have holes or pits? Have you had a finger or toe that was completely swollen and painful for no apparent reason? Consider referral to rheumatology with a score > 2 Assess risk factors and comorbid disease of psoriasis at presentation and as indicated thereafter.  Cardiovascular risk factors, and management of these (eg, smoking ) Measure blood pressure, studies and fasting at least annually. Risk of and its management [1]. Signs of , skin , and tumours, according to guidelines for age, , and phototherapy [10] Children with psoriasis may have higher rates of associated comorbid disease. Recommended screening for risk factors and comorbid disease depend on the child’s age [15]. All ages — psoriatic arthritis, , annually for depression and anxiety From age 2 — annually for elevated body mass index (BMI) From age 10 — 3 yearly for diabetes in patients who are obese or overweight and have 2 or more risk factors for diabetes; screen for NAFLD in those who are obese or overweight with additional risk factors for NAFLD. From age 11 — annual substance abuse screening [15] Eye conditions may occur more commonly in people with psoriasis (blepharitis, , , corneal and ). Consider asking patients about symptoms at each follow-up appointment [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — seborrhoeic dermatitis presents with erythematous patches with overlying scale. The scalp, ears and intertriginous areas are commonly affected. Differences from psoriasis — seborrhoeic dermatitis has a fine, greasy scale. The eyebrows, nasolabial folds, central chest and postauricular area are generally involved [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — atopic dermatitis commonly presents as excoriated areas with erythema, hyperpigmentation and scale. may be present. Differences from psoriasis — atopic dermatitis generally lacks the thick, coarse-scale and well- borders of psoriasis. Itch is a more prominent feature of atopic dermatitis, and in infants, the napkin area is usually spared. Occasionally patients are affected by both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis [2,7]. Similarities to psoriasis — fungal infections present with erythematous plaques and pustules. Onychomycosis may be mistaken for nail psoriasis. Differences from psoriasis — a skin scraping or nail clipping show fungal elements on and the causative is confirmed by [2]. Similarities to psoriasis — cutaneous T-cell lymphoma usually presents with erythematous, plaques and variable itch, and sometimes as (Sézary syndrome). Differences from psoriasis — the plaques of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tend to be less and less scaly, and they are not distributed symmetrically. and are common in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [8,16]. The differential diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis also includes: Pityriasis rosea is an important differential for guttate psoriasis [7]. While psoriasis is treatable, there is no cure [8]. Successful management is  on the patient understanding the chronic nature of psoriasis and the  options that are available to them. Points to consider include: Reassuring the patient and the patient’s family that psoriasis is not contagious. Determining how the patient perceives their disability and their preference and commitment to therapy. Discussing the risks and benefits of treatment options. Providing general advice regarding the benefits of not smoking, avoiding excessive alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight and blood pressure [1,17]. Advice to avoid direct pressure on areas of psoriasis where possible. An acceptable treatment response is either BSA ≤ 3% or an improvement in BSA ≥ 75% from , 3 months after treatment initiation [18]. The ideal target for treatment response is BSA ≤ 1% 3 months after treatment initiation maintained at every 6-month assessment interval during maintenance therapy. Referral to a for advice or face-to-face assessment is recommended in the following circumstances: Children with psoriasis at the time of diagnosis [1] Erythrodermic or generalised pustular psoriasis (emergency referral) or unstable psoriasis (urgent referral).  symptoms ( and ) may indicate unstable forms of psoriasis. Difficult to treat sites (face, genitalia, palms and soles) with inadequate response to initial treatment [1,8] Moderate to severe psoriasis likely to require phototherapy or systemic treatment Acute guttate psoriasis, for consideration of phototherapy Nail psoriasis with a significant functional or cosmetic impact [1] Significant impact on the quality of life, including a DLQI score > 9 [1,8] Any person who has psoriasis challenging to manage in the general practice (GP) setting [1,8]. Note: Public hospital dermatology services in NZ may have more stringent referral criteria due to a dermatology workforce shortage. Patients with ocular symptoms that may indicate an eye condition associated with psoriasis should be referred to an [2,8]. Patients with arthritis and PEST score ≥ 3 should be referred to a . Patients may also require assessment by a gastroenterologist if they have NAFLD or abnormal liver function tests on systemic medications for psoriasis. Consider patient preferences, cosmetic and practical aspects of treatment, and the body surface area affected [1]. Discuss the different available. An is preferred for plaques with thick scale [1]. Discuss referral for phototherapy or systemic therapy if patients are unlikely to respond adequately to topical therapy alone, including those with: Ensure the patient understands: Once a satisfactory outcome has been achieved, treatments can be reduced to the amount needed to maintain psoriasis control [1] They should seek medical advice if the therapy is not tolerated, as the dose should be reduced or the therapy changed to an alternative [20]. After a new topical therapy is started, arrange to review adults in 4 weeks and children in 2 weeks to: Assess the response to treatment, and how it has been tolerated Highlight the importance of a break between courses of potent and very potent Identify the need for daily use of topical corticosteroids, which indicates that systemic therapy should be considered Discuss treatment alternatives if the response has been unsatisfactory [1]. If the response has been unsatisfactory, consider the following: Difficulties with current therapy, such as tolerance, practical aspects of the application and cosmetic acceptability Review psoriasis patients at least annually to assess for adverse effects of steroid therapy, if: An adult is using potent or very potent corticosteroids Recommend to all patients with psoriasis [19]. They improve dryness, scaling and cracking and may have their own properties. They can be used with other treatments [20]. Emollients may be all that is required to treat mild psoriasis. Emollients are especially beneficial for psoriasis of the palms and soles [20]. Ointments and thick are most effective, particularly when applied straight after a shower or bath [17]. A soap substitute such as aqueous can help improve symptoms. The formulation of aqueous cream funded in NZ can also be prescribed as an as it is sodium lauryl sulphate free [8]. Coal tar has and anti-scaling properties [20]. Its use may be limited because it stains skin and clothes, is messy to apply, and has a strong smell [17]. Coal tar sometimes causes irritation, contact , and sterile folliculitis [20]. Highlight the importance of shampoo formulations reaching the scalp [17]. It is useful for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in adults. include acute psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and skin . It can cause irritation and staining of skin, and clothing. It is effective on large, thick plaques as ‘short-contact therapy’, where it is applied daily, initially with a contact time of 10 minutes which is steadily increased to 30 minutes over 7 days. Salicylic acid is a  agent that reduces scaling and increases penetration of other topical treatments. It can be prescribed in combination with a topical or emollient. It is often already present in coal tar formulations. Salicylic acid is in women who are pregnant. Use with caution in children under 5 years of age (a concentration < 0.5% can be used on limited areas), patients with psoriasis, and patients with or impairment [21]. Calcipotriol is often used as first-line therapy for plaque psoriasis. It is also available in combination with topical betamethasone dipropionate and is available as , ointment and foam formulations. Contraindications to calcipotriol include calcium disorders and . Use with caution in generalised pustular, guttate and erythrodermic psoriasis where there is an increased risk of hypercalcaemia [20]. Calcipotriol may cause irritation when applied to sensitive sites (eg, the groin). To avoid inactivation of calcipotriol: Apply calcipotriol and salicylic acid at different times, for example, one in the morning and the other in the evening Maximum dose of calcipotriol in adults is 100 g/week, in children 12–18 years is 75 g/week, and in children 6–12 years is 50 g/week [20,22]. Monitor calcium and renal function before commencing calcipotriol and 3-monthly following this if maximum doses may be exceeded [20,22]. Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and properties through their effect on [17]. Match the strength and formulation to the patient’s preference and need [1]. Improvement generally occurs with topical corticosteroids but the response is usually incomplete and the length of remains difficult to predict [17]. Prolonged potent or very potent corticosteroid use may result in: Potent corticosteroids should not be used continuously at any site for more than 4 weeks without a break. They can be used long term intermittently. Very potent corticosteroids should not be used for more than 4 weeks continuously. The advice of a dermatologist should be sought for ongoing use. A 4-week break is recommended between courses of potent or very potent corticosteroids (including when combined with calcipotriol). Offer an alternative topical treatment option during this time to maintain control of psoriasis if required (eg, calcipotriol or coal tar). Do not apply topical corticosteroids to more than 10% of BSA. Very potent corticosteroids are not suitable for children [1]. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are calcineurin . They will normally be initiated by a dermatologist or doctor with expertise in treating psoriasis. They are used in adults for the treatment of facial, or genital psoriasis if other therapies have not been successful. The most common side effects of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are burning and itching that generally reduces with ongoing usage. Adverse effects also include erythema and skin infections. Tacrolimus is expensive and needs to be specially compounded off-label in New Zealand (2019) [20]. It is best used in combination with topical corticosteroids. The most common side effect is skin irritation [17]. Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the trunk, limbs or scalp Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the trunk, limbs or scalp Topical treatment options for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas Phototherapy appears to slow and reduce the activity of implicated in the formation of psoriatic plaques [17]. It is suitable for most people with an inadequate response to topical therapy [24]. It can be given as monotherapy or in combination with topical or systemic agents [20]. The types of phototherapy are narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB), broadband UVB, and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) [1,17]. Potential short-term side effects of phototherapy include: Nausea with psoralen tablets (used in systemic PUVA) [25]. Potential long-term side effects of phototherapy include: Skin cancer. Cancer risk has not been reported with narrowband UVB, however, it is possible that risk will be identified with longer follow-up [25,26]. Phototherapy may not be an option for young children (< 5 years) or people with psychological or physical difficulties that preclude standing in the treatment booth. Narrowband UVB phototherapy is the most commonly used form of phototherapy [24]. It is especially useful for people with guttate or chronic plaque psoriasis [1,20]. UVB phototherapy is given 2 to 3 times a week for 6–12 weeks. Exposures are initially under a minute and are increased over time [1,24]. UVB phototherapy can exacerbate inflammatory psoriasis [20]. The absolute contraindications to UVB phototherapy are lupus erythematosus and xeroderma pigmentosum [26]. PUVA may be suitable for selected patients, such as those with localised [1,20,24]. Psoralen amplifies the effect of UVA therapy and can be given orally or [20]. The following should be discussed before commencing PUVA for psoriasis: The risk of skin cancer, which increases with the number of exposures [1] The total dose of phototherapy can be reduced by combining phototherapy with topical or systemic treatments (eg, coal tar, calcipotriol or oral acitretin) [1]. The following are indications for systemic treatment:  Rapid relapse after completion of phototherapy (> 50% of the baseline severity of psoriasis within three months) The patient has difficulty attending for phototherapy [1]. Systemic therapy should be initiated in a specialist setting. Monitoring and supervision can occur in non-specialist settings when these arrangements have been formalised and agreed upon [1]. The NICE guidelines suggest systemic non-biologic therapy should be offered to people with any type of psoriasis if [1]: Psoriasis cannot be controlled with topical therapy; and; It has a significant impact on physical, psychological or social wellbeing; and; One or more of the following apply: The psoriasis is extensive (eg, >10% BSA is affected or a PASI score > 10)  The psoriasis is localised and associated with significant functional impairment or high levels of distress (eg, severe nail psoriasis or involvement of high-impact sites)  Phototherapy has been ineffective, cannot be used, or has resulted in rapid relapse. Non-biologic systemic therapy outcomes can be optimised with the use of topical therapy [1]. All patients using non-biologic systemic therapy need close monitoring for adverse effects, as per local protocols [20,22,24]. Non-biologic systemic agents include methotrexate, ciclosporin, acitretin and apremilast. Methotrexate is the first-line treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis [24]. It is given as a once-weekly oral dose in adults and children. Contraindications include pregnancy, lactation, severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment and bone marrow depression [20]. Patients require ongoing monitoring for , and infection [20,24]. Ciclosporin can be used in adults and children [20,22]. It is used as a second-line treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis following methotrexate [24]. It is also used for rapid control of psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis and those contemplating conception (males and females) who cannot avoid systemic treatment [1]. Monitoring for and hypertension is essential [20,22,24]. Acitretin is an oral retinoid agent, particularly useful for pustular psoriasis and as a third-line treatment after methotrexate and ciclosporin [1]. It can be used in adults and children and is considered the treatment of choice in -positive patients with psoriasis [17,20,22]. Due to its high , it is contraindicated in pregnancy and has very limited use in women of childbearing age (strict contraception during treatment and for 2 years after stopping treatment). Acitretin has a number of adverse effects, including dryness of membranes [24]. It is a treatment option for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults [20]. Evidence suggests apremilast is less effective than biologic agents [17]. Biologic agents are effective in treating moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Studies show excellent short and long term results, and treatment is generally well tolerated [17]. While they are often more efficacious than non-biologic systemic therapies, the long term risks are still largely unknown. In addition, biologic systemic therapy is expensive, hence their use in clinical practice remains limited. Etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab the activity of tumour necrosis factor (). Etanercept and adalimumab can be used in NZ for severe chronic plaque psoriasis to standard treatments in both children and adults. Infliximab, secukinumab (an -17A inhibitor) and ustekinumab (an inhibitor of 12 and 23) are approved for severe plaque psoriasis refractory to standard treatments in adults only. Ustekinumab is not subsidised in NZ [20,22]. In New Zealand, a special authority application is required for a subsidy of biologic treatments [20,22]. A dermatologist is required to apply on behalf of the patient. The eligibility criteria include having 'whole body' severe chronic plaque psoriasis with a PASI score of > 10 (> 15 for infliximab) or severe chronic plaque psoriasis of the face, palm or sole. The patient must also have had psoriasis for greater than 6 months and have trialled (or have contraindications to) at least three of the following treatments: phototherapy, methotrexate, ciclosporin and acitretin [27–30]. General practitioners can renew applications if ongoing treatment is recommended by a dermatologist [24]. Psoriasis often has an unpredictable clinical course. Plaque psoriasis is generally a chronic disease, with fluctuating severity over time. Guttate psoriasis may resolve, relapse or develop into chronic plaque psoriasis. Generalised pustular psoriasis frequently has a variable and protracted course without intervention [2]. As mentioned above, psoriasis is now recognised as a multisystem inflammatory disease. People with psoriasis have an increased risk of compared to those unaffected by psoriasis [2,31]. Specifically, studies suggest an increased liver, kidney, infectious disease and chronic lower respiratory disease mortality risk. Patients with severe psoriasis also appear to have higher cardiovascular disease and mortality risk [31]. The cause of the increased mortality risk is unknown. Postulated contributing factors include systemic inflammation, adverse effects of systemic treatments, comorbid conditions and behavioural risk factors [2,31]. Screening and holistic care may help minimise these risks.

There are a number of types of psoriasis, such as , , , , and . Despite recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism of how psoriasis develops, psoriasis may be difficult to treat; there is currently no cure and no single treatment works for everyone. Several treatments may need to be tried before the most suitable regime is established, and different treatments may need to be used concurrently, or in rotation, for best effect or to minimise side-effects. Treatment choice in psoriasis depends on a number of factors. For example: Disease severity: body surface area (BSA) affected and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index () score Disease impact: symptoms and Life Quality Index () score Comorbidities (eg, liver or disease; ) Treatment goals (eg, improving or aiming for a 90% improvement in PASI score [PASI 90]) More details about each form of psoriasis treatment are found on individual topic pages. Where possible, minimise factors that aggravate or trigger psoriasis, such as stress, , and certain medications (, beta-blockers, and ). Health conditions associated with psoriasis include , sleep disturbance, and depression. Treatment for these may help skin disease. Due to the association between psoriasis and , weight loss, , moderation of , and blood pressure may also lead to improvements in skin disease [1,2].  Sun exposure () may help to clear psoriasis; in many people, psoriasis improves dramatically during summer months or on sunny holidays. Short-term side-effects include the of psoriasis in areas of , (due to the ). Long-term risks include premature  and the development of . Soaking in warm water can soften the psoriatic plaques and lift the . are not necessary and may cause skin irritation. (the treatment of disease by bathing in mineral springs) is a popular form of complementary therapy in certain demographic areas [3], although there is little or no strong evidence of benefit. One avenue of current research is looking at the skin and gut (the living on and in the human body) and whether the alteration of this may be effective in the treatment of psoriasis [4,5]. To date, probiotics have not been found to help psoriasis. Relatively small,  patches of psoriasis may improve with (eg, using waterproof adhesive dressings). The regular use of softens psoriasis and adds moisture to the skin. This improves dryness, , and irritation.

Topical steroids are available in various strengths and . Topical steroids are also used in combination with other agents, such as with: for (to counteract ). The selection of a suitable product depends on the site and type of psoriasis. Weak topical steroids are used on sensitive sites (ie, the face, , and genital areas).  In contrast, requires a very potent topical steroid due to the thicker skin on the hands and feet. Potent steroids are often more effective than mild topical steroids, but they have a higher risk of side-effects. They should be used with caution in large areas and for limited periods. They may cause: Topical steroids can be used under medical supervision in and, alongside , are generally the first-line treatment of psoriasis in pregnancy. may be used for a small number of thickened plaques of psoriasis and in [6]. -like compounds for psoriasis include , calcitriol, and tacalcitol.

When combined with ultraviolet () therapy, calcipotriol should be applied after to exposure to UV radiation, because: Vitamin D-like compounds are best avoided in children under 6 years, and during pregnancy and lactation, due to lack of data regarding their safety.  Calcipotriol is available in combination with a very potent , betamethasone dipropionate as a /ointment or .

It can be very effective but dithranol treatment has a number of practical drawbacks and so is less frequently prescribed. The method of application is complex; it is usually given as ‘short contact' therapy. It is applied directly to psoriasis (ie, avoiding normal skin) and then washed off after 10–60 minutes. The strength of dithranol is gradually increased every few days until it is effective, or until skin irritation occurs. Dithranol permanently stains fabrics and temporarily stains the skin.

They are used as steroid-sparing agents on sensitive sites where the skin is thinner (eg, the face, flexures, and genital areas). They are not effective for treating elsewhere (unless under occlusion) [7]. Tazarotene is a , which may be applied once daily to as a 0.05% or 0.1% cream. [8]. The most common side-effect is skin pain and local irritation. It is not currently available in New Zealand (July 2018). Off-label use of the topical has been shown to be effective for flexural and facial psoriasis. is the use of UV radiation to treat skin disorders, and this can be very effective in the treatment of psoriasis. It is generally reserved for cases where topical therapy has been ineffective or too much of the skin surface is involved to treat psoriasis effectively with topical agents. It is administered in cabinets at specialised centres, and a treatment course for psoriasis will usually consist of 2–3 treatments per week for 20–30 treatments. Phototherapy is best avoided in patients with very fair skin, who take certain , or who have a previous history of . It is not effective for or . Early side-effects include and . Late side-effects include  and . The need for regular travel to a phototherapy centre can make this option difficult for some patients. The beneficial effects may be short-lived.  (311–312 nm wavelengths) is also known as TL01 light therapy (after the type of fluorescent tubes used). Narrowband UVB is particularly effective in thin  and , especially in the winter months. It is generally felt to be safe and well-tolerated. About two-thirds of patients with plaque psoriasis experience a 75% improvement in PASI score (PASI 75) compared to with this treatment [9]. UVB is felt to be safe in pregnancy. Note that UVB degrades folic acid and regular supplementation in pregnancy is needed [10,11]. Psoralens plus long wave ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, (known as ), can be applied to the whole body by giving an oral psoralen in tablet form 2 hours prior to treatment. Treatment can be localised to the hands and/or feet by using psoralen bath soaks or topical psoralens prior to treatment. Localised treatment is commonly used to treat thick plaques or moderate-to-severe , including . persists for some hours following oral psoralen treatment; therefore, patients are advised to avoid sun exposure, including wearing wrap-around sunglasses on the day of treatment. PUVA is more likely than narrowband UVB treatment to cause , especially  and is usually limited to a maximum of 100 to 200-lifetime treatments. Psoralens and therefore PUVA is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Systemic (oral or injectable) medication may be required to treat psoriasis when: Psoriasis is affecting the patient's physical, social, or is ineffective or [12].

Oral tablets or injections may be selected. The dose of methotrexate is often adjusted over the first few weeks or months of treatment. There are various regimens. It can be given long-term if there are no significant side-effects. 45% of patients treated with methotrexate for 12–16 weeks experience PASI 75 [13]. Regular blood tests should monitor liver function and blood count while the patient is on methotrexate. Methotrexate can cause fetal harm so women should not become pregnant while taking methotrexate and for 3 months after stopping it. Side-effects of methotrexate include nausea, tiredness, , and diarrhoea.   is an used short-term to treat and . Ciclosporin capsules are usually taken twice daily. The dose is individualised according to patient weight, , and adverse effects (2.5–5.0 mg/kg/day).  Ciclosporin has a rapid onset of action, making it useful in severe  or . Due to its side effects and risks, ciclosporin is usually prescribed in courses of 8–12 weeks. 50–80% of patients treated with ciclosporin for 8–12 weeks achieve PASI 75 [14]. Regular blood tests should be undertaken and monitor at least the patient's blood pressure and renal function. There is no evidence that ciclosporin causes fetal harm but doses should be kept low in pregnancy or it should be discontinued due to . Important side-effects of ciclosporin include hypertension, renal failure, to , and increased risk of .   is a vitamin A-like compound or that is particularly effective for . Dose varies from 10 mg three times weekly to 50 mg daily. 20–40% of patients treated with acitretin at full dose achieve PASI 75 by Week 16 [14]. Regular blood tests should monitor the patient's liver function and blood fats. Pregnancy must be strictly avoided while on acitretin and for at least 2 years afterwards because it is associated with serious birth (). Acitretin is therefore rarely given to women of childbearing age. The risk does not apply to men, as acitretin does not affect sperm. Dose-related side-effects of acitretin include dry lips, peeling palms and soles, thinning hair, tiredness, and muscle pains.  is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor used to treat and . It is not funded in New Zealand (July 2018). The dosing of apremilast is titrated for the first 5 days and then given as a fixed-dose twice daily. Treatment may be given long-term and does not require drug screening or monitoring. 29–33% of patients treated with apremilast achieve PASI 75 at week 16 [14]. Apremilast is thought to be harmful to a fetus and so it should not be given in pregnancy (US pregnancy category C).  Side effects of apremilast include nausea and diarrhoea. There have also been reports of suicidal behaviour.  are . They are not available or funded in New Zealand. The dose is usually gradually increased to achieve an effect. PASI 75 is achieved 38% of patients at Week 16. Blood tests should monitor the patient's kidney, liver, and white blood cells.  Side-effects include nausea, diarrhoea, stomach cramps, flushing, and headaches. A rare but serious side-effect is a nervous system viral infection ( multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Fumaric acid esters are not to be used during pregnancy due to fetal harm. Other non-biological oral medications used less commonly for psoriasis include: or biologics are or recombinant targeted at specific components of the immune system. They are often very effective treatments for . The risk of serious side-effects relates to their effect on immunity. They are very expensive and the prescription is tightly regulated. They are used for moderate-to-severe psoriasis that has failed on topical and systemic treatment options or when these are contraindicated. Each available biologic has individual risks and benefits. Novel biological therapies are under development. Currently available biologics and those under development include: -alpha (α) inhibitors: , , , certolizumab, and golimumab () agents: , , and  Interleukin 12 and 23 (IL-12 and IL-23): , , , and . The biologicals for psoriasis are given by subcutaneous injection, with the exception of infliximab, which is administered intravenously. Infliximab is a chimaera of mouse and human and can result in infusion reactions and formation.  Biosimilars are drugs that are nearly identical to an original biological medication that has come off patent [15] and are available at a reduced cost. Biosimilars are available for infliximab and etanercept and others are under development (July 2018). Oral drugs under development include small compounds targeting signalling pathways, such as JAK inhibitors, PDE inhibitors. As they are low weight, topical formulations are being investigated.

Most important in diagnosing skin issues1. Primary lesions: most characteristic lesion that is representative of skin disease-macule, papule, plaque, nodule, cyst, patch, pustule, etc. 2. Secondary lesions: changes due to exogenous factors that can progress during the course of skin disease-scale, crust, excoriations, erosion, ulcer, fissures, lichenification, induration, scar/atrophy Morphology ConfigurationDistributionCommunication of skin findings:What is the primary lesion?-Location and distribution-Shape and configuration-Size-Texture (firm, waxy, umbilicated)-Color (erythematous, brown, red, etc.)-Secondary changes Pattern in which skin lesions are arranged. 4 most common patterns:1. Linear (streak of vesicles in contact dermatitis)2. Grouped (papules from insect bites)3. Annular (scaling in tinea corporis)4. Geographic (wheals in urticaria)Others: targetoid, reticular, numular Preferential areas of involvement and regions of the body affected by the skin disorderScalp: seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, tinea capitusFace: Rosacea, contact dermatitis, pityriasis alba, lupus erythematosusTrunk: tinea versicolor, psoriasis, pityriasis rosea, drug rashGenital: syphilis, psoriasis, HSVGroin: intertrigo, hidradenitis suppurativa, tinea cruis, candidiasisWrists/ankles: lichen planusArms: actinic purpuraLegs: stasis dermatitis, vasculitis, erythema nodosumHands/feet: tinea pedis, contact dermatitis Flat with no depression or elevation <10 mm in sizeCommon macules:-Oral melanotic nodules-Cafe au lait spots-Sun spots-Tinea versicolorPrimary lesion Larger version of a macule. Flat and >1 cmPrimary lesion Raised, solid lesions (no involvement of the dermis)<10 mmMay be indurated/firm or soft and fleshyColor can varyCharacterized by:- spike-topped- slope-shaped- dome-shaped- flat-topped- umbilicatedPrimary lesion Can be a larger papule OR a confluence of multiple papules>/= 10 mmUsually elevated, but may have a central depressionPrimary lesion Circumscribed (you can feel the edges to know where it begins and ends)More elevated lesion> 10 mmMay involve both the epidermis and the debris-depth of involvement and size differentiate this from a papulePrimary lesion Larger version of nodules> 2 cm in diameter (generally)Can be fixed or freely moveableSoft or firmElevated, subcutaneous, or pedunculated (attached to another structure by a stem)Primary lesion Closed sac with its own wall separating it from other tissueLumen of the cyst contains keratin and lipid-rich debri Can become infectedPrimary lesion Circumscribed, superficial cavities of skin that contain a purulent exudate (pus)Typically appear white, yellow, or greenishCan develop around a hair follicleMay develop from a papule or vesiclePrimary lesion Circumscribed, elevated, superficial cavity containing fluid (like a blister)May be serous fluid (pale to yellow) or serum + blood (red)Distribution:-Localized-Irregularly scattered-Grouped Bullae only differ in that they are larger than 10 mmPrimary lesion ""hives""Rounded, pale red, edematous plaque resulting from superficial infiltration of the dermis with histamine and/or other vasoactive substancesTransient and disappear within 24-48 hours (longer than this and it is not hives)Primary lesion Permanently dilated superficial blood vessels (capillaries or arterioles. Very rarely bleed)Distinct clinical entity, but can present with other disorders or can be caused by medicationsPrimary lesion Plug of sebaceous and keratinous material lodged in the opening of a hair follicle""Blackheads"": Open comedones. Pore is dilated and has been oxidized""Whiteheads"": Closed comedones. Pore is narrowed (not come to a ""head"" but simply fleshy bumps)Primary lesion Excess dead epidermal cells produced by abnormal keratinization and sheddingCan be dry or greasy masses of keratinVary in size from fine to large and coarseScaling typically implies a pathologic process occurring in the epidermis Secondary lesion Crusts: collections of dried serum and cellular debris. -""scab""-Usually contains pus or bloodExcoriations: punctate or linear abrasions produced by mechanical means (usually scratching)-Typically only involves the epidermisSecondary lesions Erosions: focal loss of epidermis. Often results from blisters. -Heals without scarringUlcer: Deeper defect involving complete loss of epidermis and portions of the dermis or deeper layer-Heals with scarringFissure: Linear loss of epidermis with sharply defined, vertical wallsSecondary lesions Thickened skin where skin markings become accentuatedTypically from chronic rubbing or itchingSecondary lesion Atrophy: depression in the skin resulting from thinning of epidermis or dermisScar: abnormal formation of the connective tissue implying dermal damage-Hypertrophic: thickened, but still within wound margins-Keloids: delayed appearance that goes beyond wound marginsSecondary lesions Rash:-How did it spread?-How has is evolved?-History of atopy?Growth:-How has it changed (size, shape, color)?-Family Hx skin cancer?Focal skin examTotal body skin exam (increased risk for skin CA, new rash, 50+ moles, Hx dysplastic nevi)Magnification, Dermoscopy (epiluminescence microscopy-patterns), Wood's lamp (""black"" UV lamp-color differences), diascopy (red due to capillary or blood)Start head to toe (don't forget between toes, scalp, nails, etc) Physical barrier against the environment-Regulates water loss-Protection against microbes, mechanical insults, chemical insults-Failure: disrupted skin barrier Immune functions:-identify pathogens and trigger response-Failure: HPV, molluscum, inflammation/hypersensitivity Temperature control: -Skin helps maintain constant body temperature-Insulation= fat and hair-Cooling: sweat production and dense superficial microvasculature-Failure: hyper/hypothermiaNerve sensation:-sensory and mechanoreceptors help to monitor the environment and aid our interaction with physical objects-Failure: pruritus, abnormal sensation, insensitivity to injuriesInjury repair:-Cutaneous wound repair process1. coagulation 2. inflammatory phase 3. proliferative/migratory phase 4. remodeling phase-Failure: delayed wound healingProtection from radiation:-melanin in epidermis protects against UV radiation-Failure: susceptibility to skin cancerAppearance and QOL:-Failure: can cause psychological distress Epidermis-Keratinocytes Dermis-fibroblasts, collagen, elastic fibersSubcutis/""panniculus""/""hypodermis"" Epidermal cells mature over a 2-week lifespan from bottom to top. Cells are shed 2 weeks after reaching the top (stratum corneum) for a 28 day cycle. They differentiate as they move upwards through the layersContains 4 layers (from deep to superficial)1. Stratum basale (epidermal stem cell ""basal cell"" layer)-Cell division occurs here. 2. Stratum spinosum (spiny layer)-Center of epidermis-""spiny"" appearance due to desmosomal junctions which hold keratinocytes together3. Stratum granulosum (granular cell layer)-lipids produced in this layer from a water barrier that keeps water in the skin-Filaggrin (protein that retains water, dysfunction can cause atopic dermatitis)4. Stratum corneum-Desquamating keratinocytes-Thick, flat, non-nucleated cell layers that provide barrier against trauma and infection Loss of adhesion:-Bullous Pemphigoid- autoimmune blistering disease with autoantibodies directly beneath the basal layer of the epidermis. Presents with tense bullae on an erythematous base of the skin (mucous membranes may also be affected)Thickening:-Psoriasis- rate of epidermal turnover is increased. accelerated rate of movement through epidermis doesn't allow for adequate differentiation which is recognized as scaleCancer:-Basal cell carcinoma- most common type of skin cancer. Composed of cells that resemble basal keratinocytes. Presents early as pearly erythematous papules or plaques with rolled borders and telangectasias in sun-exposed areas Keratinocytes-Make up the majority of cells-Held together by adhesion proteins called desmosomes (most visible in spinous layer)Melanocytes-staggered along basal layer (1 to 10 vs keratinocytes)-Pigment-producing cells that transfer their pigment (melanin) to keratinocytes in the basal cell layer-Dysfunction: Melanocytic nevi (moles)= benign collections of melanocytes. Melanoma is malignant collection of melanocytesLangerhans cells (dendritic cells)-Main function is in immune response by providing recognition, uptake, processing, and presentation of antigens to sensitized T-lymphs. Important in the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity-Dysfunction: allergic contact dermatitis (poison oak) or Mycosis fungoides (zebra)Merkle cells (clear cells)-Mechanoreceptor cells in basal layer of epidermis-Form a complex with afferent sensory nerve endings associated with touch-Dysfunction: Merkel cell carcinoma, very rare and aggressive. Usually a deep pink to red nodule Flexible but tough support structure. 1-4 mm (depending on age and body location)=MUCH thicker than the epidermisContains: collage, blood + lymph vessels, nerves, sweat glands, hair follicles2 layers:1. Papillary dermis (superficial)2. Reticular dermis Fibroblasts: -synthesis and degradation of connective tissue proteins. -Important in wound healing and scarring.-Dysfunction: Keloids from uncontrolled synthesis and excessive deposition of collagen at sites of prior dermal injuryMast cells:-Specialized cells responsible for immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions in the skin-major effector in Urticaria (hives)= vascular reaction of skin with wheels and read halo or flare Subcutaneous layerFat layer (adipocytes and CT) which separates the dermis from deeper underlying structures such as fascia and musclesInsulates body, serves as an energy supply, cushions and protects the skin, allows for mobility of skin over underlying structuresDysfunction: -Erythema nodosum: inflammation of subcutaneous layer. Presents as deep-seated erythematous nodules (on shins typically). May be idiopathic , reaction to infection/meds, or an underlying autoimmune disease Pilosebaceous unit:-Hair follicle-Sebaceous (oil) glands-Apocrine (sweat) glands (found in axillary and anogenital areas, open directly into hair follicle)-Arrector pili muscleDysfunction: -Acne vulgaris: disorder of pilosebaceous unit -caused by 4 factors:1. plugging of hair follicle as result of abnormal keratinization of upper portion (comedones)2. P. acnes in hair follicle (lives on the oil and breaks it down to free fatty acids which cause inflammation)3. Presence of hormones (androgens)4. Sebaceous gland activity (increased in presence of androgens)Eccrine glands are also adnexal structures:Sweat glands that do not involve the hair follicle-Open directly onto skin surface-Present throughout the body-Help regulate body temperature-Can be genetically absent and predispose a patient to hyperthermia Pros:-Safe (reduced systemic side effects and toxicity)-Delivers meds right to target organ-Targeted therapy-Rapid onset, relatively easyCons:-Time-consuming and requires large volumes-Cutaneous side effects and aesthetics (greasy, stain)-Patient education needed-Overprescribed-Compliance issuesActive ingredients: ""Ants""-Anti-inflammatory-Antibiotic/antifungal/antiviral/antiparasitic-Anti-metaboliteVehicle: ointment, cream, lotion, gel, foam, powder, etc.-Influences absorption concentration and compliance Influences absorption concentration and compliance-Ointment: very occlusive (greasy), hydrates stratum corneum, improves penetration, increases skin temperature, sticks. Less irritating and typically more effective-Creams: less greasy semi-solid emulsions, often contain many ingredients including preservatives and propylene glycol -Lotions: oil-in-water/water-in-oil emulsions, often in alcohol. Lower viscosity. Better for hairy surfaces and grease-averse patients. Not as moisturizing-Foam: good for hairy areas1 gram covers about the size of palms. 30 grams to cover body Variety of vehiclesMOA: anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, immunosuppressive, vasoconstrictiveADRs:-Atrophy: thinned epidermis and dermis, striae (common in abdomen, groin, thighs)-Hypopigmentation of skin-Acne, folliculitis, contact dermatitis-Corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis (CIRD) (perioral, perinasal, periocular, diffuse)-Tachyphylaxis: ""tolerance"". Most likely related to compliance-Systemic: (related to misuse and with occlusion) Cushing syndrome, HPA suppression-Ocular: 36-40x penetration around the eyes can cause glaucoma, cataracts, poor wound healing, herpetic ulcers, and infection Best practices: CORRECT-potency, location, vehicle, quantity, duration Stoughton vasoconstrictor assay ranked 1-7 (1 is the strongest)Potency related to:-chemical structure-vehicle-concentration-characteristics of skin location1. Clobetasol propionate2. Diflorasone diacetate3. Fluocinonide 4. Clocortolone pivalate5. Triamcinalone or Fluticasone propionate 6. Desonide or Aldmetasone dipropionate 7. Hydrocortisone Dermatitis: Inflammation in the upper layers of the skin (can be epidermis and dermis)Eczema: Broad range of conditions that begin with spongiotic dermatitis (fluid build-up in the skin)Terms can be synonymous. Eczema better understood by the patient, dermatitis better in the medical arena Acute:-weepy vesiclesChronic: -Lichenification (thickening of the skin) from chronic scratching-Patches of rough, inflamed skinTypically:-Itchy and scaly-Red-colored except in darker skin types it looks more hyperpigmented--Can present in various locations and have multiple causes Atopic dermatitis (eczema)Contact dermatitis-allergic contact dermatitis-irritant contact dermatitisSeborrheic dermatitisNummular dermatitisAsteatotic dermatitisStasis dermatitisDyshydrotic dermatitisRhus dermatitis Can occur at any age, but most cases arise before age 5. -Arise from genetic and environmental factors-Commonly associated with xerosis and irritant susceptibility Etiology:-Immunologic (T-cell mediated)-Increase in IgE in 75% of patientsGenetic predisposition:-Families with atopy (seasonal allergies, food allergies, asthma, allergic rhinitis = type 1 hypersensitivities)-Defects in fillagrin gene which is part of skin barrierEnvironmental stress-highly industrialized countries-Flares with climate (dry times of year)-Can worsen when exposed to allergensDiagnosis:-dry skin + pruritis (look for typical morphology and age-specific patterns)-personal/family history of atopy-typically early age of onset-Chronic/relapsing pattern Classic stages: 1.

This often happens in association with such as small depressions in the nail (pitting), , and . Skin changes consistent with (e.g., , scaly, and plaques) frequently occur before the onset of psoriatic arthritis but psoriatic arthritis can precede the rash in 15% of affected individuals. It is classified as a type of . are thought to be strongly involved in the development of psoriatic arthritis. and certain forms of psoriasis are thought to increase the risk. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30% of people with psoriasis and occurs in both children and adults. Approximately 40–50% of individuals with psoriatic arthritis have the . The condition is less common in people of or descent and affects men and women equally. Pain, swelling, or stiffness in one or more joints is commonly present in psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is inflammatory, and affected joints are generally red or warm to the touch. Asymmetrical , defined as inflammation affecting two to four joints during the first six months of disease, is present in 70% of cases. However, in 15% of cases, the arthritis is symmetrical. The joints of the hand that is involved in psoriasis are the , the distal interphalangeal (DIP), the , and the wrist. Involvement of the (DIP) is a characteristic feature and is present in 15% of cases. In addition to affecting the joints of the hands and wrists, psoriatic arthritis may affect the fingers, nails, and skin. Sausage-like swelling in the fingers or toes, known as , may occur. Psoriasis can also cause changes to the nails, such as pitting or separation from the nail bed, , under the nails, and horizontal ridging. Psoriasis classically presents with scaly skin lesions, which are most commonly seen over extensor surfaces such as the scalp, natal cleft and umbilicus. In psoriatic arthritis, pain can occur in the area of the (the lower back, above the tailbone), as a result of or , which is present in 40% of cases. Pain can occur in and around the feet and ankles, especially in the Achilles tendon (inflammation of the Achilles tendon where it inserts into the bone) or in the sole of the foot. Along with the above-noted pain and inflammation, there is extreme exhaustion that does not go away with adequate rest. The exhaustion may last for days or weeks without abatement. Psoriatic arthritis may remain mild or may progress to more destructive joint disease. Periods of active disease, or flares, will typically alternate with periods of remission. In severe forms, psoriatic arthritis may progress to which on X-ray gives a ""pencil-in-cup"" appearance. Because prolonged inflammation can lead to joint damage, early diagnosis and treatment to slow or prevent joint damage is recommended. The exact causes are not yet known, but a number of genetic associations have been identified in a of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis including .

There is no definitive test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis may closely resemble other diseases, including . A (a physician specializing in autoimmune diseases) may use physical examinations, health history, blood tests and x-rays to accurately diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Factors that contribute to a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis include the following: Psoriasis in the patient, or a family history of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. A negative test result for , a blood factor associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis symptoms in the distal (the joints closest to the tips of the fingers). This is not typical of rheumatoid arthritis. Ridging or pitting of fingernails or toenails (), which is associated with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Radiologic images demonstrating degenerative joint changes. Other symptoms that are more typical of psoriatic arthritis than other forms of arthritis include (inflammation in the (at the back of the heel) or the (bottom of the feet)), and (sausage-like swelling of the fingers or toes).

Several conditions can mimic the clinical presentation of psoriatic arthritis including , , , , , and -associated arthritis. In contrast to psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the proximal joints (e.g., the ), involves a greater number of joints than psoriatic arthritis, and affect them symmetrically. Involvement of the spinal joints is more suggestive of psoriatic arthritis than rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis shares certain clinical features with psoriatic arthritis such as its tendency to affect multiple distal joints in an asymmetric pattern. Unlike psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis does not typically involve . Psoriatic arthritis sometimes affects only one joint and is sometimes confused for gout or when this happens. There are five main types of psoriatic arthritis: Oligoarticular: This type affects around 70% of patients and is generally mild. This type does not occur in the same joints on both sides of the body and usually only involves fewer than 3 joints. Polyarticular: This type accounts for around 25% of cases, and affects five or more joints on both sides of the body simultaneously. This type is most similar to and is disabling in around 50% of all cases. Arthritis mutilans (): Affects less than 5% of patients and is a severe, deforming and destructive arthritis. This condition can progress over months or years causing severe joint damage. Arthritis mutilans has also been called chronic absorptive arthritis, and may be seen in as well. Spondyloarthritis (): This type is characterized by stiffness of the neck or the of the spine, but can also affect the hands and feet, in a similar fashion to symmetric arthritis. Distal interphalangeal predominant (): This type of psoriatic arthritis is found in about 5% of patients, and is characterized by inflammation and stiffness in the joints nearest to the ends of the fingers and toes. Nail changes are often marked. The underlying process in psoriatic arthritis is ; therefore, treatments are directed at reducing and controlling . Milder cases of psoriatic arthritis may be treated with alone; however, there is a trend toward earlier use of or to prevent irreversible joint destruction. Typically the medications first prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are such as and , followed by more potent NSAIDs like , , and . NSAIDs can irritate the stomach and intestine, and long-term use can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. Coxibs () e.g. Celecoxib or Etoricoxib, are associated with a statistically significant 50 to 66% relative risk reduction in gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding complications compared to traditional NSAIDs, but carry an increased rate of cardiovascular events such as (MI) or heart attack, and . Both COX-2 inhibitors and other non-selective NSAIDS have potential adverse effects that include damage to the kidneys. These are used in persistent symptomatic cases without exacerbation. Rather than just reducing pain and inflammation, this class of drugs helps limit the amount of joint damage that occurs in psoriatic arthritis. Most DMARDs act slowly and may take weeks or even months to take full effect. Drugs such as or are commonly prescribed; other DMARDS used to treat psoriatic arthritis include , , and . According to a recent Cochrane review, low dose oral methotrexate was slightly more effective than placebos. drugs can also reduce psoriasis skin symptoms but can lead to liver and kidney problems and an increased risk of serious infection. The most recent class of treatment is called or biologics has been developed using technology. Biologic medications are derived from living cells cultured in a laboratory. Unlike traditional DMARDS that affect the entire immune system, biologics target specific parts of the immune system. They are given by injection or intravenous (IV) infusion. Biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are inhibitors, including , , , and , as well as the / inhibitor . Recently, the Jak inhibitor, tocifitinib (Xeljanz), was approved for the use in active psoriatic arthritis. Biologics may increase the risk of minor and serious infections. More rarely, they may be associated with nervous system disorders, blood disorders or certain types of cancer. A first-in-class treatment option for the management of psoriatic arthritis, is a small molecule approved for use by the FDA in 2014. By inhibiting PDE4, an enzyme which breaks down , cAMP levels rise, resulting in the down-regulation of various pro-inflammatory factors including , and , as well as the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory factor . It is given in tablet form and taken by mouth. Side effects include headaches, back pain, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections, as well as depression and weight loss. Patented in 2014 and manufactured by , there is no current generic equivalent available on the market. A review found tentative evidence of benefit of and concluded that it could be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated RA. Retinoid etretinate is effective for both arthritis and skin lesions. Photochemotherapy with methoxy psoralen and long-wave ultraviolet light (PUVA) are used for severe skin lesions. may use with in cases where one joint is severely affected. In psoriatic arthritis patients with severe joint damage may be implemented to correct joint destruction, usually with the use of a . Surgery is effective for pain alleviation, correcting joint disfigurement, and reinforcing joint usefulness and strength. Seventy percent of people who develop psoriatic arthritis first show signs of on the skin, 15 percent develop skin psoriasis and arthritis at the same time, and 15 percent develop skin psoriasis following the onset of psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis can develop in people who have any level severity of psoriatic skin disease, ranging from mild to very severe. Psoriatic arthritis tends to appear about 10 years after the first signs of . For the majority of people, this is between the ages of 30 and 55, but the disease can also affect children. The onset of psoriatic arthritis symptoms before symptoms of skin psoriasis is more common in children than adults. More than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis will have psoriatic nail lesions characterized by nail pitting, separation of the nail from the underlying nail bed, ridging and cracking, or more extremely, loss of the nail itself (). is observed in 30 to 50% of patients and most commonly involves the and , but it may cause pain around the , , , and insertions Men and women are equally affected by this condition.

Plaque-type psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis. Approximately, nine out of 10 people with psoriasis have plaques. The disease begins with a small scaling red bump that coalesces with other similar to form an elevated plaque of red skin that is covered with silvery scales. Circular- to oval-shaped red plaques that sometimes itch or are typical of . The plaques usually are found on the elbows, knees, trunk, or , but they may be found on any part of the skin. Most plaques of psoriasis are persistent (they stay for years and do not tend to come and go). Picture of plaque psoriasis on a leg. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD.

Usually, a fine scale surmounts the drop-like that is much finer than the scales in plaque psoriasis. usually occurs on the trunk, arms, or legs. However, it may cover a large portion of the body. This type of psoriasis often ""runs its course"" and may even go away without treatment in a few weeks. Sometimes guttate psoriasis can be more persistent, and it may evolve into plaque psoriasis. Picture of guttate psoriasis. Red drop-like lesions are found on the skin. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. A close-up view of guttate psoriasis. Notice the salmon-pink (red) drop-like lesions. Fine scales can be seen on the lesions. These scales are much finer than those associated with plaque psoriasis. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. The guttate form of psoriasis is the second most common form of psoriasis. About 2% of those with psoriasis have the guttate type. This type of psoriasis is more common in children and adults younger than 30 years of age. The trigger to the disease is often a streptococcal bacterial throat infection. The eruption of the lesions on the skin usually occurs two to three weeks after a streptococcal . Outbreaks may resolve only to return with the next . Types of Psoriasis: Medical Pictures and Treatments is an uncommon form of psoriasis. People with have clearly defined, raised bumps on the skin that are filled with pus (pustules).

Picture of pustular psoriasis. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Picture of pustular psoriasis. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Pustular psoriasis is classified into one of several types, depending on the symptoms. The lesions may be come on suddenly (acute) or be long-term (chronic), or somewhere in between (subacute). Extensive pustular psoriasis (von Zumbush) often has systemic effects producing acute symptoms like , chills, , , and . Pustular psoriasis can be so severe that it requires hospitalization. Pustular psoriasis of the palms and soles is usually chronic and has red patches studded with white to yellow pustules. A ring-shaped (annular, or circinate) type also exists. It is usually subacute or chronic, and people with this type do not usually have symptoms aside from the skin symptoms. Acrodermatitis continua is a rare type of pustular psoriasis that involves the fingertips. Fingernails may accumulate lakes of pus over the nail bed. The lesions may be very painful and result in permanent nail destruction. Bright red, smooth (not scaly) plaques are found in the skin folds (intertriginous areas). The most common areas are under the breasts, in the armpits, near the genitals, under or between the buttocks, or in abdominal folds. These irritated and inflamed areas are aggravated by the sweat and skin rubbing together in the folds. Yeast overgrowth may trigger the skin lesions of psoriasis. Picture of inverse psoriasis. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Topical creams and ointments are used to treat . Corticosteroids, derivatives, topical retinoids, , , or anthralin have been used. Due to the sensitive nature of the skin in the folds of the body, irritation from treatment is common. Another problem is that these moist irritated areas can be prime areas for yeast and other . This is the least common type of psoriasis and can be quite serious. A very large area of the skin becomes bright red, inflamed, and scaly.

Note the discoloration. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Most, but not all, people who have psoriasis of the nails also have skin psoriasis (also called cutaneous psoriasis or simply psoriasis). Psoriasis of the nails occurs in fewer than 5% of people who do not have skin psoriasis. In people who have skin psoriasis, 10%-55% have psoriasis of the nails (also called psoriatic nail disease). About 10%-25% of people who have skin psoriasis also have , a specific condition in which people have inflammation of both the joints and the skin. Of people with , 53%-86% have affected nails. Psoriasis of the nails can cause a number of changes to the nail area. Clear yellow-red nail discoloring that looks like a drop of oil under the nail plate may occur. Little pits may form in the nails. These pits develop when cells are lost from the nail's surface. Picture of nail psoriasis with pitting. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Lines may develop going across the nails (side to side rather than root to tip). Areas of white on the nail plate may also be present. The skin under the nail may thicken and lead to loosening of the nail. A white area may develop under the tip of the nail where it is separated from the skin underneath. This usually starts at the tip of the nail and extends toward the base. The nail may weaken and start to crumble because the underlying structures are not healthy. The pale arched area at the bottom of the nail may become red. This occurs when the capillaries under the nail are congested. Nail psoriasis can also occur with fungal infections of the nail () and inflammation of the skin around the edges of the nail (). Psoriasis causes the top layer of skin cells to become inflamed and grow too quickly and flake off. The scalp may have fine dry scaly skin or have heavily crusted plaque areas. The plaque can flake off or peel off in crusted clumps. Sometimes is confused with . Picture of psoriasis of the scalp. Image courtesy of Hon Pak, MD. Medicated shampoos are used to loosen the scales from the scalp. Salicylic acid and coal tar are used as active ingredients in psoriasis shampoo. Topical or systemic medications may be used to treat the psoriasis. When psoriasis involves the palms and/or the soles, special problems occur. Since these surfaces are often extremely important in our normal activities, significant involvement can be debilitating. Because the skin in these area is so thick naturally, treatment with topical medication may not be adequate and alternative treatments must be considered. is a disease in which a person may have both psoriasis and inflammatory . Psoriatic arthritis is a potentially destructive and deforming form of joint disease. Picture of severe psoriatic arthritis involving the finger joints. Psoriatic arthritis, like psoriasis, is an autoimmune disease, meaning that the immune cells damage one's own tissues. Rarely, a person can have psoriatic arthritis without having skin psoriasis. Usually, the more severe the skin symptoms are, the greater the likelihood a person will have psoriatic arthritis. Picture of psoriatic arthritis. Severe deformity of the joints at the ends of the fingers. Psoriatic arthritis affects 10%-30% of people with psoriasis. A recent survey by the indicated that approximately 1 million people in the United States have psoriatic arthritis. Often people who have psoriasis are unaware that they have psoriatic arthritis. It is important to recognize that patients with psoriasis are predisposed to a number of systemic conditions that can adversely impact their general health, including , , and cardiovascular disease.

Psoriasis Diet, Essential Oils & Supplements for Natural Treatment Top Supplements and Essential Oils for the Psoriasis Diet Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease that causes inflammation and scaling of the skin that affects approximately 2 percent to 2.6 percent of the U.S. population. () Normal, healthy skin experiences cell turnover about once a month, but when you have psoriasis, the skin cells rise way too fast and actually pile up on top of each other. Thankfully, you can help combat this condition with by following a proper psoriasis diet treatment plan. We know that psoriasis begins in the immune system and involves a type of white blood cell called a T cell. () When you have psoriasis, the T cells are put into action by mistake and become overly active, leading to unhealthy swelling and fast turnover of skin cells. A major dermatology focus in the realm of skin diseases, can vary according to the form of psoriasis (of which there are several – more on that below). You might be thinking psoriasis is just an annoying skin condition, but it can also result in psoriatic arthritis, an inflammation of the joints that affects approximately 30 percent of all psoriasis patients. Conventional psoriasis treatment might work, but it often doesn’t or is only a temporary fix that doesn’t get to the heart of the issue. There are many natural remedies for psoriasis, with a psoriasis diet making the very top of the list. Why is a psoriasis diet so important? Studies have shown that intestinal permeability or is very common in psoriasis patients. Making the right food choices can make a world of difference when it comes to psoriasis. As the National Psoriasis Foundation says, “Happy diet, happy life.” () I couldn’t agree more! The most common psoriasis symptoms, especially those seen in people with plaque psoriasis, include: () plaques of red skin, sometimes also covered with a crust of scales that tend to be silver or white loose skin or lesions that can be sensitive, itchy and painful cracked, discolored skin that easily bleeds and bruises discoloration in the finger and toenails or growth of nails that detach from the nail beds and can be painful or bloody many people with psoriasis also suffer from emotional problems due to feeling embarrassed and hopeless about their skin () Psoriasis is most often found on the elbows, legs, scalp, lower back, face, palms and soles of the feet. However, it can also occur in other locations, such as the fingernails, toenails, genitals and inside the mouth. Scalp psoriasis affects about 50 percent of people with psoriasis, making it one of the most obvious concerns in people with the condition. Most doctors are unsure about what causes psoriasis, but many natural physicians have found contributing factors. Psoriasis causes include: Overactive immune system (psoriasis is an ) An increased number of T cells in the blood, dermis and epidermis If you want to overcome psoriasis, you can see great improvements by following a healthy and healing psoriasis diet. Psoriasis is believed to be an in which the body mistakenly detects its own tissue as foreign and attacks itself. When it comes to conventional treatment, doctors take into consideration how serious your case is, the type of psoriasis and the size of the psoriasis patches. Doctors will often switch conventional treatments if one isn’t effective, you have a bad reaction or if it stops working all together. () Conventional treatment is often difficult, and currently the most common remedies are retinoids or immunosuppressant drugs. The latter are often steroids or cyclosporin, which come with concerning side effects even if they’re effective in treating psoriasis. Topical treatment is very common and involves applying a cream or ointment to the problem areas. Another conventional option is , also called , which uses a combination of natural ultraviolet light from the sun and artificial ultraviolet light. PUVA is a form of light therapy treatment that uses a combination of a drug that makes skin more sensitive to light and exposure to ultraviolet A light. When psoriasis is severe, doctors will likely use systemic treatment, which means prescription drugs or medicine given through a shot. Combination therapy for psoriasis uses topical, phototherapy and systemic treatments in unison, all of which come with side effects that a natural remedy like a psoriasis diet does not. Natural or holistic treatment aims to get at the root of the problem. For many people,  combined with a healing psoriasis diet is one of the best ways to naturally treat psoriasis. Studies have been looking at the link between intestinal structure and function in the development of psoriasis for decades. () Some experts believe that psoriasis is actually caused by intestinal permeability, specifically in the area between the duodenum and the jejunum. Consequently, the body seeks to eliminate the toxins through the skin. In this model, psoriasis represents the body’s desperate attempt to cleanse itself. Here are some natural ways to help combat psoriasis: Stress is also known to play a big role in psoriasis, which is why mind-body therapies and can really help naturally heal psoriasis. , meditation and hypnosis can all help. Studies actually show that people who meditate before receiving light therapy have better outcomes than people who had light therapy alone. () It may sound too simple, but exercise and  are two easy and effective ways to help heal psoriasis. When it comes to bathing, you definitely don’t want to use water that’s too hot because this can further dry and inflame your skin. Soaking in a lukewarm bath containing dead sea salts, or oats for around 15 minutes can help remove scales and calm itching. Be sure to apply moisturizer to your skin as soon as you get out of a bath or shower — this way you can seal some water into your skin, which can help to calm and heal psoriasis patches. There are three nature-based topical remedies that have shown positive effects on psoriasis: Oregon grape (10 percent) cream, avocado and cream, and aloe (0.5 percent) cream. Research has shown that using Reliéva, a homeopathic cream containing Oregon grape extract, is effective and well-tolerated in patients with mild to moderate psoriasis. () Early research suggests that a proprietary cream containing and vitamin B12 may decrease psoriasis symptoms. Several studies have shown that a cream containing 0.5 percent aloe vera extract is superior to a placebo with no negative side effects. () 4. Try Homeopathy and Other Alternative Treatments is another natural remedy shown to improve psoriasis. Studies have shown that homeopathic treatment of psoriasis patients results in improved symptoms and overall quality of life. ()  and Chinese medicine may also help some people with psoriasis. In Chinese medicine, psoriasis is viewed as a health issues caused by the stagnation of blood. Some herbs a Chinese medicine doctor may prescribe include turmeric, zedoria (similar to ginger), dang gui, red peony and sarsaparilla. Dittany, sophora and tribulus may also be prescribed to relieve psoriasis-related itching. If you’re a fan of , you may want to try Panchakarma therapy, which involves plant-based remedies and dietary changes aimed at detoxifying the body. A vegetarian diet is often recommended as well. The Panchakarma treatments include consuming and medicated enemas. A psoriasis diet is crucial. If you have a leaky gut, then partially digested protein and fat can seep through your intestinal lining, making their way into your bloodstream and causing allergic responses. If left unrepaired, it can lead to more severe health issues like psoriasis as well as depression, anxiety, migraine headaches, muscle pain and chronic fatigue. Studies have shown a link between abnormal small intestine permeability and psoriasis. () A psoriasis diet can help heal your gut, which in turn can end your suffering with psoriasis as well as . Wondering how to get rid of psoriasis naturally? As I always say, your diet is the basis for good health, and it’s no different when it comes to psoriasis. Not only is your diet a treatment for active psoriasis, but it’s also a way to prevent psoriasis in the first place. When it comes to natural treatment for psoriasis, these are some of the best foods to consume on a regular basis. I also recommend these food choices for anyone looking for a psoriatic . The more you consume healing, anti-inflammatory foods, the more improvement you will see in your skin’s health. Consuming foods high in probiotics is a great way to support digestion, remove toxins from the body, help reduce inflammation and boost immunity.  Look for organic, raw, cultured dairy like kefir, yogurt and cultured vegetables which can give your body the bacteria and yeast that it needs to be healthy. There have been many, many personal accounts of probiotics clearing up stubborn psoriasis that did not respond to conventional treatment. One sufferer had psoriasis on his heels for about 10 years that did not respond to topical treatment. He started taking probiotics for a different condition, and his heels cleared up and stayed clear of psoriasis. () —By upping your intake of high-fiber foods you can help to keep your digestive system healthy, which helps avoid constipation and keep your natural detoxification processes on track. Fruits, vegetables, beans and seeds are all rich in fiber.  — Similar to the lineup for fiber-rich foods, foods high in antioxidants include vegetables, fruits, herbs, beans and nuts. Some choices that top the list when it comes to antioxidants include goji berries, wild blueberries, pecans, cilantro and kidney beans. Antioxidant consumption is especially important since psoriasis sufferers are at a greater risk for cancer and heart disease.  — Zinc is critical for keeping skin healthy. Some evidence shows that zinc helps reduce pain and joint swelling for psoriasis sufferers. () Grass-fed beef, lamb, pumpkin seeds, kefir and chickpeas are all great sources of zinc.  — Think orange, yellow and dark leafy green vegetables. By adding these winners to your diet on a daily basis, you will increase your , which is critical for skin healing. Good sources of vitamin A includes cantaloupe, carrots, mango, tomatoes, kale, collard greens and watermelon.  Fish like salmon, mackerel, herring and sardines are excellent sources of vitamin D as well as , which are both key to improving psoriasis. Vitamin D is clinically proven to help fight psoriasis. () If you have psoriasis, fish should be the new leading protein in your life rather than meat and conventional dairy products. Studies have shown that eating fewer protein-rich foods, primarily meats and dairy products, may help ease psoriasis flare-ups.  — is a much healthier choice than conventional milk. Rich in vitamin D and enzymes, raw dairy products can be therapeutic to psoriasis.  — are anti-inflammatory and contain antioxidants. Curcumin, the active ingredient in the spice known as , is known for its potent health properties. A 2012 scientific review specifically notes turmeric’s ability to alter TNF cytokine expression, which are known to play an essential role in the start and continuation of psoriatic lesions. This is probably why patients find turmeric helpful in minimizing psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis flare-ups. You can liberally add this spice to your food, keeping in mind that the FDA considers 1.5 to 3.0 grams of turmeric per day safe. ()  — Applied externally and taken internally, is very soothing to the body, especially to the digestive system and skin. When you’re on a psoriasis diet, you definitely want to avoid processed foods, simple sugars, alcohol, conventional dairy, conventional meats, hydrogenated oils and fried foods. You should also keep caffeine intake low. For some sufferers, a gluten-free diet helps improve symptoms. If you or your doctor think that you might have a gluten allergy or any other type of food allergy, then food allergy testing or an elimination diet can help guide you toward what to avoid in your diet. Top Supplements and Essential Oils for the Psoriasis Diet If you’re wondering how to treat psoriasis naturally, a psoriasis diet is most crucial, but supplements can also be very helpful. These are the top five supplements I recommend for internal treatment of psoriasis: Hydrochloric acid (1–3 capsules per meal) — Helps with protein digestion and decrease psoriasis flare-ups. Fish oil (1,000–2,000 grams daily) —  is anti-inflammatory and can aid in the healing of psoriasis. Vitamin D3 (5,000 IU daily) — Low levels of vitamin D may be associated with psoriasis. Milk thistle (250 milligrams three times daily) — helps promote liver detoxification and reduces cellular growth. Probiotics (50 billion units daily) —  improve digestion by increasing good bacteria and crowding out bad bacteria. Digestive issues are linked to psoriasis. Other home remedies for psoriasis that can reduce symptoms include cleansing, bone broth, vitamin B12 and digestive enzymes. Also, getting 20 minutes of sunshine a day can greatly improve vitamin D levels naturally and is very therapeutic to psoriasis. Essential oils for psoriasis like tea tree, lavender, frankincense, myrrh and geranium essential oil can bring relief to inflamed skin and support the healing process.  — When you use tea tree for your psoriasis, you prevent infection while also reducing inflammation and stimulating the immune system to support your skin health. Scientific research has confirmed the psoriasis-reducing effects of tea tree oil. ()  — With calming and anti-inflammatory properties, it helps soothe the skin while also promoting new skin growth and healing.  — With antiseptic, antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, frankincense can help provide relief for stubborn psoriasis patches.  — Excellent at healing the chapped, flakey and cracked skin of psoriasis patches.  — Geranium is great at improving circulation and decreasing inflammation. It also helps relieve stress.  — It’s not an essential oil, but it’s a great choice for a base oil. You should always dilute essential oils in a base oil before applying them to problem areas. Coconut oil has anti-inflammatory, very gentle and moisturizing. : Mix three drops of lavender oil and three drop of frankincense oil with on teaspoon of coconut oil and rub onto affected area. It’s also a great idea to use these essential oils in aromatherapy for psoriasis. You can diffuse these oils as a natural method of stress relief. Psoriasis causes and symptoms can be a tricky subject because of the various types of psoriasis and psoriatic disease complications that can occur – this isn’t just one of the skin diseases. That’s why it’s so important to recognize the signs and do what you can to treat your condition naturally and with the supervision of your doctor. (also known as ) – This is the most common form of psoriasis, found frequently on the knees, elbows, lower back and as scalp psoriasis. People with generally have psoriasis on other areas of their body as well, but this location can be particularly frustrating because it can cause a dandruff-like appearance and may even lead to temporary hair loss. – Unlike the large, raised lesions common with plaque psoriasis, guttate psoriasis is characterized by small dots and seen frequently in childhood or early adulthood. This form of psoriasis can be brought on by a case of strep throat. (may be referred to as flexural psoriasis or intertriginous psoriasis) – Body folds, such as behind the knee or in the groin, are the prime location for the smooth and shiny red areas of inverse psoriasis. In dermatology, it is commonly understood that this form of psoriasis probably occurs during an outbreak of plaque psoriasis somewhere else on the body. – The bumps of pustular psoriasis look like blisters or pimples but are actually filled with white blood cells. Often, people assume this is a contagious infection, but it is not. These pustules are usually surrounded by red skin and occur most frequently on the hands and feet. (sometimes called exfoliative psoriasis) – The most severe of the psoriasis types, erythrodermic psoriasis is usually found in people with unstable plaque psoriasis. It is known by the wide, fiery outbreak and is accompanied by severe itching and pain. During an outbreak of erythrodermic psoriasis, skin often comes off in “sheets.” Only about three percent of people with psoriasis have this type of psoriasis, and it requires immediate medical attention because it can cause increased heartrate and body temperature changes. Some cases, particularly if left untreated, can lead to protein and fluid loss, shivering episodes, pneumonia and even congestive heart failure. Certain skin diseases look like psoriasis but actually fit another diagnosis. One example of this is , a red, itchy rash that appears most often (but not always) on the scalp. Seborrheic dermatitis (or “seborrhea”) seems to have roots in stress, genetic factors, a particular yeast that lives on skin, certain diagnoses or medications and cold, dry weather. Newborns, men and people with oily skin are at the highest risk of this particular form of dermatitis. Dandruff is caused by seborrhea. Infants with the condition are often referred to as having “cradle cap,” as well as given an improper diagnosis of diaper rash when the redness occurs around the groin. Like psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis most often clears and flares throughout the lifetime. If you have symptoms of these disorders, see a dermatologist for a confirmed diagnosis and treatment options. Since seborrhea is not an autoimmune disease, treatment looks different – although many of the same items and supplements on my psoriasis diet are similar for those with seborrhea. Psoriatic diseases including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have an elevated risk of related conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease, , depression, diabetes, , obesity, osteoporosis, (an inflammatory disease of the eye) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. () Any psoriasis overview would be incomplete without noting the underlying mechanisms of this conditions and the related issues. A combination of genetic predisposition and an extreme action of the immune system lead to these unsightly, uncomfortable and even painful conditions. No wonder it’s associated with the autoimmune issues common in leaky gut syndrome! If you already use conventional treatment for your psoriasis, check with your doctor before adding any supplements or other natural remedies to your regimen. Also, check with your doctor before taking any supplements if you have any ongoing health concerns or are currently taking medication. Some supplements and herbs may interact with common prescription medications, such as blood thinners and birth control pills. If you’re pregnant or breast-feeding, ask your doctor before using any conventional or natural treatments for psoriasis. When using essential oils for psoriasis, always perform a small patch test to make sure you don’t react badly to any essential oil. Also, always dilute the essential oils in a base oil like coconut. If you generally have sensitive skin, be even more careful when using essential oils. There are many natural, home remedies that have been scientifically shown to improve psoriasis. Psoriasis is an immune system issue so anything you can do to improve your immune system will be helpful to improving psoriasis symptoms. One of the best ways to get to the root of the problem is through a healthy, healing, anti-inflammatory psoriasis diet.

This major histocompatibility complex is not associated with , or late-onset psoriasis. Theories about the causes of psoriasis need to explain why the skin is red, inflamed and thickened. It is clear that immune factors and inflammatory (messenger ) such as IL1β and α are responsible for the clinical features of psoriasis. Current theories are exploring the TH17 pathway and release of the IL17A. Psoriasis usually presents with symmetrically distributed, red, scaly plaques with edges. The is typically silvery white, except in skin folds where the plaques often appear shiny and they may have a moist peeling surface. The most common sites are scalp, elbows and knees, but any part of the skin can be involved. The plaques are usually very without treatment.

How do clinical features vary in differing types of skin? Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis in all racial groups. Non-Caucasians tend to have more extensive skin involvement than Caucasians. Asian populations are reported to have the highest percentage of body surface area involvement. In skin of colour the plaques are typically thicker with more pronounced silver scale and itch. The pinkness of early patches may be more difficult to appreciate resulting in a low assessment. The thick plaques may appear violet or dark in colour. Plaque psoriasis commonly resolves to leave or in skin of colour, which further impacts quality of life even after disease clearance. Other types of psoriasis show variable rates in different skin types. Palmoplantar psoriasis is reported to be most common in the Indian population. Non-Caucasians are more likely to present with and erythrodermic psoriasis than Caucasians, whereas flexural psoriasis is said to occur at a lower rate in skin of colour.

If necessary, diagnosis is supported by typical findings. Medical assessment entails a careful history, examination, questioning about the effect of psoriasis on daily life, and evaluation of comorbid factors. Validated tools used to evaluate psoriasis include: Self-Administered Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (SAPASI) Psoriasis Log-based Area and Severity Index (PLASI) The severity of psoriasis is classified as mild in 60% of patients, moderate in 30% and severe in 10%.

It is classified into several subtypes. Psoriasis affects 2–4% of males and females. It can start at any age including , with peaks of onset at 15–25 years and 50–60 years. It tends to lifelong, fluctuating in extent and severity. It is particularly common in Caucasians but may affect people of any race. About one-third of patients with psoriasis have family members with psoriasis. Psoriasis is . It is classified as an immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID). factors are important. An individual's genetic profile influences their type of psoriasis and its response to treatment. -wide association studies report that the histocompatibility complex -C*06:02 (previously known as HLA-Cw6) is associated with early-onset psoriasis and . This major histocompatibility complex is not associated with , or late-onset psoriasis. Theories about the causes of psoriasis need to explain why the skin is red, inflamed and thickened. It is clear that immune factors and inflammatory (messenger ) such as IL1β and α are responsible for the clinical features of psoriasis. Current theories are exploring the TH17 pathway and release of the IL17A. Psoriasis usually presents with symmetrically distributed, red, scaly plaques with edges. The is typically silvery white, except in skin folds where the plaques often appear shiny and they may have a moist peeling surface. The most common sites are scalp, elbows and knees, but any part of the skin can be involved. The plaques are usually very without treatment. Itch is mostly mild but may be severe in some patients, leading to scratching and (thickened leathery skin with increased skin markings). Painful skin cracks or may occur. When psoriatic plaques clear up, they may leave brown or pale marks that can be expected to fade over several months. Certain features of psoriasis can be categorised to help determine appropriate investigations and treatment pathways. Overlap may occur. Early age of onset < 35 years (75%) vs late age of onset > 50 years eg vs eg ,  psoriasis vs psoriasis : new plaques at sites of skin injury Induced by , , drugs, or drug withdrawal May or may not be preceded by another form of psoriasis May result in illness with temperature , electrolyte imbalance, cardiac failure and are no longer classified within the psoriasis spectrum. How do clinical features vary in differing types of skin? Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis in all racial groups. Non-Caucasians tend to have more extensive skin involvement than Caucasians. Asian populations are reported to have the highest percentage of body surface area involvement. In skin of colour the plaques are typically thicker with more pronounced silver scale and itch. The pinkness of early patches may be more difficult to appreciate resulting in a low assessment. The thick plaques may appear violet or dark in colour. Plaque psoriasis commonly resolves to leave or in skin of colour, which further impacts quality of life even after disease clearance. Other types of psoriasis show variable rates in different skin types. Palmoplantar psoriasis is reported to be most common in the Indian population. Non-Caucasians are more likely to present with and erythrodermic psoriasis than Caucasians, whereas flexural psoriasis is said to occur at a lower rate in skin of colour. Injuries such as cuts, abrasions, sunburn () Sun exposure in 10% (sun exposure is more often beneficial) Medications such as lithium, beta-blockers, ,  and others Stopping or strong . Patients with psoriasis are more likely than other people to have other health conditions listed here. Inflammatory arthritis “” and spondyloarthropathy (in up to 40% of patients with early-onset chronic plaque psoriasis) ( and ulcerative ) Metabolic : obesity, , , gout, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes , and Psoriasis is diagnosed by its clinical features. If necessary, diagnosis is supported by typical findings. Medical assessment entails a careful history, examination, questioning about the effect of psoriasis on daily life, and evaluation of comorbid factors. Validated tools used to evaluate psoriasis include: Self-Administered Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (SAPASI) Psoriasis Log-based Area and Severity Index (PLASI) The severity of psoriasis is classified as mild in 60% of patients, moderate in 30% and severe in 10%. Psoriatic Arthritis Screening Evaluation (PASE) or Psoriasis Screening Tool (PEST) Body Mass Index (BMI, ie height, weight, waist circumference) Patients with psoriasis should ensure they are well informed about their skin condition and its treatment. There are benefits from not , avoiding excessive and maintaining optimal weight. Mild psoriasis is generally treated with topical agents alone. Which treatment is selected may depend on body site, extent and severity of psoriasis. Combination calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate / or A  (, ) Most psoriasis centres offer with ultraviolet () radiation, often in combination with topical or systemic agents. Types of phototherapy include Moderate to severe psoriasis warrants treatment with a systemic agent and/or . The most common treatments are: Other medicines occasionally used for psoriasis include: are best avoided due to a risk of severe withdrawal flare of psoriasis and adverse effects. or targeted therapies are reserved for conventional treatment-resistant severe psoriasis, mainly because of expense, as side effects compare favourably with other systemic agents. These include:  (anti-TNFα) , and The (IL)-12/23 antagonist   Many other are under investigation in the treatment of psoriasis. Oral agents working through the kinase pathways are also under investigation.  Several JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitors are under investigation for psoriasis, including tofacitinib and the TYK2 ( 2) inhibitor BMS-986165; both are in Phase III trials for psoriasis.

It is believed that over 10,000 different compounds make up coal tar, but only 400 or so have been identified. The main groups of compounds making up crude coal tar are 48% hydrocarbons, 42% carbon and 10% water. In its natural form coal tar is a thick, nearly black, liquid with a characteristic smell. It is most often obtained in form (0.1 to 20%) and mixed with other ingredients, such as and sulphur, to make lotions, , ointments and shampoos. It has been used for decades to help treat the , itching and of , , and other skin disorders. Marketed preparations of coal tar in New Zealand include: Coconut Oil Compound (Coco-Scalp™) for scalp psoriasis Shampoos such as Polytar™, Sebitar™, Ionil T™ and Fongitar™ However, crude and refined coal tar preparations are still available through your pharmacist who will compound any coal tar preparation as prescribed by your doctor. The use of coal tar is declining as newer compounds effective against the different forms of psoriasis are replacing it.

Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30% of people with psoriasis and occurs in both children and adults. Approximately 40–50% of individuals with psoriatic arthritis have the . The condition is less common in people of or descent and affects men and women equally. Pain, swelling, or stiffness in one or more joints is commonly present in psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is inflammatory, and affected joints are generally red or warm to the touch. Asymmetrical , defined as inflammation affecting two to four joints during the first six months of disease, is present in 70% of cases. However, in 15% of cases, the arthritis is symmetrical. The joints of the hand that is involved in psoriasis are the , the distal interphalangeal (DIP), the , and the wrist. Involvement of the (DIP) is a characteristic feature and is present in 15% of cases. In addition to affecting the joints of the hands and wrists, psoriatic arthritis may affect the fingers, nails, and skin. Sausage-like swelling in the fingers or toes, known as , may occur. Psoriasis can also cause changes to the nails, such as pitting or separation from the nail bed, , under the nails, and horizontal ridging. Psoriasis classically presents with scaly skin lesions, which are most commonly seen over extensor surfaces such as the scalp, natal cleft and umbilicus. In psoriatic arthritis, pain can occur in the area of the (the lower back, above the tailbone), as a result of or , which is present in 40% of cases. Pain can occur in and around the feet and ankles, especially in the Achilles tendon (inflammation of the Achilles tendon where it inserts into the bone) or in the sole of the foot. Along with the above-noted pain and inflammation, there is extreme exhaustion that does not go away with adequate rest. The exhaustion may last for days or weeks without abatement. Psoriatic arthritis may remain mild or may progress to more destructive joint disease. Periods of active disease, or flares, will typically alternate with periods of remission. In severe forms, psoriatic arthritis may progress to which on X-ray gives a ""pencil-in-cup"" appearance. Because prolonged inflammation can lead to joint damage, early diagnosis and treatment to slow or prevent joint damage is recommended. The exact causes are not yet known, but a number of genetic associations have been identified in a of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis including .

A (a physician specializing in autoimmune diseases) may use physical examinations, health history, blood tests and x-rays to accurately diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Factors that contribute to a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis include the following: Psoriasis in the patient, or a family history of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.

Several conditions can mimic the clinical presentation of psoriatic arthritis including , , , , , and -associated arthritis. In contrast to psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the proximal joints (e.g., the ), involves a greater number of joints than psoriatic arthritis, and affect them symmetrically. Involvement of the spinal joints is more suggestive of psoriatic arthritis than rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis shares certain clinical features with psoriatic arthritis such as its tendency to affect multiple distal joints in an asymmetric pattern. Unlike psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis does not typically involve . Psoriatic arthritis sometimes affects only one joint and is sometimes confused for gout or when this happens. There are five main types of psoriatic arthritis: Oligoarticular: This type affects around 70% of patients and is generally mild. This type does not occur in the same joints on both sides of the body and usually only involves fewer than 3 joints. Polyarticular: This type accounts for around 25% of cases, and affects five or more joints on both sides of the body simultaneously. This type is most similar to and is disabling in around 50% of all cases. Arthritis mutilans (): Affects less than 5% of patients and is a severe, deforming and destructive arthritis. This condition can progress over months or years causing severe joint damage. Arthritis mutilans has also been called chronic absorptive arthritis, and may be seen in as well. Spondyloarthritis (): This type is characterized by stiffness of the neck or the of the spine, but can also affect the hands and feet, in a similar fashion to symmetric arthritis. Distal interphalangeal predominant (): This type of psoriatic arthritis is found in about 5% of patients, and is characterized by inflammation and stiffness in the joints nearest to the ends of the fingers and toes. Nail changes are often marked. The underlying process in psoriatic arthritis is ; therefore, treatments are directed at reducing and controlling . Milder cases of psoriatic arthritis may be treated with alone; however, there is a trend toward earlier use of or to prevent irreversible joint destruction. Typically the medications first prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are such as and , followed by more potent NSAIDs like , , and . NSAIDs can irritate the stomach and intestine, and long-term use can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. Coxibs () e.g. Celecoxib or Etoricoxib, are associated with a statistically significant 50 to 66% relative risk reduction in gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding complications compared to traditional NSAIDs, but carry an increased rate of cardiovascular events such as (MI) or heart attack, and . Both COX-2 inhibitors and other non-selective NSAIDS have potential adverse effects that include damage to the kidneys. These are used in persistent symptomatic cases without exacerbation. Rather than just reducing pain and inflammation, this class of drugs helps limit the amount of joint damage that occurs in psoriatic arthritis. Most DMARDs act slowly and may take weeks or even months to take full effect. Drugs such as or are commonly prescribed; other DMARDS used to treat psoriatic arthritis include , , and . According to a recent Cochrane review, low dose oral methotrexate was slightly more effective than placebos. drugs can also reduce psoriasis skin symptoms but can lead to liver and kidney problems and an increased risk of serious infection. The most recent class of treatment is called or biologics has been developed using technology. Biologic medications are derived from living cells cultured in a laboratory. Unlike traditional DMARDS that affect the entire immune system, biologics target specific parts of the immune system. They are given by injection or intravenous (IV) infusion. Biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis are inhibitors, including , , , and , as well as the / inhibitor . Recently, the Jak inhibitor, tocifitinib (Xeljanz), was approved for the use in active psoriatic arthritis. Biologics may increase the risk of minor and serious infections. More rarely, they may be associated with nervous system disorders, blood disorders or certain types of cancer. A first-in-class treatment option for the management of psoriatic arthritis, is a small molecule approved for use by the FDA in 2014. By inhibiting PDE4, an enzyme which breaks down , cAMP levels rise, resulting in the down-regulation of various pro-inflammatory factors including , and , as well as the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory factor . It is given in tablet form and taken by mouth. Side effects include headaches, back pain, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections, as well as depression and weight loss. Patented in 2014 and manufactured by , there is no current generic equivalent available on the market. A review found tentative evidence of benefit of and concluded that it could be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated RA. Retinoid etretinate is effective for both arthritis and skin lesions. Photochemotherapy with methoxy psoralen and long-wave ultraviolet light (PUVA) are used for severe skin lesions. may use with in cases where one joint is severely affected. In psoriatic arthritis patients with severe joint damage may be implemented to correct joint destruction, usually with the use of a . Surgery is effective for pain alleviation, correcting joint disfigurement, and reinforcing joint usefulness and strength. Seventy percent of people who develop psoriatic arthritis first show signs of on the skin, 15 percent develop skin psoriasis and arthritis at the same time, and 15 percent develop skin psoriasis following the onset of psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis can develop in people who have any level severity of psoriatic skin disease, ranging from mild to very severe. Psoriatic arthritis tends to appear about 10 years after the first signs of . For the majority of people, this is between the ages of 30 and 55, but the disease can also affect children. The onset of psoriatic arthritis symptoms before symptoms of skin psoriasis is more common in children than adults. More than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis will have psoriatic nail lesions characterized by nail pitting, separation of the nail from the underlying nail bed, ridging and cracking, or more extremely, loss of the nail itself (). is observed in 30 to 50% of patients and most commonly involves the and , but it may cause pain around the , , , and insertions Men and women are equally affected by this condition.

If you don’t have a reaction, you should be fine to use it on a larger area, such as your scalp. Never apply pure tea tree oil to your scalp without diluting it first. Instead, mix it with a , such as coconut oil. It might be hard to get the oil mixture out of your hair, so you can also try diluting it in another substance, such as aloe vera or apple cider vinegar. You can also try adding tea tree oil to your regular shampoo. When mixing your own tea tree oil solution, start with a concentration of 5 percent. This translates to 5 milliliters (mL) of tea tree oil per 100 mL of the carrier substance. You can also buy an antidandruff shampoo containing tea tree oil.

Psoriasis is a genetic, autoimmune disease Updated January 27, 2021 A slew of powerful medications can help control psoriasis, but your most powerful weapons against the condition may be some simple lifestyle changes. From eating right to de-stressing to honing your beauty routine, how you live your life can affect psoriasis symptoms—for the better. The best part? Many of these same lifestyle measures will boost your overall health. Here's how to take control over your psoriasis by making smart choices in your daily life. | Credit: Getty Images Jump to: | | | | | | Psoriasis is a disease in which red, scaly patches form on the skin, typically on the elbows, knees, or scalp. An estimated 7.5 million people in the United States will develop the disease, most of them between the ages of 15 and 30. Many people with psoriasis experience pain, discomfort, and self-esteem problems that can interfere with their work and social life. Although the exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, researchers say the disease is largely genetic—it’s caused by a combination of genes that send the immune system into overdrive, triggering the rapid growth of skin cells that form patches and lesions. A dermatologist can likely tell the difference between psoriasis and , but to the untrained eye, these can appear similar. Generally speaking, psoriasis appears as thick, red patches that have a scaly buildup on top, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). These lesions are usually well defined, whereas eczema tends to cause a rash and be accompanied by an intense itch. In addition, psoriasis tends to occur on the outside of the knees and elbows, and on the lower back and scalp; eczema usually covers the elbow and knee creases and the neck or face. Research published in 2015 in the suggested that infants and children with psoriasis may be particularly likely to be misdiagnosed with eczema because they may have less scaling than adults. Psoriasis can range in severity, from mild patches to severe lesions that can affect more than 5% of the skin. There are five types of the disease: plaque psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, inverse psoriasis,and erythrodermic psoriasis. Some people will have one form, whereas others will have two or more. appears as red patches with silvery white “scales,” or buildup of dead skin cells, called plaques. It’s the most common type of psoriasis, affecting up to 90% of all people with the disease, according to the AAD. Most often found on the scalp, elbows, lower back, and knees, the plaques themselves will be raised and have clear edges; they may also itch, crack, or bleed. is a form of psoriasis in which white pustules (or bumps filled with white pus) appear on the skin. In a typical cycle, the skin will turn red, break out in pustules, and then develop scales. There are three types of pustular psoriasis: von Zumbusch pustular psoriasis (which appears abruptly and can be accompanied with fever, chills, and dehydration), palmoplantar pustulosis (which appears on the soles of the feet and the hands), and acropustulosis (a rare form of psoriasis that forms on the ends of the fingers or toes). is a type of psoriasis that appears as red, scaly teardrop-shaped spots. (The word guttate is Latin for “drop.”) During a flare-up, hundreds of lesions can form on the arms, legs, and torso, although they can also appear on the face, ears, and scalp. Guttate is the second most common type of psoriasis, occurring in about 10% of all people with the disease. It’s most likely to appear in people who are younger than 30, oftentimes after they develop an infection like strep throat. is a type of psoriasis that appears as smooth, bright red lesions in the armpit, groin, and other areas with folds of skin. Because these regions of the body are prone to sweating and rubbing, inverse psoriasis can be particularly irritating and hard to treat. is rare but can require immediate treatment or even hospitalization. The lesions look like large “sheets” rather than small spots, as if the area has been burned, and tend to be severely itchy and painful. A flare-up can trigger swelling, infection, and increased heart rate. Psoriasis is contagious—it’s a genetic, autoimmune disease Psoriasis lesions cannot infect other people; likewise, people can’t catch psoriasis from someone else, whether through touching, sexual contact, or swimming in the same pool. It’s unclear, however, whether a majority of the general public is aware of this fact. In a small 2015 survey in the , about 60% of people said they thought that psoriasis was infectious, while 41% said they thought the lesions looked contagious. If you develop raised red patches with a silvery-white coating over your knees, elbows, lower back, or scalp, you probably have . It’s the most common form of psoriasis, a chronic disease that seriously speeds the process by which skin cells mature and reach the skin’s surface. Because the rate at which old cells are shed remains unchanged, the new cells stack up and become thickened patches covered by the dead, flaking skin.The precise cause of psoriasis isn’t known. “Something is happening at the level of the T-cell, one of the immune cells in our body, that signals the skin to overproduce,” explains Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine. Heredity is definitely a factor—about one-third of sufferers have a close family member who’s also affected, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. can begin at any age—“You can come out of the womb with it or develop it late in life,” says Dr. Gohara—but most people get it between ages 15 and 30. Three-quarters of people who are going to develop psoriasis have it by age 40.Psoriasis can come and go with varying degrees of severity, and attacks may be triggered by emotional stress, skin injury, and physical illness. There’s no cure for the condition, but many treatments are available, and your dermatologist will chose the right one based on the degree of your psoriasis and where on the body it occurs. | Credit: Suze777/Getty Images The simplest answer to the question of what causes psoriasis: your genetics. An estimated 10% of people inherit at least one of the genes that can cause psoriasis. (There are as many as 25 genetic mutations that make someone more likely to develop psoriasis.) But only 2% to 3% of people will develop the disease, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation (NSF). Therefore, researchers believe that psoriasis is caused by a certain combination of genes that spring into action after being exposed to a trigger. Common triggers include stress, an infection (like strep throat), and certain medications (like lithium). Cold, dry weather and sunburns may also trigger psoriasis flares. When someone with psoriasis is exposed to a trigger, their immune system scrambles to defend itself by producing T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps ward off infections and other diseases. With psoriasis, however, T cell-production goes into overdrive, eventually causing inflammation and faster-than-usual growth of skin cells, leading to psoriasis symptoms. The signs and symptoms of psoriasis vary depending on the type and severity of the skin disease. Some people may have one form of psoriasis, while others can have two or more. . People with plaque psoriasis can experience a flare-up of red, raised patches. These patches can be itchy or painful or crack and bleed. . Often seen in plaque psoriasis, scales are patches of built-up dead skin cells that have a silvery-white sheen. They often appear on top of raised, red patches that can be itchy or painful or crack and bleed. People with plaque psoriasis can experience a flare-up of symptoms on their scalp, knees, elbows, and lower back. . A characteristic of pustular psoriasis, these white pus-filled blisters can cluster on the hands and feet or spread to most of the body. After the pustules appear, scaling usually follows. In people with von Zumbusch psoriasis, the pustules will dry after 24 to 48 hours, leaving the skin with a “glazed” appearance. In people with palmoplantar pustulosis, the pustules will turn brown, then peel, then start to crust. Seen in inverse psoriasis, these very red lesions are smooth and shiny and are found in parts of the body with folds of skin, like the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. Because these lesions tend to be located in sensitive areas, they are prone to irritation from rubbing or sweating. . A telltale sign of guttate psoriasis, these small, red spots are shaped like drops and usually appear on the torso, arms, and legs. In most cases, they aren’t as thick as plaque psoriasis lesions, but they can be widespread, numbering into the hundreds. About 50% of people with psoriasis experience changes to their finger or toenails, including pitting (the appearance of holes in the nail), thickening, and discoloration, according to the NPF. 10 Things Your Nails Can Tell You About Your Health There are no special diagnostic tests for psoriasis. Instead, a psoriasis diagnosis is made by a dermatologist, who will examine the skin lesions visually. In some cases, psoriasis can resemble other types of , like , so doctors may want to confirm the results with a biopsy. That involves removing some of the skin and looking at the sample under a microscope, where psoriasis tends to appear “thicker” than eczema. Doctors may also take a detailed record of your family’s medical history: About one-third of people with psoriasis have a first-degree relative who also has the condition. Health care providers may also try to pinpoint psoriasis triggers by asking whether their patients have been under stress lately or are taking a new medication. There’s no one-size-fits-all psoriasis treatment, and the medications that work for some people may not work for others. The goal, however, is the same for everyone: to find psoriasis medications that can reduce or eliminate psoriasis symptoms. Here are some of the most commonly prescribed therapies. . A first-line form of therapy for mild to moderate conditions, topicals (in psoriasis cream, gel, and ointment forms) are applied directly to the skin in the hopes of reducing inflammation and slowing down skin cell growth. Some are available over-the-counter, like products with salicylic acid and coal tar as active ingredients, while others, like calcipotriene (a form of vitamin D3) and tazarotene (a vitamin A derivative known as a retinoid) are available by prescription. There are also special psoriasis shampoos that can help clear up scalp psoriasis; many contain coal tar and salicylic acid. . Also called light therapy, exposes a person’s skin to ultraviolet light, which is thought to kill the immune cells contributing to psoriasis. Phototherapy can be administered in the form of UVB rays, a combination of UVA and UVB, or UVA rays alongside an oral or topical medication called psoralen (a treatment called PUVA). The catch: These treatments have to be done in a doctor’s office, a psoriasis clinic, or with a specialized phototherapy unit and usually require several visits, which can become expensive. Because indoor tanning increases the risk of (especially ), it’s not considered a safe substitute for phototherapy under medical supervision. . If topical medications and phototherapy don’t work, doctors may recommend taking systemics, or prescription drugs that affect the entire body. These meds can be taken orally or via an injection, and include cyclosporine (which suppresses immune system activity and slows skin cell growth), acitretin (an oral retinoid, or form of vitamin A, that slows down the speed at which skin cells grow and shed), and methotrexate (a medication that was originally used as a cancer treatment, but can also slow down the growth of skin cells). . Biologics contain human or animal proteins and can block certain immune cells that are involved in psoriasis. They’re usually recommended for people with moderate to severe psoriasis and are administered via an injection or IV infusion. There are currently three types of biologics that can help treat psoriasis, all of which block immune system chemical messengers that promote inflammation called cytokines. The three types of biologics block the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 12, interleukin 23, and interleukin 17-A (IL-12, IL-23, and IL-17A, respectively). . Some alternative therapies—including acupuncture, massage, and Reiki—might help relieve certain psoriasis symptoms, like pain. They may also help control stress, a common psoriasis trigger. Other stress-relievers include meditation, mindfulness, exercise, yoga, and Tai Chi. Always talk to your doctor before beginning any alternative psoriasis treatments. There is currently no cure for psoriasis. As a chronic autoimmune disease, most people with psoriasis will always have it. But it possible to treat the condition. In fact, the right medications and therapies can reduce symptoms and even clear up the skin entirely in some people. More psoriasis treatments may be available in the future. Researchers are currently trying to uncover what causes the lesions on a cellular level and how to prevent flare-ups caused by the immune system. For the millions of Americans who have psoriasis, the skin condition can pose many challenges. Not only can the pain and itching interfere with their ability to sleep or work, but research shows that many people with psoriasis feel unattractive; worse, if they feel self-conscious, they may withdraw from their friends and family and become isolated. People with psoriasis are also twice as likely to be depressed as those who don’t have the skin condition, according to the NPF, and they can also be more likely to have suicidal thoughts. If you’re feeling a loss of energy, lack of interest in once-enjoyable activities, or an inability to focus, talk to your doctor about whether you may have or should see a mental health specialist. An estimated 30% of people with psoriasis will also develop , a disease which causes joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Having psoriasis may also make people more likely to develop , , and , according to the NPF. There are many ways that people living with psoriasis can manage the condition. This includes avoiding , , and unhealthy foods. Although there is no “psoriasis diet,” per se, eating healthy meals may help you feel better. You should also keep tabs on whether your joints feel stiff or sore or whether your nails are pitting or turning yellow—two possible signs of . Recognizing these symptoms–and getting treatment–can help prevent further damage to the joints. Anyone can develop psoriasis—even the most beautiful people on the planet. And as people who are paid to look flawless, many celebrities with psoriasis say that the skin condition delivers a serious blow to their self-esteem and fear that it can interfere with their careers. In 2011, revealed her psoriasis diagnosis on an episode of . Although her mother, Kris Jenner, was diagnosed with psoriasis at the age of 30, Kim was surprised to learn that she had the skin condition too. “My career is doing ad campaigns and swimsuit photo shoots,” she said in the episode. “People don’t understand the pressure on me to look perfect. Imagine what the tabloids would do to me if they saw all these spots.” Model and actress also has psoriasis, which she struggled to manage while runway modeling. She told London’s in an interview that people would paint her body with foundation to cover up the patches. “It was every single show,” she said. “People would put on gloves and not want to touch me.” Other models also struggle with psoriasis, like , who won in 2006. Partly in response to the hurtful tabloid headlines that called out the lesions on her legs, she posted , saying, “I knew I didn’t want anyone capturing my psoriasis in a way that wasn’t empowering.” Other include golfer Phil Michelson, country singer LeAnn Rimes, and pop star Cyndi Lauper.

Normally the immune system protects us from pathogens and disease, but in an allergic reaction the immune system actually causes the problem by trying to do its job too well. An allergic reaction occurs when our immune systems mistakes a substance for a toxic one and initiates a major defense against it. Irritant reactions affect everyone who comes in contact with an irritant, although the degree of irritation will vary depending on the individual. In acute case, symptoms are noticed immediately or within just a few hours. Chronic cases may be delayed reactions from redness, swelling, scaling, and itching to serious, painful chemical burns. Caustic substances are examples of irritants. When the skin is damaged by irritating substances, the immune system springs into actions. It floods the tissue with water, trying to dilute the irritant. This why swelling occurs.

You may also wish to have treatment for cosmetic reasons.

Maybe you fret over your hair type, pick at your split ends or look for those dry flakes that cascade off when you scratch your head. Not everyone has that Hollywood hair with a perfect scalp to match. One thing's for certain, though, if you want great hair, you'll need a great scalp, too. Before you jump into all the various scalp treatments out there today, there's one myth that you should know about right off the bat. If you enjoy sitting at the hair salon getting a good scalp massage as part of your treatment, you might be wondering whether such a luxury could help your scalp problems or make them magically disappear. The fact is that no amount of scalp massage will cure your scalp problems. You can't massage away an oily scalp or massage up some extra oil production to treat a dry scalp. However, a good one can increase the blood flow to your head and release hormones that can improve your mood [source: ]. So don't ditch the scalp massage just yet; instead, think of it more as an add-on at the hair salon that can raise your spirits but not cure your dry or oily scalp by itself. One of the best ways to help a scalp that has excessive dryness or oiliness -- or other chronic skin conditions -- is with a scalp treatment. You might need to see a doctor for help with more severe conditions, but many of these treatments are very accessible and can easily become part of your daily routine. If you have an oily scalp, for example, read on to learn about what you can do to keep your scalp -- and as a result, your hair -- from feeling greasy. The math seems simple: An oily scalp leads to oily hair. But if you're fighting excessive oiliness on your scalp, relief might be as close as your shower. One of the most readily available treatments comes in the form of a cream or medicated shampoo. When shopping, look for shampoos containing ingredients such as coal tar, zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide or salicylic acid. Curious as to how these medicated products can cut down the oil production on your scalp? Those with coal tar and selenium sulfide work to slow down the death and regeneration of skin cells on your scalp [source: ]. These ingredients might also help to reduce inflammation and itching. Sometimes a fungus on your scalp can contribute to excessive oily conditions, and products with selenium sulfide or zinc pyrithione can also help to control any oiliness caused by fungi. Products containing salicylic acid, which is commonly used in treatments for acne caused by oily skin, will reduce the amount of oil on your scalp. Once you've selected your product, make sure you work the cream or shampoo into your scalp. These treatments work only if they are on your scalp, so give some extra attention to working the medication all the way up to your skin. Once you've built up a good lather, let the product sit for three to five minutes before rinsing it out thoroughly [source: ]. Because some agents that reduce scalp oiliness could dry out your hair, you might want to follow up with a conditioner on the ends of your hair to add back moisture. If your scalp problem is on the opposite end of the spectrum and a lack of oil is what's bothering you, then read on to find out how to treat dry scalp. A common misconception is that dandruff is a result of a dry, flaky scalp. Although that's true, dandruff can also happen to an irritated, oily scalp. To treat dandruff for an oily scalp, look for shampoos that contain salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione or coal tar [source: ]. Just as an oily scalp leads to oily hair, a dry scalp often results in hair that looks dull and lifeless, not to mention skin that is itchy and flaky. But if you are dealing with a dry scalp, treatment might also be as close as your shampoo bottle. When treating dry scalp, look for products containing coal tar, salicylic lactic acid or urea [source: ]. We've already discussed how coal tar reduces the regeneration of skin cells, which can lead to fewer flakes and less dry skin. Salicylic acid works in much the same way and can be used along with coal tar for tough scalp problems [source: ]. Shampoos with salicylic acid will soften scaly patches of dry skin and make them easier to shampoo away; however, because salicylic acid can dry out your skin, be sure to use a moisturizing product along with it. Also, products containing urea and lactic acid will work in much the same way to reduce any flakes or scaly patches caused by excessive dryness. Again, be sure to work product into the scalp and let it sit for three to five minutes before rinsing for maximum effectiveness. Additionally, shampoos, creams or foams with corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, can provide relief [source: ]. But be sure to check with your doctor before using a steroid-based product. If you find yourself still fighting chronic scalp problems, and nothing you've done so far has worked, read on to find out what you can do next. It might sound unpleasant, but scalp psoriasis is nothing more than red patches of itchy, dry skin that build up on your scalp. Occasionally, the patches might bleed, burn or be sore to the touch. If scalp psoriasis is a problem, try hair treatments that contain coal tar, salicylic acid or corticosteroids. Most of these products are available in over-the-counter shampoos or creams [source: ]. So you've been there, done that, and nothing has worked. But before you decide to give up, there are still a few other options to try. First off, your dermatologist or general doctor can prescribe stronger shampoos and topical creams that might reduce the amount of oil or help counteract the itchy, dry pain of your scalp. These shampoos and topical creams might contain some of the same ingredients as over-the-counter formulas, but in a more potent strength. Prescription treatments might include hydrocortisone creams, steroid creams or coal tar shampoos. [source: ]. Another option is vitamin D3 analogs, which are available as prescription strength topical treatments for conditions that cause dry, patchy skin. Vitamin D3 treatments might take longer to work than treatments containing steroids, but some versions of this treatment can be safely used for up to a year [source: ]. Your doctor might also prescribe topical creams and gels such as tazarotene, a Vitamin A derivative, or anthralin in order to give you more fighting power than medicated over-the-counter shampoos [source: ]. Another alternative, especially for scalp psoriasis, is to use phototherapy, or light therapy. With this treatment, ultraviolet light rays are applied to the scalp or skin to help clear up moderate to severe psoriasis [source: ]. Several treatments might be necessary over the course of a few weeks before you see results. For more information on treating scalp problems, click on the links on the next page. This common skin condition causes to patchy areas of thick flaky scales that are either white or yellow in color. These flakes are often attached to the hair shaft and can take on a crust-like appearance. In infants, this disorder is commonly known as cradle cap [source: ]. If you are dealing with this condition, try a shampoo with ketoconazole or selenium sulfide. Is the sodium lauryl sulfate in my shampoo killing me? American Academy of Dermatology.

a6580089-9780-43c1-acd8-a9e3ec24fca5,"— A tingling, burning, or just plain painful sensation when you’re pulling your hair back isn’t only uncomfortable — it can be confusing. The sharp pain might seem like it’s coming from your hairs themselves, but it’s actually coming from nerves in your scalp. Scalp pain that comes from moving your hair has several possible causes. The good news is that it’s treatable. This article will cover the basics of everything you need to know if you’re having frequent, mysterious pain when you move your hair. Scalp pain when you’re repositioning hair can take the form of: describe it as the feeling of having your hair combed or brushed aggressively, like a scraping or pulling feeling. Since moving your hair triggers the pain, it’s only natural that many people assume your hair is what’s the pain, too. But since hair strands don’t have any nerves in them, it follows that it’s the underlying scalp that’s experiencing pain when you tug, pull, or even lightly stimulate the hair strands attached to it. Scalp pain that occurs when you move your hair can be a symptom of other health conditions, such as: Scalp pain starts with irritation or inflammation of the skin on your head. This irritation or inflammation can have several different causes, including: Your options for treating scalp pain are highly dependent on the cause. If pain when you touch or move your hair is a regular symptom for you, you’ll probably need a dermatologist’s help to determine why it’s happening. Scalp pain that appears suddenly and doesn’t have any other symptoms might be a result of an allergic reaction, particularly a reaction to a new hair product. The first line of treatment may be to give your hair a rest from new products for a day or two, and rinse your scalp in cool water instead of using harsh shampoos. Don’t apply essential oils or any other product meant to condition hair and the scalp until you’re certain an allergic reaction has passed. If your scalp appears to be flaking or peeling, try gently brushing your scalp when it’s dry with a soft-bristled brush. If scales or flakes come out of your hair, it could be your first indication that you’re dealing with eczema, psoriasis, or seborrheic dermatitis on your scalp. In cases when your scalp pain occurs during a headache, the two conditions could be related. An over-the-counter pain reliever, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, may relieve your symptoms until the pain subsides. Folliculitis is an infection or inflammation of your hair follicles. An antibacterial cleanser or antibiotic is sometimes needed to clear up the infection. In some cases, your doctor will need to take a bacterial culture from a pustule to confirm a diagnosis. This will also help them prescribe the correct treatment. It’s hard to know what will trigger scalp pain before it occurs. Once you’ve had this symptom, there are things you can do to minimize the amount of pain you feel in the future: Get treatment for any skin condition, such as eczema and psoriasis, even if it doesn’t usually affect your scalp. Carefully read product labels to avoid triggering allergic reactions on your scalp. Gently brush your hair, and wash it with lukewarm, cleansing water every other day. Avoid using sticky, adhesive-based hair products that contain alcohol, as they can strip your hair of moisture. Examples include many gels and hair spray products. Keep your hair and scalp healthy by following the hair hygiene tips recommended by the . If you often have pain on your scalp from moving your hair, make an appointment with a dermatologist. Also see your doctor if you experience any of the following on your scalp: Scalp pain when you move your hair isn’t uncommon. There are several possible causes. Some of the causes are temporary and don’t need any treatment, but many of them do. Painful scalp itching, scaling, and burning could mean you have an infection or a chronic skin condition. Sometimes these symptoms can also be related to other disorders, such as hair loss disorders. Speak to your doctor if you’re feeling pain on your scalp that isn’t going away. — Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT Scalp pain may be caused by a number of medical conditions, including dandruff, skin disorders, lice infestations, and infections.

ff31591b-0f36-460f-932b-f57422d0ee62,"Skin cancer — the abnormal growth of skin cells — most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. There are three major types of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by limiting or avoiding exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Checking your skin for suspicious changes can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages. Early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment. Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women. But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day — your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area. Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. When melanoma occurs in people with dark skin tones, it's more likely to occur in areas not normally exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your neck or face. A bleeding or scabbing sore that heals and returns Most often, squamous cell carcinoma occurs on sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your face, ears and hands. People with darker skin are more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that aren't often exposed to the sun. Melanoma can develop anywhere on your body, in otherwise normal skin or in an existing mole that becomes cancerous. Melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men. In women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs. In both men and women, melanoma can occur on skin that hasn't been exposed to the sun. Melanoma can affect people of any skin tone. In people with darker skin tones, melanoma tends to occur on the palms or soles, or under the fingernails or toenails. A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus This rare form of skin cancer develops in the skin's blood vessels and causes red or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes. Kaposi sarcoma mainly occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as people with AIDS, and in people taking medications that suppress their natural immunity, such as people who've undergone organ transplants. Other people with an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma include young men living in Africa or older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish heritage. Merkel cell carcinoma causes firm, shiny nodules that occur on or just beneath the skin and in hair follicles. Merkel cell carcinoma is most often found on the head, neck and trunk. This uncommon and aggressive cancer originates in the oil glands in the skin. Sebaceous gland carcinomas — which usually appear as hard, painless nodules — can develop anywhere, but most occur on the eyelid, where they're frequently mistaken for other eyelid problems. Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any changes to your skin that worry you. Not all skin changes are caused by skin cancer. Your doctor will investigate your skin changes to determine a cause. Skin cancer occurs when errors (mutations) occur in the DNA of skin cells. The mutations cause the cells to grow out of control and form a mass of cancer cells. Skin cancer begins in your skin's top layer — the epidermis. The epidermis is a thin layer that provides a protective cover of skin cells that your body continually sheds. The epidermis contains three main types of cells: lie just below the outer surface and function as the skin's inner lining. which produce new skin cells, sit beneath the squamous cells. — which produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its normal color — are located in the lower part of your epidermis. Melanocytes produce more melanin when you're in the sun to help protect the deeper layers of your skin. Where your skin cancer begins determines its type and your treatment options. Much of the damage to DNA in skin cells results from ultraviolet (UV) radiation found in sunlight and in the lights used in tanning beds. But sun exposure doesn't explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of skin cancer, such as being exposed to toxic substances or having a condition that weakens your immune system. Factors that may increase your risk of skin cancer include: Anyone, regardless of skin color, can get skin cancer. However, having less pigment (melanin) in your skin provides less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair and light-colored eyes, and you freckle or sunburn easily, you're much more likely to develop skin cancer than is a person with darker skin. Having had one or more blistering sunburns as a child or teenager increases your risk of developing skin cancer as an adult. Sunburns in adulthood also are a risk factor. Anyone who spends considerable time in the sun may develop skin cancer, especially if the skin isn't protected by sunscreen or clothing. Tanning, including exposure to tanning lamps and beds, also puts you at risk. A tan is your skin's injury response to excessive UV radiation. People who live in sunny, warm climates are exposed to more sunlight than are people who live in colder climates. Living at higher elevations, where the sunlight is strongest, also exposes you to more radiation. People who have many moles or abnormal moles called dysplastic nevi are at increased risk of skin cancer. These abnormal moles — which look irregular and are generally larger than normal moles — are more likely than others to become cancerous. If you have a history of abnormal moles, watch them regularly for changes. Having skin lesions known as actinic keratoses can increase your risk of developing skin cancer. These precancerous skin growths typically appear as rough, scaly patches that range in color from brown to dark pink. They're most common on the face, head and hands of fair-skinned people whose skin has been sun damaged. If one of your parents or a sibling has had skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of the disease. If you developed skin cancer once, you're at risk of developing it again. People with weakened immune systems have a greater risk of developing skin cancer. This includes people living with HIV/AIDS and those taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant. People who received radiation treatment for skin conditions such as eczema and acne may have an increased risk of skin cancer, particularly basal cell carcinoma. Exposure to certain substances, such as arsenic, may increase your risk of skin cancer. Most skin cancers are preventable. To protect yourself, follow these skin cancer prevention tips: For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy. You absorb UV radiation year-round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays. Avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer. Sunscreens don't filter out all harmful UV radiation, especially the radiation that can lead to melanoma. But they play a major role in an overall sun protection program. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. Use a generous amount of sunscreen on all exposed skin, including your lips, the tips of your ears, and the backs of your hands and neck. Sunscreens don't provide complete protection from UV rays. So cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than a baseball cap or visor does. Some companies also sell photoprotective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. Don't forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV radiation — UVA and UVB rays. Lights used in tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer. Some common prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including antibiotics, can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the side effects of any medications you take. If they increase your sensitivity to sunlight, take extra precautions to stay out of the sun in order to protect your skin. Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor. Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine your chest and trunk, and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Examine both the front and back of your legs, and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks. Any use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.

Percival, Jenna Friedenthal, Pavel Krejci, Joan T. Richtsmeier, David L. Huso, Michael Rendl, Ethylin Wang Jabs Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome (BSS) is a human genetic disorder characterized by skin and skull abnormalities. BSS is caused by mutations in the FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2), but the molecular mechanisms that induce skin and skull abnormalities are unclear. We developed a mouse model of BSS harboring a FGFR2 Y394C mutation and identified p38 MAPK as an important signaling pathway mediating these abnormalities. Fgfr2 mice exhibited epidermal hyperplasia and premature closure of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis) due to abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation. We found ligand-independent phosphorylation of FGFR2 and activation of p38 signaling in mutant skin and calvarial tissues. Treating Fgfr2 mice with a p38 kinase inhibitor attenuated skin abnormalities by reversing cell proliferation and differentiation to near normal levels. This study reveals the pleiotropic effects of the FGFR2 Y394C mutation evidenced by cutis gyrata, acanthosis nigricans, and craniosynostosis and provides a useful model for investigating the molecular mechanisms of skin and skull development. The demonstration of a pathogenic role for p38 activation may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies for BSS and related conditions, such as acanthosis nigricans or craniosynostosis.

c3597cec-764e-4d79-b738-209363b7b9a5,"St. John's University, College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States, with most cases considered preventable. The incidence of skin cancer has steadily been increasing. In the last three decades, incidence rates have risen five-fold. It has been estimated that one in five Americans will be diagnosed with skin cancer in their lifetime, with an estimated 9,500 newly diagnosed cases per day. Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (also known as nonmelanoma skin cancer), and malignant melanoma are the most common types of skin cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC) are curable forms of skin cancer but are generally expensive to treat and can permanently damage the appearance of the skin. Basal cell carcinomas account for about 80% of all NMSC, while squamous cell carcinomas account for about 20%. In 2012, there were an estimated 5.4 million cases of NMSC diagnosed, although this number may underrepresent the true incidence; NMSC is not consistently reported to cancer registries. Research has indicated that the incidence of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma increased by 145% and 263%, respectively, between 1976-1984 and 2000-2010. The 5-year survival rates of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are 100% and 90%, respectively. The high survival rate of NMSC is attributed to early detection and timely treatment. To maintain a good prognosis for high-risk NMSC patients, it is important to emphasize early detection.  Melanoma, on the other hand, has been noted to be more dangerous and have a greater risk of mortality. Although it accounts for about 1% of all skin cancer diagnoses, melanoma is responsible for the most skin cancer deaths, accounting for more than 9,000 deaths annually. However, from 2013 to 2017, melanoma-related deaths decreased by almost 6% in adults older than age 50 years and by 7% in those younger than age 50 years. Melanomas can be classified using the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system to differentiate the progression of the cancer . Once TNM factors have been identified, a melanoma is assigned a stage ranging from stage 0 to stage IV. Stage I and II melanomas are localized, while stage III melanomas have regional lymph node involvement. Stage IV melanomas have distant metastasis. Approximately 85% of patients with melanoma will present with localized disease at the time of diagnosis. Regional disease accounts for almost 9% of patients at time of diagnosis, with distant disease accounting for an estimated 4%. As melanoma progresses through its various stages, the survival rates drastically decrease. The 5-year survival rate is dependent upon the stage of the melanoma at time of diagnosis. Patients diagnosed with localized disease have a 99% 5-year relative survival rate, while those diagnosed with regional disease have a 65% 5-year survival rate, and those with distant disease have a 25% 5-year survival rate. This decrease in survival rate illustrates the importance of early detection and treatment to prevent the progression of the cancer. There are many individual factors and determinants that may predispose a patient to skin cancer Certain genetic and familial characteristics such as skin type, eye color, or hair color may influence a patient’s risk; those with Fitzpatrick skin types I and II have the highest risk, as do those with blue, gray, or green eyes, and blond or red hair. Skin cancers also appear to occur more frequently in males; it is projected that in 2020 an estimated 60,190 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in men compared with 20,160 women. Because skin cancer is highly associated with sun exposure, the incidence also increases with age; the median age of diagnosis for melanomas is about 60 years. The incidence of skin cancer also varies with ethnicity. The risk is 20 times greater for the white population than it is for populations with darker skin, including black, Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander populations. Family history and mole patterns, including changed or persistently changing moles, are additional risk factors for melanoma. Exposure to substances containing arsenic, coal, and tar, infection with human papillomavirus, immunosuppressive therapies, and chronic skin inflammatory diseases are known to warrant a risk for nonmelanoma cancers. The overwhelming majority of NMSC and melanomas, however, originate from overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which damages the integrity of cells and results in the erratic formation of growths on the skin. Basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas both develop predominantly on areas such as the face, neck, ears, scalp, back, or hands, which is indicative of continuous exposure to the sun. Cumulatively, 90% of all NMSC are caused by UV radiation. Melanomas tend to develop as the result of intense, intermittent sun exposure that can lead to burning. This degree of exposure is usually caused by tanning beds and other artificial tanning methods using intense radiation. The signs and symptoms of skin cancer differ based on the type of skin cancer; however, all skin cancers present initially as a skin abnormality. These abnormalities can occur as new skin pigmentation or moles on any part of the body or changes in an existing mole. Any unusual changes in the appearance of a skin abnormality should be evaluated by a dermatologist for further testing.  Melanoma often presents initially as a skin abnormality with distinct characteristics or changes in appearance of an existing abnormality or mole. These changes can be identified using the “ABCDE” mnemonic: asymmetry, border, color, diameter, and evolving. The mole of a melanoma patient is often characterized as being asymmetric. The borders of the mole are uneven, blurred, or notched in appearance. The colors of these moles can range from shades of black, brown, and tan with areas of white, gray, red, or blue. Although the diameter of the mole may be smaller when detected early, melanoma moles can grow to a diameter of greater than 6 mm—the size of a pencil eraser. Lastly, existing moles changing size, shape, color, appearance, or texture can also be clinical presentations of melanoma. The mole can expand and encompass an area of healthy skin without symptoms of pain.   Basal cell carcinomas usually develop in areas of skin that were exposed to the sun, most commonly in the head and neck region. Nodular basal cell carcinomas, representing almost 80% of cases, usually present as a pearly, waxy, or translucent papule with small telangiectatic vessels on its surface. Pigmented basal cell carcinoma usually has a nodular pattern and appears as a brown, blue, or black lesion, which is due to the presence of melanin; this nodule is often mistaken for melanoma. Superficial basal cell carcinomas most commonly occur on the trunk and usually present as slightly scaly macules, patches, or thin plaques that are light red to pink in color. The morpheaform type usually presents as a smooth, flesh-colored, or very light pink papule or plaque, often with indistinct borders.  Squamous cell carcinoma can develop on any cutaneous surface including the trunk, extremities, oral mucosa, periungual skin, and anogenital areas, but it typically occurs on the head and neck, most frequently involving the lower lip, forehead, and scalp. Similar to basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma may appear as a sore that does not heal or as a recurrent sore. It can also manifest as rough, scaly red patches with irregular borders, raised lumps with indentation in the center, wart-like growth, a crusty and easily bleeding sore, or an itchy/irritable growth.   Because most skin cancers are caused by overexposure to UV radiation, the most effective preventative measure is to decrease skin exposure to radiation. Some of these preventive methods include limiting or avoiding direct exposure to sunlight when the rays are strongest (10 am to 4 pm); avoiding sunbathing/sun lamps/tanning beds; wearing sun-protective clothing such as a wide-brimmed hat and long-sleeved shirts; and applying the appropriate sunscreen for optimal protection. The two most common types of UV radiation that contribute to the risk of skin cancer are UVA and UVB. UVA radiation has a longer wavelength and accounts for 95% of the UV radiation that reaches the earth’s surface. Although less intense compared with UVB radiation, UVA radiation is able to penetrate deeper into the skin, causing genetic cell damage that can lead to skin cancer in the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis layers of the skin. UVA radiation is able to pass through glass and cloud cover, causing aging and/or wrinkling of the skin. Other sources of UVA radiation include tanning beds, which use UVA radiation to produce the tanning effect of the skin, thus putting users at a higher risk of developing skin cancer.  Compared with UVA, UVB radiation has a shorter wavelength and is often filtered, due to its inability to pass through glass and cloud cover. UVB radiation is unable to penetrate deeper into the skin, exerting most of its damage on the epidermis and dermis layer of the skin. UVB exposure is often associated with skin burning and blistering (in severe cases). Unlike UVA radiation, UVB radiation’s intensity fluctuates based on the degree of intensity of the sun’s rays and can be avoided by limiting exposure to sunlight at its peak intensity. It is important to apply a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen prior to expected exposure to UV radiation. Early sunscreen products protected the skin from UVB radiation only and not UVA radiation. However, after studies demonstrated the damage caused by UVA radiation, sunscreen manufacturers incorporated a broad-spectrum sunscreen to provide both UVB and UVA protection.  The sun protection factor (SPF) of a sunscreen is a measurement of the sunscreen’s ability to protect the skin from UVB radiation, not UVA. Each SPF is a factor of the time it takes for an individual’s skin to redden (without sunscreen protection) upon constant exposure to UV radiation. For example, if it takes 15 minutes for a person’s skin to turn red upon continuous exposure to sunlight, applying an SPF 30 sunscreen allows the skin to be exposed for 450 (30 x 15 minutes) minutes before it starts to turn red from continuous sunlight exposure. By applying sunscreen prior to going out on a sunny day, the skin has an additional barrier that protects it from the harmful effects of UVB radiation. Sunscreens should be applied every 2 hours to maintain skin protection.  In the past, some sunscreen products have been labeled as “waterproof.” This labeling implies that individuals using a waterproof sunscreen product would not need to reapply sunscreen after swimming or other contact with water or sweating. The FDA has prohibited the use of on sunscreen products because the term “overstated the effectiveness” of sunscreen upon exposure to water. However, sunscreen products can be labeled as water-resistant or very water-resistant, depending on the effectiveness of the ingredients in prolonging time to reapplication of sunscreen after exposure to water or sweat. A rating of 40 or 80 on water-resistant sunscreen products indicates the duration of effectiveness of the sunscreen while swimming or sweating. A rating of 40 indicates that the sunscreen is effective for 40 minutes while swimming or sweating, and should be reapplied after 40 minutes. “Very water-resistant” labeling is indicated with a rating of 80 and remains effective after 80 minutes of swimming or intense sweating. Sunscreen should be reapplied 40 to 80 minutes after swimming or sweating, or immediately after towel-drying. It is important to help patients select the right sunscreen product to provide the optimal barrier against UVA and UVB radiation in order to reduce the risk of skin cancer. Everyone should select a broad-spectrum sunscreen to provide protection against both types of harmful ultraviolet radiation. Individuals who have a fair complexion and are easily reddened upon exposure to sunlight should select a sunscreen product with an SPF 30 or higher. If a person expects to sweat throughout his or her activity or expects to swim, then he or she should select a sunscreen that is water-resistant or very water-resistant, depending on the length of the activity. For maximum protection, the American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a water-resistant, broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Creams are best for dry skin and use on the face, while gels are good for hairy areas. Effective education about skin cancer and routine skin self-examination is crucial to preventing the progression of skin cancer, as most melanomas are detected in an early stage through self-screening. Most skin cancers present as a skin abnormality anywhere on the body, even in areas that were not exposed to the sun. Performing an examination of the common areas in which skin cancer can present, such as the face, scalp, trunk, torso, legs, and arms, with a full-length body mirror and a hand mirror allows for a thorough check on any new or unusual growth. Aside from the common body parts, individuals should also examine their fingernails, toenails, hands, toes, and mucosal membranes, because these are also locations in which new growth can occur. Any unusual or suspicious changes or new lesions on the skin or a sore that has not healed within 2 weeks should be reported to a healthcare provider or dermatologist for further evaluation. Pharmacists have the opportunity to provide education about UV radiation, skin cancer, and modifiable risk factors, promote skin self-examination, encourage patients to reduce sun exposure, and assist patients with appropriate selection and use of sunscreen products . When providing education to patients about skin cancer, pharmacists may evaluate patients and inform them of any risk factors they may have that would warrant concern regarding the risk of skin cancer. Pharmacists may also discuss the dangers of tanning, whether it involves prolonged exposure to natural sunlight or using a tanning bed. Such pharmacist-patient interactions enable patients to make more informed decisions regarding their sun exposure and using the right sunscreen to protect their skin. Skin cancer can happen at any stage in life and affects both men and women. Approximately one in five Americans are expected to develop skin cancer in their lifetime. While nonmelanomas are generally treatable if detected early, melanomas are more dangerous. It is estimated that in 2020, there will be 100,350 cases of melanoma diagnosed in the United States with 6,850 people expected to die from it. Genetic factors such as having lighter hair color, skin tone, or eyes may increase your risk of skin cancer. But most cases are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. By effectively and appropriately using sunscreens that cover both UVA and UVB radiation with a sun-protection factor (SPF) of at least 15, the risk of developing skin cancer can be greatly reduced.  The symptoms of skin cancer generally start with the development of a pigmentation or mole on the skin, or the change in color or structure of an existing mole. These abnormalities could also be painful, irritating, or begin to bleed. Any change in color, structure, or integrity of the skin that does not improve on its own should be evaluated by a dermatologist. Although a diagnosis of skin cancer requires screening, screening processes are simple and only require the identification of an unusual or uncomfortable abnormality of the skin. It is recommended that individuals perform annual self-examinations to identify the presence of any new marks or pigmentations that could be cancerous. To screen for skin cancer, you should first perform a self-examination of your entire body and look for any abnormalities. You can conduct a self-examination at home using a full-body mirror to examine any unusual or new formations of the skin, and a hand mirror for locations that are not easily visible. If a notable growth is identified, you should speak to your dermatologist about further screening. A dermatologist will likely examine the suspected growth, and possibly perform a biopsy or dermoscopy for further analysis.

Lithium — codes and concepts 85899009, 68852009, 290802009, 292276005, 295831006 Lithium is a chemical element and the lightest of the alkali metals. As it is highly reactive and flammable, it exists in nature in compounds. Lithium salts are used therapeutically in the treatment of mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and depression. In New Zealand, lithium carbonate (a lithium salt) is fully subsidised and can be prescribed as 250 mg capsules, 250 mg or 400 mg tablets or 400 mg modified release tablets. Trade names include Lithicarb FC and Priadel. It is best taken with food to prevent nausea. Prevention and treatment of mania, hypomania and depression in bipolar disorder Prevention and treatment of unipolar depression Combination therapy with other antidepressants for the treatment of depression. Lithium has been used for over 60 years and is a mainstay in both prevention and treatment of bipolar disorder. Many -controlled trials have shown its in reducing the frequency and severity of both the manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder. It has also been shown to reduce the risk of suicide and death compared to placebo. If used for acute mania and hypomania, patients will experience a effect within 6–10 days. When used for depression, there is a 6–8-week delay in its effect. Used for prevention, it can take 6–12 months before the full therapeutic effect is achieved. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, which means there is a small difference between doses that are effective for treatment and doses. Because of this, regular blood tests are needed to check lithium levels. As lithium is excreted from the body through the kidneys, caution is required in patients with failure, as they are more likely to suffer from lithium accumulation and . The adverse effects of lithium are usually dose- and occur when serum lithium levels are above therapeutic levels.  Nausea, vomiting, anorexia and diarrhoea are more common in the initial stages of lithium therapy when serum lithium levels are not yet stable. At therapeutic levels, lithium can cause a fine hand tremor, muscle weakness and rarely, extrapyramidal features. Tremors may be treated with a beta-blocker.

Topical lithium salts are useful in the treatment of . It is believed to work by reducing the release of fatty acids in the skin. As fatty acids are important for growth in fungi, this reduces the number of fungi on the skin surface. High local concentration of topical lithium also produces an effect, by reducing the production of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids. This allows it to be used to treat other inflammatory skin diseases. Topical lithium is generally well tolerated and does not raise serum lithium levels significantly. It can cause mild skin irritation. [Sponsored content] Yeung CK, Chan HH. Cutaneous Adverse Effects of Lithium: Epidemiology and Management.

Psoriasis tends to present in the but may to chronic . Lithium can also trigger other types of psoriasis, such as , , and . Upon discontinuing lithium, most cases of psoriasis improve within weeks.  is a common inflammatory skin disease characterised by (blocked ). It usually appears several weeks after starting the drug. Lithium-induced acne appears as persistent on an base It usually arises on the limbs and trunk, rather than the face. Tender red pustules characterise folliculitis due to of hair follicles. Lithium-induced folliculitis tends to present on the surfaces of the forearms and legs several months after initiating lithium. Folliculitis self-resolves, even if lithium is continued.  affects 12–19% of patients on long-term lithium therapy. hair loss may present as (round bald patches), or in some cases, alopecia totalis (the loss of all scalp hair). Hair loss may regrow when lithium is discontinued.  hair thinning may be due to lithium-induced hypothyroidism, so thyroid function should be measured. Other skin diseases that have been reported in association with lithium include: Generalised and and other What investigations are undertaken while on lithium? Patients on lithium should undergo regular tests of: Additional tests may be required, depending on the adverse effect observed, for example, or . How are cutaneous adverse effects managed in patients on lithium? For many patients, mood disorder may be more disabling than the skin condition, and lithium’s benefits may outweigh its side effects. Most adverse effects of the skin are mild to moderate in severity, and lithium can be safely continued. The skin condition is treated as usual with local and treatments. If the skin condition is severe and not responding to treatment, reducing the dose of lithium or to stopping it may be considered. Numerous medications have been shown to interact with lithium and either increase or decrease the concentration of lithium in the body. Diuretics, ACE and non-steroidal , which reduce excretion of lithium by the kidneys and can lead to an accumulation of lithium. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel blockers, and neuroleptics should be used with caution. are often used to treat and , which can cause lithium toxicity.   Lithium is if taking another medication that causes QT prolongation, such as domperidone, hydroxyzine, mizolastine, piperaquine and sibutramine. Topical lithium salts are useful in the treatment of . It is believed to work by reducing the release of fatty acids in the skin. As fatty acids are important for growth in fungi, this reduces the number of fungi on the skin surface. High local concentration of topical lithium also produces an effect, by reducing the production of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids. This allows it to be used to treat other inflammatory skin diseases. Topical lithium is generally well tolerated and does not raise serum lithium levels significantly. It can cause mild skin irritation. [Sponsored content] Yeung CK, Chan HH. Cutaneous Adverse Effects of Lithium: Epidemiology and Management.

Onychomycosis does not necessarily require treatment. The taken by mouth appears to be the most effective but is associated with . Trimming the affected nails when on treatment also appears useful. There is a -containing , but it does not work as well. The condition returns in up to half of cases following treatment. Not using old shoes after treatment may decrease the risk of recurrence. It occurs in about 10 percent of the adult population. Older people are more frequently affected. Males are affected more often than females. Onychomycosis represents about half of nail disease. It was first determined to be the result of a fungal infection in 1853 by . The term is from ""nail"", ""fungus"", and the suffix ""functional disease"". The most common symptom of a fungal nail infection is the nail becoming thickened and discoloured: white, black, yellow or green. As the infection progresses the nail can become brittle, with pieces breaking off or coming away from the toe or finger completely. If left untreated, the skin underneath and around the nail can become inflamed and painful. There may also be white or yellow patches on the nailbed or scaly skin next to the nail, and a foul smell. There is usually no pain or other bodily symptoms, unless the disease is severe. People with onychomycosis may experience significant problems due to the appearance of the nail, particularly when fingers – which are always visible – rather than toenails are affected. are fungus-free that sometimes form as a result of a fungus infection in another part of the body. This could take the form of a or in an area of the body that is not infected with the fungus. Dermatophytids can be thought of as an to the fungus. The causative of onychomycosis are all in the and include , (), and nondermatophytic . Dermatophytes are the fungi most commonly responsible for onychomycosis in the temperate western countries; while and nondermatophytic molds are more frequently involved in the tropics and subtropics with a hot and humid climate. When onychomycosis is due to a dermatophyte infection, it is termed tinea unguium. is the most common involved in onychomycosis. Other dermatophytes that may be involved are , , , , , and . A common outdated name that may still be reported by medical laboratories is for . The name is now restricted to the agent of skin infection of the ; though this fungus may be transmitted from and their to humans, it generally infects skin and not nails. Other causative include and nondermatophytic , in particular members of the mold genus (name recently changed to ), , and . species mainly cause fingernail onychomycosis in people whose hands are often submerged in water. mainly affects people in the , though it persists if they later move to areas of . Other molds more commonly affect people older than 60 years, and their presence in the nail reflects a slight weakening in the nail's ability to defend itself against fungal invasion. Aging is the most common risk factor for onychomycosis due to diminished , longer exposure to fungi, and nails which grow more slowly and thicken, increasing susceptibility to infection. Nail fungus tends to affect men more often than women and is associated with a family history of this infection. Other risk factors include heavily, being in a humid or moist environment, , wearing socks and shoes that hinder ventilation and do not absorb perspiration, going barefoot in damp public places such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms, having (tinea pedis), minor skin or nail injury, damaged nail, or other infection, and having diabetes, circulation problems, which may also lead to lower peripheral temperatures on hands and feet, or a weakened immune system. The diagnosis is generally suspected based on the appearance and confirmed by laboratory testing. The four main tests are a , , examination, and . The sample examined is generally nail scrapings or clippings. These being from as far up the nail as possible. Nail plate with appear more useful than culture or direct KOH examination. To reliably identify nondermatophyte molds, several samples may be necessary. There are five classic types of onychomycosis: is the most common form of and is usually caused by , which invades the and the underside of the . (WSO) is caused by fungal invasion of the superficial layers of the nail plate to form ""white islands"" on the plate. It accounts for around 10 percent of onychomycosis cases. In some cases, WSO is a misdiagnosis of ""keratins granulations"" which are not a fungus, but a reaction to nail polish that can cause the nails to have a chalky white appearance. A laboratory test should be performed to confirm. is fungal penetration of the newly formed nail plate through the proximal . It is the least common form of in healthy people, but is found more commonly when the patient is immunocompromised. Endonyx onychomycosis is characterized by along with a lack of or subungual . is species invasion of the fingernails, usually occurring in persons who frequently immerse their hands in water. This normally requires the prior damage of the nail by or . In many cases of suspected nail fungus there is actually no fungal infection, but only nail deformity. To avoid misdiagnosis as , , , nail bed such as , , or , laboratory confirmation may be necessary. Other conditions that may appear similar to onychomycosis include: , normal aging, , and chronic . A person's foot with a fungal nail infection ten weeks into a course of terbinafine oral medication. Note the band of healthy (pink) nail growth behind the remaining infected nails. Most treatments are with medications either topically or by mouth. Avoiding use of antifungal therapy by mouth (e.g. ) in persons without a confirmed infection is recommended because of the possible side effects of that treatment. Topical agents include nail paint, , and . Some topical treatments need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year). Topical amorolfine is applied weekly. Topical ciclopirox results in a cure in 6% to 9% of cases; amorolfine might be more effective. Ciclopirox when used with terbinafine appears to be better than either agent alone. In trials, about 17% of people were cured using efinaconazole as opposed to 4% of people using placebo. Although eficonazole, P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer), and tavaborole are effective at treating fungal infection of toenails, complete cure rates are low. Medications that may be taken by mouth include (76% effective), (60% effective) and (48% effective). They share characteristics that enhance their effectiveness: prompt penetration of the nail and nail bed, and persistence in the nail for months after discontinuation of therapy. by mouth is not recommended due to side effects. Oral terbinafine is better tolerated than itraconazole. For superficial white onychomycosis, systemic rather than topical antifungal therapy is advised. Chemical () or surgical of the affected nail appears to improve outcomes. As of 2014 evidence for is unclear as the evidence is of low quality and varies by type of laser. Tea tree oil is not recommended as a treatment, since it is not effective and can irritate the surrounding skin. According to a 2015 study, the cost in the United States of testing with the (PAS) was about $148. Even if the cheaper is used first and the PAS test is used only if the KOH test is negative, there is a good chance that the PAS will be done (because of either a true or a false negative with the KOH test). But the terbinafine treatment costs only $10 (plus an additional $43 for liver function tests). In conclusion the authors say that terbinafine has a relatively benign adverse effect profile, with liver damage very rare, so it makes more sense cost-wise for the dermatologist to prescribe the treatment without doing the PAS test. (Another option would be to prescribe the treatment only if the potassium hydroxide test is positive, but it gives a false negative in about 20% of cases of fungal infection.) On the other hand, as of 2015 the price of topical (non-oral) treatment with was $2307 per nail, so testing is recommended before prescribing it. Following effective treatment, recurrence is common (10–50%). Nail fungus can be painful and cause permanent damage to nails. It may lead to other serious infections if the immune system is suppressed due to medication, diabetes or other conditions. The risk is most serious for people with diabetes and with immune systems weakened by leukemia or AIDS, or medication after organ transplant. Diabetics have vascular and nerve impairment, and are at risk of , a potentially serious bacterial infection; any relatively minor injury to feet, including a nail fungal infection, can lead to more serious complications. is another rare complication. A 2003 survey of diseases of the foot in 16 European countries found onychomycosis to be the most frequent fungal foot infection and estimates its prevalence at 27%. Prevalence was observed to increase with age. In Canada, the prevalence was estimated to be 6.48%. Onychomycosis affects approximately one-third of and is 56% more frequent in people suffering from . Research suggests that fungi are sensitive to heat, typically 40–60 °C (104–140 °F). The basis of treatment is to try to heat the nail bed to these temperatures in order to disrupt fungal growth. As of 2013 research into laser treatment seems promising. There is also ongoing development in photodynamic therapy, which uses laser or LED light to activate photosensitisers that eradicate fungi.
