Your dentist may recommend if: There’s not enough room for them to grow without causing problems. They’re partially erupted and showing signs of decay. They’re , , or both. Discomfort following wisdom teeth extraction commonly includes: swelling of the jaw, which can make it uncomfortable to open the mouth wide Although far less common, discomfort following wisdom teeth extraction may also include: damage to the jawbone, sinuses, nerves, or nearby teeth , which is caused by losing the postsurgical blood clot that forms in the socket to help the area heal socket infection from trapped food particles or bacteria Following surgery, your dentist will give instructions on managing pain and swelling. They’ll also tell you how to care for your wound, which will most likely include stitches and gauze packing. Talk to your dentist if your pain persists, gets worse, or you have any other concerns. If your wisdom teeth are healthy and positioned correctly, they typically don’t cause any pain. Pain is usually a result of the way the wisdom teeth erupt, such as: If lack of space doesn’t allow your wisdom teeth to break all the way through your gums, it can cause a flap of tissue to remain over the tooth. This flap can lead to pain and swelling in the gum tissue. It can also trap food and bacteria, which can result in a gum infection and pain. If your jaw isn’t large enough to host your wisdom teeth, they may become in your jaw and unable to fully erupt through your bone and gums. Symptoms of partial eruption can include pain and in the area of the impacted wisdom tooth. Your wisdom teeth may come in crooked or facing the wrong direction.

0c93d1e3-20ea-46e6-b62d-c2850a4b4a34,"You have four wisdom teeth (molars), one in each corner of your mouth. These teeth are the last to grow in -- usually when you are between the ages of 17 and 25. This is the time of life called the Age of Wisdom, hence the name wisdom teeth. When there's not enough room in the mouth for a wisdom tooth to break through, it will push or get stuck against another tooth and grow at an angle under the gum. This is called an impacted wisdom tooth, and will cause pain and irritation. If part of an impacted wisdom tooth pushes through the gum, the gum may become sore and swollen. Food particles and bacteria can collect around the impacted wisdom tooth and cause decay. It's very difficult to remove that decay and it will most likely cause an infection. In most cases, an impacted wisdom tooth has to be extracted [source: ]. There are some simple things that can temporarily relieve the pain of an impacted wisdom tooth [source: ]. Rinsing your mouth with a warm saltwater solution by swishing it around for 30 seconds and then spitting it out will help ease the pain around the infected tooth. Rinse this way several times a day, and be sure not to swallow the salt water. Oral numbing medications can be applied to the affected area. Over-the-counter pain relievers may help ease the pain. Chewing gum will gently massage the irritated area. These measures may temporarily relieve the pain. However, your dentist should examine the tooth and decide whether further treatment is necessary.

3972fba7-8172-442d-aa74-0d1ca0e5a375,"Impacted wisdom teeth are third molars at the back of the mouth that don't have enough room to emerge or develop normally. Wisdom teeth are the last adult teeth to come into the mouth (erupt). Most people have four wisdom teeth at the back of the mouth — two on the top, two on the bottom. Impacted wisdom teeth can result in pain, damage to other teeth and other dental problems. In some cases, impacted wisdom teeth may cause no apparent or immediate problems. But because they're hard to clean, they may be more vulnerable to tooth decay and gum disease than other teeth are. Impacted wisdom teeth that cause pain or other dental complications are usually removed. Some dentists and oral surgeons also recommend removing impacted wisdom teeth that don't cause symptoms to prevent future problems. Impacted wisdom teeth don't always cause symptoms. However, when an impacted wisdom tooth becomes infected, damages other teeth or causes other dental problems, you may experience some of these signs or symptoms: See your dentist if you experience symptoms in the area behind your last molar that may be associated with an impacted wisdom tooth. Wisdom teeth (third molars) become impacted because they don't have enough room to come in (erupt) or develop normally. Wisdom teeth usually emerge sometime between the ages of 17 and 25. Some people have wisdom teeth that emerge without any problems and line up with the other teeth behind the second molars. In many cases, however, the mouth is too crowded for third molars to develop normally. These crowded third molars become trapped (impacted). An impacted wisdom tooth may partially emerge so that some of the crown is visible (partially impacted), or it may never break through the gums (fully impacted). Whether partially or fully impacted, the tooth may: Grow at an angle toward the next tooth (second molar) Grow at a right angle to the other teeth, as if the wisdom tooth is ""lying down"" within the jawbone Grow straight up or down like other teeth but stay trapped within the jawbone Impacted wisdom teeth can cause several problems in the mouth: If the wisdom tooth pushes against the second molar, it may damage the second molar or increase the risk of infection in that area. This pressure can also cause problems with crowding of the other teeth or require orthodontic treatment to straighten other teeth. The wisdom tooth develops in a sac within the jawbone. The sac can fill with fluid, forming a cyst that can damage the jawbone, teeth and nerves. Rarely, a tumor — usually noncancerous (benign) — develops. This complication may require removal of tissue and bone. Partially impacted wisdom teeth appear to be at higher risk of tooth decay (caries) than other teeth. This probably occurs because wisdom teeth are harder to clean and because food and bacteria get easily trapped between the gum and a partially erupted tooth. The difficulty cleaning impacted, partially erupted wisdom teeth increases the risk of developing a painful, inflammatory gum condition called pericoronitis (per-ih-kor-o-NI-tis) in that area. You can't keep an impaction from occurring, but keeping regular six-month dental appointments for cleaning and checkups enables your dentist to monitor the growth and emergence of your wisdom teeth. Regularly updated dental X-rays may indicate impacted wisdom teeth before any symptoms develop.

There is a sharp hard thing coming out of gums after wisdom tooth removal. What is it? Answered by and medically reviewed by team. This is a published on Dec 10, 2018 I am 30 years old and had to get my wisdom tooth extracted a week ago. The surgery was very complex and painful. Few days into it and I started feeling something hard and sharp coming out from my gums towards my tongue, went to the dentist again. She was not able to take it out so she clipped and ground it, but it is not very smooth and I can still feel it. She told me told me that eventually, gums will cover it. Is that true or do I need to see an oral surgeon? Complex wisdom tooth extractions will definitely have post-operative pain and discomfort. Lucky you that the procedure did not end up in swelling of the gums or face. That something hard feeling is nothing but the bone spicules that is left behind once the tooth is removed. The bony remnants will naturally fade away with time by a process called resorption. A kind of dissolving process. Do not panic about it because that is the process which heals your gums after the extraction. It will take a minimum of two weeks time for resorption but I advise you not to disturb that gums area with any sharp objects or tongue which will purposely delay healing. If any stitches were put, then you have got to remove them by the dentist in seven days from the day of surgery. Gargle your mouth with lukewarm salt water three times daily which will soothe the gums around. Also, do not brush aggressively and avoid hot and spicy food for a week. Otherwise, you will be fine.

My wife has swollen gums with pain in wisdom tooth area. Please suggest solution. Answered by and medically This is a published on May 06, 2020 and last reviewed on: May 16, 2020 My wife is having toothache and swollen and inflamed gums for four days. This is due to wisdom teeth. Currently, she is taking Cataflam 50 mg two tablets in 24 hours for the past two days for pain relief. Her age is 36 years and her weight is 56 kg. She does not have any past medical history. Currently, we feel visiting the dentist should be avoided. Please advise for medication. The proper treatment of is extraction as wisdom tooth is not able to perform its function of chewing because it is present in the most posterior position of our oral cavity. So it is of no use in saving it by RCT (root canal treatment) and crown and wasting money and time in it. So it is better to go for extraction after lockdown overs and kindly visit a dentist who is taking all the sterilization measures with PPE (personal protective equipment) kit. Until that time, do saline and warm water gargle three to four times a day for seven days. Take hot pack from outside the mouth and apply it on the affected cheek area to reduce the swelling twice a day for seven days. Take tablet Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 625 mg BD for five days, Zerodol SP (Aceclofenac, Serratiopeptidase, and Paracetamol) BD for five days, Pan 40 (Pantoprazole) OD before food in the morning, and capsule Becosule OD.

Wisdom teeth often first appear in young adults between the ages of 17 to 21. They are also called third molars. Because most mouths are too small for 4 more teeth, wisdom teeth often need to be removed. This is called an extraction. It sometimes needs to be done as soon as they erupt or break through the surface. These symptoms may mean that the wisdom teeth have erupted, and should be removed before they cause more serious problems. Swelling of the gumline in the back of the mouth around the wisdom tooth The wisdom teeth may be partly erupted. That means the teeth have partly surfaced and have no room in the mouth to come in completely. Completely impacted teeth have not come through the gum and may never erupt into the mouth. If they are not causing problems or seen as a possible problem, then many dentists will choose to watch them over time. If the wisdom teeth are causing problems or likely to cause problems, most oral health specialists will advise to remove them right away. Early removal will help to prevent problems, such as an impacted tooth that causes the roots of the second molar to resorb. What problems are often linked to impacted wisdom teeth? Bacteria and plaque buildup if the molars are partly erupted To remove the wisdom teeth, your dentist will make a cut or incision through the gum tissue over the tooth. He or she will gently detach the connective tissue between the tooth and the bone. The tooth is then removed and the opening in the gum is stitched closed. Sometimes, some of the bone surrounding the tooth must be removed. The tooth may need to be cut into sections to allow removal. ﻿ ",105,wisdom tooth cuts gum pain,-6.054922103881836,18

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Your dentist or oral surgeon can evaluate your teeth and mouth to determine if you have impacted wisdom teeth or if another condition is causing your problems. Such evaluations typically include: Questions about your dental symptoms and general health An examination of the condition of your teeth and gums Dental X-rays that can reveal the presence of impacted teeth, as well as signs of damage to teeth or bone If your impacted wisdom teeth are likely to be difficult to treat or if you have medical conditions that may increase surgical risks, your dentist will likely ask you to see an oral surgeon to discuss the best course of action. If impacted wisdom teeth aren't causing symptoms or apparent dental problems, they're called asymptomatic. Some disagreement exists in the dental community about how to manage asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth. Research on this topic doesn't strongly favor one strategy over the other. Some dentists and oral surgeons recommend removing asymptomatic wisdom teeth to prevent future potential problems. They argue: Symptom-free wisdom teeth may not be free of disease. If there isn't enough space for the teeth to erupt, it's often hard to get to them and clean them properly. Serious complications with wisdom teeth happen less often in younger adults. The procedure is more difficult and more likely to cause complications later in life, particularly among older adults. Other dentists and oral surgeons recommend a more conservative approach. They note: There isn't enough evidence to suggest that impacted wisdom teeth not causing problems in young adulthood will later cause problems. The expense and risks of the procedure don't justify the expected benefit. With a conservative approach, your dentist will monitor your teeth for decay, gum disease or other complications. He or she may recommend removing a tooth if problems arise. Impacted wisdom teeth that are causing pain or other dental problems are usually surgically removed (extracted). Extraction of a wisdom tooth is usually required for: Infection or gum disease (periodontal disease) involving the wisdom teeth Wisdom teeth that are causing damage to neighboring teeth Extraction is almost always done as an outpatient procedure, so you'll go home the same day. The process includes: You may have local anesthesia, which numbs your mouth; sedation anesthesia that depresses your consciousness; or general anesthesia, which makes you lose consciousness. During an extraction your dentist or oral surgeon makes an incision in your gums and removes any bone that blocks access to the impacted tooth root. After removing the tooth, the dentist or oral surgeon typically closes the wound with stitches and packs the empty space (socket) with gauze. Wisdom tooth extractions may cause some pain and bleeding, as well as swelling of the site or jaw. Temporarily, some people have trouble opening their mouth wide due to swelling of the jaw muscles. You'll receive instructions for caring for wounds and for managing pain and swelling, such as taking pain medication and using cold compresses to reduce swelling. Painful dry socket, or exposure of bone if the post-surgical blood clot is lost from the socket Infection in the socket from bacteria or trapped food particles Damage to nearby teeth, nerves, jawbone or sinuses The thought of having a tooth removed may be overwhelming, but delaying care can lead to serious and permanent problems. It's important to talk to your dentist about your concerns. Anxiety is common and nothing to be embarrassed about. Ask your dentist for suggestions on how to cope with your anxiety and discomfort. Many dentists offer ways to ease your anxiety, such as listening to music or watching videos. You may be able to bring along a supportive family member or friend. You can also learn relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and imagery. If you have severe anxiety, talk to your dentist or oral surgeon about medications or sedative techniques that may help. If you're experiencing symptoms or other dental problems that may indicate an impacted wisdom tooth, see your dentist as soon as possible.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Wisdom tooth extraction is a surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four permanent adult teeth located at the back corners of your mouth on the top and bottom. If a wisdom tooth doesn't have room to grow (impacted wisdom tooth), resulting in pain, infection or other dental problems, you'll likely need to have it pulled. Wisdom tooth extraction may be done by a dentist or an oral surgeon. To prevent potential future problems, some dentists and oral surgeons recommend wisdom tooth extraction even if impacted teeth aren't currently causing problems. Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Wisdom teeth are the last of your teeth to appear (erupt) in the mouth. Sometimes a wisdom tooth becomes stuck below the surface of your gums (impacted), and grows at an odd angle, possibly causing complications. Wisdom teeth, or third molars, are the last permanent teeth to appear (erupt) in the mouth. These teeth usually appear between the ages of 17 and 25. Some people never develop wisdom teeth. For others, wisdom teeth erupt normally — just as their other molars did — and cause no problems. Many people develop impacted wisdom teeth — teeth that don't have enough room to erupt into the mouth or develop normally. Impacted wisdom teeth may erupt only partially or not at all. Grow at an angle toward the next tooth (second molar) Grow at a right angle to the other teeth, as if the wisdom tooth is ""lying down"" within the jawbone Grow straight up or down like other teeth but stay trapped within the jawbone You'll likely need your impacted wisdom tooth pulled if it results in problems such as: Development of a fluid-filled sac (cyst) around the wisdom tooth Complications with orthodontic treatments to straighten other teeth Dental specialists disagree about the value of extracting impacted wisdom teeth that aren't causing problems (asymptomatic). It's difficult to predict future problems with impacted wisdom teeth. However, here's the rationale for preventive extraction: Symptom-free wisdom teeth could still harbor disease. If there isn't enough space for the tooth to erupt, it's often hard to get to it and clean it properly. Serious complications with wisdom teeth happen less often in younger adults. Older adults may experience difficulty with surgery and complications after surgery. Most wisdom tooth extractions don't result in long-term complications. However, removal of impacted wisdom teeth occasionally requires a surgical approach that involves making an incision in the gum tissue and removing bone. Rarely, complications can include: Painful dry socket, or exposure of bone when the post-surgical blood clot is lost from the site of the surgical wound (socket) Infection in the socket from bacteria or trapped food particles Damage to nearby teeth, nerves, jawbone or sinuses Your dentist may perform the procedure in the office. However, if your tooth is deeply impacted or if the extraction requires an in-depth surgical approach, your dentist may suggest you see an oral surgeon. In addition to making the area numb with local anesthetic, your surgeon may suggest sedation to allow you to be more comfortable during the procedure. Questions you may want to ask your dentist or oral surgeon include: How complicated do you expect the procedure to be? Have the impacted wisdom teeth caused damage to other teeth? What other dental treatments might I need at a later date? How long does it take to completely heal and return to normal activity? A wisdom tooth extraction is almost always performed as an outpatient procedure. This means that you go home the same day. You'll receive instructions from the hospital or dental clinic staff on what to do before the surgery and the day of your scheduled surgery. Ask these questions: Will I need to make arrangements for someone to drive me home after the procedure? When do I need to arrive at the dental clinic or hospital? Do I need to avoid eating food or drinking fluids or both (fast)? If so, when do I begin? Can I take my prescription medications before the surgery? If so, how soon before the surgery can I take a dose? Should I avoid any nonprescription drugs before the surgery? Your dentist or oral surgeon may use one of three types of anesthesia, depending on the expected complexity of the wisdom tooth extraction and your comfort level. Options include: Your dentist or oral surgeon administers local anesthesia with one or more injections near the site of each extraction. Before you receive an injection, your dentist or surgeon will likely apply a substance to your gums to numb them. You're awake during the tooth extraction. Although you'll feel some pressure and movement, you shouldn't experience pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon gives you sedation anesthesia through an intravenous (IV) line in your arm. Sedation anesthesia suppresses your consciousness during the procedure. You don't feel any pain and will have limited memory of the procedure. You'll also receive local anesthesia to numb your gums. In special situations, you may be offered general anesthesia. You may inhale medication through your nose or have an IV line in your arm, or both. Then you lose consciousness. Your surgical team closely monitors your medication, breathing, temperature, fluids and blood pressure. You'll experience no pain and have no memory of the procedure. Local anesthesia is also given to help with postoperative discomfort. During wisdom tooth extraction, your dentist or oral surgeon: Makes an incision in the gum tissue to expose the tooth and bone Divides the tooth into sections if it's easier to remove in pieces Cleans the site of the removed tooth of any debris from the tooth or bone Stitches the wound closed to promote healing, though this isn't always necessary Places gauze over the extraction site to control bleeding and to help a blood clot form If you receive sedation anesthesia or general anesthesia, you're taken to a recovery room after the procedure. If you have local anesthesia, your brief recovery time is likely in the dental chair. As you heal from your surgery, follow your dentist's instructions on: Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you don't dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon. You may be able to manage pain with an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), or a prescription pain medication from your dentist or oral surgeon. Prescription pain medication may be especially helpful if bone has been removed during the procedure. Holding a cold pack against your jaw also may relieve pain. Use an ice pack as directed by your dentist or surgeon. Any swelling of your cheeks usually improves in two or three days. Bruising may take several more days to resolve. After your surgery, plan to rest for the remainder of the day. Resume normal activities the next day, but for at least a week, avoid strenuous activity that might result in losing the blood clot from the socket. Drink lots of water after the surgery. Don't drink alcoholic, caffeinated, carbonated or hot beverages in the first 24 hours. Don't drink with a straw for at least a week because the sucking action can dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Eat only soft foods, such as yogurt or applesauce, for the first 24 hours. Start eating semisoft foods when you can tolerate them. Avoid hard, chewy, hot or spicy foods that might get stuck in the socket or irritate the wound. Don't brush your teeth, rinse your mouth, spit or use mouthwash during the first 24 hours after surgery. Typically you'll be told to resume brushing your teeth after the first 24 hours. Be particularly gentle near the surgical wound when brushing and gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water every two hours and after meals for a week. If you smoke, don't do so for at least 72 hours after surgery — and wait longer than that if possible. If you chew tobacco, don't use it for at least a week. Using tobacco products after oral surgery can delay healing and increase the risk of complications. You may have stitches that dissolve within a few weeks or no stitches at all. If your stitches need to be removed, schedule an appointment to have them taken out. Call your dentist or oral surgeon if you experience any of the following signs or symptoms, which could indicate an infection, nerve damage or other serious complication: Severe pain not relieved by prescribed pain medications A bad taste in your mouth not removed with saltwater rinsing You probably won't need a follow-up appointment after a wisdom tooth extraction if: You don't experience persistent problems, such as pain, swelling, numbness or bleeding — complications that might indicate infection, nerve damage or other problems If complications develop, contact your dentist or oral surgeon to discuss treatment options.

Before you receive an injection, your dentist or surgeon will likely apply a substance to your gums to numb them. You're awake during the tooth extraction. Although you'll feel some pressure and movement, you shouldn't experience pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon gives you sedation anesthesia through an intravenous (IV) line in your arm. Sedation anesthesia suppresses your consciousness during the procedure. You don't feel any pain and will have limited memory of the procedure. You'll also receive local anesthesia to numb your gums. In special situations, you may be offered general anesthesia. You may inhale medication through your nose or have an IV line in your arm, or both. Then you lose consciousness. Your surgical team closely monitors your medication, breathing, temperature, fluids and blood pressure. You'll experience no pain and have no memory of the procedure. Local anesthesia is also given to help with postoperative discomfort. During wisdom tooth extraction, your dentist or oral surgeon: Makes an incision in the gum tissue to expose the tooth and bone Divides the tooth into sections if it's easier to remove in pieces Cleans the site of the removed tooth of any debris from the tooth or bone Stitches the wound closed to promote healing, though this isn't always necessary Places gauze over the extraction site to control bleeding and to help a blood clot form If you receive sedation anesthesia or general anesthesia, you're taken to a recovery room after the procedure. If you have local anesthesia, your brief recovery time is likely in the dental chair. As you heal from your surgery, follow your dentist's instructions on: Some oozing of blood may occur the first day after wisdom tooth removal. Try to avoid excessive spitting so that you don't dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Replace gauze over the extraction site as directed by your dentist or oral surgeon. You may be able to manage pain with an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), or a prescription pain medication from your dentist or oral surgeon. Prescription pain medication may be especially helpful if bone has been removed during the procedure. Holding a cold pack against your jaw also may relieve pain. Use an ice pack as directed by your dentist or surgeon. Any swelling of your cheeks usually improves in two or three days. Bruising may take several more days to resolve. After your surgery, plan to rest for the remainder of the day. Resume normal activities the next day, but for at least a week, avoid strenuous activity that might result in losing the blood clot from the socket. Drink lots of water after the surgery. Don't drink alcoholic, caffeinated, carbonated or hot beverages in the first 24 hours. Don't drink with a straw for at least a week because the sucking action can dislodge the blood clot from the socket. Eat only soft foods, such as yogurt or applesauce, for the first 24 hours. Start eating semisoft foods when you can tolerate them. Avoid hard, chewy, hot or spicy foods that might get stuck in the socket or irritate the wound. Don't brush your teeth, rinse your mouth, spit or use mouthwash during the first 24 hours after surgery. Typically you'll be told to resume brushing your teeth after the first 24 hours. Be particularly gentle near the surgical wound when brushing and gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water every two hours and after meals for a week. If you smoke, don't do so for at least 72 hours after surgery — and wait longer than that if possible. If you chew tobacco, don't use it for at least a week. Using tobacco products after oral surgery can delay healing and increase the risk of complications. You may have stitches that dissolve within a few weeks or no stitches at all. If your stitches need to be removed, schedule an appointment to have them taken out. Call your dentist or oral surgeon if you experience any of the following signs or symptoms, which could indicate an infection, nerve damage or other serious complication: Severe pain not relieved by prescribed pain medications A bad taste in your mouth not removed with saltwater rinsing You probably won't need a follow-up appointment after a wisdom tooth extraction if: You don't experience persistent problems, such as pain, swelling, numbness or bleeding — complications that might indicate infection, nerve damage or other problems If complications develop, contact your dentist or oral surgeon to discuss treatment options.

What antibiotics should I use? What should I do to maintain oral hygiene in pericoronitis? Acetaminophen/paracetamol for pericoronitis pain relief An inflammation in the gum tissue surrounding the crown portion of a tooth is called as pericoronitis. In this, the lower third molar (wisdom) tooth gets covered and chewing surface overlapped by gum tissue. Pericoronitis can be . Chronic Pericoronitis: In this, the inflammation is mild but persistent. Acute Pericoronitis: In this, infection starts spreading and cause fever, swelling and intense pain. Pericoronitis is usually confused with peridontitis, and is differentiated by peridontitis in a way that peridontitis occurs specifically around a partially erupted tooth and gum cavity start covering the tooth before emerging from gum. Whereas the cause is same in both the conditions that is formation of gum abscess by entrapment of debris and bacteria under the gum tissue. The primary cause of pericoronitis is accumulation of bacteria. It can develop when wisdom tooth is broken through the gum or erupted. The erupted space makes the opening for bacteria to enter the tooth and cause an infection. After having meals and after munching, a bacterial film left on the teeth and entered under the flap of gum around the tooth. The bacteria are trapped in between the tooth and overlapping gum that is also known as “operculum”. It starts accumulating under the gum fold and converted into the debris. After sometime, it starts irritating the gum and lead to pericoronitis. If left untreated, the infection may extend beyond the jaw to the cheeks and neck and results into the severe pericoronitis. Active infection is associated with an abscess that contains pus, which has the ability to spread if left unattended. Pericoronits is the condition in which the wisdom tooth gets affected only if it is partially erupted. Only then, it can give space to bacteria to enter into the gum cavity. Just like viruses, you can also pass bacteria back and forth by means of kissing and sharing utensils. Only wisdom tooth can be affected by pericoronitis. The one who removed his/her wisdom tooth removed and their gums are intact, are less prone to catch this infection. A microscopic examination had been carried out in order to know the responsible bacteria for pericoronitis. We have seen the cultivation of facultative anaerobic microflora such as streptococcus (78%), (71%) and (57%). And we concluded that a well known, streptococci milleri group bacteria, which is known for its ability to cause superlative infections, and these microorganisms are involved in pathogenesis of acute severe pericoronitis of the lower third molar. Pericoronitis is a disease that mainly affects the young adults in their mid20sandinthepersonswho are experiencing poorly erupting wisdom teeth. Plaque formation is the main risk factor. Other risk factors include the presence of excess opurculum (gum tissue) overlapping the wisdom tooth and difficult cleaning of wisdom tooth after overlapping of gum tissue. When the infection exceeds in the jaw and cheeks area, the overlapping area of operculum starts swelling which cause intense pain. The pain in the pericoronitis is severe and spontaneous. The pain more often aggravated by closing of mouth or unintentional chewing by wisdom tooth. In some cases of swelling of operculum, opening and closing of the mouth during examination of the mouth, the pain is worsened. This second approach can be a good one. Indistinct symptoms involving pain, pressure sensation or headaches are sometimes ultimately attributed to non-tooth conditions. When pericoronitis left unseen, the infection in the tooth increases, which cause severe pain in lower jaw and wisdom tooth. This pain can spread to throat and ear. The bacteria that is grown the gum cavity in the pericoronitis is responsible for causing bad breath. These bacteria release sulfur-containing compounds, which is called as “volatile sulfur compounds”, (or VSC’s for short). When the volatile sulphur compounds are increased, they cause bad breath. When tounge bacteria break down these bacteria, the bad breath gets worse. Difference between acute and chronic pericoronitis Acute pericoronitis is caused due to trauma from the upper maxillary molar occlusion at the retromolar region. Symptoms of acute pericoronitis are inflammation of operculum, severe redness and soreness, continuous severe localized pain. Localized intra oral swelling occurs. Pungent odour and halitosis is also most common in patients suffering from acute pericoronitis. Some other symptoms include tenderness and enlargement of lymph node locally, fever and malaise, leucocytosis, dysphagia, pyrexia associated with tachycardia can be seen if the condition left unseen or untreated. Its presence shows the recurring inflammation and infection in the pericoronal region, and the dull pain in the pericoronal region. Its one of common symptom is halitosis and bad taste in oral cavity. Difference between pericoronitis and Temporomandibular joint disorder Pericoronitis is the gum disease in which the erupted wisdom tooth is overlapped by gum tissue that causes swelling in the overlapped tissues, which cause intense pain whereas tempo mandibular joint disorder is the disease, in which patient experience localized pain in the joint, which connect cheekbone and jaw bone. The pain occurs due to joint injury or tooth injury, misalignment of the teeth. Pericoronitis is the inflammation of the gum tissue surrounding the crown tissue of the wisdom tooth.  It is caused by overlapping of the gum tissue on the erupted wisdom tooth. Whereas temporomandibular disorder is the pain in the cheekbone and jawbone. It is caused by jaw injury, tooth injury, misalignment of the tooth, teeth grinding, poor posture, gum chewing or arthritis. In pericoronitis, there is Intense pain in tooth, oral swelling and bad breath, restricted mouth opening, Discharge from pericoronal space, pain in the jaw joint. Where as the symptoms of Temporomandibular joint disorder are Jaw clicking and popping, Ear pain, popping sounds in ears, headaches, sore jaw muscles, locking of jaw joint Early stage of pericoronitis is often confused with normal teething. Symptoms of acute pericorornitis are : Halitosis, leucocytosis and malaise are also common in some cases of pericoronitis. In addition patient may also notice sloughing or ulceration around the operculum. When left untreated, the infection spread in sublingual and para-pharyngeal spaces, which is followed by dysphagia. In this, the patient has difficulty in swelling food. Pericoronitis can be diagnosed by symptoms and appearance during a clinical evaluation with a dentist or a oral surgeon. A dental x-ray can be used to check out the other possible causes of the pain or dental decay. It can be diagnosed by the means of: Difference between pericoronitis and Temporomandibular joint disorder Pericoronitits is the gum disease in which the erupted wisdom tooth is overlapped by gum tissue that cause swelling in the overlapped tissues, which cause intense pain. Whereas tempomandibular joint disorder is the disease, in which patient experience localized pain in the joint, which connect cheekbone and jaw bone. The pain occurs due to joint injury or tooth injury, misalignment of the teeth. Pericoronitits is the inflammation of the gum tissue surrounding the crown tissue of the wisdom tooth.  It is caused by overlapping of the gum tissue on the erupted wisdom tooth. Temporomandibular disorder is the pain in the cheekbone and jawbone. It is caused by jaw injury, tooth injury, misalignment of the tooth, teeth grinding, poor posture, gum chewing or arthritis. Whereas signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorder are: The prevention of pericoronitis can be carried out by preemptive care and regular visit to dentist. The dentist keep a track on the problem spots, keep them clean and diagnose the need for extraction of the overlapping gum. Pericoronitis is the diseases, which require immediate attention due to intense pain and disturbed quality of life. Depending upon the severity of the condition, pericoronitis can be treated by three methods: The pain can be reduced by OTC (Over the counter) medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Painkillers can help with any dental pain from pericoronitis. If the infection is severe, the pain will be intense. If there is no spread of infection, the pain will be localized and less severe. A course of antibiotics may be recommended by the dentist to treat infection. If there is swelling or fever, oral antibiotics such as amoxicillin or erythromycin can be prescribed. In case of pericoronitis, a minor surgery can be performed, depending upon need and use of tooth. In this, operculum is removed. The operculum is removed in order to easy access and proper cleaning of the infected area. This prevents the accumulation f the bacteria and food debris. Sometimes, gum tissues grow again and cause the same problem again. It may be recommended to refer a oral surgeon or maxillofacial surgeon if wisdom tooth cause problems, the removal of wisdom tooth. When the wisdom tooth does not erupt completely and poorly impositioned, the removal of tooth is necessary and is most common treatment known. The removal of tooth prevents any kind of future consequences. In rare cases, the symptoms become so severe that an individual needs to go the hospital emergency room to seek care due to the rapid spread of infection. After treatment of pericoronitis, and removal of tooth, oral hygiene measures may be advised. Are antibiotics helpful for pericoronitis? What antibiotics should I use? Drainage of abscess and empirical antibiotic therapy is recommended for severe infections such as pericoronitits and cellulitis. Metronidazole in 250mg dose every 8 hours is recommended for infections in which anaerobic bacteria are implicated, such as pericoronitis, periodontal abscess and ulcerative gingivitis. It is given due to its best pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties. The short course antibiotic therapy requires the antibiotics with certain characteristics: Other common used antibiotic in dental practice are amoxicillin which is followed be penicillin. Among the group of penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin and clavulanate combination is used most commonly because penicillin is still the gold standard therapy. A combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid has many advantages that includes increased inconvenience, improved compliance and improved tolerability, in a dose over three times daily. What should I do to maintain oral hygiene in pericoronitis? Erupted wisdom tooth with overlapping gum tissues is very had to clean and non cleaning can result into tooth decay. The erupted wisdom tooth can be treated after checking the reason of infection. After a difficult surgical extraction of lower wisdom tooth, the extraction socket get inflamed, swelled and infectious, which is called as alveolitis. And it is caused by poor oral hygiene. Proper oral hygiene is the key to prevent symptoms. Its proper cleaning should be carried out by using soft electrical or manual toothbrush. One can try small or kids toothbrush for cleaning of wisdom tooth and they should use mouthwash, which contains fluoride. The cleaning with mouthwash is necessary to prevent the spread of infection. When toothache caused by pericoronitis, one should be treated with normal painkillers and mouthwash containing chlorhexidine. The antiseptic gels should be used topically after gentle lifting of gum covering the erupted wisdom tooth. A mouth rinse containing essential oils (e.g., Listerine Antiseptic) is as effective as chlorhexidine in the treatment of pericoronitis and may result in less calculus accumulation and tooth staining. Analgesics are the other name for painkillers.  Analgesics are of two types: These are referred as narcotics such as morphine derived from opium and are very powerful. They give additional pain relief in high doses but there are other potentially dangerous side effects. These opioids should not be used in dentistry. If needed, It should be used for very short period and for very short time periods due to its potential side effects. Non-opioid analgesics are generally used to control dental pain until definitive treatment can be instigated. These are given pre and post operatively as an adjunct to dental treatment. Ibuprofen is also considered as best painkiller and should be given before dental procedure as it can help in reducing post operative pain. It acts by blocking the production of pain causing chemicals inside the body. An analgesic should be taken as a recommended dose. Analgesics acts by two ways i.e. reducing the inflammation or by diminishing the brain’s perception of pain through nervous system. They are considered best painkillers because they increase the pain relieving effect as well as minimal side effects. The non-opioids analgesic are divided in to two types: Best known and most commonly used salicylate is Aspirin. It is helpful in reducing pain and fever. Dentists or surgeon interests this medication as it cause thinning of blood and diminished blood clotting. After a dental surgery or tooth extraction, aspirin is not advised. These painkillers are similar to aspirin due to same mode of action, pharmacological effects and adverse reactions. It possesses anti-inflammatory properties and has a powerful pain relieving effect as well as action. They are superior over opioids due to better safety profile and it is most useful in density due to its sontrol on mild to moderate pain. Ibuprofen is an important NSAID which is used in combination of paracetamol for pain relief in toothache.  NSAIDs are available in varying strengths, sometimes used without prescription. The effective dose of ibuprofen is 400-800 mg and higher doses do not have a benefit as far as dental pain relief is concerned. Higher doses are prescribed when there is swelling apparent, as well as pain and the anti-inflammatory effect is important. Ibuprofen is generally well tolerated and produces some gastro-intestinal in some patients. Ibuprofen can reduce the blood thinning effect of aspirin so patients taking aspirin for cardiovascular protection should avoid it. Diclofenac is another potent NSAID, as is also aceclofenac which may cause less gastrointestinal side effects. Acetaminophen/paracetamol for pericoronitis pain relief Acetaminophen/paracetamol acts more centrally, to block the pain messages in the brain and has little effect in reducing inflammation but is an effective medicine for toothache. It is useful for those who can’t take aspirin or it can be combined with aspirin or a NSAID to greater effect. A dose of 4-500 mg is commonly used and adequate, although the maximum effective dose for toothache relief is about 1000 mg. An excessive amount of acetaminophen can potentially cause liver damage so this needs to be taken into account, especially when analgesic products combining two or three types are used. Only when the dose of NSAID and/or paracetamol is at optimum levels, is it usually necessary to consider adding an opioid, and this is fairly rare in most dental problem circumstances. Operculectomy is the surgical procedure of removing the operculum, the flap of gum that partially covers a tooth in pericoronitis. Pericoronitis typically occurs in patients whose wisdom tooth starts to erupt and is most common among young adults. Operculum is the extending part of the gum tissues that overlap the erupted wisdom tooth. It is a mass of soft tissue and is most commonly associated with lower wisdom tooth. Sometimes it also covers the permanent molars and some baby teeth. In normal teething, the gum tissue moves back as the tooth continue to erupt and takes its accurate position. Whereas in pericoronitis these gum tissue exceeds and cover the tooth instead to recede. A normal tooth should not be covered with any gum tissue on it chewing surface. In the case of pericoronitis, the lower wisdom tooth is not able to erupt fully and come out of the gum line.  Also the operculum do not recede fully and cover the wisdom tooth completely and permanently. The upper molar start putting pressure on lower counterparts which cause intense pain and disturbs the quality of life of patient. Therefore, there is a need for operculectomy in case of pericoronitis. In pericoronitis, the primary aim to get relief from pain associated. An inflammation in the gum tissue surrounding the crown area of tooth occurred due to overlapping of erupted wisdom tooth with operculum. A dental surgery known as operculctomy is done to remove operculum. But if there is swelling, infection, difficulty in swallowing, fever or intense pain, the wisdom tooth be extracted as soon as possible. After extraction of tooth, proper antibiotics should be taken as prescribed. Warm saltwater rinse and OTC painkillers are also advised in order to get relief from toothache. Swelling in the gum area cause severe toothache. One should seek medical attention immediately in case of excessive pain. But meanwhile you can try some natural painkillers and remedies to avoid pain at home. One should make a paste from salt and pepper in equal quantities and place it on the infected area. Salt and pepper contains anti-inflammatory and painkilling properties. Apply the mixture and rest it for sometime. Apart from its great antibiotic and other medical properties, garlic is a great painkiller for toothache. One can crush the garlic, clove and add in the black pepper and salt, and apply the mixture on the affected area. Clove is considered as one of the best natural remedy for toothache. It contains anesthetic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties due to which clove is known to relieve toothache and combat infections. One can mix clove oil with water to make a mouthwash and then rinse the infected area thoroughly with this mouthwash. You can also soak a cotton ball in clove oil and rub this on infected tooth in order to get relief. One of the best natural remedy for treating toothache is onion. It contains antimicrobial and antiseptic properties. It is beneficial in killing the bacteria and germs and provides relief from pain. Chew an onion in case of excessive pain, and if chewing is not possible then place an onion slice on the infected tooth. Gargling with warm salty water is highly advised to get relief from toothache. For this mixture, one can mix warm water with half spoon salt.  Rinse your mouth with the mixture and any inflammation or swelling will reduce. Gargling with this solution is beneficial in killing of germs that may be associated with tooth infection. “What is the cause of excessive sweating?

This article discusses the common reasons for tooth removal, things to expect during the procedure, and the risks and complications associated with it. Sometimes, people need to have one or more of their teeth pulled out. This tooth extraction may be advised by the dentist for one of the following reasons: Severe gum disease that makes the tooth wobbly, which cannot be fixed. Severe involving the nerve inside the tooth called the pulp. In this case, the only alternative treatment to save the tooth is root canal treatment or endodontic treatment, which is a complex and costly procedure and may not be feasible. A badly broken tooth that cannot be restored with a filling or a cap. Crowding or malposition - When a tooth is out of the arch or not in its correct position, it may hinder proper tooth cleaning and aid food accumulation and plaque retention. In this case, its removal is recommended for better dental health and maintenance of the rest of the teeth. Braces - Sometimes the orthodontist recommends the removal of certain teeth before braces to facilitate placing the remaining teeth in their proper position and achieve a proper bite. - Wisdom teeth, also called third molar teeth, are the last adult teeth to come through (erupt) into the mouth and there are four of them, one in each side of each jaw. If there is not enough room for a wisdom tooth it may get stuck inside the jaw bone and require removal to avoid future problems. Sometimes, it cannot grow properly because of lack of space and erupt only partially in the mouth or get stuck against the nearby tooth causing infection and swelling of the gum around it. In this situation and to avoid recurrence of the infection or further complications, it may be better to have the tooth pulled out by the dentist or an oral surgeon. There is a sharp hard thing coming out of gums after wisdom tooth removal. What is it? What causes pain in the extracted tooth area with bone exposure that extends upto ear? The procedure of tooth removal is a simple surgical procedure performed under local anesthesia. The dental practitioner may first apply a topical anesthetic gel or cream to the gum tissue so that there is no pain while injecting the local anesthetic. During the local anesthetic injection itself, there may be a feeling of a small scratch after which, the tooth and surrounding tissue become numb and there should be no pain during the procedure though there may be a feeling of some pressure and pulling. When the mouth is numb, the dentist starts loosening the tooth from the gum with a special tool and then pulls it out with forceps. The procedure usually takes from a few minutes to less than an hour, depending on the difficulty of the procedure and how many teeth are removed. After the tooth has been removed, the dentist might put stitches to close the wound or place a piece of gauze over the wound to stop the bleeding. What Are the Risks and Complications of Extraction? As with any medical and dental treatment, tooth extraction is associated with some risks and complications. Common risks and complications include: Damage to lips and cheeks - you may bite or rub the numbed area without realizing the damage you may be causing. Children are particularly more prone to this and may need to be supervised until the numbness has worn off. Short term minimal to moderate pain, including jaw pain, due to the irritation of the nerves and the movement of the jaw during extraction. Short term swelling or infection - signs of post-extraction infection include pain and swelling that is worsening or not improving 48 hours after tooth removal, purulent discharge from the wound or the tooth socket (the hole where the tooth was), and cellulitis adjacent to the extraction site. - occurs when a blood clot does not form in the hole where the tooth was or the blood clot is disrupted. The bone underneath will be exposed to air and food, which can be very painful and can cause a bad taste and/or odor in your mouth. This is more likely to occur if you smoke. Prolonged or permanent nerve damages - a small percentage of people may, in spite of all precautions, experience partial or total loss of feeling in the area served by the nerves in close proximity to the extraction site. Irritation to these nerves during extraction can cause permanent or prolonged numbness or a tingling sensation to the lip, tongue, cheek, chin, gums, or teeth. You will normally have a gauze swab placed over the wound and you need to keep pressing on it for 30 minutes. If bleeding recurs, you can apply another piece of gauze and bite on it for another 30 minutes. The bleeding usually stops after that, unless there is a serious problem. You should not rinse your mouth for the first 24 hours after your tooth has been removed, then rinse gently with salty warm water a few times a day for a few days until the wound heals. You should avoid smoking and drinking alcohol or any strenuous activity for at least 24 hours. For the first 24 hours, avoid hot drinks and food, and eat a soft diet, such as mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs, on the other side away from the wound. Do not place fingers, pens or any other objects in your mouth to avoid injury and infection. You can take an over-the-counter painkiller such as Paracetamol or Ibuprofen before the numbness wears off to avoid any postoperative pain. If pain continues or increases the next day, consult a dentist online for further advice and treatment.   This is a sponsored Ad. icliniq or icliniq doctors do not endorse the content in the Ad.

If you’ve recently had a tooth removed, you’re at risk for dry socket. Although dry socket is the most common complication of tooth removal, it’s still relatively rare. For example, researchers in one found that about 40 people out of the 2,218 observed experienced some degree of dry socket. This puts the incidence rate at 1.8 percent. The type of tooth extraction determines how likely you are to experience dry socket. While still rare, dry socket is more likely to develop after your wisdom teeth are removed. When a tooth is removed from the bone and gums, a blood clot is supposed to form to protect the hole in your gums as it heals.

It’s common to have your wisdom teeth removed. They may need to be removed because they’re and won’t come in normally. Or they may need to be removed because they’re coming in at a wrong angle. During the removal procedure, you’ll be given anesthesia. Many surgeons will use some form of local, sedation, or general anesthesia. If your teeth haven’t come in yet, your surgeon will likely make incisions to remove them. They may need to remove bone if it’s blocking access to the root of the tooth. Once the teeth are removed, they’ll clean the site and add stitches to close the incision site if necessary. They’ll also place gauze over the extraction site. What you eat following your wisdom teeth removal is important. Eating soft or liquid foods won’t irritate the extraction site, helping it to heal faster. Some foods and drinks can irritate or become trapped in the extraction sites, leading to infection. It’s important to follow your doctor’s orders about what to eat following surgery.

Avoid eating harder foods at this time, as these might damage, or get trapped in, the recovering area. Cold foods like Jell-O, smoothies, and ice cream may relieve some discomfort. Nutrient-rich soups and smoothies can help promote healing. Soups in particular can help balance out the other high-sugar options on the list. As you start to heal, you can incorporate more normal foods. Start off easy with semisoft foods like scrambled eggs, instant oatmeal, and toast before moving to foods like chicken, fruits, and vegetables. There are some foods that you should avoid following your wisdom teeth removal. Stick to the foods listed above for the first few days. Avoid the following foods for a week or more until the extraction site has healed. Acidic and spicy foods (including citrus juice) may cause irritation and pain. Alcoholic beverages can irritate the area and are likely to interact negatively with the pain medication prescribed by your doctor. Grains (including rice and quinoa) and any types of seeds can easily become trapped in the extraction site. Hard or difficult-to-chew foods (including nuts, chips, and jerky) can reopen the stitches and delay healing. You should also avoid smoking or using any type of tobacco for a minimum of 72 hours after surgery as it can severely increase the risk of complications. Don’t use chewing tobacco for at least a week. For the first 24 to 48 hours, eat only liquid and soft foods like yogurt, apple sauce, and ice cream. Cold foods may help with some of the discomfort. As you start to feel better, you can try incorporating more solid foods. On the third day after surgery, try foods like eggs, toast, or oatmeal. Gradually continue to increase solid foods as chewing doesn’t cause any pain. If you experience pain when chewing, go back to soft and semisoft foods.

The reason is unknown, but lack of these teeth could involve genetics. So if one of your parents doesn’t have wisdom teeth, you may not have them either.

However, some people get their wisdom teeth earlier, and some people get them later. If you need your wisdom teeth removed, it’s easier to do so when you’re younger. Not that you can’t schedule surgery later in life, but when you’re young, the bones around your gums are softer and the nerve roots in your mouth haven’t completely formed.

Wisdom teeth removal is a common procedure because there’s often only room for 28 teeth in the mouth. If all four of your wisdom teeth come in, resulting in 32 teeth, this may lead to overcrowding. Since the mouth only has space for about 28 teeth, what is the purpose of wisdom teeth? One belief is that wisdom teeth served as replacement teeth for our distant ancestors. Today, we eat foods that are soft or tender, and most people practice good oral hygiene. Both factors help reduce the likelihood of losing teeth. Since our ancestors ate different types of foods — maybe not as soft — and didn’t have regular dental appointments, they might have dealt with gum and teeth problems like tooth decay or tooth loss. If so, wisdom teeth possibly provided extra teeth for chewing. Today, wisdom teeth serve little purpose, and often cause more harm than good. Of course, there’s no rule that says you have to remove a wisdom tooth that emerges — especially if you have space in your mouth. Some people choose removal even when their wisdom teeth don’t cause problems to avoid complications down the road. And some people don’t seek removal until they have pain.

Along with pain, signs of an emerging wisdom tooth include redness or swelling in the gums around your third molars. Sometimes, your jaw bone and other teeth prevent wisdom teeth from coming in, and the teeth remain trapped beneath the gum line. This can cause severe pain in the mouth. Other signs of an impacted wisdom tooth include pain around your molars, but no sign of an emerging tooth. You may also develop a in the back of your mouth.

What is that white spot present between my upper and lower wisdom teeth? Answered by and medically reviewed by team. This is a published on Nov 27, 2017 and last reviewed on: Jul 02, 2019 From the last three months, I have a constant pain on the right side of my mouth. I believe the pain was similar to when someone has an erupting wisdom tooth, but I am not 100 % sure. When I looked in the mirror with a flashlight, I found a tiny white spot in the area between my right upper and lower wisdom teeth. I had this spot for at least 4 or 5 days, and then gradually it subsided within a week or so. After a week, when I took a look, that white spot was gone but the little surrounding area had become white. This white area got bigger with time. I visited a dental surgeon in a top hospital, who visually examined the area and asked me to get an OPG done. The . The doctor said the white area was caused by trauma from the friction of the two wisdom teeth on that side with the skin. I was not very convinced and visited another dental surgeon, who also said more or less the same thing, after examining and going through the OPG. As per his advice, I . The white area has remained till this date, not the initial white dot which had disappeared within 5 to 6 days as mentioned above. I could not open my mouth properly for few days after the extraction, but when I finally did, everything appeared normal. Since then, I have not had any oral or dental issues. It is to be noted that neither doctor had seen the first tiny white dot or spot since I had met them after it was gone and when the surrounding area was white. I have attached some photos here, and the photos marked 1 and 2 show the first white dot. While the remaining show the condition after this spot disappeared. I request your thoughts and opinion about the issue detailed above. Could the original white spot be an ulcer or canker sore? If yes, what could have been the possible cause? Is a single canker sore cause of worry? Can it indicate some very serious underlying condition? I have read on the internet that mouth ulcers normally occur on the inside of cheeks, tongue, and lips. Can it occur in the area where the spot appeared? If it had been a mouth ulcer, is it possible that the ulcer affected the area in a way which caused a trauma resulting in the white area? I request a detailed response to the above at the earliest, please. Thank you for your query. I have seen all the attached photos (). There is nothing to worry.. As per the given picture, your lower wisdom tooth was not in the correct position. The normal eruption period of wisdom tooth is 17 to 25 years of age. If there is enough space behind the second molar and the tooth position is normal, it will erupt in the normal period. The pain you had is due the pressure applied by the wisdom tooth on the adjacent molar in its attempt to erupt. Finally, a part of tooth came out. Since rest of the tooth is inside the gum and bone, the gums behind the wisdom tooth grew over the tooth. When you chew, the upper wisdom tooth hits on the gum over the lower tooth, which leads to traumatic keratitis. The white spot you noticed initially is the point where the irritation by upper tooth happened. As the irritation started, the gums over the lower tooth got swollen, and more area comes between the upper and lower last tooth. That is why the white spot increased in size. The treatment is to . Traumatic keratosis will subside after removal of the cause. The white color which is persisting will disappear by 6 to 8 months from the tooth extraction. If you have a habit of , , or pan chewing, then it will take more time for tissue remodeling. Then there may be a chance of transforming to any pathology in future. It is a very rare. In your case, it is not a . Traumatic mouth ulcers will subside by removal of the cause. Mouth ulcers can occur in any part of the mouth. Usually, all mouth ulcers will subside within 7 to 10 days.

4a847e41-edc7-4b8e-91a5-f5cae0a0eb49,"— Throbbing tooth pain is a sign that you might have tooth damage. Tooth decay or a can give you a toothache. Throbbing tooth pain can also happen if there is an infection in the tooth or in the gums surrounding it. Toothaches are typically caused by an infection or inflammation in the tooth. This is called pulpitis. The soft pink pulp inside your tooth helps to keep it healthy and alive. Tooth pulp contains tissue, nerves, and blood vessels. A cavity or crack in the tooth lets air and germs inside the tooth. This can irritate and infect the sensitive pulp nerves, leading to tooth pain. Along with throbbing pain, other symptoms of a can include: Both adults and children can get a toothache. See a dentist immediately if you have any signs or symptoms. You will likely need a dental exam and an X-ray to find out what’s causing the tooth pain. Here are eight possible causes of throbbing tooth pain. or a cavity is the most common reason for tooth pain. It can happen when bacteria “eat” through the hard enamel outer layer of a tooth. Bacteria are part of normal mouth and body health. However, too much sugar and other foods on your teeth can cause too many bad bacteria. Bacteria make a plaque that sticks to your teeth. Some kinds of bacteria give off acid that can lead to holes or cavities. Tooth decay might look like small white, brown, or black spots on your teeth. Your dentist can repair a hole or fix a weakened area in the tooth to help stop the throbbing pain. You may need: An abscessed tooth is when part or all of the pulp inside the tooth dies. The dead tissue makes a “pocket” of bacteria and pus called an abscess. Tooth infection or inflammation can cause an abscess. A damaged tooth can lead to a tooth abscess if it is not treated quickly. This happens when a hole or crack lets in bacteria into the tooth. antibiotics to kill the bacteria causing the infection cleaning and treating the gums, if the abscess is caused by gum disease , if the abscess is caused by decay or a cracked tooth implant, which involves replacing the tooth with a synthetic one A tooth fracture is a crack or split in the tooth. This can happen by biting on something hard like ice. You may also get a tooth fracture in a fall or if you get hit in the jaw or face with something hard. In some cases, a tooth fracture can develop slowly over time. A tooth fracture can lead to throbbing pain. The fracture allows things to get into the tooth and irritate or infect the pulp and nerves, triggering pain. Your dentist can repair a fractured tooth with dental glue, a , or a filling. You may need a cap or crown on the tooth, or your dentist may recommend a root canal. You can damage a filling with normal biting and chewing, by biting something hard, or by grinding or clenching your teeth. A filling may: Your dentist can repair or replace a damaged filling. You may need a crown on the tooth if it has become too damaged for a new filling. A is also called gingivitis. Infected gums can lead to gum disease or periodontitis. Gum disease is the main cause of tooth loss in adults. Bacteria from infected gums can build up around the tooth roots. This can cause an infection in the gum tissue that results in a toothache. Gum disease may shrink gums away from the tooth. It may also break down the bone that holds teeth in place. This can loosen teeth and cause cavities. A gum infection is normally treated with antibiotics. You may need regular cleanings by your dentist to remove plaque. A medicated mouth wash can help soothe gum and tooth pain. If you have , you may need several treatments to help save your teeth. Treatment includes a “deep cleaning” called scaling and root planing to keep your teeth and gums healthy. In severe cases, dental surgery may be needed. is also called bruxism. It usually happens during sleep. Clenching your teeth means biting down hard. Grinding and clenching can happen because of stress, genetics, and over-developed jaw muscles. Grinding and clenching can cause tooth, gum, and jaw pain. They can lead to tooth erosion by wearing away the tooth. This increases the risk of cavities, tooth pain, and fractured teeth. teeth thinning (biting edges look slightly transparent) sensitive teeth (especially to hot, cold, and sweet drinks and foods) Treating the cause of grinding and clenching teeth helps stop tooth pain. Wearing a mouth guard during sleep can help stop adults and children from grinding their teeth. It may also be helpful to practice or seek counseling from mental health professional. A crown or cap is a tooth-shaped cover. It usually covers the whole tooth down to the gumline. You might need a crown if a tooth is cracked or broken, or if a cavity is too big for a filling. A crown holds the tooth together. It can be made of metals, ceramic, or porcelain. Dental cement holds a crown in place. A crown can become loose through normal wear and tear. It can also chip or crack like a real tooth. The cement glue holding a crown in place may wash out. You may damage a crown by clenching or grinding your teeth or biting something hard. A loose crown can trigger throbbing tooth pain. This happens because bacteria can get under the crown. The tooth may become infected or damaged, triggering nerve pain. Your dentist may remove the crown and treat the tooth if there is a cavity or tooth damage. A new crown is put on the repaired tooth. A loose or damaged crown can be repaired or replaced with a new one. New growing (erupting) teeth can cause pain in the gums, jaw, and surrounding teeth. This includes teething babies, children getting new teeth, and adults growing wisdom teeth. A tooth can become if it’s blocked from growing through the gums. Or it may grow in the wrong direction, such as sideways instead of up. This can be caused by: An impacted tooth may damage a neighboring tooth’s roots. A newly erupted tooth and an impacted tooth may also cause other teeth to move or loosen. This sets off pain in the gums and teeth. You can soothe pain or tenderness from an erupting tooth with an oral numbing gel or general pain medication. Treatment for an impacted tooth includes minor dental surgery to make room for the tooth. This may involve removing extra teeth or opening up blockages. heart disease, such as angina (pain around the teeth and jaw) A tooth infection can spread to the jaw bone and other areas of the face, throat, and head. Call your dentist immediately if you have other symptoms along with a toothache. These can include: If your tooth has broken or come out, go to the dentist or emergency room immediately. Try these tips to soothe throbbing tooth pain if you cannot see your dentist immediately: Gently floss to remove food or plaque between teeth. Take over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen. Try for toothaches like clove oil to numb the gums. See your dentist or doctor if you have throbbing tooth pain. It may be due to an infection. Early treatment can help keep your teeth and body healthy. Regular dentist visits help to prevent serious teeth problems before they cause pain. Check with your health insurance to find out if you’re covered for regular check-ups and teeth cleaning. If you cannot afford a dentist, call some local dental schools. They often offer free or cheaper teeth cleaning and minor dental procedures, like fillings. — Are your teeth feeling extra sensitive after a filling?

d12f2aed-9cbb-49f2-a3eb-077797e540ed,"By leaning on a trained dental professional's knowledge and care, you can generally expect the wisdom-teeth extraction procedure and recovery to go smoothly. They are to the mouth what tonsils are to the throat, or what your gall bladder is to your abdomen. But while tonsils or gall bladders are rarely removed unless they present a physical problem, wisdom teeth almost always have to come out. Extractions are routine and nothing to fear, but you should be informed about the procedure so you're prepared and ready to handle the recovery as efficiently as possible. Wisdom teeth -- aka third molars -- are the teeth at the farthest most part of your upper and lower rows of teeth. The term ""wisdom"" has been used to characterize these teeth since the 1600s. Initially, they were called ""the teeth of wisdom"" and, by the 1800s, ""wisdom teeth."" The teeth, of course, don't make you any smarter but they tend to appear later in life than any other teeth -- mid-teens to mid-20s, typically. Presumably, a person is wiser when they have reached adulthood, resulting in the terminology [source: ]. Anthropologists believe wisdom teeth were useful to early man, who had a much different diet than we do today. He didn't sit down to a bowl of soup with a spoon or eat mashed potatoes with a fork. Ripping meat, grinding roots and chomping on nuts would've been more common and that would have resulted in extensive wear, making wisdom teeth quite valuable [source: ]. It's also believed that wisdom teeth often come in at odd angles or remain impacted because the human jaw has become smaller with time, resulting in overcrowding [source: ]. Interestingly, dentists and oral surgeons may encourage the removal of wisdom teeth even if they come in perfectly and don't crowd existing teeth. That's because it's difficult to clean these teeth due to their remote, hard-to-reach location. It's common for bacteria to build up, which can lead to infection. As a result, approximately 85 percent of the population requires the removal of their wisdom teeth [source: ]. So, when should you have your wisdom teeth extracted? Generally, the sooner the better. Teeth, like trees, grow more extensive root systems as they grow and age. It will likely be easier to remove your wisdom teeth when you're younger. If the roots eventually connect with bone or even sinus tissue, the procedure will become more difficult and, potentially, much more painful [sources: ; ]. Wisdom tooth removal is more complex than simply pulling a tooth. It will require some level of sedation involving a local anesthetic, intravenous sedative or general anesthetic. The procedure itself usually isn't painful [source: American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons]. But after the anesthetic wears off, that could be another story. Depending on whether your wisdom teeth are impacted -- below the gum line -- cutting and stitching may be involved. Most people are less concerned with how the extraction is performed and more concerned with how it will feel and how long the recovery will take. Because you'll be sedated, it's unlikely you'll experience pain during the tooth removal process. But, while wisdom tooth extractions are routine, you'll need to take your recovery seriously or else experience unpleasant and painful consequences. Your doctor will likely give you pain medication to help ease your post-extraction discomfort. Bed rest is necessary for at least the first 24 hours following wisdom tooth removal, and you should avoid exercise for three to four days [source: ]. The combination of a few hours rest and may make you overly optimistic about returning to your normal activities. This is common, but if you're tempted to return to your normal routine in less than 24 hours, you're asking for trouble. The more you move, the more blood will pulsate to the already sensitive areas. Bleeding can occur during the first couple of days post-removal, and swelling in the mouth and cheeks may be apparent for several days. Your oral surgeon will give you gauze to place over the sutures or area where the wisdom teeth were extracted. In addition, there may be bruising on your face. Ice packs can be helpful during the recovery, too [source: ]. Because your mouth will be quite sensitive, soft foods like mashed potatoes, soups or even cool nutrition like smoothies are good choices. You'll also want to avoid nuts and seeds for as much as six weeks following wisdom tooth extraction [source: ]. To speed the recovery and prevent infection, continue good . You can even brush your teeth the night after surgery; just remember to avoid the extraction area. With attention to your doctor's orders, you should have a swift and uneventful recovery. Complications from wisdom tooth extraction are quite rare. In fact, less than 2 percent of patients who have their wisdom teeth removed have unexpected health issues [source: ]. Perhaps the most significant potential complication is infection. Some people are simply more prone to infection than others. If you have a pre-existing medical condition that has weakened your immune system, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics before and after having your wisdom teeth extracted. If you or your doctor don't guard against infection, there's the small possibility that bacteria could enter your bloodstream during the removal process, leading to more serious health problems involving vital organs like the heart or kidneys. Women who take should be aware that the medication can disrupt the effectiveness of . Your doctor will likely recommend that you use a second form of birth control until you have completed the entire course of antibiotic treatment [source: ]. If you don't have a weakened immune system, much of the potential for infection is within your control. For example, smokers should avoid the practice for at least 24 hours following extraction [source: ]. Continuing to keep your mouth clean by brushing your teeth and tongue will prevent the risk of infection. Avoiding physical activity for several days following wisdom tooth extraction will promote the healing process. You can also avoid complications arising from infection by leaving the wounds alone as much as possible. Touching the affected areas with your fingers or tongue may be tempting but can't help in your recovery. Aside from changing out gauze, the sutured area should be avoided. Remember, too, to rinse your mouth gently with warm water and avoid sucking (using a straw) or spitting, which can interrupt healing [source: ]. In most cases, it's wise to have those wisdom teeth of yours removed, and by leaning on a trained dental professional's knowledge and care, you can expect the extraction procedure and recovery to go smoothly.

Medical Editor: What and Signs May Accompany a Toothache? When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for a Toothache? How Do Health Care Professionals Diagnose a Toothache? A toothache or tooth pain is most often caused when the nerve to a tooth is irritated, but there are numerous other reasons for a person to experience tooth pain. Risk factors for toothache include dental infection, , plaque, dental decay, injury, cracked , poorly placed fillings or crowns, failing or leaking fillings or crowns, loss of a tooth (including tooth extractions), () disorders, and . There are instances, however, where pain originating from outside the mouth radiates to the mouth, thus giving the impression that the pain is of tooth origin. This often happens when there is a problem with the jaw joint (temporomandibular joint or TMJ), ears, nerves, sinuses, or muscles. Occasionally, heart problems can give a sensation of tooth pain. can also be a risk for tooth problems that lead to pain. Due to fluctuating hormone levels during pregnancy, pregnancy and tooth decay can occur. One can prevent the majority of dental problems through basic oral hygiene home care -- flossing and brushing. There are many different products, such as xylitol- and -containing rinses and toothpaste, and having teeth professionally cleaned on a regular schedule. The dentist may apply sealants, varnishes, and , which are especially important in children but can also be valuable to adults and the elderly, too. Toothaches occur from inflammation of the central portion of the tooth called pulp. The pulp contains nerve endings that are very sensitive to pain. Inflammation to the pulp, or pulpitis, can be caused by anything that has contact with the tooth. Common causes of tooth pain are the following: Temperature sensitivity -- hot or liquids or foods After a , a tooth will sometimes become sensitive after a crown is prepared or cemented. Gum recession -- exposure of the tooth root that was covered by gum or bone What and Signs May Accompany a Toothache? Toothache and jaw pain are common complaints. It is not unusual for one to feel mild pain from pressure and hot or cold exposure to the tooth. However, if the pain is severe or persists for longer than 15 seconds after the pressure or temperature exposure ceases, then this could be an indication of a more serious problem. If there is severe inflammation of the tooth, the pain can radiate to the cheek, the ear, or the jaw. The signs and symptoms that might lead one to seek care include the following: Swelling around a tooth or swelling of the jaw or cheek These signs and symptoms may sometimes be associated with dental decay or gum disease (periodontal disease). Dental decay or an area of redness around the tooth's gum line may point to the source of pain. If one taps an , it may make the pain more intense. This sign may point to the problem tooth even if the tooth appears normal. A toothache needs to be differentiated from other sources of pain in the face. , ear or , or an injury to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) that attaches the jaw to the skull can be confused with toothache. Pain from a deeper structure (called referred pain) may be passed along the nerve and be felt in the jaw or tooth. In order to pinpoint the source of the pain and get relief, an evaluation by a dentist or doctor is appropriate. When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for a Toothache? One should call the doctor or dentist for advice for the following concerns: Dental pain is not relieved by over-the-counter medications. Even when it is relieved, a dental evaluation can be beneficial as the pain could be something that can be fixed more easily when treated earlier. If one experiences severe pain more than two days after a tooth is pulled, it is possible that the tooth socket is not healing properly. A condition known as "" syndrome"" may have occurred and the patient should see a dentist immediately. Pain may be associated with swelling of the gums or face, or the patient may have discharge around a tooth. A is another sign of infection in dental disease. These signs may indicate an infection surrounding the tooth, the gum, or the jaw bone (maxilla or mandible). Fever and swelling may indicate the presence of an . Dental abscesses may require and surgical opening (drainage) of the abscess. When this procedure is recommended to be done inside the tooth (endodontic drainage), a ""root canal"" is performed. unfortunately are common. Unless associated with more severe injuries, the dentist should be contacted as soon as possible. The sooner a patient seeks treatment, risk of infection is decreased and teeth have a higher chance of being saved. It is particularly important that children who have damaged their primary teeth (baby teeth) be treated right away in that such injuries can affect secondary teeth (adult teeth). Pain may be present at the angle of the jaw. If opening the mouth causes pain, it is likely that the temporomandibular (TMJ) joint has been injured or inflamed. This can occur from an injury or just by trying to eat something that is too big. The dentist may be able to suggest solutions to this problem. can cause pain. As wisdom teeth (molars) come out, inflammation of the gum around the erupted crown often occurs. This can then lead to gum infection. The pain usually occurs in the lower third molar and may extend to the jaw and ear. There may be swelling in the affected area so that the jaw cannot close properly. In severe cases, and the floor of the mouth may make it difficult to swallow. Any history of trauma, , , or rashes may suggest causes of pain other than purely dental. What appears to be a toothache could be a symptom of a much more severe underlying issue. The following symptoms in conjunction with toothache or jaw pain indicate that the patient should visit the doctor or a hospital's emergency department. High fever or chills: This indicates a more widespread infection that may require medication stronger than oral antibiotics. Recent head or face injury: If the patient experiences , lightheadedness, , , or other symptoms after an injury to the face or mouth, the patient may have a more serious injury in addition to the dental injury. A facial : This could be an indication of a growing infection related to a tooth. The doctor should be able to decide what is appropriate. Any jaw pain occurring with chest pain: Although jaw pain is most commonly caused by dental disease, it is sometimes referred pain from other areas. People with , especially people who have had placed, people with , or those who have had heart surgery may have jaw pain as a symptom of a () or (ischemia). If the jaw or tooth pain is associated with lightheadedness, , or shortness of breath, the patient should see a doctor immediately. Trouble swallowing or excessive pain or bleeding from gums: If the patient has a history of a weakened immune system, , or steroid use, they are more susceptible to infections. Infections can often be more severe and extensive or caused by unusual organisms. Dental and gum infections in people with these conditions may require more aggressive treatment. An abscess may need to be drained or may require intravenous antibiotics, for example. How Do Health Care Professionals Diagnose a Toothache? A medical history and physical exam will usually indicate the appropriate diagnosis. Sometimes radiographs, often referred to as X-rays, can be used along with other diagnostic aids. Panoramic radiographs and cone beam computed tomography views are used to further evaluate the teeth and bones throughout the mouth and skull. Occasionally, lab evaluation including tracings of the heart will assist the doctor. If the cause is something other than a dental or jaw problem, the doctor may prescribe medications directed at the problem. If the condition is more severe, the doctor may admit the patient to the hospital for further care. The patient may be referred to a dentist for further treatment. For toothaches People may use over-the-counter such as () or (). Individuals with toothaches should take these medications as directed for temporary relief prior to professional evaluation. Avoid very cold or hot foods because these may make the pain worse. A home remedy for pain relief is to bite on a cotton ball soaked in oil of cloves. oil is available at most drugstores. contains a chemical called allicin, which acts as a natural antibiotic and can fight a tooth infection. By simply eating more garlic through supplementation or as an ingredient in everyday foods, one can decrease their vulnerability to infection. To help alleviate pain, garlic can be crushed and mixed into a paste with a little bit of salt and applied to the area that is infected. This won't cure the infection but may help with tooth pain and prevent the infection from growing or spreading. Applying medicated relief gel like to the affected area can provide pain relief in some instances. For jaw pain or ibuprofen (Advil, ) may be helpful for problems in the jaw joint (TMJ) in adults. Acetaminophen (Tylenol), not aspirin, should be used for children and teenagers. If pain occurs every time the patient opens his/her mouth widely, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may be the source of the pain. Yawning or taking a large bite of food may intensify the pain. To manage this type of pain in the short term, one should avoid hard or chewy foods, apply moist heat to the jaw, and avoid opening wide as much as possible. An appointment with the doctor or dentist will help to determine the cause and direction of treatment. When someone is experiencing a toothache, they typically can't think of anything besides how to get rid of the pain. It can be a dominating and debilitating experience. The affected person must have a dental evaluation as soon as possible to determine the cause. Sometimes it may just be pain that comes and goes. Other times, the pain is indicative of a serious condition. The dentist will do a clinical exam and may take X-rays or perform other clinical tests to locate the origin of the toothache. Usually, the best way to stop dental or jaw pain initially is with painkillers. A health care professional may prescribe antibiotics (such as ) if there is swelling in the gums or face, or if the patient has fever. A referral to a dentist for follow-up will usually be arranged. The doctor may try an injection of local anesthetic around the tooth for pain control. The dentist may apply a desensitizing varnish or fluoride treatment to help strengthen the tooth and seal up a part of the tooth that just might be sensitive. It may be determined that a deep cleaning is necessary -- to remove harmful bacteria and plaque that have become trapped under the gumline. A patient may need feelings if a dentist finds dental decay. Deep decay or a fractured tooth may necessitate a crown or a root canal (cleaning out the nerve of the tooth and sealing the root). If the tooth is too badly decayed or broken, there may be nothing left to do but to extract the tooth. This will provide rapid relief of the tooth pain. If it has been a while since the last dental visit, the dentist may find multiple factors contributing to the tooth pain. In this situation, the dentist will prioritize dental treatment in order of severity. The dentist will likely recommend procedures that will take care of the pain or infection first, followed by treatment to teeth that are likely to cause pain or infection, and a dental cleaning. The goal will be to provide immediate relief and then work to create an atmosphere of future health. After most dental procedures, the patient will be able to return to work or school while he or she recovers. If causes other than the teeth or jaw are responsible for the pain, such as TMJ disorders, , muscle or nerve problems, management will be according to the specific condition. Mouth Problems: TMJ, Canker Sores, Painful Gums and More After leaving the dentist's office, continue to practice good dental care, but be careful not to self-medicate or use numerous over the counter (OTC) oral rinses as they can sometimes exacerbate or prolong problems. Routine and prompt follow-up appointments with the dentist can relieve dental pain faster. When the patient leaves the emergency department, he or she should take the medications as prescribed and keep their follow-up appointments. If the patient has any concerning signs or symptoms, call the doctor. Stopping may help improve some dental conditions. If the patient is having trouble quitting, talk to the doctor about assistance. For most common causes of toothache, the prognosis is good with appropriate dental medicine. Following good , such as brushing with a fluoride toothpaste, flossing, and routine check-ups by the dentist, helps to prevent dental problems. For conditions other than dental and jaw problems, prompt diagnosis and treatment usually will improve the long-term outcome. Most people can avoid severe dental problems with regular dental care. Have the dentist's telephone number easily available in case of an emergency. Maintain a healthy and brush and floss often. Bacteria thrive on refined and starch and need this in order to burrow through the enamel on teeth. One should watch what they eat and be careful about food that sticks to and between the teeth. Regular brushing habits can be key to tooth pain prevention. Brushing after eating or adding foods that can act as a natural should be part of one's preventive care routine (end meals with a salad or apple). Brush to remove food particles using a soft toothbrush with fluoride toothpaste as recommended by the American Dental Association. (Xylitol in toothpaste or a mouth rinse will help reduce bacteria.) Floss between teeth daily and brush the gums to encourage healthy gums. Water jets are effective at removing trapped particles, but flossing the teeth does a more thorough job when done carefully. Prevent tooth decay with fluoride and xylitol. Fluoride is effective in preventing tooth decay in children. Fluoride is a natural element and is found in many water supplies and vegetables. Check and see if tap water is fluoridated. If the water is not fluoridated, the dentist can prescribe fluoride tablets or fluoride for children younger than 10 years of age. Xylitol is a natural product of birch trees and bacteria see it as a food source just like they consume carbohydrates and simple sugars. However, bacteria cannot break down xylitol so it neutralizes bacteria. There are other more modern toothpastes and topical gels that can be placed on the teeth to help fight off acid attack from bacteria and help to remineralize damage caused to the teeth by bacteria. These newer types of products typically contain xylitol, casein phosphopeptide (CPP), amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), and fluoride. One should arrange to have the teeth cleaned by a dentist or dental hygienist at least twice a year. This has been shown to be effective in preventing both decay and gum disease. Dental X-rays may be needed every year to identify problem areas. One should keep their bridge or clean. The dentist can offer suggestions. Even if one does not have all of their original adult teeth, they can prevent new dental problems if they try these preventive tips. Wear a protective dental guard or headgear while playing sports to help prevent injury. Do not smoke. may make some dental conditions worse. An abscessed tooth is a dental condition in which the nerve of the tooth, also referred to as the dental pulp, has become infected. The infection usually occurs when a dental cavity (tooth decay) goes untreated and spreads deep within the tooth. The infection can also occur from a broken or cracked tooth where the dental pulp is exposed to the oral environment. The bacteria that cause an abscess can spread down the length of the roots and into the surrounding bone tissue. Dental professionals also consider an infection can also occur between the gum tissues and root of the tooth, which is called a periodontal abscess. Additionally, the dental nerve can be susceptible to injury leading to an infection after a crown or large filling are completed. The greater the amount of decay, the closer the dental treatment gets to the dental nerve, and the more likely the nerve can become compromised. Teeth that are directly subjected to dental trauma (for example, from a fall or from a hit by a projectile such as a baseball) are also prone to infection and should be immediately examined by a dentist.

9bb2b030-f90d-4184-9a72-cfe8b7d7dcd1,"— — Sometime between , most adults will develop their third set of molars. These molars are more commonly called wisdom teeth. are categorized by their placement and function. The sharper teeth can tear food into smaller pieces and the flatter teeth grind food down. Wisdom teeth are the flatter kind of teeth, called molars. Molars are all the way in the back of your mouth. Adults get three sets of molars on top and bottom, and on both sides of the mouth. From infancy through early adolescence, humans develop their first set of teeth, lose them, and get a whole new set again. There’s a brief pause and then again, in early adulthood, the final set of teeth emerge. They’re called wisdom teeth because they’re the last teeth to emerge. You’re presumably “wiser” when these teeth come in. All of the teeth a person will ever have are present at birth, higher up in the skull structure. First, a set of 20 baby teeth erupts and falls out. Then 32 permanent teeth grow in. The first usually becomes visible at age 6, the second set around 12, and the final set (wisdom teeth) sometime before age 21. Once essential for an early human diet of roots, leaves, meat, and nuts, wisdom teeth are no longer totally necessary. Today, humans cook food to soften it, and we can cut and crush it with utensils. Anthropologists believe humans have evolved beyond needing wisdom teeth, so some people may never get any. Wisdom teeth may go the way of the appendix and become completely unnecessary. It wouldn’t be surprising to some researchers if someday nobody had wisdom teeth anymore. Still, genetics do cause most adults to develop their wisdom teeth. found that at least 53 percent of people had at least one wisdom tooth come in. Men were more likely to have them than women. However, just because you don’t see all of your wisdom teeth doesn’t mean they aren’t there. Sometimes wisdom teeth don’t ever erupt and won’t ever become visible. An X-ray can confirm if you have wisdom teeth under your gums. Whether visible or not, wisdom teeth can cause oral health problems. Wisdom teeth that haven’t erupted through the gums are called . Sometimes this causes even more problems than visible wisdom teeth. Humans and our jaws have gotten smaller over time. There are probably a few reasons for this evolutionary progress. Some scientists believe that as the human brain grew bigger over time, the jaw got smaller to accommodate for space. Our diet and dental needs have also changed drastically. Smaller jaws mean there isn’t always enough room in the mouth for all the teeth we’re supposed to have. There are four wisdom teeth in total, two on top and two on the bottom. People can have any number of wisdom teeth from none to all four. Most jaws are by the time a person is 18 years old, but most wisdom teeth emerge when a person is around . Most problems caused by wisdom teeth are due to the fact that they just don’t fit. The indicates that removal will be necessary if any of the above changes are apparent. It’s recommended that teenagers be evaluated for . People who get their wisdom teeth removed at a younger age tend to heal better from surgery, before the roots and bone have fully formed. This can help avoid any potential problems before they start. There are always risks associated with surgery so be sure to ask a lot of questions when you’re deciding whether or not to have these teeth removed. If you decide not to have your wisdom teeth removed, they need to be monitored closely by your dentist. Wisdom teeth tend to become more problematic over time. Sometimes dentists will recommend wisdom tooth removal before any orthodontic work, like braces, to ensure that these teeth don’t erupt later and undo all the hard work of shaping your jaw and teeth. Either a professional dentist or oral and maxillofacial surgeon can remove your wisdom teeth. They’ll give you clear instructions on how to prepare for surgery and what to do during recovery. — — Medically reviewed by Are your wisdom teeth causing you pain?

Discover the warning signs before it's too late. You unwrap your favorite ice cream bar and can already taste that creamy vanilla ice cream with the hard chocolate coating. You take that first bite, mouth watering, and…OUCH! An intense, throbbing pain shoots through your molar—and throughout your entire body. Maybe you just banged your tooth. Maybe it's something worse. Occasional mouth pain may just indicate a sensitivity to hot or cold, which can become increasingly common as you get older. But different types of toothaches—and other symptoms associated with this pain—can be indicators that you're developing one of several serious health conditions that need immediate treatment. Don't just pop an ibuprofen and assume it'll go away. Read on to learn about 20 signs that indicate you need to take your tooth pain seriously. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these If your tooth sends a sharp, shooting pain when you take a bite of something, it may be cracked or damaged. If you don't remember some kind of trauma—getting hit in the mouth, biting down on a Gobstopper—this crack may have occurred from grinding your teeth at night or clenching your jaw too intensely. Exposed nerves from a cracked tooth produce this pain and if left untreated, can cause the spread of bacteria and lead to an infection. It might also hurt to chew because your tooth enamel has worn down. Tooth enamel protects your teeth's nerves from outside factors that can cause pain. If the enamel wears down, you'll notice increased sensitivity to hot or cold foods, which can cause that instant zing of pain when you chew. Depending on the pattern of your enamel disappearance, it may also be related to chronic acid reflux or a poor diet. According to a study published in the , dentists may be the first to diagnose gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) because they can spot these tooth erosion patterns. A cracked tooth must be addressed immediately to prevent infection or decay. Visit your dentist so he or she can fix it. If you're experiencing a loss of tooth enamel, you'll need to examine your dietary habits and gastrointestinal health. There's no way to get tooth enamel back once it's gone, so the sooner you make healthy lifestyle changes, the less likely you are to experience pain when chewing in the future. Bloody gums while flossing may be a sign of gum disease, a buildup of plaque and bacteria on the gums that causes your gums to recede from your teeth. According to the , most adults in the U.S. have some form of this disease but it's more likely to occur in adults who are 30 to 40 years of age. In the most mild cases, it results in bloody and slightly receding gums. In severe cases, it can lead to tooth loss and decay. Regularly brushing at least twice a day and flossing once a day (don't lie to your dentist! She knows when you do!) can generally prevent gum disease. A professional deep clean once every six months can also keep this disease at bay. If your tooth pain is associated with bloody gums, visit your dentist. He or she may suggest additional oral health care, such as a daily mouthwash, or a procedure to save your teeth in severe cases. An intense, throbbing pain in your tooth that isn't associated with eating may indicate you're dealing with a tooth infection. A tooth infection occurs when bacteria invades the tooth's pulp, which is the inner part of the tooth, where the connective tissue, nerves, and blood vessels are located. Infections are serious because they can spread to other parts of your body if left untreated. According to the , poor dental hygiene, dry mouth, or a diet that's high in sugar can cause a tooth infection. If you're feeling an intense, throbbing pain in your tooth, make an emergency dentist appointment as soon as you can. Your dentist needs to treat the infection so it doesn't spread, which may mean draining the abscess and prescribing antibiotics. If your tooth pain is associated with pressure, it may indicate that your wisdom teeth are giving you trouble. According to a study by , 10 million wisdom teeth are extracted every year in the United States. Your wisdom teeth do most of their growing and changing when you're 16 to 23 years of age. If they seemed to grow normally throughout these years, your dentist at the time may have opted to let them stay in. However, when you get older, they can still begin to crowd your other teeth. If your wisdom teeth grew in at an angle, they're more susceptible to infections or tooth decay, which can cause other problems in your mouth if they aren't taken out. Go see your dentist so he or she can take x-rays of your mouth and see what's going on with your wisdom teeth. If they're starting to crowd your other teeth or don't look healthy, you may need to get them removed for your tooth pain and pressure to finally go away. Saliva protects you from bacteria and a dry mouth can exacerbate any problems you're having with your teeth, since it allows bacteria to grow; the bacteria has a perfect environment to thrive in. Dry mouth can be caused by certain medications and can make it hard to spit, talk, or speak. According to the , you should avoid cigarettes, alcohol, and caffeine because they can make your dry mouth worse. Practice regular brushing and flossing and try to keep your mouth salivated by sipping water or sucking on sugar-free hard candy. Visit your dentist immediately so he or can find the source of your tooth pain. Your dentist can also prescribe medications to counteract your dry mouth and keep your teeth healthy. If you recently underwent dental surgery, your jaw may swell a bit as you heal. However, if you haven't had any work done recently and you notice a swelling of your jaw or neck in addition to your tooth pain, it can be a sign that you have a tooth abscess. Your tooth is infected and has caused a buildup of pus and bacteria, which has spread to your jaw or neck. The infection can also spread to other teeth, surrounding bones, and in severe cases, your ears or brain. If your tooth pain is accompanied by jaw or neck swelling, you need to seek emergency dental treatment. An abscess never goes away on its own. Your dentist must provide treatment, which may involve a root canal or tooth extraction, and you may need to take antibiotics to stop the infection from spreading. Any tooth you have is susceptible to chipping, but according to a study published by the , the lower second molar is the most frequently chipped tooth. This may be because it takes the most pressure when you chew or bite down. If you don't address the chip in your tooth, you may suffer from extreme sensitivity to hot and cold foods and a toothache forever. A chipped tooth can indicate that your roots and nerves are exposed to the air, making your mouth extremely sensitive to anything it comes in contact with. Visit your dentist as soon as you can for a treatment plan to fix your chipped tooth. He or she may suggest a crown, bonding, or a veneer to make your tooth whole again. Not only will this alleviate your tooth pain, it'll also help improve your smile. If you have tooth pain and the tooth itself feels loose, it's a sign of advanced gum disease, also called periodontal disease. We already know how bad this disease is for your mouth and the trouble it can cause when it spreads, so it's important to get it taken care of right away. A loose tooth can also occur if you have a cavity or tooth decay that you haven't had treated. According to the , about 1 in every 5 adults who are aged 65 or older have lost all of their teeth. Don't become a statistic! Visit your dentist so he or she can figure out if you have periodontal disease or cavities. The sooner you get treatment for the problem, the more likely it is your tooth can be saved. A jaw that's consistently sore or that clicks when you open your mouth may indicate that you're developing temporomandibular joint disorder, commonly referred to as TMJ. This disorder can occur if you clench or grind your teeth frequently. It may also be a result of arthritis or simply caused by genetics. According to the , in addition to a sore or clicking jaw, you may also feel: Locking of the jaw, making it hard to open or close your mouth. This condition can lead to the worsening of arthritis, jaw injury, or damage to the connective tissues around the jaw. Make an appointment with a specialist if your jaw is sore, clicking, or generally causing you pain. He or she can provide you with strategies to combat or alleviate the symptoms of TMJ. He or she may also take an x-ray to understand the extent of your TMJ and surgery may be recommended if it's severe. A constant and persistent toothache is not only annoying, it can also be a sign of something more serious. If your consistent pain is centralized to one area and accompanied by swollen or inflamed gums, it could indicate you have a foreign substance stuck in your gums. Try to floss thoroughly and see if you feel better. If your dull pain is generalized throughout your entire mouth, it may mean you're grinding your teeth at night. This can be dangerous because it can lead to chipped or broken teeth or the onset of TMJ. Try to record when and where you feel this dull, consistent toothache. Visit your dentist so he or she can investigate further and provide you with the right treatment. Your dentist might find an infection or abscess that needs to be treated. If teeth grinding is to blame, he or she or may recommend wearing a nightguard. Inflammation is an indicator that your body is fighting off bacteria and infection, and inflamed gums along with tooth pain are clear signs that you have gum disease. If your gums are swollen, your gum disease may already be severe and regular brushing and flossing just won't cut it. According to a study published in the , women who carried bacteria that's known to cause periodontal disease were more likely to have more severe oral bone loss than women who didn't carry these pathogens. According to the , severe gum disease affects about 9% of adults and it can ruin your oral bones and gums, leading to tooth loss. It must be treated by a dentist, so you'll need to make an appointment right away to seek treatment. Mild sensitivity to hot and cold is normal for many people, especially as you age. However, intense, throbbing pain when biting into hot or cold food is something to be concerned about. According to , from Penn Dental Medicine, this sensitivity may be due to an exposure of the root structure in one or more of your teeth. This leaves the nerves of your teeth completely exposed, so it makes sense that hot or cold would trigger a painful reaction. Be sure you aren't brushing too hard and try to stay away from extremely hot or cold foods. Use a toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth and go see your dentist as soon as possible to see if you have exposed roots that can be fixed. Although they're attached to your jawbone with a periodontal ligament and cementum, your teeth can move and shift in your mouth at any time. According to the (AAO), teeth generally move forward with age, but other factors can cause them to move faster. A decrease in tooth enamel can affect the movement of your teeth, the alignment of your bite, and even the shape of your pearly whites. As your teeth move, change, and shift, they can create small spaces and crevices that are hard to reach with floss or a toothbrush. This makes it easy for bacteria to grow, which can cause gum disease and infection. Your tooth alignment change may be what's causing your toothache to begin with. If bacteria has caused tooth pain, your dentist will need to get involved. You may need an antibiotic and a deep cleaning to prevent the spread of the infection. If your alignment has changed drastically, you may need braces to prevent overcrowding or tooth damage. If you notice that your teeth look flat and worn down, you might be grinding them at night. This condition is also referred to as bruxism and according to the , it affects 10% of adults and 15% of children. It can be caused by stress or genetics and usually decreases with age for most people. You may not even realize you grind your teeth at night, but jaw or tooth pain, along with a flatter bite can be good indicators that you're a nightly grinder. Bruxism can wear down your enamel, cause TMJ, and in some severe cases, it can even break your teeth. Try to eliminate possible stressors from your life so you can get more restful sleep. You'll also need to consult your dentist about teeth grinding. If he or she agrees with your diagnosis, you may be fitted for a custom mouthguard to wear at night. This will prevent your teeth from making contact and can save you from broken teeth, tooth pain, or a sore jaw. A fever along with tooth pain indicates an infection. If you notice pain in a centralized location, there may be a tooth or gum infection from a food particle or a buildup of bacteria and plaque. You may even be able to see a bump on an area of your gums. This is an abscess that's filled with pus from the infection. In addition to your fever, you may also experience nausea and vomiting. If your tooth pain is accompanied by a fever, your tooth infection is severe and you may need to seek emergency treatment. According to the (HCUP), over 900,000 emergency department visits and nearly 13,000 hospital inpatient stays in one year were related to dental conditions. Your abscess may need to be drained and you may need to be placed on antibiotics. You may also be required to visit your dentist for a root canal or to get your tooth pulled if it's not salvageable. If you notice white sores on your mouth or tongue, it may indicate a type of oral cancer. According to the , oral cancer is more common in people over the age of 40 but it's always a good idea to have your dentist check at every exam. In 2012, the , reported about 40,000 new cases of cancer of the oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers. Oral cancers are more common in those who smoke or drink heavily. If left untreated, oral cancer can spread to other parts of the body and be life threatening. If you notice white spots or sores around your mouth, on your gums, or on your tongue, make an appointment with your doctor. In the meantime, avoid spicy foods, tobacco products, and alcohol. Your doctor will examine these areas and may need to biopsy them. If you're diagnosed with oral cancer, you may need to get surgery to remove these cancerous cells. You may also need to undergo additional treatment, such as radiation or chemotherapy I'm a Doctor and This Vitamin May Reduce Your COVID Risk If your toothache is only brought on by sugary foods, a weakening of your tooth enamel may be to blame. Our tooth enamel disappears as we age. But if you brush too intensely or with a hard-bristled toothbrush, you could be making your tooth enamel wear off prematurely. Without this enamel protecting your teeth, the sugar in sweet foods can make direct contact with the nerve endings in your teeth, causing you pain. Ask your dentist about your sensitivity to all things sweet. You may need to use a toothbrush with softer bristles and you may need to adapt a more gentle brushing technique. Your dentist may also suggest toothpaste specifically designed for sensitive teeth to ensure the rest of your enamel isn't threatened. If your tooth pain is accompanied by bad breath that won't go away, it's another indicator that you're suffering from gum disease. When bacteria grows on your gum line and your gums begin to recede from your teeth, it can produce an unpleasant smell. Even if you don't notice any changes in your gum line, your dentist can identify gum disease with a tiny ruler that measures small pockets in your gums. While bad breath doesn't seem like a threat to your health, gum disease and a mouth full of bacteria can increase your risk for serious health conditions. According to the , poor oral health can be linked to an increased risk for: Excessive mouth bacteria can cause an infection in the inner lining of your heart chambers or valves. Severe gum disease may be linked to low birth weight and premature birth. Some scientists believe there's a link between gum disease and heart disease, stroke, or clogged arteries. If certain mouth bacteria are pulled in your lungs, it can cause pneumonia or other respiratory conditions. If you have chronic bad breath, visit your dentist for a thorough cleaning and x-rays. If gum disease is the culprit, you need to stick to a stricter oral health routine that includes regular flossing and brushing. Regular cleanings and checkups are also important to prevent gum disease from getting worse. Your dentist may be able to prescribe mouthwash or toothpaste designed to kill the bacteria causing your gum disease and bad breath. If you feel pain when you suck in air, it means your tooth enamel is worn away, which can be an indication that you have a cavity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 90% of adults aged 20 to 64 years had at least one cavity. Cavities occur when plaque and tartar are left on your tooth enamel. As bacteria consume this plaque and tartar, acid is produced, which wears away at your tooth enamel and creates a tiny hole in your tooth. This tiny hole can be the source of that sharp pain you feel as your suck in air or bite down on food. In some cases, however, you may not even feel pain when you have a cavity. If left untreated, cavities can lead to tooth decay or an infection. Once you have a cavity, there's no home remedy to get rid of it. You must visit your dentist so he or she can drill out the decay within the hole and replace it with a filling. If the source of your tooth pain is a cracked or damaged filling or crown, don't ignore it. While it may seem like an ailment that can wait, damage to your filling or crown can cause deeper, more serious issues. If your dental work is compromised, it leaves your teeth vulnerable to bacteria. When your crown is loose or your filling has been cracked, you simply can't reach these small crevices with floss or your toothbrush, so bacteria continues to fester and multiply. Before you know it, your tooth can become infected, which can cause severe tooth pain and other problems. If your filling has been cracked or damaged, your dentist may need to start over and replace it with a new one. If the tooth itself has damage, you may also need a crown to ensure there are no exposed cracks for bacteria to thrive. A loose crown may also need to be removed and replaced to ensure there's solid contact between the tooth and the material.

When severe it may impact sleep, eating, and other daily activities. Common causes include , (usually in response to , , or other factors), , (inflammation of the and around the root apex), (localized collections of ), (""dry socket"", a possible complication of ), (a gum infection), and . Pulpitis is reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts for a short time after a stimulus (for instance cold); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute of a lower , and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of (gum disease). Less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as , which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or , which can cause pain in the lower teeth. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. Proper helps to prevent toothache by preventing dental disease. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a , , , drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. Toothache is the most common type of It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of as the first specialty of medicine. Toothache may be caused by () conditions (such as those involving the dentin-pulp complex or ), or by () conditions (such as or ). There are many possible non-dental causes, but the vast majority of toothache is dental in origin. Both the pulp and periodontal ligament have (pain receptors), but the pulp lacks (motion or position receptors) and (mechanical pressure receptors). Consequently, pain originating from the dentin-pulp complex tends to be poorly localized, whereas pain from the periodontal ligament will typically be well localized, although not always. For instance, the periodontal ligament can detect the pressure exerted when biting on something smaller than a grain of sand (10–30 µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down to a group of three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli. of dental caries and resultant toothache and odontogenic infection. The majority of pulpal toothache falls into one of the following types; however, other rare causes (which do not always fit neatly into these categories) include and . (inflammation of the pulp) can be triggered by various stimuli (insults), including mechanical, thermal, chemical, and bacterial irritants, or rarely and . Common causes include tooth decay, dental trauma (such as a crack or fracture), or a filling with an imperfect seal. Because the pulp is encased in a rigid outer shell, there is no space to accommodate swelling caused by inflammation. Inflammation therefore increases pressure in the pulp system, potentially compressing the blood vessels which supply the pulp. This may lead to (lack of oxygen) and (tissue death). Pulpitis is termed when the inflamed pulp is capable of returning to a state of health, and when is inevitable. Reversible pulpitis is characterized by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, such as when dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin () have been produced inside the pulp chamber, insulating against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold. is a sharp, short-lasting dental pain occurring in about 15% of the population, which is triggered by cold (such as liquids or air), sweet or spicy foods, and beverages. Teeth will normally have some sensation to these triggers, but what separates hypersensitivity from regular tooth sensation is the intensity of the pain. Hypersensitivity is most commonly caused by a lack of insulation from the triggers in the mouth due to (receding gums) exposing the roots of the teeth, although it can occur after or , or as a result of . The pulp of the tooth remains normal and healthy in dentin hypersensitivity. Many topical treatments for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the exposed dentin surface. Treatment of the is critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and the exposed dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity. In general, chronic periodontal conditions do not cause any pain. Rather, it is acute inflammation which is responsible for the pain. Apical abscess associated with roots of a lower molar. is acute or chronic inflammation around the apex of a tooth caused by an to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a , non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial reach the region around the roots of the tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing , sensitization of nerves, (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation. The periodontal ligament becomes inflamed and there may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth. An of approximately 1.5 mm shown between two posterior teeth. The meat, at right, was recovered from the open contact more than 8 hours after the person had last eaten meat, even though they had brushed the teeth twice since. Food impaction occurs when food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is pushed into the gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an ). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain and a feeling of pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation. Lateral periodontal abscess (blue arrows) due to a fracture (green arrows) A (lateral abscess) is a collection of pus that forms in the , usually as a result of chronic periodontitis where the pockets are pathologically deepened greater than 3mm. A healthy gingival pocket will contain bacteria and some kept in check by the . As the pocket deepens, the balance is disrupted, and an acute inflammatory response results, forming pus. The debris and swelling then disrupt the normal flow of fluids into and out of the pocket, rapidly accelerating the inflammatory cycle. Larger pockets also have a greater likelihood of collecting food debris, creating additional sources of infection. Periodontal abscesses are less common than apical abscesses, but are still frequent. The key difference between the two is that the pulp of the tooth tends to be alive, and will respond normally to pulp tests. However, an untreated periodontal abscess may still cause the pulp to die if it reaches the tooth apex in a . A periodontal abscess can occur as the result of tooth fracture, food packing into a periodontal pocket (with poorly shaped fillings), calculus build-up, and lowered immune responses (such as in ). Periodontal abscess can also occur after periodontal scaling, which causes the gums to tighten around the teeth and trap debris in the pocket. Toothache caused by a periodontal abscess is generally deep and throbbing. The covering an early periodontal abscess appears (red), , shiny, and . A variant of the periodontal abscess is the gingival abscess, which is limited to the gingival margin, has a quicker onset, and is typically caused by trauma from items such as a fishbone, toothpick, or toothbrush, rather than chronic periodontitis. The treatment of a periodontal abscess is similar to the management of dental abscesses in general (see: ). However, since the tooth is typically alive, there is no difficulty in accessing the source of infection and, therefore, antibiotics are more routinely used in conjunction with . The occurrence of a periodontal abscess usually indicates advanced periodontal disease, which requires correct management to prevent recurrent abscesses, including daily cleaning below the gumline to prevent the buildup of subgingival and calculus. Mild presentation of ANUG on the gums of the lower front teeth Common marginal in response to subgingival plaque is usually a painless condition. However, an acute form of gingivitis/periodontitis, termed (ANUG), can develop, often suddenly. It is associated with severe periodontal pain, bleeding gums, ""punched out"" ulceration, loss of the , and possibly also (bad breath) and a bad taste. Predisposing factors include poor , smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress, and immunosuppression. This condition is not contagious, but multiple cases may simultaneously occur in populations who share the same risk factors (such as students in a dormitory during a period of examination). ANUG is treated over several visits, first with of the necrotic gingiva, homecare with mouthwash, analgesics and, when the pain has subsided sufficiently, cleaning below the gumline, both professionally and at home. Antibiotics are not indicated in ANUG management unless there is underlying systemic disease. An operculum (green arrow) over a partially erupted lower left third molar tooth. There is minimal inflammation and recurrent swelling. A radiograph of the above tooth showing chronic pericoronitis, operculum (blue arrow) and bone destruction (red arrow) from chronic inflammation. Tooth is slightly disto-angular. is inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which is an area that is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection. results from excessive biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with , the (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, there may be (), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the . Occlusal trauma often occurs when a newly placed is built too ""high"", concentrating the biting forces on one tooth. Height differences measuring less than a millimeter can cause pain. Dentists, therefore, routinely check that any new restoration is in harmony with the bite and forces are distributed correctly over many teeth using . If the high spot is quickly eliminated, the pain disappears and there is no permanent harm. Over-tightening of can cause periodontal pain and, occasionally, a periodontal abscess. is a complication of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) in which the blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to four days after the extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis. Crown-root fracture with pulp involvement (left). Extracted (right). refers to a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and has given way to the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them). When toothache results from (regardless of the exact pulpal or periodontal diagnosis), the treatment and prognosis is dependent on the extent of damage to the tooth, the stage of development of the tooth, the degree of displacement or, when the tooth is avulsed, the time out of the socket and the starting health of the tooth and bone. Because of the high variation in treatment and prognosis, dentists often use trauma guides to help determine prognosis and direct treatment decisions. The prognosis for a cracked tooth varies with the extent of the fracture. Those cracks that are irritating the pulp but do not extend through the pulp chamber can be amenable to stabilizing dental restorations such as a crown or . Should the fracture extend though the pulp chamber and into the root, the prognosis of the tooth is hopeless. Apical abscesses can spread to involve periodontal pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen at the bottom of the tooth. Such lesions are termed , and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor. Discomfort caused by coronary artery disease can radiate to the neck, lower jaw and teeth Non-dental causes of toothache are much less common as compared with dental causes. In a toothache of neurovascular origin, pain is reported in the teeth in conjunction with a . Local and distant structures (such as ear, brain, , or heart) can also to the teeth. Other non-dental causes of toothache include (muscle pain) and (which classically refers pain to the lower jaw). Very rarely, toothache can be in origin. Disorders of the can be referred to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and of the sinus (such as ) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon or tilting the head forward. Painful conditions which do not originate from the teeth or their supporting structures may affect the oral mucosa of the gums and be interpreted by the individual as toothache. Examples include neoplasms of the gingival or (usually ), conditions which cause and . Various conditions may involve the alveolar bone, and cause non-odontogenic toothache, such as , in the jaws caused by , and . Various conditions of the trigeminal nerve can masquerade as toothache, including trigeminal (maxillary or mandibular division), , , and trigeminal . Very rarely, a might cause toothache. Another chronic facial pain syndrome which can mimic toothache is (temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome), which is very common. Toothache which has no identifiable dental or medical cause is often termed , which, in turn, is usually considered a type of atypical facial pain (or persistent idiopathic facial pain). Atypical odontalgia may give very unusual symptoms, such as pain which migrates from one tooth to another and which crosses anatomical boundaries (such as from the left teeth to the right teeth). 1: crown, 2: root, 3: enamel, 4: dentin and dentin tubules, 5: pulp chamber, 6: blood vessels and nerve within root canal, 7: periodontal ligament, 8: apex and periapical region, 9: alveolar bone.

A tooth is composed of an outer shell of hard (from hardest to softest: , , and ), and an inner core (the pulp system), which contains and . The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth – the crowns (covered by enamel) – are anchored into the bone by the (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms the bulk of the tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the , and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are , exiting through one or more holes at the root end (/foramina). The connects the roots to the bony socket. The covers the , the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws. Enamel is not a vital tissue, as it lacks blood vessels, nerves, and living cells. Consequently, pathologic processes involving only enamel, such as shallow cavities or cracks, tend to be painless. Dentin contains many microscopic tubes containing fluid and the processes of cells, which communicate with the pulp. Mechanical, , or other stimuli cause movement of this fluid, triggering nerves in the pulp (the "" theory"" of pulp sensitivity). Due to the close relationship between dentin and pulp, they are frequently considered together as the . The teeth and gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are generally sharp, lasting as long as the stimulus. There is a continuous spectrum from physiologic sensation to pain in disease. Pain is an unpleasant sensation caused by intense or damaging events. In a toothache, nerves are stimulated by either sources (for instance, bacterial toxins, byproducts, chemicals, or trauma) or factors (such as ). The pain pathway is mostly transmitted via (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the , which supplies sensation to the teeth and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (). The physical component of pain is processed in the and perceived in the . Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable. The diagnosis of toothache can be challenging, not only because the list of potential causes is extensive, but also because dental pain may be extremely variable, and pain can be referred to and from the teeth. Dental pain can simulate virtually any facial pain syndrome. However, the vast majority of toothache is caused by dental, rather than non-dental, sources. Consequently, the saying """" has been applied to the of orofacial pain. That is, everyday dental causes (such as pulpitis) should always be considered before unusual, non-dental causes (such as myocardial infarction). In the wider context of orofacial pain, all cases of orofacial pain may be considered as having a dental origin until proven otherwise. The diagnostic approach for toothache is generally carried out in the following sequence: , followed by , and . All this information is then collated and used to build a clinical picture, and a differential diagnosis can be carried out. The , and the onset of the complaint, are usually important in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the (see table). From the history, indicators of pulpal, periodontal, a combination of both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor may be involved in the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold. Non-dental sources of pain often cause multiple teeth to hurt and have an epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, it is possible that dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark is that there is no obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain. Irreversible pulpitis progresses to pulp necrosis, wherein the nerves are non-functional, and a pain-free period following the severe pain of irreversible pulpitis may be experienced. However, it is common for irreversible pulpitis to progress to apical periodontitis, including an acute apical abscess, without treatment. As irreversible pulpitis generates an apical abscess, the character of the toothache may simply change without any pain-free period. For instance, the pain becomes well localized, and biting on the tooth becomes painful. Hot drinks can make the tooth feel worse because they expand the gases and likewise, cold can make it feel better, thus some will sip cold water. The clinical examination narrows the source down to a specific tooth, teeth, or a non-dental cause. Clinical examination moves from the outside to the inside, and from the general to the specific. Outside of the mouth, the , muscles of the and , the , and are palpated for pain or swelling. In the mouth, the soft tissues of the , , , and are examined for redness, swelling or deformity. Finally, the teeth are examined. Each tooth that may be painful is percussed (tapped), palpated at the base of the root, and probed with a for dental caries and a periodontal probe for , then wiggled for mobility. Sometimes the symptoms reported in the history are misleading and point the examiner to the wrong area of the mouth. For instance, sometimes people may mistake pain from pulpitis in a lower tooth as pain in the upper teeth, and . In other instances, the apparent examination findings may be misleading and lead to the wrong diagnosis and wrong treatment. Pus from a pericoronal abscess associated with a lower third molar may drain along the plane and discharge as a over the roots of the teeth towards the front of the mouth (a ""migratory abscess""). Another example is decay of the tooth root which is hidden from view below the gumline, giving the casual appearance of a sound tooth if careful periodontal examination is not carried out. Factors indicating infection include movement of fluid in the tissues during palpation (), , and fever with an oral temperature more than 37.7 °C. Any tooth that is identified, in either the history of pain or base clinical exam, as a source for toothache may undergo further testing for vitality of the dental pulp, infection, fractures, or periodontitis. These tests may include: Pulp sensitivity tests, usually carried out with a cotton wool sprayed with to serve as a cold stimulus, or with an . The air spray from a three-in-one syringe may also be used to demonstrate areas of dentin hypersensitivity. Heat tests can also be applied with hot . A healthy tooth will feel the cold but the pain will be mild and disappear once the stimulus is removed. The accuracy of these tests has been reported as 86% for cold testing, 81% for electric pulp testing, and 71% for heat testing. Because of the lack of , a second symptom should be present or a positive test before making a diagnosis. utilized to find dental caries and bone loss laterally or at the apex. Assessment of biting on individual teeth (which sometimes helps to localize the problem) or the separate cusps (may help to detect cracked cusp syndrome). Less commonly used tests might include trans-illumination (to detect congestion of the maxillary sinus or to highlight a crack in a tooth), dyes (to help visualize a crack), a test cavity, selective anaesthesia and . Pulp sensibility test using ethyl chloride (cold stimulus) Plastic wedge to identify pain on biting from a fractured tooth Establishing a diagnosis of nondental toothache is initially done by careful questioning about the site, nature, aggravating and relieving factors, and referral of the pain, then ruling out any dental causes. There are no specific treatments for nondental pain (each treatment is directed at the cause of the pain, rather than the toothache itself), but a dentist can assist in offering potential sources of the pain and direct the patient to appropriate care. The most critical nondental source is the radiation of into the lower teeth and the potential need for urgent cardiac care. Well localized, associated with partially impacted tooth From pain of reversible pulpitis to no pain in days Gradual, typically follows weeks of thermal pain in tooth Dull, aching, occasional thermal sensitivity in back top teeth Patient may complain of receding gums and/or toothbrush abrasion cavities May follow report of something getting ""stuck"" in gum Tension headaches, neck pain, periods of stress or episode of mouth open for long period Hypersensitivity as long as stimulus is applied; often worse in cold weather Absence of pain following days or weeks of intense, well localized pain Pain on biting following constant dull, aching pain development Dull ache with acute increase in pain when tooth is moved, minimal thermal sensitivity Spontaneous, worse with eating, chewing, or movement of jaw Same as irreversible pulpitis, or no response to cold, lingering pain to hot, pain with biting or lying down Tapping tooth makes worse, cleansing area may improve pain Rest or ice makes pain better, movement and chewing make it worse Tilting head forward, jarring movements (jumping) make pain worse Variable; pain dissipates until periapical tissue affected When it becomes extremely painful and decayed the tooth may be known as a . Since most toothache is the result of , such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a diet and maintenance of good . That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with toothpaste and . Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of in . Root canal treatment (blue arrows) carried out on the lower right first molar with temporary restoration in place Incision of an abscess above a front tooth and insertion of a Odontogenic infection involving the . Above, deformation of the cheek on the second day. Below, deformation on the third day. There are many causes of toothache and its diagnosis is a specialist topic, meaning that attendance at a dentist is usually required. Since many cases of toothache are inflammatory in nature, (NSAIDs) may help (unless , such as with a ). Generally, NSAIDs are as effective as alone or in combination with . However, simple analgesics may have little effect on some causes of toothache, and the severe pain can drive individuals to exceed the maximum dose. For example, when (paracetamol) is taken for toothache, an accidental overdose is more likely to occur when compared to people who are taking acetaminophen for other reasons. Another risk in persons with toothache is a painful chemical burn of the caused by holding a caustic substance such as aspirin tablets and toothache remedies containing (such as ) against the gum. Although the logic of placing a tablet against the painful tooth is understandable, an aspirin tablet needs to be swallowed to have any pain-killing effect. Caustic toothache remedies require careful application to the tooth only, without coming into excessive contact with the soft tissues of the mouth. For the dentist, the goal of treatment generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on the cause of the toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as and is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement. In pulpitis, an important distinction in regard to treatment is whether the inflammation is reversible or irreversible. Treatment of reversible pulpitis is by removing or correcting the causative factor. Usually, the decay is removed, and a sedative dressing is used to encourage the pulp to return to a state of health, either as a base underneath a permanent filling or as a temporary filling intended to last for a period while the tooth is observed to see if pulpitis resolves. Irreversible pulpitis and its sequalae pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis require treatment with root canal therapy or tooth extraction, as the pulp acts as a of infection, which will lead to a chronic infection if not removed. Generally, there is no difference in outcomes between whether the root canal treatment is completed in one or multiple appointments. The field of is now developing ways to clean the pulp chamber and regenerate the soft and hard tissues to either regrow or simulate pulp structure. This has proved especially helpful in children where the tooth root has not yet finished developing and root canal treatments have lower success rates. Reversible/irreversible pulpitis is a distinct concept from whether the tooth is restorable or unrestorable, e.g. a tooth may only have reversible pulpitis, but has been structurally weakened by decay or trauma to the point that it is impossible to restore the tooth in the long term. A general principle concerning dental abscesses is (""where there is pus, drain it""), which applies to any case where there is a collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste. Antibiotics tend to be extensively used for emergency dental problems. As samples for microbiologic are hardly ever carried out in general dental practice, such as are typically used for a short course of about three to seven days. Antibiotics are seen as a ""quick fix"" by both dentists, who generally only have a very short time to manage dental emergencies, and by patients, who tend to want to avoid treatments (such as tooth extraction) which are perceived negatively. However, antibiotics typically only temporarily suppress an infection, and the need for definitive treatment is only postponed for an unpredictable length of time. An estimated 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions are made by dentists, a major factor in . They are often used inappropriately, in conditions for which they are ineffective, or their risks outweigh the benefits, such as irreversible pulpitis, apical abscess, dry socket, or mild pericoronitis. However, the reality is that antibiotics are rarely needed, and they should be used restrictively in dentistry. Local measures such as incision and drainage, and removal of the cause of the infection (such as a necrotic tooth pulp) have a greater therapeutic benefit and are much more important. If abscess drainage has been achieved, antibiotics are not usually necessary. Antibiotics tend to be used when local measures cannot be carried out immediately. In this role, antibiotics suppress the infection until local measures can be carried out. Severe trismus may occur in when the are involved in an odontogenic infection, making any surgical treatment impossible. individuals are less able to fight off infections, and antibiotics are usually given. Evidence of systemic involvement (such as a fever higher than 38.5 °C, cervical lymphadenopathy, or ) also indicates antibiotic therapy, as do rapidly spreading infections, , or severe pericoronitis. and are signs that the airway may be threatened, and may precede . and are rare but serious complications of odontogenic infections. Severe infections tend to be managed in hospital. Most dental pain can be treated with routine dentistry. In rare cases, toothache can be a symptom representing a life-threatening condition, such as a deep neck infection (compression of the by a spreading ) or something more remote like a heart attack. Dental caries, if left untreated, follows a predictable as it nears the pulp of the tooth. First it causes reversible pulpitis, which transitions to irreversible pulpitis, then to necrosis, then to necrosis with periapical periodontitis and, finally, to necrosis with periapical abscess. Reversible pulpitis can be stopped by removal of the cavity and the placement of a of any part of the cavity that is near the pulp chamber. Irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis are treated with either root canal therapy or extraction. Infection of the periapical tissue will generally resolve with the treatment of the pulp, unless it has expanded to or a . The success rate of restorative treatment and sedative dressings in reversible pulpitis, depends on the extent of the disease, as well as several technical factors, such as the sedative agent used and whether a rubber dam was used. The success rate of root canal treatment also depends on the degree of disease (root canal therapy for irreversible pulpitis has a generally higher success rate than necrosis with periapical abscess) and many other technical factors. In the United States, an estimated 12% of people reported that they had a toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher rates toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults. Toothache may occur at any age, in any gender and in any geographic region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without ). , patron saint for toothaches, holds one of her own extracted teeth in a pair of forceps (, , 1493) American advertisement from 1885 offering ""instantaneous cure"" for toothache with ""Cocaine toothache drops"". was the first , but its addictive and other dangerous side effects eventually led to its use being virtually abandoned by modern health care. A monk with a toothache examines himself in a mirror, painting by from 1875. The first known mention of tooth decay and toothache occurs on a clay tablet now referred to as the ""Legend of the worm"". It was written in , recovered from the valley, and dates from around 5000 BC. The belief that tooth decay and dental pain is caused by is found in ancient India, Egypt, Japan, and China, and persists until the . Although toothache is an ancient problem, it is thought that ancient people suffered less dental decay due to a lack of refined sugars in their diet. On the other hand, diets were frequently coarser, leading to more tooth wear. For example, hypotheses hold that ancient Egyptians had a lot of tooth wear due to desert sand blown on the wind mixing with the dough of their bread. The ancient Egyptians also wore to prevent toothache. The (1500 BC) details a recipe to treat ""gnawing of the blood in the tooth"", which included fruit of the gebu plant, onion, cake, and dough, to be chewed for four days. of Apamea describes use of a mouthwash made by boiling and hallicacabum in vinegar, and a mixture of roasted earthworms, ointment, and crushed spider eggs. advises toothache sufferers to ask a frog to take away the pain by moonlight. ' physician recommends ""fumigations made with the seeds of the scattered on burning charcoal  ... followed by rinsings of the mouth with hot water, in this way  ... small worms are expelled."" In Christianity, is the patron saint of toothache and other dental problems. She was an early Christian who was persecuted for her beliefs in during the . A mob struck her repeatedly in the face until all her teeth were smashed. She was threatened with being burned alive unless she renounced Christianity, but she instead chose to throw herself onto the fire. Supposedly, toothache sufferers who invoke her name will find relief. In the 15th century, priest-physician describes a ""deworming technique"" for the teeth: ""And if it [toothache] do come by worms, make a candle of wax with Henbane seeds and light it and let the perfume of the candle enter into the tooth and gape over a dish of cold water and then you may take the worms out of the water and kill them on your nail."" (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi) used for toothache, inserting a red-hot needle into the pulp of the tooth. The medieval surgeon used a , , , and mixture to fill teeth and cure toothworm and toothache. French anatomist recommended: ""Toothache is, of all others, the most atrocious pain that can torment a man, being followed by death. Erosion (i.e. dental decay) is the effect of an acute and acrid humour. To combat this, one must recourse to cauterization  ... by means of cauterization  ... one burns the nerve, thus rendering it incapable of again feeling or causing pain."" In the , toothache was an ailment associated with lovers, as in and 's play . Toothache also appears in a number of 's plays, such as and . In , Act III scene 2, when asked by his companions why he is feeling sad, a character replies that he has toothache so as not to admit the truth that he is in love. There is reference to ""toothworm"" as the cause of toothache and to tooth extraction as a cure (""draw it""). In Act V, scene 1, another character remarks: ""For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently.""

5d4b81c2-9f8b-4058-957e-3542763065bf,"If wisdom teeth cause your teeth to get crooked Do your teeth get straight after you get your wisdom teeth extractions? Teeth tend to become more crowed as we age, especially the lower front teeth. This happens in some people regardless of whether they have wisdom teeth or not. Therefore, removing the wisdom teeth, solely for the purpose of hoping to get naturally straighter teeth, won't work. Wisdom teeth do not necessarily crowd teeth. Some people who have had their wisdom teeth removed still get crowding, while others that still have their third molars erupted or impacted do not have crooked teeth. How do you make your wisdom teeth grow straight when there is no second molar? Unfortunately, there is no way to ""make"" your wisdom teeth grow in straight. If your other teeth are straight, then they may grow in straight. If you have a tendency towards crooked teeth, they they may grow crooked too. The good news is that not everyone has to have them removed if they grow in crooked. If there is sufficient room and they will not cause problems with the other teeth, they may not have to be removed. With no 2nd molar, there might be enough room that they do not have to be removed. The best person to make this determination is your dentist. No. However, not having them removed can. Wisdom teeth are teeth that are not needed. Our mouths were designed to have them but not need them. If they come in and are not straight they are called ""impacted"". When they become impacted they can cause danger to the roots of other teeth. This is when they need to be removed. Yes, extractions can cause TMJ if they are taken from the lower jaw. It depends on who you ask. The literature on dry sockets after wisdom teeth extractions reports a range from 5-20% dry socket occurence. Most experienced oral surgeons will see fewer than 10% dry socket rate after wisdom teeth extractions. The biggest determining factor to risk is experience of the surgeon. Which means that newbies will have more dry sockets than seasoned surgeons. A deviated septum can cause a nose to be crooked. This condition is caused by the septum of the nose being in the wrong place. NO! You should not smoke after any extractions. Smoking may cause something called a ""Dry Socket"" which can be extremely painful! Ask your dentist or oral surgeon how long you should wait before smoking. Can wisdom teeth cause other forward teeth to become cracked by pressure? No, that can't really happen. Teeth can get cracked my a number of different things.NoIt is very unlikely that front teeth get cracked due to pressure caussed by wisdom teeth. Usually it takes a trauma to crack a tooth. NOalthough they cannot crack your teeth, they WILL cause pressure and cause your other teeth pain and make them crooked Can impacted wisdom teeth cause vertigo and dizziness after four days after the extractions? Yes, it can. Many people aren't aware that impacted teeth, infected teeth also can involve the ear canal. This would cause vertigo and dizziness. Getting wisdom teeth pulled can be a trauma to the body and it may take a few days before you feel normal. If this keeps up please see your dentist. You could have infection. How long until you can use a straw after wisdom teeth extraction? It is recommended that you refrain from using a straw for at least ten days to two weeks following extractions. The reason is that anything that can cause suction pressure in the mouth can cause the blood clot in the socket to be lost prematurely. This can lead to a very painful condition known as a dry socket. A number of factors need to be considered before extracting wisdom teeth. Are the teeth causing pain or likely to cause pain in the future? Are the wisdom teeth decayed, fractured, or impacted? Are the wisdom teeth compromising or causing damage to other teeth or oral tissues? If the wisdom teeth remain, is it likely they will complicate other procedures such as orthodontics or crown placements? Is the patient young enough and healthy enough to undergo the surgery? Does the likely benefit of extracting the wisdom teeth outweigh the potential harm or complications of extractions? If any or all of these questions are answered 'yes' then extractions are usually indicated. Most people do not have enough room in their jaws for the wisdom teeth. Wisdom teeth are almost never necessary for proper chewing or attractive appearance. Wisdom teeth are often very difficult to adequately clean. On the flip side, there are other questions: Are there any contraindications (prohibitions) in the patient's medical, mental, emotional, or familial status? Does the patient, primary caregiver, or guardian withhold their consent? If these questions are answered 'yes' then extraction is not proper. If you are eleven and you are going to get braces is there any danger if your wisdom teeth are beginning to come in? Your orthodontist should be able to answer this question. In some cases, there is enough room for your wisdom teeth to come in without overcrowding. There shouldn't be any real ""danger"" except that they may cause your teeth to become crooked which is why most people have them removed eventually. Can erupting wisdom teeth cause pain in neighboring tooth? Yes, wisdom teeth coming in can cause headaches and soar throats too. Can wisdom teeth cause enlarged lymph nodes or an enlarged spleen? I had an enlarged spleen and enlarged lymph nodes and it turned out that I had Mono. I don't think your ""spleen"" has anything to do with your wisdom teeth coming in. But, in uncommon cases, infection to your wisdom teeth can sometimes cause enlarged lymph nodes, but only if the teeth are ""impacted"". A dental impaction is where an unearthed tooth is growing in crooked underneath the gumline. This also causes other dental problems such as crooked teeth. If the lymph nodes your are referring to are painless and are swelling with other symptoms, then you might have a serious condition, which also means you need to see a doctor immediately. The swelling in the lymph nodes in your neck are the ones to swell if your teeth are infected from an impaction. Also, only the lower teeth can cause lymph node swelling in your neck. The nodes will be tender, moveable, and causing pain in any way. Any kind of severe infection in your mouth, including a wisdom tooth infection, can cause your lymph nodes to become larger. The spleen should not be directly affected though. she was powerful cause she was the goddess of wisdom What is a dry socket when wisdom teeth are pulled? A dry socket is when the blood clot that is part of the healing process comes out. If this happens it could cause the healing to slow, and could also cause an infection. To avoid dislodging the clot :Avoid spitting for the first few daysDon't smoke.Don't drink soda or hot liquidsDon't drink through a strawFollow the Dental Surgeon's instructions and you will be fine. Most wisdom tooth extractions heal well and will soon become less sensitive. What bone causes the arm to be in a straight position? Bones will not cause the arm to be in a straight position, instead, muscle and tendons will cause the arm to be straight. Why do you need to get your wisdom teeth taken out? This is a common misconception about 3rd Molars (Wisdom teeth). Not every person who's third molars come in will need to have them removed. Sometimes they grow in perfectly normal in alignment and position and therefore do not present a problem. However, should the molars come in crooked (impacted) or have a high risk of pushing other teeth out of alignment, then they will need to be surgically removed. The main reason for third molar extraction is because of the reasons listed above, not only can they cause periodontal infections, they can cause other teeth to be pushed out of alignment, causing damage to not only the sockets but nerves. If a dentist says they should be removed, ask to look at the x-rays, If you see the teeth all the way in the back on top and bottom are sideways or crooked, then he's right. If you notice they are perfectly straight (like your normal molars) then the need for removal can wait. Can cracking your knuckles cause your fingers to go crooked? No. Cracking the knuckles does not damage tot he joint. Why does your throat hurt after pulling wisdom teeth? If you have general anaesthesia performed during your extractions, the anesthesiologists (or oral surgeons) place an endotracheal tube into your windpipe to help you breathe. This can cause the throat to become sore after it is removed. Even if you do not get intubated (have a tube placed into your throat), the tissues in your throat can become dehydrated, thus causing a sore throat. Can wisdom teeth cause problems such as swallowing and tightness in the throat? Wisdom teeth coming in does not normally cause swelling or tightness in the throat. The most common side effect is a sore jaw. There are several different things that can cause crooked toes. Some are hammertoe, badly fitting shoes, and high-arched feet where the tendon on the top of the foot pulls back on the toes. Please see the related link below for more information.

Bone spurs may grow following bone damage, or after bone loss like that caused by . Bone spurs commonly grow where bones meet, such as in the knees, spine, hips, and feet. In the mouth, bone spicules may occur following or other kinds of oral surgery. Some dentists may refer to these as bone sequestra. This is your body’s way of removing extra bone from the tooth extraction site. While uncomfortable, dental bone spicules usually aren’t a cause for concern. While bone spurs that occur in other parts of the body may cause no noticeable symptoms, bone spicules that occur in the mouth can be quite noticeable. discomfort (may feel like there are tiny, sharp flakes stuck in one area of your gums) , including There are several possible oral procedures that may cause dental bone spicules to form in your mouth. These procedures can cause trauma to the bone that lies under a tooth or teeth. Immediately after an oral procedure, the surrounding bone naturally begins to heal itself. But in some cases, there are fragments of bone left at the surgery site. The body sends these bone fragments away from the healing bone and out of your body through your gums. Procedures capable of causing bone spicules include: Tooth extraction is the removal of a tooth or teeth from your jawbones. Common for tooth extraction, including extraction, include: need to make room for an device, like braces preventing future tooth problems (as is the case with some wisdom teeth) surgery is the replacement of a tooth’s roots with a metal post shaped like a screw, and placement of artificial teeth on these posts.

A biopsy is the removal of bone or tissue from the body with a small needle or knife. A biopsy can detect if abnormal cells, like those that cause cancer, are present. Many dental specialists recommend that bone spicules be removed from the gums to prevent or treat infection, and to promote quicker healing. The surgery for removal of bone spicules in the mouth is usually brief and minimally invasive. If you’re having tooth extractions done, your dental surgeon may choose to do an alveoplasty at the same time, where extra instruments are used to smooth your jawbone. The device will grind off any pieces of jawbone that stick out following oral surgery and could possibly form into a spicule. Alveoloplasty isn’t a sure way to stop bone spicules from forming, but it’s commonly used as a preventative measure.

fd47aed0-44da-4881-ba88-6340c287ac01,"Wisdom teeth begin to come in between the ages of 17 into the mid twenties. Many people must get their wisdom teeth removed due to lack of room in their mouth. An adult that had they're wisdom teeth pulled or not come through then you have 32 teeth. But if you still have your wisdom teeth you have 36. Your wisdom teeth will normally come through at any time between the ages of 14 and 30. However, there have been cases where they have not come through until over 70 or 80 years old. Also, some people will never get their wisdom teeth through. You are 14 is it possible your wisdom tooth is coming through as you are suffering disscomfort at the back of your mouth where you are told wisdom teeth come through? Yes it possible. I am 13 and all 4 of my wisdom teeth are almost fully through. In fact I am having them taken out tomorrow morning........:( Sometimes when teeth are crowded, the wisdom teeth come after aging has caused teeth to narrow and make space, and then they come out! (Like my mum) Wisdom teeth are the last teeth to come through, generally around ages 16 to 18, and are found at the very back of the mouth. Impacted wisdom teeth are leaning back in the mouth and may still be mostly surrounded by bone. Wisdom teeth are the last of the adult teeth to come through the gum, usually between the ages of 18-25. Some people never develop any wisdom teeth whilst others develop one wisdom tooth in each of their four dental arches. No. Wisdom teeth should only be taken out if they are a problem. Is it OK to get braces if your wisdom teeth may come in soon? I don't know if it's OK. I have braces myself and my wisdom teeth are coming in right now. Unfortunatly, I have to get them pulled, if anything that's what would happen. You should wait until the wisdom teeth come in, and then get them pulled, because the metal bands may not fit around the wisdom teeth, and most people have more comfort when their wisdom teeth are pulled. I have braces and my wisdom teeth came through and my otho hasn't done anything to them. Can you get wisdom teeth come through in your 50's? Yes! I have never heard of it before until at the age of 50, three of my wisdom teeth came in. One never did come in. It was painful but I am not having them removed and they are fine. Wisdom teeth do not always require removal. Many people have wisdom teeth that have erupted normally and have not caused any problems. In some cases, however, wisdom teeth may be impacted. This means that there is not enough space in the jaw for the teeth to come in normally or to come in at all. Impacted wisdom teeth can become infected or interfere with other teeth. To prevent such problems impacted wisdom teeth are often removed. not everyones wisdom teeth come in at age thirteen just like how some peoples teeth fall out before others Most people say wisdom teeth come in when your 17-25 or 15-25 either one When your wisdom teeth are coming through can all your teeth be sore? It's highly possible. As the Wisdom Teeth are joined to your jaw the pain can feel like it's running through all your teeth. The teeth that are referred to as ""wisdom teeth"" are teeth numbered, 1, 16, 17, and 32. They are located the furthest in the back of the mouth. However, do not get these confused with the molars. The wisdom teeth come in where the gums are located. Can wisdom teeth come in when you are 65 years old? Wisdom teeth are the 3rd molars, or the last teeth in the back. Sometimes we can't feel them because they haven't come out, and they can only be detected on an x-ray. Usually a person has four wisdom teeth. I'm 15 years old and I have 24 teeth. Although it is usually between the ages of 17-21 that wisdom teeth start to grow, there are four more molars (one per side and jaw of your mouth) that should grow at this age and the wisdom teeth should come in at about late teens, early 20's, on average. Note there are some cases where wisdom teeth come early (I know someone the same age as me whose wisdom teeth came through 3 months ago) and others where they don't come through at all. :) kthxbi Adults can have a maximum of 32 teeth. The wisdom teeth or third molars are the last to come through, right at the back. They usually appear between the ages of 17 and 25. Although sometimes they appear many years later. Nowadays people often have jaws that are too small for all 32 teeth -- 28 is often the most we have room for. So if all the other teeth are present and healthy there may not be enough space for the wisdom teeth to come through properly. I am 75 1/2 and had a wisdom tooth that was trying to come through and had to have it extracted. My dentist said he had a man last year who was in his eighties. These are the very back molars in your mouth. Typically they come through around age 18. You are 30 and have had 3 wisdom teeth out will the other one stay dormant if it has not come through already? No way to tell, teeth behaviour isn't always possible to predict. Wisdom teeth are called wisdom teeth because you get them usually around 18 when you are a legal adult. Wisdom teeth are the third and last molars on each side of the upper and lower jaws. They are also the final teeth to erupt; they usually come in when a person is in their late teens or early twenties.

75c4eda9-0057-440c-8749-2f7aca71d046,"— Dental hygiene can fight bad breath and prevent gum disease. So it’s important to regularly brush and floss, and see a dentist twice a year for routine dental cleanings. Sometimes, though, a dentist will recommend deep teeth cleaning. Signs that you might need a deep cleaning include , , and loose teeth. Although a deep cleaning — also called or root planing — is common, it has its risks. Here’s what you need to know about deep cleaning teeth, including the disadvantages of this procedure. A deep teeth cleaning can remove a buildup of and on your teeth, reducing gum inflammation and improving gum health. Plaque is a sticky film that forms on teeth. It contains bacteria and develops when food particles mix with saliva. You can remove plaque, which collects on teeth daily, by brushing your teeth. Brushing, however, doesn’t remove all plaque in between your teeth. Leftover plaque calcifies or hardens, which forms tartar. The accumulation of plaque or tartar can lead to . This includes gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums. If left untreated, gingivitis can advance to . This is a serious infection that destroys the bone that supports the teeth. You might need a deep cleaning if gum disease causes your gums to pull away from your teeth, creating a space greater than 5 millimeters (mm) deep. If gum disease worsens, the space between your gums and teeth can continue to widen. This can weaken the bones that support your teeth, causing loose teeth or tooth loss. If your dentist recommends a deep cleaning, benefits of this procedure include: What are the disadvantages of deep cleaning teeth? Although deep cleaning can treat gum disease, the procedure has its risks. Disadvantages of deep cleaning teeth include: doesn’t guarantee the reattachment of your gums to your teeth possible infection if you have a compromised immune system Pain and sensitivity are the most common side effects. Risks from deep cleaning are usually minimal and only last about 5 to 7 days, though for extensive cases, this may extend to a few weeks. Deep teeth cleanings differ from routine teeth cleanings. Regular cleaning removes plaque and tartar from above the gumline. A deep cleaning, on the other hand, removes plaque and tartar from below the gumline. Gum disease causes a space or gap between your teeth and gums, where tartar and plaque can become trapped. Cleaning below the gumline removes this buildup. Deep cleaning involves gum scaling and root planing Deep cleanings usually take place over two or more visits and involve gum scaling and root planing. Each visit can take 1 to 2 hours. The tooth scaling appointment is when your dentist removes plaque and tartar from below the gumline. During the root planing visit, your dentist removes plaque and tarter that forms on the roots of your teeth. This helps reduce the size of the space between your teeth and gums, helping your gums reattach to the teeth. If your , you might have to take an antibiotic for a few days. That’s because there’s a risk of infection after the procedure. In addition, deep dental cleanings can sometimes release bacteria into the bloodstream. Teeth scaling and root planing can cause some discomfort, so you’ll receive a topical or local anesthetic to numb your gums. You can expect some sensitivity after your treatment. Your gums might swell, and you might have minor bleeding, too. Eating soft foods (yogurt, applesauce, or mashed potatoes) for a few days after your procedure can help reduce sensitivity. You should also avoid extremely hot or cold foods and drinks. Taking over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen can reduce inflammation, as well as rinsing with warm salt water. Brushing and flossing on a regular basis promote healing and reduce further gum inflammation. Use a soft bristle toothbrush , and . The cost of deep cleaning varies depending on the severity of gum disease or inflammation. You’ll likely have two visits, although some people might need up to four visits to completely remove tartar and plaque. During these cleanings, your mouth is considered in quadrants. You can pay $100 or more per quadrant depending on where you live or how much treatment you need. If you have dental insurance, most plans cover deep cleanings. A deep teeth cleaning helps get rid of bad breath and promotes healing of gum disease. Deep cleanings do have risks, so it’s important to understand possible complications or side effects. Although a common, safe procedure, you can expect some sensitivity and swelling afterward. If swelling, bleeding, or pain continues for more than a week after your procedure, see your dentist. — Teeth scaling is a deep dental cleaning that is often performed along with root planing.

Fairys come a sometimes they give you dreams. bite on your finger using the loose tooth and hold for 40 seconds. next wiggle it. it should be looser! i tried and now its about to come out Usually, a child will play with a tooth until it is loosened enough to come right out. They can try to pull it, but if it is causing pain stop. It will come out when it is ready, and shouldn't really hurt. Will a wisdom tooth come out itself when it is loose? Maybe,Because My mum has a wisdom tooth too and she had it itself grow out But idk!I need to ask my mum,I have a wisdom tooth too and im only 10!:( If it is very loose and when you push it with your tongue it moves/wiggles other wise it might not be quite ready to come out. Well, you have to shake it for a while and when you feel its about to come out, then it will be easy to shake it out. Don't worry, it won't hurt. What's the most outdated thing you still use today?

dcc53e7f-1b83-4457-82ab-bb3dac866d31,"— You may experience ear and jaw pain simultaneously for several reasons. Though these areas of your body are different, they’re close in proximity. A medical condition in your jaw, ear, or mouth can cause the pain, or you may also experience ear and jaw pain because of referred pain. This happens when a part of your body feels pain even though the source of the pain is located somewhere else. Below are some conditions that can cause pain in both your jaw and ears at the same time. One source of ear and jaw pain may be related to your temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This area includes not only the jaw joint but also the muscles surrounding it. The TMJ is adjacent to the temporal bone, which includes your inner ear. The TMJ does a lot of work, moving in many directions so you can chew and talk. Ear and jaw pain may occur from a TMJ disorder. of adults may experience a TMJ disorder. These disorders cause inflammation and pain in your TMJ. Facial pain and ear discomfort are the most common complaints of this condition. You may have a chronic TMJ disorder if you experience symptoms for longer than three months. You may develop a from wear and tear or because of another medical condition. In some cases, your doctor may suspect a TMJ disorder, but you actually have something else like: Ear and jaw pain could be caused by osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis in the TMJ. This condition develops from wear and tear over time to the cartilage surrounding the joint. You may feel stiffness in the joint as well as pain. These forms of arthritis occur because your immune system attacks healthy joints. Both rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis are identified as autoimmune conditions. You may experience joint pain throughout your body at different times, including in your TMJ, and certain triggers may cause the pain to flare up. Pain felt in your jaw and ears near the TMJ area may trigger migraine. Migraine attacks are severe headaches that can re-occur. They can cause sensitivity to light, sound, and smell. This condition occurs when bacteria forms in the outer ear from water exposure or injury. You may get this condition from swimming or if an outside object tears your ear’s lining. The symptoms will get worse if the condition is untreated and can lead to ear and jaw pain. You may experience ear and jaw pain from sinusitis. This condition can occur if you have a cold or allergies and your nasal passages become irritated and inflamed. The infection is generally caused by a virus, but you can also get bacterial sinusitis. You may experience cavities, periodontal disease, and dental abscesses if bacteria builds up on your teeth and gums. These conditions can cause damage to your mouth and beyond, especially if left untreated. They can lead to jaw and ear pain. If you grind your teeth, you may end up with a TMJ disorder and feel pain in your ears and jaw. This condition can: You may grind your teeth at night and not even realize it until pain or another symptom develops. Ear and jaw pain are not the only symptoms of these conditions. You may also experience the following: Cavities, periodontal disease, or dental abscesses Your doctor will conduct a physical exam to begin the diagnosis of your jaw and ear pain. Your doctor may also ask about your health history to find out more about your symptoms. Be sure to mention: changes to your mental health like stress, anxiety, or depression You may need an MRI, X-ray, or other imaging test to diagnose the condition. The cause of jaw and ear pain can vary and so can treatments. You may not seek treatment for TMJ, as of cases resolve on their own and only 5 to 10 percent of cases require treatment. Treatments for a TMJ disorder can include: using over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications wearing a brace or splint to restrict jaw movement Other causes of ear and joint pain may include similar treatments. Some conditions like arthritis, swimmer’s ear, and sinusitis may include specific medications. Your doctor may recommend certain anti-inflammatories for arthritis, steroids for swimmer’s ear, and nasal sprays for sinusitis, among other treatment options. Oral conditions like cavities, periodontal disease, and dental abscesses may require tooth removal, a root canal, or deep cleaning in addition to other treatment methods. There are several methods you can try at home to help TMJ disorders: Stop chewing gum or other objects, such as the ends of pens or pencils. Perform exercises that stretch the jaw, including slowly opening and closing your mouth several times. Some of these treatments may also work with other conditions causing ear and jaw pain. Take good care of your teeth to treat and avoid conditions that affect your mouth. Make sure to brush and floss regularly, eat a healthy diet, and quit smoking to avoid the buildup of bacteria in your mouth. is accompanied by a fever or other flu-like symptoms There are many reasons why you may experience jaw and ear pain at the same time. Often, the condition affecting both of them is related to only your jaw or ears but you feel referred pain in the other area. Talk to your doctor to determine the cause of the jaw and ear pain. This will help you treat the pain and avoid it from getting worse. — Jaw pain can affect your ability to eat, speak, and sleep.

Dental Images of Cavities, Dry Sockets, Gingivitis Reviewed By: Besides smiling, laughing, and communicating, the mouth and teeth serve important functions in the body. Teeth and saliva break down food, making it easier for the stomach to process it further for absorption by the intestines. The teeth provide structural support for the face. The mouth and throat contain immune cells that help protect the body against pathogens. Taking good care of the mouth and teeth is an essential part of maintaining good health. Here is a guide to some common oral health problems and procedures. An abscessed tooth occurs when an infection moves up tooth pulp and settles into the root near the jaw bone and forms a swollen, pus-filled area. An untreated tooth abscess may lead to a dangerous infection of the jaw bone and other tissues. Treatment of a tooth abscess depends on the extent of the infection. Some abscesses may be treated with antibiotics or drainage. In cases in which a cavity or a cracked tooth has exposed the pulp, a root canal may be necessary to treat the abscessed tooth. Cavities are areas of damaged tooth enamel that form when acid erodes away at a tooth. Bacteria are normally present on teeth as plaque. Bacteria produce acid as a byproduct from feeding on sugar in the diet. The acid produced then erodes the enamel and exposes dentin that, in turn, can become pitted and result in a cavity. Good dental hygiene that includes brushing, flossing, and regular teeth cleanings, can help prevent cavities. Treatment of a cavity depends on the extent of the tooth decay. A small or superficial cavity may be treated with a filling. Larger cavities may require more extensive drilling to remove decay and then placement of a crown over the remaining portion of the tooth. Decay that extends to the tooth pulp may require root canal treatment. A small spot of decay visible on the surface of a tooth. The radiograph reveals an extensive region of demineralization within the dentin (arrows). A hole is discovered on the side of the tooth at the beginning of decay removal. A dental crown is a cap that is placed over a damaged tooth to make it stronger or to improve its appearance. Crowns may be placed over a tooth that has a very large filling or one that is cracked. A crown may also be placed in order to serve as support for a dental bridge. Sometimes a crown is used to disguise an ill-shaped or stained tooth. Dental crowns are available in a variety of materials including porcelain (ceramic), porcelain and metal, metal alloy, and more. A dry socket is a condition that may result after a tooth extraction if the blood clot that normally fills the socket is lost. The dry socket leaves underlying nerves exposed, which is very painful. Whitish bone rather than a blood clot where a tooth was pulled Pain beginning about two days after tooth was pulled The condition is treated by a dentist who cleans the wound and places a special dressing into the socket. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen may be used to treat pain and decrease swelling. Gum disease (gingivitis) is inflammation of the gums. It is caused by plaque-producing bacteria that build up on the teeth. Severe gum inflammation that spreads to the bones and ligaments that support teeth is called periodontitis and can lead to tooth loss. Lack of good oral hygiene increases the risk of gingivitis. Smoking, diabetes, pregnancy, genetic factors, and certain medications also increase the risk of gum disease. Gum disease is reversible when it is treated in the earlier stages. Regular brushing, flossing, and special dental cleanings and treatments can help prevent and treat gum disease. Saliva lubricates teeth and other tissues in the mouth and helps guard against infection and gum disease. Dry mouth results from a decreased production of saliva. Dry mouth is caused by some medical conditions or the use of certain medications. Diabetes, Sjögren’s syndrome, and HIV are a few conditions that may be associated with dry mouth. Dry mouth may make it hard to speak or swallow. It may also cause hoarseness or a sore throat. Dry mouth increases the risk of tooth decay. Chewing sugar-free gum may help improve saliva flow. A doctor can prescribe special aids, including artificial saliva, to combat dry mouth. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders refer to conditions that affect the jaw joint and the associated muscles. Arthritis or structural problems may cause TMJ problems. TMJ disorders may also be a symptom of another condition like chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, or stress. Self-care strategies to manage TMJ problems include practicing stress management, applying hot or cold packs, eating soft foods, and avoiding activities that stress the jaw like chewing gum and opening the mouth too wide to yawn. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications can help decrease pain and swelling. A health care professional may recommend jaw exercises, orthodontic treatment, or a night guard to treat a TMJ disorder. Many TMJ problems follow a cyclical pattern, and symptoms may resolve without treatment. Bad breath (halitosis) can be uncomfortable and can have many potential causes. Diet is one potential cause of bad breath. Odiferous garlic and onions can lead to unpleasant breath. Lack of good oral hygiene may allow bacteria to proliferate, contributing to gum disease and bad mouth odor. Sometimes bad breath is the result of another medical condition like dry mouth, diabetes, a lung infection, or others. Good oral hygiene including brushing, flossing, and regular teeth cleaning, can help keep gum disease and bad breath at bay. Using a tongue scraper can help as well. In addition, treating an underlying condition such as dry mouth or diabetes, for example, may also help get rid of bad breath. Tooth sensitivity occurs when hot, cold, sweet, or acidic substances irritate tooth nerves. Teeth are covered by a protective substance called enamel. Under the gum line, the protective substance is called cementum. The layer under the enamel and cementum is the dentin. Dentin supports the enamel and protects the tooth pulp and nerve root in the middle of the tooth. A series of small tubes (tubules) runs through the dentin. Erosions in enamel and cementum allow substances to come into contact with tubules, which irritates the tooth nerve and results in pain. Cavities, gum disease, cracks in teeth, and enamel erosion may all contribute to tooth sensitivity. Treatments may include the use of toothpaste or fluoride gel that blocks pain sensation. A dentist may apply a crown or bonding material over the sensitive area. A gum graft may be necessary to cover a sensitive area in which gums have receded. Wisdom teeth are the very last teeth that people get as a young adult (teens to early twenties). They are called the third molars. Some people may be able to keep their wisdom teeth if they do not cause any problems. Other times, wisdom teeth may crowd other teeth, cause pain, have decay, or may be associated with gum disease or another dental problem. In these cases, extraction of the wisdom teeth may be warranted. After having wisdom teeth removed, pain is common. There are a few ways to minimize this pain. Take the doctor-recommended pain medicine before local anesthetic wears off and continue taking medicine if pain persists. For mild pain, over-the-counter painkillers like Tylenol and ibuprofen can be taken every 4 hours. Ice packs can be applied to the side of the face where the surgery took place for 20 minutes at a time, followed by a 10-minute break. To slow bleeding, biting a moist teabag for one hour can help. Whether or not to remove wisdom teeth depends on several factors. The recent trend has been to leave healthy wisdom teeth alone and to monitor them. This is because the risk of surgery, which includes permanent numbness and the risk of anesthesia, may outweigh the potential good of routinely removing wisdom teeth. Oral cancer is cancer in and around the mouth including the lips, inside of the cheeks, tongue, roof of the mouth, floor of the mouth, sinuses, and throat. Oral cancer may appear as a lump or sore in the mouth that does not go away. Red or white patches on the soft tissues of the mouth may also signal cancer. People are most likely to get oral cancer in their 50s or 60s. Risk factors for oral cancer include alcohol, tobacco, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection of the oral cavity, and male gender. Excess sunlight exposure to the lips increases cancer risk. Eating lots of colorful fruits and vegetables decreases oral cancer risk. Detecting and treating oral cancers early boosts the chance of a successful outcome. Many forms of oral cancer treatment are available. They include: Hyperfractionated (repeated doses of radiation) radiation therapy A root canal is performed if tooth decay or an infection affects the tooth pulp. It may also be done if a tooth is injured or damaged, either by trauma or repeated dental procedures. Root canals can eliminate pain and save the remainder of the tooth. A root canal is a procedure in which the tooth pulp and nerve are removed. The canals are then cleaned and sealed. Many times a root canal is performed on a tooth that already has a large cavity or other damage. In these cases, a crown is placed over the remaining portion of the tooth to restore its appearance and function. Dental implants are designed to replace missing teeth. The process of performing dental implants involves several steps: First, a titanium post is inserted into the jawbone by a surgeon. Over the next several months, bone grows around and stabilizes the implant. Lastly, a custom crown designed to blend in with the surrounding teeth is placed over the implant. If multiple teeth are missing, an implant may be designed to accommodate a denture or bridge. Toothache is commonly associated with a cavity, but many other things may cause tooth pain. A cracked tooth, an abscess, and gum disease can all be painful. Toothache pain is sometimes “referred pain” from another area like the sinuses. That means the pain is felt in another location other than where it actually originates. A dentist has many tools to uncover the cause of toothache pain. Over-the-counter pain medicines (Aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) Dental erosion is damage to the hard covering of teeth called enamel. Erosion occurs when acids in certain foods and drinks damage enamel. The most common sources of acids in the diet are fruit, soft drinks, and fruit juices. Avoiding sugary drinks helps protect tooth enamel. Fruit and reasonable amounts of 100% fruit juice are parts of a healthy diet. As long as one brushes and flosses regularly and has adequate saliva flow – which buffers and neutralizes acids – fruit and fruit juice can be safely consumed without harming teeth.

As long as the tooth did not get knocked out your symptoms should improve in a day or so. The attachments that connect the tooth to the gum can get stretched and that can cause soreness. i would consult my dentist soon. May be it is cracked. Get X-ray done and checked by dentist. Good lucl If you are constantly putting too much pressure on that tooth it will aggravate the nerve and make it hypersensitive and always sore. The tiny zap could be nerve pain, especially if there is any crack in the enamel. Your dentist needs to make sure it does not hit too hard or the pain will continue and could even damage the nerve irreversibly. See your dentist for analysis and adjustment to your bite. Yous should see your dentist to have your bite checked and adjusted before it creates more issues. are contributory to this condition. Avoiding further trauma can help the nerve to recover. In the presence of bruxism and clenching habits, it can aggravate the condition and can lead from sensitivity to pulp necrosis. All tooth symptoms will be relieved after the occlusal adjustment by your dentist. Very common benign procedure. You seem to have a very good sense of your bite. However, there are problems with premature contacts including excessive wear of the tooth and possible change in the bone and gum tissue around the teeth involved. See a dentist to see how this prematurity can be corrected Several possibilities here: The premature contact could be the result of a habit, a malocclusion, gum problem, nerve problem or something else. See a dentist for a clinical exam, x-rays, bite analysis and appropriate treatment if needed and as required. If your bite is off and a bottom tooth is hitting an upper tooth prematurely it can cause soreness. I would recommend you make an appointment with your dentist and have the area checked out. Your bite may just need to be adjusted or something else may be causing it. Prolonged premature hitting of the upper and lower tooth could lead to complications. 45 years experience Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Premature contacts between teeth are traumatic. Over time you can even loosen and lose teeth. See your DDS asap for evaluation. It is called exactly that... a prematurity. The fix could be quite simple and painless: a minor bite adjustment by your dentist. Have them take a look. Malocclusion can cause soreness. Teeth are designed to come together in a specific orientation. See Andrews Six Keys to Normal Occlusion. Any variation can cause excess force that results in pain. ""Zap"" may indicate a fracture or 2 dissimilar metal fillings coming into contact. See your Dentist for relief. This is a pretty common finding and if that's all there is causing your symptoms it is easily taken care of with a bite adjustment. Part of treatment is figuring out why your teeth may be shifting and addressing that issue as well. Good luck! Excessive forces on a tooth can make it sore. See a dentist bout this. You may need to have your bite adjusted or the tooth treated with a possible filling, crown or other procedure. A tooth can become bruised like any other part of your body. Teeth are held in the bone by a small ligament. When you bite on something too hard or something knocks your tooth, this ligament can become very sore. Try not to chew on the tooth. These types of injuries usually take a few days to feel good again. If it is not better in a couple of days, you should see a dentist. Go see your dentist and have a bite adjustment if needed. Let your dentist determine the need. What are the variables- did you have a new restoration- ie filling or crown recently placed? Do you grind your teeth? Discuss all with the dentist If you have one pair of teeth that are hitting first, or harder than the others, it is very possible for that to cause soreness. All of the forces of your jaws closing are directed to that one area. See your dentist for a definitive diagnosis. YES! Recent studies found that light premature biting contact of teeth may change tooth sensations. These sensations can lead to hypersensitivity to hot and cold and pain when biting. Fracture lines in teeth that can expand and cause cracking of parts of the tooth and ultimately loss of the tooth. Absolutely, A premature contact (high) can cause inflammation and soreness of the tooth. Contact your dentist and have him adjust your bite. That should take care of it. Hitting a tooth or or teeth harder than they like can create discomfort. If you are getting a ""zap"" when you bite it could mean a toothe has a cracked or is cracking. I would suggest you go see you dentist and let them see. If there is no definitive answer or if they can duplicate your zap then they can treat the problem or continue to just watch it until it goes away or gets worse. Yes, and this can be maddening. Its like if you get a filling and its too thick. See your dentist and the tooth can be subtlety be recontoured to allow them to meet comfortably, usually with having to be anesthetized The solution depends on the severity, timing, and duration of your symptoms. You could need anything from rest (nothing) to orthodontics &amp; surgery; likely something in-between. See your dentist, find the answer and feel better. Changes in occlusion can be related to a lot of causes. See your dentist to do a thorough investigation to find a lasting solution. Good luck. The type of pain you describe could be caused by the tooth having a microscopic crack in it. When you bite down in a way that stresses the crack you feel it. At other times the tooth feels fine. This can be caused by your bite being off (malocclusion), previous trauma, or just normal wear and tear. Treatment may require an inlay or a crown.

Occasionally they are swallowed, but that is harmless. If the tooth has not fallen out by the time the permanent tooth erupts, it may need to be removed by the dentist.Loose Permanent TeethThere are two usual possibilities: your tooth is fractured, or you are suffering from gum disease that weakens the tissue firmly holding the tooth.If your tooth is fractured, you would probably feel pain from cold. But when your tooth is loose, the most common reason is your gums. If you are suffering from gum disease, you must get it treated right away before your tooth gets too loose and you would have to remove it. You should consult a dentist or a periodontist (gum speacialist) who will start with a tooth scaling and maybe a curetage depending of how advanced your condition is.In rare cases, diseases or medications can weaken the bone that anchors your tooth.

Getting your tooth actually pulled out feels the same any way, loose or not(That part isn't all that bad with all of the numbing.) Sorry, it's not that bad though. Different people handle the pain in different ways. First, the tooth should be COMPLETLY numb so that the patient does not feel any pain. Once that is accomplished, then the Dentist will use an instrument called an elevator to push the gums gently away from the tooth. When most of the gums at the top are pulled back the dentist will use another instrument that pushes the gums aways as you he goes lower down the roots of the tooth. When all sides of the tooth are loose from the ligament then the tooth should already be mobile and the Dentist can use surgical forceps to pull the loose tooth out.

9d997279-38c7-48cd-8a74-32b2c3dd3917,"Put it under your pillow and the tooth fairy will come for it The nerve usually dies because of an infection in the pulp at the centre of the tooth (while this is happening you will have very bad toothache! The dentist will prescribe antibiotics to kill the infection then after a week the tooth is drilled and the puss left in the centre of the tooth is drained out through the tooth using a procedure called a root canal. The now dead tooth is then filled and stabilised. Dying nerves (which I assume you've experienced, given the question) have a tendency of hurting. A lot. Dead nerves have a strong tendency of getting infected, which then brings you down the root of Tooth Abscesses and root canal and general dental hell. If your tooth nerve is dead, see your dentist. (S)He should remove the nerve and then fill the space left to re-inforce your tooth. Dead teeth also go dark-coloured. :( The nerve inside it is probably dead. We only feel toothache because the nerve that goes to the tooth is exposed. Yes, generally when you remove the nerve root you then have a dead tooth. the dentist must fill the canal and either cap it or discuss other options with you, as it will turn gray because it has no nerve. What is the name of the part of the tooth hidden inside the tooth? The nerve endings are found in the pulp cavity centre of the tooth, the nerve is carried in the tooth root. It is a tooth that the root has been damaged and is ""dead"" you may have injured the nerve for that tooth, it's best to see a dentist, it won't take long to see what the issue is and its a lot better than losing the tooth. There are no nerves IN a tooth. The nerve is above the tooth. That's why when it's loose and you eat, your tooth hurts. Hope this helps Yes, a dead tooth can cause or trigger a headache. The part of the tooth that has the nerves in it is right under the crown of your tooth ''aka'' the top part of your tooth and they travel down into you gums hope this help's How long can a tooth stay in your mouth after the nerve has been removed? If the nerve has been removed in your tooth, you need to have a root canal done in order to keep your tooth in your mouth. A tooth that has had a root canal treatment and ideally a crown as well, has about 85% chances of staying in your mouth for the rest of your life. How can you tell if a tooth nerve is infected or just inflamed? Go to the dentist! You can not run around with a infection in your tooth. If you think you have a infection in your tooth that is enough reson to go to the dentist. They know if a nerve is infected or inflamed. -------- Even if it is inflamed that means that the dental nerve is infected with bacteria, and if left untreated it can lead to gangrene and root treatment. See this video about infection of the dental nerve http://www.checkdent.com/en/videos/tooth-inflammation-159.html It happens. Was/is it a lower wisdom tooth? The inferior alveolar nerve travels through the lower jaw, this is the nerve the dentist ""numbs"" to work on a bottom tooth. Lower wisdom tooth problems often cause an ear ache. It could be an infection, it could be the nerve was bruised, it could be do to normal healing with a little swelling. Tell the dentist/oral surgeon. How long does a tooth nerve take to die after treatment to kill it? It is important to know that the nerve is removed not killed. If a tooth has had to fight a long infection, many times the tooth is dead, which means it is unable to fight the infection present inside the canal. The treatment for this situation is root canal therapy. Most of the time the patient does not feel anything throughout the procedure except the delivery of local anesthesia. The treatment goal is to clean the canal space and remove all nerve tissue and bacteria that is present inside the canal. A successful root canal treatment will remove the pain experienced by the patient immediately unless the infection has spread outside the root around the tooth, then it may still be sensitive to biting forces. So to answer your question, the nerve is removed and therefore there is ideally no nerve tissue left in the tooth after the procedure. While in a tooth or after pulled? Inside your tooth in your mouth, the nerve may not die. You may have to get a root canal done to remove the nerve and keep the tooth. If a person does not pull an infected tooth, the infection may strangle the nerve and leave a non-sensitive tooth. You will then have a grey tooth with no life in it. If this happens and your lucky enough without medication so as the infection goes away; you would have experienced a natural root death and will need to keep an eye on the tooth and get x rays done often. Your tooth will still rot and you will not know it because you feel little pain in the tooth. If your talking about the nerve in the pulled tooth's orifice, bottom jaws could be damaged for months or even permanently. You may also feel as though your lip was numb if you have damage. Top back orifices may perforate the nasal cavity and may hurt constantly. Please be more specific for specific answers. that is a root canal of a molar tooth. Meaning the dentist is removing the nerve and pulp of the tooth. Yes the tooth's nerve is in the roots and ends in the crown of the tooth. Extracting a tooth will remove the nerve. It is important to discuss different treatment options with a dentist because sometimes a root canal is the preferred treatment and sometimes extraction is more appropriate. Not all teeth need to be replaced but if the tooth is important for function, bite stability, or esthetics than tooth replacements such as dental implants or fixed bridges become important options to consider. Why after a root canal a tooth still hurts when its pressed on? The tooth will continue to hurt for a couple reasons, either the nerve in the tooth has been tampered with or it is just still sore. A loose baby tooth that is turning gray or black is a dead tooth. A dentist can take the tooth out. You might think that a tooth's nerve tissue is vitally important to a tooth's health and function, but in reality it's not. A tooth's nerve tissue plays an important role in the growth and development of the tooth, but once the tooth has erupted through the gums and has finished maturing the nerve's only function is sensory, it provides the tooth with the ability to feel hot and cold.In regards to the normal day to day functioning of our mouths, the sensory information provided by a single tooth is really quite minimal. Dentists realize that on a practical level it is pretty much academic whether a tooth has a live nerve in it or not. If a tooth's nerve tissue is present and healthy, wonderful. But if a tooth has had its nerve tissue removed during root canal treatment that's fine too, you will never miss it. A cracked tooth or a damaged deep filling can cause a tooth's nerve to die. Grinding teeth can also cause nerve damage. Place in the tooth where nerves and blood vessels are found? The part of a tooth where the nerve and blood vessels are found is called the pulp chamber. If you have an exposed nerve, only a dentist can help you with that. When did organ music become associated with baseball? What is the denotative and connotative meaning of clouds?

b44a570b-c65d-475a-a953-04faaaf9c2ce,"You bite into an apple and then try to start talking to your friend about yesterday's math homework. Suddenly something feels funny — one of your baby teeth has fallen out! It's been loose forever, and now there it is, right in your hand. And you have an empty space in your mouth big enough to poke a drinking straw through. Before you put that tooth under your pillow, did you know that there is much more to that tooth than meets the eye? A single tooth has many different parts that make it work. And teeth play an important role in your daily life. They not only let you eat stuff like apples, they also help you talk. So let's talk teeth! Unlike your heart or brain, your teeth weren't ready to work from the day you were born. Although babies have the beginnings of their first teeth even before they are born, teeth don't become visible until babies are about 6 to 12 months old. After that first tooth breaks through, more and more teeth begin to appear. Most kids have their first set of teeth by the time they are 3 years old. These are called the primary teeth, baby teeth, or milk teeth and there are 20 in all. When a child gets to age 5 or 6, these teeth start falling out, one by one. A primary tooth falls out because it is being pushed out of the way by the permanent tooth that is behind it. Slowly, the permanent teeth grow in and take the place of the primary teeth. By about age 12 or 13, most kids have lost all of their baby teeth and have a full set of permanent teeth. There are 32 permanent teeth in all — 12 more than the original set of baby teeth. Most people have four teeth (called wisdom teeth) grow in at the back of the mouth when they're between 17 and 25 years old. These complete the adult set of 32 teeth. Let's take a tour of your teeth. Look in the mirror at your own teeth or check out a friend's smile. The part of the tooth you can see, which is not covered by the gum (your gums are the pink, fleshy part), is called the . The crown of each tooth is covered with (say: ih-NAM-ul), which is very hard and often shiny. Enamel is a very tough substance and it acts as a tooth's personal bodyguard. Enamel works as a barrier, protecting the inside parts of the tooth. If you were able to peel away the enamel, you would find (say: DEN-tin). Dentin makes up the largest part of the tooth. Although it is not as tough as enamel, it is also very hard. Dentin protects the innermost part of the tooth, called the . The pulp is where each tooth's nerve endings and blood supply are found. When you eat hot soup, bite into a super-cold scoop of ice cream, fall and hurt a tooth, or get a cavity, it's your pulp that hurts. The nerve endings inside the pulp send messages to the brain about what's going on (""That is too cold!""). The pulp also contains the tooth's blood vessels, which feed the tooth and keep it alive and healthy. The pulp goes all the way down into the root of the tooth, which is under the gum. (say: sih-MEN-tum) makes up the root of the tooth, which is anchored to the jawbone. You've probably noticed that you have different types of permanent teeth in your mouth. Each one has its own function. Your two front teeth and the teeth on either side of them are (say: in-SY-zurs). There are four on the top and four on bottom. Incisors are shaped like tiny chisels, with flat ends that are somewhat sharp. These teeth are used for cutting and chopping food. Think back to that apple you ate: You used your incisors to crunch into the skin of the apple. The pointy teeth beside your incisors are called (say: KAY-nine) teeth. There are four of them, two on top and two on bottom. Because these teeth are pointy and also sharp, they help tear food. Next to your canine teeth are your (say: PREE-mo-lurs), which are also called bicuspid teeth. You have eight premolars in all, four on top and four on the bottom. You'll need to open a bit wider to see these teeth, but when you do, you'll notice that their shape is completely different from both incisors and canines. Premolars are bigger, stronger, and have ridges, which make them perfect for crushing and grinding food. If you open your mouth really wide, you'll see your (say: MO-lurs). You have eight of these, four on the top and four on the bottom. Sometimes these are called your 6-year molars and your 12-year molars because that is around the time when they come in. Molars are the toughest of the bunch. They are even wider and stronger than premolars, and they have more ridges. Molars work closely with your tongue to help you swallow food. How? The tongue sweeps chewed-up food to the back of your mouth, where the molars grind it until it's mashed up and ready to be swallowed. As we mentioned earlier, the last teeth a person gets are wisdom teeth. These are also called third molars. They are all the way in the back of the mouth, one in each corner. Wisdom teeth may have to be removed because they can cause problems in a person's mouth. Some people believe that wisdom teeth may have been used by people millions of years ago when humans had larger jaws and ate food that needed a lot of chewing. It's believed that they're called wisdom teeth because they come in later in life, when a young person is becoming older and wiser. Your teeth are great for chewing, but you also need them to talk. Different teeth work with your tongue and lips to help you form sounds. Try saying the word ""tooth"" slowly and notice how your tongue first hits the inside of your incisors to produce the hard ""t"" sound and then goes in between your upper and lower teeth to make the ""th"" sound. And if you love to sing ""la la la la la,"" you can thank those teeth every time you sing a song. Pay attention to what happens to your teeth and tongue every time you make the ""l"" sound. Brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste is your best bet when it comes to . Try to brush after eating or at least twice a day. It's especially important to brush before bedtime. The best way to brush your teeth is in little circles — go around and around until you have covered every surface of every tooth. Brush up and down, rather than side to side. You'll also want to clean between your teeth with dental floss (a special string for cleaning your teeth) at least once a day. That removes food and plaque (sticky stuff that can cause cavities or gum disease) that get stuck in between your teeth. You can also brush your tongue to help keep your breath fresh! Your dentist may suggest that you use an alcohol-free mouth rinse. It's also important to visit your favorite tooth experts — your and dental hygienist. During your appointment, they'll look out for any problems and clean and polish your teeth. Sometimes the dentist will take X-rays to get a better picture of what is going on in your mouth. You also might get a treatment while you're there. In between dentist visits, you can prevent problems by eating fewer sugary snacks and sugary drinks, such as soda. Sugar can hurt your teeth and cause tooth decay, or . But if you take care of your teeth now, you'll be chewing like a champ for the rest of your life!

After that first tooth breaks through, more and more teeth begin to appear. Most kids have their first set of teeth by the time they are 3 years old. These are called the primary teeth, baby teeth, or milk teeth and there are 20 in all. When a child gets to age 5 or 6, these teeth start falling out, one by one. A primary tooth falls out because it is being pushed out of the way by the permanent tooth that is behind it. Slowly, the permanent teeth grow in and take the place of the primary teeth. By about age 12 or 13, most kids have lost all of their baby teeth and have a full set of permanent teeth. There are 32 permanent teeth in all — 12 more than the original set of baby teeth. Most people have four teeth (called wisdom teeth) grow in at the back of the mouth when they're between 17 and 25 years old. These complete the adult set of 32 teeth. Let's take a tour of your teeth. Look in the mirror at your own teeth or check out a friend's smile. The part of the tooth you can see, which is not covered by the gum (your gums are the pink, fleshy part), is called the . The crown of each tooth is covered with (say: ih-NAM-ul), which is very hard and often shiny. Enamel is a very tough substance and it acts as a tooth's personal bodyguard. Enamel works as a barrier, protecting the inside parts of the tooth. If you were able to peel away the enamel, you would find (say: DEN-tin). Dentin makes up the largest part of the tooth. Although it is not as tough as enamel, it is also very hard. Dentin protects the innermost part of the tooth, called the . The pulp is where each tooth's nerve endings and blood supply are found. When you eat hot soup, bite into a super-cold scoop of ice cream, fall and hurt a tooth, or get a cavity, it's your pulp that hurts. The nerve endings inside the pulp send messages to the brain about what's going on (""That is too cold!""). The pulp also contains the tooth's blood vessels, which feed the tooth and keep it alive and healthy. The pulp goes all the way down into the root of the tooth, which is under the gum. (say: sih-MEN-tum) makes up the root of the tooth, which is anchored to the jawbone. You've probably noticed that you have different types of permanent teeth in your mouth. Each one has its own function. Your two front teeth and the teeth on either side of them are (say: in-SY-zurs). There are four on the top and four on bottom. Incisors are shaped like tiny chisels, with flat ends that are somewhat sharp. These teeth are used for cutting and chopping food. Think back to that apple you ate: You used your incisors to crunch into the skin of the apple. The pointy teeth beside your incisors are called (say: KAY-nine) teeth. There are four of them, two on top and two on bottom. Because these teeth are pointy and also sharp, they help tear food. Next to your canine teeth are your (say: PREE-mo-lurs), which are also called bicuspid teeth. You have eight premolars in all, four on top and four on the bottom. You'll need to open a bit wider to see these teeth, but when you do, you'll notice that their shape is completely different from both incisors and canines. Premolars are bigger, stronger, and have ridges, which make them perfect for crushing and grinding food. If you open your mouth really wide, you'll see your (say: MO-lurs). You have eight of these, four on the top and four on the bottom. Sometimes these are called your 6-year molars and your 12-year molars because that is around the time when they come in. Molars are the toughest of the bunch. They are even wider and stronger than premolars, and they have more ridges. Molars work closely with your tongue to help you swallow food. How? The tongue sweeps chewed-up food to the back of your mouth, where the molars grind it until it's mashed up and ready to be swallowed. As we mentioned earlier, the last teeth a person gets are wisdom teeth. These are also called third molars. They are all the way in the back of the mouth, one in each corner. Wisdom teeth may have to be removed because they can cause problems in a person's mouth. Some people believe that wisdom teeth may have been used by people millions of years ago when humans had larger jaws and ate food that needed a lot of chewing. It's believed that they're called wisdom teeth because they come in later in life, when a young person is becoming older and wiser. Your teeth are great for chewing, but you also need them to talk. Different teeth work with your tongue and lips to help you form sounds. Try saying the word ""tooth"" slowly and notice how your tongue first hits the inside of your incisors to produce the hard ""t"" sound and then goes in between your upper and lower teeth to make the ""th"" sound. And if you love to sing ""la la la la la,"" you can thank those teeth every time you sing a song. Pay attention to what happens to your teeth and tongue every time you make the ""l"" sound. Brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste is your best bet when it comes to keeping your teeth in tip-top shape. Try to brush after eating or at least twice a day. It's especially important to brush before bedtime. The best way to brush your teeth is in little circles — go around and around until you have covered every surface of every tooth. Brush up and down, rather than side to side. You'll also want to clean between your teeth with dental floss (a special string for cleaning your teeth) at least once a day. That removes food and plaque (sticky stuff that can cause cavities or gum disease) that get stuck in between your teeth. You can also brush your tongue to help keep your breath fresh! Your dentist may suggest that you use an alcohol-free mouth rinse. It's also important to visit your favorite tooth experts — your and dental hygienist. During your appointment, they'll look out for any problems and clean and polish your teeth. Sometimes the dentist will take X-rays to get a better picture of what is going on in your mouth. You also might get a treatment while you're there. In between dentist visits, you can prevent problems by eating fewer sugary snacks and sugary drinks, such as soda. Sugar can hurt your teeth and cause tooth decay, or . But if you take care of your teeth now, you'll be chewing like a champ for the rest of your life!

When a , it leaves a temporary hole in its place. Several factors determine the length of time needed for this hole to close, including your tooth’s size and the type of extraction. It may take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. Read on to learn more about how long it takes for a hole to close after a tooth extraction and some tips for a manageable recovery. Recovery time depends on the type of extraction you’ve had There are two types of tooth extraction processes. Your recovery time will largely be determined by which one you’ve had. Simple tooth extractions are done on visible teeth — the ones that have already erupted through your gums. These teeth sometimes require extraction due to: If your tooth being extracted is large or has several roots, it will take longer to heal. You should see the hole close by the end of the third week, but complete healing and elimination of the hole may take several months. During this time, the hole will be closed, but may have an indentation you can feel with your finger or tongue. A hole from a simple extraction of a small tooth with a single root usually takes about 7 days to close and heal. A hole from a simple extraction of a large tooth with several roots closes after 3 weeks, but complete healing and elimination of the hole may take several months. Visible teeth may also require extraction before to help make room for your remaining teeth to align properly in your mouth. A simple extraction is done with a to numb the area. You’ll usually remain awake and alert during this procedure. If your tooth being extracted is small, or only has a single root, the hole it leaves behind will close relatively quickly, in around 7 days. Complete healing will take approximately 1 additional week. This procedure is more extensive, so it takes longer for your tooth hole to close than after a simple extraction. Tissues and bone are cut underneath the gum line during surgical extractions. In the case of surgical extraction, your tooth hole will be fully or almost fully closed by 6 weeks after surgery. It may take several more months before the indentation fills in and the healing is complete. Your tooth hole will be fully or almost fully closed about 6 weeks after surgery. The indentation will usually fill in and heal completely after several more months. an impacted tooth, such as that don’t erupt into your gums impacted (your sharper teeth near the front of your mouth) above your gum line, especially if you need braces or your child does remnants of a visible tooth that has or broken off fragments of a tooth that breaks while being removed during a simple extraction Surgical extraction typically requires the use of a local anesthetic plus general anesthesia. Healing takes time, but begins as soon as your procedure is complete. During the first 24 to 48 hours after extraction, a will start to form over the hole. This blood clot helps keep the hole free of food particles and bacteria. It is a necessary first step towards healing and allows and bone to start forming. It won’t be visible to your eye, but new gum tissue has already started to form in the hole. Bleeding from the hole will slow down and eventually stop during this period. You will continue to have swelling and tenderness on the side of your mouth where your tooth was pulled. Your tooth hole will start to visibly close as gum tissues repair and regenerate. If you had stitches, they will be removed or start to dissolve. Large tooth extractions, molars, and any impacted teeth will take the longest amount of time to heal. Based on how extensive the extraction is, your tooth hole should be completely healed with no indentation. The hole in your jawbone (your tooth’s socket) should also be completely filled in with new bone. Here are the dos and don’ts to help manage your . Keep a gauze pad over the area for at least 30 minutes after surgery. This will help the blood clot start to form in your tooth hole. Talk with your dentist or surgeon about the medications you take.

Don’t do any strenuous activities that might accelerate blood flow during the first few days. Avoid any activity that causes suction in your mouth during the first few days so that you don’t dislodge the blood clot that starts to form. This includes smoking , drinking through a straw, and spitting. Don’t drink or use alcohol-based mouthwash for 24 hours after surgery. Avoid eating anything that might become lodged in the hole, such as seeds or particles. If no blood clot forms over your tooth hole, or it is dislodged, may occur. Dry socket is a potential complication of tooth extraction surgery that interferes with the growth of new bone and development of your soft tissue meant to form over the clot. have an injury at the extraction site from the procedure don’t keep the area clean of bacteria and food debris Call your doctor if you experience any signs of infection or dry socket, including: severe or swelling that starts 3 or more days after surgery throbbing, tingling, or scratching in your tooth hole or surrounding area your tooth hole doesn’t have a visible clot or does not appear to be getting smaller after 2 to 4 days If you have an infection, your doctor will prescribe oral antibiotics or an antimicrobial or antiseptic mouthwash for you to use. If you have dry socket, your dentist will flush out the area to rid it of food particles, bacteria, and debris. Your dentist may also pack the socket with medication and gauze. Dry socket can be painful. Over-the-counter medications are usually enough to reduce or eliminate discomfort. When a tooth is extracted, it leaves a temporary hole in its place that can take anywhere from several weeks to several months to fill in and heal. The first all-important step to healing your tooth hole is the formation of a blood clot. If a blood clot does not form or is dislodged, dry socket may occur. Habits such as drinking through a straw or smoking cigarettes can interfere with healing. Proper aftercare, such as keeping the area clean and getting enough rest, can help accelerate healing. — What’s That White Tissue Coming from a Tooth Socket After an Extraction?

One of those big moments — almost as big as when that cuts through the gums — is when your child gets their first visit from the tooth fairy. Here’s when you can expect your child to begin losing their baby teeth, common concerns, and potential complications — and what you need to know to stay on top of your child’s . Baby teeth chart — when they appear and when they fall out  Each child will sprout and lose teeth on their own timeline. When new teeth appear, the official term is . While most people think of them as baby teeth (also known as milk teeth or primary teeth), their formal name is . In total, your child will have 20 baby teeth to chow down their snacks. Your baby will begin to gain teeth around 6 months of age, and this will . From the age of 6, your child will eventually lose all of their baby teeth by the time they’re 12 years old. By the time your child reaches their teenage years, they’ll have 32 permanent . So why do baby teeth fall out, anyway? It turns out that those baby teeth act as placeholders, creating space in the jaw for future, permanent teeth. For most children, their baby teeth begin to fall out around the age of 6. Of course, all of the teeth don’t fall out at one time! When a permanent tooth is ready to erupt, the root of a baby tooth begins to dissolve until it’s completely gone. At that point, the tooth is “loose” and only held in place by the surrounding gum tissue. You might be surprised to find that most people lose their baby teeth in the order that they erupted. As such, since the lower central incisors are the first teeth to appear around 6 months of age, they’re also the first to come loose and make room for your child’s permanent teeth when they’re around 6 or 7 years old. After the lower central incisors, the upper central incisors come out, making way for the bigger upper central incisors we all expect to see on adults. For some children, losing teeth can be an exciting time, especially if you introduce fun concepts like the tooth fairy. For others, it can be a little upsetting, as something that they thought was permanent (their tooth) just came out of their mouth! Likewise, it’s not uncommon for children to experience a little pain or discomfort when they lose a tooth. After the tooth is removed: Have your child rinse their mouth with a simple saltwater solution to help clean their gums. Use a bit of gauze to help cover the area, which is known as a socket, and encourage them not to spit, as this can cause bleeding. Apply a cold, wet cloth after any bleeding has stopped if there’s pain or discomfort. After the central incisors have been shed, the next baby teeth to go will be your child’s lateral incisors. Generally, the upper lateral incisors loosen first. This will usually happen between the ages of 7 and 8. At this point, your child should be more familiar with the experience of losing a tooth. Ideally, it should no longer be a scary experience, as they’ll have already lost four teeth prior to the lateral incisors. Compared with when your child’s teeth first erupted, losing them can be a significantly easier process for parents. While teething may be uncomfortable in general, incoming molars might be especially painful for babies and toddlers. In contrast, the primary molars (also known as first molars) usually aren’t painful when they fall out or are replaced by permanent molars. These primary first molars are usually shed between the ages of 9 and 11 years old. The last sets of baby teeth to go are the canines and primary second molars. The canines are usually lost between the ages of 9 and 12 years old, while the primary second molars are the last baby teeth that your child will lose. These final sets of teeth are usually shed between the ages of 10 and 12. As your child grows, their jaws also grow to accommodate the larger permanent teeth. Once your child reaches the age of 13, they should have a full set of permanent teeth. Once your child reaches their late teen years, their (third molars) may come in. You might be surprised to learn that . Some only get a few instead of the full four wisdom teeth, and not everyone needs them removed. These final sets of molars are called wisdom teeth because of the folklore belief that you only get these teeth once you’re more mature and have gained some knowledge due to having more life experiences. The timeline shared here is just a general guideline. If your child’s teeth were slow to erupt, you should expect that losing their baby teeth might take a little longer, too. However, if your child has missed their dental milestones by a year (whether eruption or shedding), speak with your child’s dentist. Regardless of what is (or isn’t) happening in your child’s mouth, by their first birthday, you should schedule an appointment. After the first visit, your child should visit the dentist every 6 months. The can provide options in your area if you don’t already have a pediatric dentist. Not everyone introduces the tooth fairy to their child, but it is a way to make a major milestone fun. You may wonder how much the tooth fairy should leave. The answer is… it varies. Some parents prefer to keep expectations simple with a few quarters, while others give a few dollars. In general, the tooth fairy tends to be most generous for the first tooth! Children will lose their teeth and develop that jack-o’-lantern smile on their own timeline. The most important thing is that you teach your child how to maintain so that long after their baby teeth are gone and forgotten, their permanent teeth are in healthy shape. — How to Tell If Your Baby’s Teeth Are in the Right Order Medically reviewed by Your baby’s primary teeth will be replaced by adult teeth, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore the state of their baby teeth.

7b371d4c-410c-4d7e-b6cf-a953fbadfda5,"— Waiting for your little one to cut their first few teeth is one of those milestones that you may look forward to but also dread just a bit. Teething can be painful for babies — and their parents, too! So, when can you expect your baby to begin teething, and how long will this stage last? Usually teething begins around 6 to 10 months of age and lasts until baby is about 25 to 33 months. Still, teething isn’t officially over until young kids get their permanent molars. The first set of molars comes in around 6 to 7 years of age, and you can expect to see the second set come in when your child is around 12 or 13. While we generally refer to the phase as “” or “cutting teeth,” its formal name is tooth eruption. Although every baby develops on their own timeline, most babies get their . You’ll be glad to know that not all of your baby’s teeth erupt at once. Normally, it’s the lower central incisors (the two front lower teeth) that . Your baby’s teeth will usually appear in pairs and in this order: Assuming there are no underlying issues, your baby should continue to gain two new teeth every 2 to 4 months until the age of 2. The final baby teeth to appear will be your toddler’s second lower and upper molars. The lower second molars will arrive between 23 to 31 months, while the upper second molars appear between 25 to 33 months. By the time your child is 3 years old, they should have 20 teeth, which is a full set of primary or baby teeth. But rest easy, as more teeth begin to appear in your baby’s mouth, the horrors of teething tend to subside. The age range for teething is a general guide — not a hard and fast rule. Some babies can cut their teeth as early as 4 months old. It’s also not necessarily a problem if your child’s first tooth doesn’t appear until they’re much older than the guidelines say to expect. Sometimes, a late eruption is hereditary. Some babies don’t cut their first tooth until they’re 15 months old. Given that the recommends that children have their first dental visit around when their first tooth erupts or by 1 year of age — whichever comes first — you should have the opportunity to discuss any concerns you may have with a dentist by baby’s first birthday. So, now you know the timeline for teething, but ? While increased drooling and sucking on things are nearly universal by 4 to 6 months of age and not necessarily signs that a tooth is about to erupt, other notable symptoms may include irritability and a baby that’s gnawing on anything they can get their hands on, including your fingers! While you may hear people say , many experts no longer support this belief. So, if you’re concerned that something else could be at play besides your baby cutting their teeth, contact your pediatrician. Usually, it’s the first few pairs of teeth that seem to be the most uncomfortable for babies. As more teeth appear, the classic horror tales of teething should subside. But there’s a catch. Sometimes when the come in, the classic painful teething symptoms can return. Keep in mind that every baby is different, and your child might not experience any symptoms at all when their teeth erupt. There’s nothing worse than seeing your baby in pain and feeling helpless to stop it. Fortunately, there are plenty of safe remedies that you can use to try to help ease your baby’s discomfort — and restore calm to your home! One of the best things you can do is give your baby something to chew on. Biting down on hard or firm objects may help them relieve the pressure of their teeth pushing up into their gums. Always make sure that whatever you give them is large and doesn’t contain small items or pieces that could pose a choking hazard. While you can buy teething toys, you can also create by wetting a washcloth and putting it in the freezer for 30 minutes. It’ll give your little one something to gnaw on, and the cold cloth may also soothe their sore gums. You can also opt for rubber teething rings, but avoid rings that are full of liquid or gels, as a baby chomping on them could eventually break it. Just remember that even though you can put washcloths in the freezer, teething rings should only be kept in the fridge. You’ll also want to make sure to have plenty of bibs and soothing skin ointments on hand, as extra drool can lead to skin irritation and . If you’ve tried all the at-home remedies and nothing seems to be working, it’s OK to bring in reinforcements by way of over-the-counter (OTC) remedies.
