b24e7863-a293-4153-9f93-906d39986a88,"6 Chiropractor-Approved Exercises to Fight Text Neck Medically reviewed by — — What are the chances you’re reading this article from your handheld device, engaging in the serious but harmful position text neck? (Definition: head forward, shoulders rounded, and back slumped.) This position, also known as “text neck,” is a real epidemic. People spend approximately five hours every day looking at their phones — and that can lead to some serious text-neck aches and pains, explains chiropractor , DC, of Cappo Chiropractic & Sports Therapy. Researchers at Harvard Medical Health predict that will experience neck aches at some point in their lives. Here’s what text neck does to your body: It compresses and tightens the muscle, tendon, and ligament structures in front of the neck while lengthening the muscles, tendon, and ligament structures behind the neck. “The human head weighs 10 pounds. For every inch your head is tilted forward, the weight your neck has to carry doubles,” explains Cappo. Overtime, that extra strain adds up. But ditching our devices isn’t really an option. Instead, what we can do is make sure we exercise right and practice good habits to prevent the aches and pains associated with text neck. Strengthening and stretching your muscles may help alleviate some of that nagging neck pain, says Aixa Goodrich DC, FMP, of . So, with the help of professional chiropractors, we rounded up the best equipment-free stretches and exercises. Incorporate these into your daily routine one to three times a day to help show text neck who’s boss. The exaggerated nod counterbalances the downward/forward head position by pulling your shoulders down and back, and increasing neck mobility, explains Cappo. Start by sitting at your desk or standing comfortably with your shoulders relaxed. With your mouth closed — teeth touching but not clenching — look up to the ceiling. Pause here and let your jaw relax and open your mouth. Now see if you can bring your head further back an inch or two (typically you can). Keep your head still here and bring your lower jaw to your upper jaw, closing your mouth. You should feel a stretch in the front of your neck. Downward-Facing Dog is useful for opening the anterior chest wall and shoulders — which are often rounded and tightened from excessive tech usage, Goodrich points out. This pose is all about upper-body strength, which means if you don’t have the shoulder strength you might compensate by scrunching your shoulders up to your ears. If you notice yourself doing this, actively draw your shoulder blades down your back, which will create space in your neck. Begin on all fours. Tuck your toes and lift your hips high, reaching your hip bones toward the ceiling. Reach your heels back toward the mat, but don’t let them plank on the ground. Drop your head so that your neck is long. As you stay here, make sure that your wrist creases stay parallel to the front edge of the mat. To alleviate the pressure on your wrists, press into the knuckles of your forefingers and thumbs. Breathe here for at least three deep breaths. Then release. Your core and pelvis should drive the Cat-Cow flow: As you inhale you create an anterior tilt to the pelvis so that your tailbone is facing the ceiling, and as you exhale you create a posterior tilt so that your tailbone is turned toward the ground. This movement sequence helps increase spinal awareness, which is a large part of . Start on all fours with your shoulders stacked over your wrists, your hips stacked over your knees, and the tops of your feet pressed into the ground. Look down a few inches in front of your fingers and lengthen from your head down to your tailbone. To begin the ‘cat’ phase, use your abs to curl your spine toward the ceiling while tucking in your tailbone (making the shape of a Halloween cat) as you exhale. Lengthen your neck and allow your chin to reach down and in, toward your chest, so your ears come down by your biceps. To begin the ‘cow’ phase, swoop and scoop your pelvis so your belly drops down to the floor as you inhale. Broaden across your shoulder blades, drawing your shoulders away from your ears, and lift your chin and chest to gaze up toward the ceiling. Cycle through Cat-Cow a few times, keeping stress and pressure out of the head and neck. Padahastasana stretches the neck and hamstrings, which means that it’s fighting text neck hips that are tight from sitting all day at the same time, explains Goodrich. Take off your shoes and begin with your feet hip-distance apart. Then, bend forward, letting your arms touch the floor. If it’s difficult, take your arms only as far as it’s possible without straining. Bend your knees and lift the balls of your feet off the ground to slip your hands, palms face-up, underneath your feet. Allow your toes to come right into your wrist creases. Press into your palm with the balls of your feet and relax your head. Breathe here for at least three deep breaths. Bow pose helps to counteract slouched shoulders by opening them from the front, and strengthening them from the back, explains Marina Mangano, DC, founder of . Lie flat on your stomach with your chin on the floor and your hands resting on either side of you. Bend your knees and bring your heels as close to your buttocks as you can. Reach backwards with both hands and grab onto your outer ankles. As you inhale, lift your heels up toward the ceiling so that your chest, thighs, and upper torso lift up off the mat. To intensify the stretch, try to lift your heels higher while keeping your tailbone pressed into the mat. Look forward and draw your shoulders away from your ears. Hold this position for 10 breaths. Release on an exhale by slowly lowering your thighs, and then the rest of your body, to the ground. Chin tuck is a simple exercise you can do at your desk, at a stoplight, or even in a meeting at work. This simple stretch will help increase spinal awareness, while strengthening the neck muscles to help pull your head back into alignment, says Cappo. Sit up tall in a chair and keep your chin parallel to the floor. Without tilting your head in any direction, gently draw your head and chin back, like you’re making a double chin. Be careful not to jam your head back. You should feel a stretch along the back of the neck. Now imagine there’s a string pulling your head upward like a puppet, and actively elongate your neck. Actively push the base of your skull away from the base of your neck. Keep your jaw relaxed and hold this position for 3 deep breaths. “Bring the screen to eye level so your head is not slouched forward or too high. Instead, keep a neutral spine so your ear is in line with your shoulders,” says Cappo. This will keep you from holding a forward-head posture for a prolonged period of time. Frequent breaks from the screen can help, even if it’s just two to three minutes every hour. “Getting rid of the habit of looking down is my first suggestion to preventing and alleviating tech neck, but that’s highly unlikely for most people. So instead I recommend that people try to consciously take breaks from their phones,” says Goodrich. “Set reminders on your phone or computer, or use a sticky note. These small cues can make a huge difference.” There’s a for Android that offers “immediate real time feedback” about your posture (indicated by a green or red light). There’s also an optional vibration or beep reminder to tell you when you’ve lapsed back into bad habits. If you experience prolonged pain, Elizabeth Anderson, DC and Erin Anderson, DC, of , recommend getting adjusted, which helps relieve pain and address the structural issues that text neck creates over time. And they might be onto something. A pointed to chiropractic care as one of the major nonpharmacological therapies considered effective for acute and chronic neck and back pain. The best way to treat and prevent neck and back pain is yoga, Goodrich says, because it helps improve movement patterns, increases body awareness, and incorporates breath work. Neck pain is caused by a muscular imbalance, such as tight rhomboids, but daily yoga sessions can help correct those differences. Doing the exercises mentioned above, or , can make a difference. There’s been debate if text neck is really the problem its chalked up to be. Recently, researchers in Brazil studied 150 young adults, ages 18-21, and found that . However, they did note that the high mobile phone use and lack of exercise . So remember: There’s no single method guaranteed to alleviate your tech-induced pains. But, at the end of the day, it doesn’t hurt to stretch and exercise to keep your muscles active and flexible. rugby-playing, mud-running, protein-smoothie-blending, meal-prepping, CrossFitting, become a morning person, tried the Whole30 challenge, and eaten, drank, brushed with, scrubbed with, and bathed with charcoal, all in the name of journalism.

ce27608f-cfa0-4acb-94ce-2acfd7b5df9e,"The Top 4 Yoga Wheels for Upper Back and Neck Pain A yoga wheel is a simplest, quickest and most efficient remedy to get immediate relieve in your lower, middle and upper back muscular pain- without burning a hole in your pocket A long-lasting yet comfy yoga wheel can cure back pain from muscular tightness, back muscle spasm and a lot more within just 5 minutes. However, it is important to purchase the most recommended versatile yoga wheel that is robust yet flexible enough to render support to your weight and permit quick muscle pain relief. 5 Yoga Poses You Can Try for Neck and Shoulder Pain Relief The yoga wheel is an innovative improvement to the conventional foam roller, crafted to stretch and massage your spinal muscles- via canal which protects your spine. The wheel is soft yet firm to provide pressure points for a complete 4-way stretch to open your back fully. A channel in the mid of the wheel is crafted to fit on your spine and it also adjusts nicely between your shoulder blades. Let’s explore some of the best benefits offered by yoga wheel stretches here. Speaking of supporting your spine, the wheel massages your back muscles in the form of myofascial release (that’s why we also use foam rollers). It is like deep tissue massage with stressed muscles in the back. If you work at a desk, it will be especially a relief for you! Is it frustrating to try more than one posture without the right result? We all went there. While this use is limited by your thoughts only, the wheel really sparkles in the above postures – forearm stands and backbends. By providing a counterbalance in a scorpion-like posture, you can fully open your chest to maintain great stability. This is especially useful in backward bending movements because the wheel is designed to support the curvature of your spine – especially useful if you are still comfortable with these movements. Most of the yogi practitioners know that the key to quality is your core and long-lasting practice. Because the wheel is strong and rounded, it can support your body weight when included in tiles, arm/leg extensions, and other balance postures. As I mentioned earlier, it is also useful for inverted postures, which help you to be comfortable with movements and build vital core muscles. Like a yoga mat, the yoga wheel is easy to transport and travel with. You can keep in your bag, loop over your rolled mat or keep it on your shoulder. Not like other complex devices you can set it up and go to work – no setup required. In simple words, it means that the core of the wheel is made of long-lasting and solid plastic-wrapped with thick padding. Dissimilar to the foam roller, this ergonomic style helps in stretching and massaging your muscles, without putting complete pressure on the spine. It is highly recommended for spinal disc generation, sciatica, pinched nerves, spine arthritis, muscle pain in the back, bulging disc, etc. Pete’s choice Dharma Yoga Wheel is the first choice when it comes to picking the best yoga wheel for back pain.

Keep your arms outwards to the side and allow your head to hang back. Another recommended way to stretch back using a yoga wheel is through the child’s pose. Go for the child pose by keeping your knees apart and put both your hands on the wheel’s side in front of your mat. Put your head down and roll the wheel gradually forward as you press your chest towards the ground. The stretch helps in opening the shoulders up. The Child’s pose is a classic, relaxing posture which is proven to help in stretching the hips, thighs as well as low back in a convenient and comfortable manner. When looking for buying a yoga wheel, you’ will initially know what you like and what you don’t. The most vital thing to consider (other than elegance and price) is that it is well built, can support your weight and has a comfortable cushion exterior. Foam (or the other material you chose like wood or cork) must be high quality because it is usually the first thing to go for cheap products. Most wheels can support hundreds of pounds, so if you don’t buy a ten-dollar product, you should be completely safe. Additionally, you should also think about the size of your yoga wheel. They are 6 to 15 inches in diameter and 5 to 7 inches wide. Consider choosing a larger size, as it is more supportive (12 inches is the most comfortable size for most people). There are usually three standard sizes for yoga wheel small, medium and large. The largest wheel is approximately 12-13 inches high and 5 inches wide. It is best for deep postures, leaning back, and assisting you with beginner and advanced asanas. Medium-sized yoga wheels are about 10 “tall and slightly lesser on the same width. These are good for small people or anyone who wants to go deeper into the back bend, but is not ready to go without yoga wheels. Smaller yoga wheels are 6″ in length/height and 5-6’’ width. These really help stretch the muscles of the throat as well as supports you for stretching and balancing poses. For example, a small yoga wheel can be placed under your back thigh during a lunge or front support in cobra, so that you can start flexing your back. The size of the yoga wheel you decide depends entirely on your own personal practice and needs. Beginners of yoga can choose to start with a smaller wheel so that they can ease their way into positions, as well as adjusted with the wheel. With that said, beginners do not have to start with a small wheel and small wheels can still work well for experienced learners. Smaller wheels are also great for targeting certain muscles and for releasing them through myofascial tissue, similar to a foam roller. Larger wheels support in inversions, creating a stronger imbalance. They allow you to go deeper into the back bending posture and provide stability. Big wheels are also great for working with balancing positions. Most people step on the wheel for postures such as tree posture and eagle posture. It’s hard to balance with one leg on the wheel, but it definitely helps strengthen your body in crazy ways! For most of the parts, people using the yoga wheel found it safe and effective, particularly for upper back pain. However, it’s good that novices should begin with less deep stretches. When you use it for back-bends, keep some additional props handy like blocks, a mattress top or a blanket to avoid any injuries. In case, you have severe osteoporosis, forced spinal flexion may lead to fracture. Also, if you suffer from osteopenia, you should be cautious about extreme spinal movements. It’s best to commence slowly and find your way out. If you experience more than mild pain, then you should immediately stop. Yoga studios are today full of yoga belts, blocks, wheels, and other props to help you out in practice. However, every prop offers you a unique advantage and is meant to serve a different purpose, provided you know how to use them correctly. Here in this section, we will be talking more about yoga blocks, you will find out the difference between yoga wheel and yoga block and which one is better. The round shape of the Yoga wheel permits you to open your spine along with shoulders and inversion practice. Professionals can use the yoga wheel as core exercise too. While yoga blocks serve not just for backbend but also for different asanas, whether it is standing postures, Vajra asana, etc. So, it depends on what kind of practice you want to do. If you are an amateur in yoga prefer blocks, but if you are a regular practitioner then go for the wheel. If you need something very compact, a yoga block can be a better option. The yoga wheel is bigger and heavier than a block. It is also harder because it is made of wood and offers a solid base to apply pressure. While yoga block proves to be a better choice for those who need to pack it and use it anywhere else. Usually, yoga blocks are considered safer for practice because it is used in a lot of yoga classes. Yoga wheel, on the contrary, requires specific knowledge and understanding as it offers its user a very deep practice. Lastly, the yoga wheel is recommended for heart opening sequences because of the way it is designed. Often people fear that the opening may be very deep for a few. Talking about the stability of the wheel, you can perform a forearm stand pose by landing your legs on the wheel. All in all, it is a great practice when done with a certified yoga teacher in a studio, before practicing it on your own. The Yoga wheel’s circular shape permits your spine to blend in with the asanas when you require a curvy back bend while yoga block is recommended for those who want to target their spine before going for deeper practice as you need to have a firm foundation to go for the wheel pose. Foam rollers are basically longer and less sturdy. They may soften and break with constant use and time. It doesn’t happen with a yoga wheel. (This is the reason why popular Plexus wheel with a 10-year warranty and others offer a lifetime warranty). Using a yoga wheel is an amazing way to get between your shoulder blades- without putting unrequired pressure on your spine. The yoga wheel is highly nimbler and you can use it to roll tough to reach to body parts where foam rollers cannot reach. A yoga wheel can be used for a plethora of house exercises, including yoga, core exercises, etc. 5 Yoga Poses You Can Try for Neck and Shoulder Pain Relief Yoga exercises for neck and shoulder pain are most effective and can be tried out without any side effects.

Inhale and hold your breath while bringing your shoulders straight up as high as possible, then squeeze them tight for about 2 seconds. Breathe out and just let your arms drop back down. Do about 8 to 10 shrugs per set. For a bit more of a challenge, consider adding some lightweight dumbbells to the mix. This one starts out like a shoulder shrug. But after pulling your shoulders up to your ears, move them back and down in a circle. Repeat the same movement in the forward direction as well. Doing 5 rolls both toward the back and front should do the trick. This stretch makes a nice compliment to neck rolls and helps to strengthen the rhomboid and pectoral muscles. Sit up straight and touch your fingertips to your shoulders with your elbows pointed out to the side. Keeping your fingers in place, exhale and slowly pull your elbows together in front of you until they touch. Breathe in and allow your arms to move to their original position.

Keep in mind that posture isn’t the only cause of hunched shoulders. being overweight, which can pull your shoulders and upper back forward muscle imbalance due to working your chest and core muscles more than those in your upper back Depending on the cause of your hunched shoulders, treatment can range from stretching and exercises, to surgery if you’re dealing with a serious spinal condition. But, generally, regular stretching and gentle exercises are a good starting point. To relieve hunched shoulders, focus on stretching your chest and arms. A few simple stretches you can do at home include: Stand with your hands clasped behind your back with your arms straight. Slowly lift your arms until you feel a stretch in the muscles of the chest and shoulders. Extend one arm straight out and place your other hand behind the elbow of your outstretched arm. Pull that arm slowly toward your chest as you feel a stretch in your upper arm. Repeat with the other arm. Stand with your arms outstretched to each side (so you’re making a “T” shape). Move your arms in small clockwise circles. Do 20 repetitions and then do 20 more small counterclockwise circles. Simply lift your shoulders up toward your ears as you inhale, then roll them back and down as you exhale. You can do these stretches throughout the day, especially as you feel your upper back or shoulders tense up. Strengthening your back, shoulder, and core muscles can also help to support your shoulders. Try working the following exercises into your routine. Lie on one side with your elbow directly under the shoulder. Engage your abdominal muscles as you lift your hips so that just your feet and elbow are touching the mat. Hold for 30 seconds and then repeat on the other side. Work up to 2 minutes per side. You’ll need a resistance band to do this next exercise. These are available on , and you can use them for a variety of exercises. Tie a resistance band around a doorknob or some other object. Take an end of the band in each hand and start with your arms outstretched in front of you. Slowly pull your arms out to your sides, squeezing your shoulder blades together as you move. Try 3 sets of 15 repetitions. As you build strength and flexibility through stretching and exercising, you can help to prevent your shoulders from returning to a hunched position by practicing good posture. But before working on your posture, it’s important to make sure you know what good posture looks and feels like. You can do this with a simple technique known as a wall test: Stand with your heels 2-3 inches away from a wall, but with the back of your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks touching the wall. Slide a flat hand in between your lower back and the wall. There should be just enough room for your hand to move in and out. If there’s too much room between your back and the wall, pull your belly button in toward your spine, which should push your lower back closer to the wall. If there isn’t enough room to slide your hand in there, arch your back just enough to make room. Walk away from the wall while holding that posture. Then return to the wall to see if you have maintained that position. Practice this throughout the day for a few days, making sure that your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks are in alignment. After some repetition, you’ll start to recognize when you’re standing up straight and identify when you need to adjust your posture. When seated, your buttocks and shoulder blades should touch the back of your chair with a slight arch in your lower back. Keep your knees at 90 degrees and your feet flat on the floor. Try to keep your neck in line with your shoulder blades and buttocks, with your chin slightly down. Do quick posture checks throughout the day, especially if you spend a lot of time carrying a heavy bag, using a computer, or talking on the phone. If you notice that your shoulders are hunched and rounded, it’s likely a sign that some of your daily habits — from driving to using a laptop — are starting to affect your posture. With some daily stretching and light exercise, you can help to loosen tight muscles and build strength. But if these changes don’t seem to help, consider working with a doctor or physical therapist to help address the underlying issue.

What ailments can it cause? : Our experts at Godrej Inteio ergonomics cell too have documented a sharp increase in cases of shoulder and neck pain in women. The reason for this pain or discomfort is carrying a heavy bag or purse on one side of the body. This causes an imbalance in when the person stands or walks. It also presses muscles and nerves in the neck which run down to the shoulder and are severely strained due to constant load. If proper care is not taken in time, the pain might escalate to problems like and . : There is a mesh of nerves in the area between the neck and shoulder. There is a pull on the nerve roots on the side on which the weight is carried and compression on the opposite side because of the tilting of the head towards the opposite side. Similar thing happens in the upper and lower back as well with muscles and nerve roots stretched on one side and compressed on the opposite side. Not to forget that there are blood vessels too in the area between the neck and shoulder, even they get pressed. The problems this cascade of events can lead to are: Tight and inflamed muscles. Since the work of the muscles is to move a particular body part, the arm, neck, back movements are restricted and painful. Pulling or compression on the nerves or nerve roots can damage them which leads to paraesthesia which means abnormal sensations like tingling, numbness, pins and needles in the fingertips or along the arm. Damaged nerves can lead to loss of strength too in the hand so gripping things becomes difficult.

You probably don’t notice it right away. It might creep up after you’ve been sitting at your desk for hours, chipping away at your . Or perhaps it’s when you’ve been carrying your backpack on one side or taking calls by squeezing your phone between your shoulder and ear. Whatever the reason, sooner or later it hits you: Your shoulders are scrunched, your , and your muscles feel tight. “The neck and upper back area hold a lot of tension,” says Karena Wu, a physical therapist and owner of in NYC. “The amount of time spent with forward head and shoulder posturing increases the stress on the soft tissue and joints in the area.” In other words, with your head and neck in the same position leaves you with tight, stiff, and sore shoulders. And sedentary jobs aren’t the only issue. can add to the problem: When you experience high levels of stress, your rib cage can drop slightly, causing your shoulders and upper back to round forward into a slouch. Try these 16 moves — they’ll help with the stiffness and maybe even the stress. While all the moves on this list will help loosen your shoulders, relieve tension, and increase flexibility, this should be your first stop. Think of it as the gateway to the rest of the exercises. “This move helps someone find their good, upright postural position and moves the spinal column and soft tissues to increase circulation and blood flow,” Wu says. From a standing position, slouch slightly forward. No need to overdo this part, Wu says, because we’re already biased to move in this direction. Now, overcorrect to an upright position with a slight bend to your upper back (without putting pressure on your neck or low back). Our model, physical therapist Rebecca Young, suggests reaching your hand behind you to touch the area between your shoulder blades to make sure you’re feeling the movement in the right place: your upper back and shoulder blades. Repeat 3 to 5 times in each direction. This move sounds easy enough, but we bet you’ll need to concentrate on isolating your shoulder blades (and not simply moving your shoulders up and down). Start in a comfortable standing position with your arms at your sides. Move your shoulder blades up, then out (pushing away from your body), then down. You need to move only about 1 centimeter in each direction. Maintain good postural alignment throughout the exercise. Hold each position for 10 seconds or longer. Go ahead, embrace your double chin. This move is especially great for people who hold their neck in the same position for long periods of time (such as staring at a computer for eight hours a day). Move your chin forward, then slowly pull it back by slightly tucking it in toward your throat. Try to keep your chin parallel to the floor and straight (not tipping it up or down). Repeat hourly up to 10 times. Tilt your head to the right and slowly roll it down (chin to chest) and to the left (making a U shape). Then roll it to the right. Repeat 5 times in each direction. Only roll your head and neck sideways and forward — not to the back, since doing so increases the pressure on your cervical spine. Starting in a position of proper alignment, roll your shoulders up, then back, then down in a fluid motion. Repeat this movement about 10 times, and then reverse it, rolling forward about 10 times. Bend your right ear to your right shoulder. Place right hand over left temple and add a little extra pressure by gently pulling your head to the right. Your left hand can rest at your side or reach behind your back, or you can hold the bottom of a chair to increase the stretch. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat on the other side. Reach your right arm straight up, bend your elbow, and let your hand fall behind your head. Move your left arm behind your back and bend the arm, letting the back of your left hand rest against your right shoulder blade (or as close to it as possible). Reach to grab your right fingertips with your left hand. Repeat on the other side. If you can’t reach the fingertips of the opposite hand, use a towel to assist, creating a bit of tension by gently pulling on the towel in opposite directions. Cross your straight right arm across your chest. Use your left hand to gently pull the right upper arm closer to your body. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds, then relax. Repeat on the other side. With your back to a wall, allow your shoulder blades to rest in a neutral position and bring both elbows out to 90 degrees (so the sides of your biceps are in contact with the wall). Without moving your elbows, turn your right arm upward, so the back of your right hand touches the wall, and your left arm downward, so your left palm touches the wall (or they come as close as possible). Slowly switch (right arm up, left arm down; then left arm up, right arm down) for about 30 seconds, trying to keep your arms at 90 degrees throughout. Place both hands on a wall so they form a 90-degree angle to your body. Walk your feet back until your arms are straight and bow, hinging forward at the hips. (Don’t push on the wall, and don’t allow your arms to raise up too high, to avoid a shoulder impingement.) Keep your shoulder blades set back and avoid scrunching your shoulders around your neck. Turn your head 45 degrees to the right and look down in the direction of your armpit. Reach your right hand over the top and back of your head, with your elbow pointing in the direction of the armpit. Add a little extra pressure by gently pulling your face down toward your armpit. Your left hand can rest at your side or reach behind your back, or you can hold the bottom of a chair to increase the stretch. Repeat the exercise up to 3 times on each side. With your back to a wall, stand with your palms facing out. Slowly bring your arms up to make a T shape, keeping your arms and back in contact with the wall. Continue to bring your arms up to make a Y shape, then an I shape, touching your thumbs overhead. Focus on keeping your shoulder blades flat against the wall (not allowing them to stick out or wing). Bring your hands behind your back, with your thumbs pointing down, and clasp your hands, touching palm to palm. Your hands should be about even with your low back. Slightly arch your upper back, opening your chest and allowing your shoulder blades to gently come together. Hold for 10 seconds, then reverse the clasp (if your left thumb was on the outside of your clasp, switch so that your right thumb is on the outside). Standing perpendicular to a wall, make big, slow circles with one arm. Get as close to the wall as you can (coming into contact with it if possible). Repeat 10 times in each direction before turning the other way to rotate the opposite arm. Maintain good posture throughout, especially when moving forward. Do not slouch or round your back forward. Bring both your hands behind your back and allow your palms to come together in prayer position, feeling your shoulder blades open and keeping your back straight. To make this stretch easier, bring your hands behind your back and hold left elbow with right hand and right elbow with left hand. Start on all fours. Lift your left hand off the floor and “thread” it through the space between your right arm and right leg, letting the back of your left hand and arm slide along the floor. Allow the upper body (thoracic spine) to naturally rotate toward the right, but keep your hips level. Stop extending your arm when your hips begin to open to the right. (This may mean less range of motion than you could have if you continued to open your hips.) Lie facedown on the floor, with arms bent at your sides and palms on the floor about even with your chest. Keep your fingertips facing forward. Peel your chest up, leaving your hands in the same position and feeling an arch in the upper back only (no pressure on the low back). Keep your elbows squeezed close to the sides of your body. Raise your right hand off the floor and straighten your right arm, bringing bicep in line with ear if possible. Focus on not letting your shoulder raise up and not crunching your neck. Hold for about 5 seconds. Lower your right arm and repeat on the other side. Lie on your right side with your legs bent comfortably, your spine neutral, and your right arm straight and perpendicular to your body. With left arm on top of right arm, push your left arm slightly forward, lift it straight up, and rotate it back, making a large arch in the air. Let your left arm fall as far as possible to the left side, without letting your hips move in the direction of your arm. Allow your nose and gaze to follow your left arm, slowly turning your neck to the left. Move slowly, holding for a few seconds at the end of the stretch before returning to the starting position. Repeat 10 times. Switch to the other side. “You have to remember that the shoulder is not just a joint on its own; it’s part of the neck, the ribs, the scapula — it’s a whole complex,” says , a physical therapist and author of the book . Here’s a quick anatomy lesson (you’re welcome): The shoulder complex includes the humerus, the clavicle, the thoracic region of your spine, the rib cage, and, perhaps most importantly, the scapula (aka shoulder blade). The upside to all this complexity is that it gives us a huge range of motion in our upper body (think: nailing and throwing curveballs). The downside: The whole area depends on ligaments and muscles for stability — as opposed to the “ball-and-socket” stability our hips get. When those muscles get overused (or misused), we’re left with limited motion and stiffness. “All four [shoulder] joints need to be working appropriately and efficiently in order to have pain-free, functional range of motion,” Wu says. The best approach is to move frequently — forward, backward, and to the sides — throughout the day. But if tends to leave you feeling stiff by 4:00 p.m., the 16 easy stretches above should really help. Special thanks to our model, Rebecca Young, physical therapist at ActiveCare Physical Therapy.

An awful lot of weight rests on your feet so you can’t blame them for getting sore.  can also occur when the fascia (connective tissue) that connect the heel to the toes become inflamed. (it may help to balance with your hand on a chair, table, or wall) Allow your weight to rest on the ball, then roll it back and forth slowly from heel to toe. We do so much with our without thinking about it. We don’t even consciously notice until there’s pain. Household activities, heavy lifting, writing, gardening, typing, knitting, and racket sports can put strain on the many entwined muscles, tendons, and fascia of the hand. Flexor muscles attached the hand to the forearm can send shooting pain up to the and neck if strained. On a table no higher than your shoulder, place your hand on a tennis ball. Place the other hand on top to add pressure. Press steadily down on the ball with all your weight for 1 minute for initial tension release. Roll the ball in all directions under your hand to stretch all the muscles and tendons, keeping up the pressure. too long, high-impact aerobic exercise, and non-supportive shoes can contribute to hip pain. Hip joints hold together muscles and tendons of the back, legs, pelvis, and buttocks and withstand a lot of movement and strain. Tension released from the muscles surrounding the hips will be felt everywhere in the lower half of your body. Lie on one side on the floor and place a tennis ball between your hip and the floor. Roll slowly over the ball in circles 12 times, then switch sides. are especially susceptible to injury and pain because of the movement they are called upon constantly. Sitting or standing in one position too long can also cause strain. Age, too, can result in weakened joints. Maintaining surrounding the knees will take some of the pressure off the joint. This stretch will reach into the knee joint capsule where all the tendons, muscles, and nerves converge. Sit with a straight back in a firm chair with feet flat on the floor. Place a tennis ball behind one knee toward the outer part of the joint. Squeeze and release the muscles around the tennis ball 10 times then switch legs. Second only to back pain  is extremely common. Posture, insufficient support from your bed or pillow, bad shoes, and huddling over a radiant screen contribute to a sore neck. Constriction here can cause and back, leg, and arm pain. This stretch releases the suboccipital and erector muscles of your neck and is especially soothing before going to sleep. Lie face up on the floor. Place 2 tennis balls on either side of the spine at the base of your neck. Nod your head up and down, with the weight of your head and upper back applying pressure against the balls. Continue slowly for 1 minute. Now move your head from side to side for 1 minute. Stop and turn your head to 1 side and pause to nod up and down. Slowly turn your head to the other side and repeat. Continue alternating sides and nodding for 2 minutes. The way we sit, stand, and walk affects every muscle in the body. The effects of can cause pain and even difficulty breathing. Becoming mindful of the position of your body, keeping the legs in alignment and the back straight will help to prevent discomfort and muscle restriction. Lie face up on a mat or smooth rug on the floor. Place a tennis ball on each side of your upper back just below where your neck attaches. Place the palms of your hands behind your head in a sit-up position and raise your head off the floor. Lower your chin toward your chest, then lift your hips off the floor so your body weight rests on the tennis balls. Slowly shift your weight so the balls roll up and down to relax the muscles on either side of your spine. Breathe deeply while stretching and continue for up to 4 minutes. The rotator cuff is the group of muscles and tendons that allows your to move up and down, side to side, and in circles. It is the place that stabilizes where the humerus meets the scapula and joins to the torso. This exercise will stretch the muscles and tendons surrounding the cuff. Lie face up on the floor. Place a tennis ball under your scapula (shoulder blade). Allow your weight to rest on the ball. Move your upper torso over the ball in the vicinity of the shoulder to release tension and ease tenderness. The iliotibial (IT) band is a ligament that connects the knee to the upper leg. Strain due to sitting in one position for an extended period (one extreme) to overuse while running or cycling (the other extreme) can cause tightness and discomfort while the surrounding muscles get stuck to the ligament or strain from being overtaxed. Pain can occur at the knee, the hip, or anywhere in between. Use 2 tennis balls to loosen the muscles from the ligament and get everything moving again. Sit in a firm chair with feet flat on the floor. Hold a tennis ball in each hand and place both on the outer side of the troubled thigh. Slowly bend your knee up and back, rolling the balls along the side of the thigh where the muscle meets the tendon. You’ll feel where that is—it’s the sorest part of the tight muscles. Repeat 30 times or as many as is comfortable. Next, with foot flat on the floor, move your thigh from side to side, allowing the balls to roll along the quadriceps. Repeat as many times as is comfortable, then switch legs if necessary.

3470f3b7-060d-43d5-ba06-146e2d10a270,"— Herniated disc, bulging disc, or slipped disc? Whatever you want to call it, this condition can be extremely painful. are most common in early to middle-aged adults. They’re often caused when too much pressure is put on an otherwise healthy spine. The spine is composed of many bony vertebrae, separated by jelly-like discs. A herniated disc occurs when the soft inside of the disc (the nucleus) leaks through the tough outer portion (the annulus). This irritates the surrounding nerves. A herniated disc often occurs with movements, including: Bad posture and poor ergonomics may also contribute to its likelihood. When the herniated disc affects the nerves in a specific area of the spine, it can lead to pain and weakness in the area of the body that specific nerve serves. If a disc herniates in the neck or upper spine, it can cause pain to radiate down the: This pain is called cervical . It’s more commonly referred to as a . The notes that cervical radiculopathy may result in feelings of burning, tingling, and weakness in the arm, shoulder, or hand. In severe cases, it may also result in loss of feeling and paralysis. There are several treatment approaches for a herniated disc. Most doctors recommend pain medication, rest, physical therapy, and other conservative treatments before considering surgery. The following exercises may improve your neck pain from your herniated disc faster. The goal of these exercises is to push the disc back, away from the nerve root. Always have your doctor do an evaluation before attempting exercise at home. from Regional Medical Group in Atlanta recommends these exercises to relieve your neck pain. Lie on your back on a table or bed with the bottom of your neck in line with the edge. Slowly and gently lower your head backward and let it hang. If this makes your pain worse, or sends pain down your arm, don’t continue. Hold this position for 1 minute, rest 1 minute, and repeat 5 to 15 times. Lie on your stomach on a table or bed with your arms by your side and head hanging off the structure. Slowly and gently raise your head up, extending your neck against gravity. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds. Repeat 15 to 20 times. Lie on your back with your head on the bed and hands by your side. Tuck your chin in toward your chest, making a double chin. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds. Repeat 15 to 20 times. Sit or stand against a wall with your arms by your side. Bring your shoulders down and back and push the back of your arms toward the wall, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Sit up tall and relax your shoulders. Put your hand on your forehead. Press your head into your hand without moving your head. Hold this position for 5 to 15 seconds. Repeat 15 times. Stretching may benefit people with a bulging or herniated disc. Just remember that stretching should not increase pain. If pain increases with stretching, stop immediately. For example, if a stretch causes a shooting pain down your shoulder and arm, don’t perform the stretch. The goal of stretching is to relieve pain, not increase it. Slowly tilt your head to one side as if you’re going to touch your ear to your shoulder. Hold this position for 30 seconds, then rest. Repeat 3 to 5 times throughout the day. Grasp the chair you’re sitting in with your left hand and let your shoulder blade move down. Slowly bend your right ear down toward your right shoulder and slightly backward. Hold this position for 30 seconds, rest, and repeat 3 to 5 times throughout the day. Gently turn your head to the side. Don’t over-rotate your head behind you and avoid twisting your neck. Hold each position for 30 seconds. Repeat 3 to 5 times throughout the day. , a board-certified cervical spine surgeon, recommends avoiding any high-impact exercises while your herniated disc is healing. Exercises like running, jumping, powerlifting, or anything that involves sudden sharp movements, can greatly increase your pain and slow down healing. It may even cause lifelong problems. It’s still possible to participate in many of your usual activities. It’s important to modify challenging activities and keep your neck in a pain-free position. Gentle exercise is beneficial to the healing process. This is because it encourages: A looked at the effectiveness of active treatment (physical therapy and home-based exercise) and passive treatment (cervical collar and rest) for cervical radiculopathy versus a “wait and see” approach. Both the active and passive treatment had a significantly positive impact on pain and disability at the 6-week follow-up versus those who didn’t receive any treatment at all. This high-quality randomized control trial leaves little doubt that exercise can help heal cervical radiculopathy faster than waiting it out. — What Causes Shoulder Blade Pain and How to Treat It Find out what's causing your shoulder blade pain and how to relieve your pain.

Pain on the left side of the neck can be due to any number of causes, from muscle strains to a pinched nerve. Most causes aren’t serious. A is likely due to sleeping in an odd position or holding your neck at an angle that stresses the muscles and tendons on that side. In many cases, the pain on the left side of your neck will subside on its own or with over-the-counter pain relievers and rest. See a doctor if your pain is severe, is due to a recent injury, or if it lasts for more than a week. Read on to learn about some of the more common and less common triggers of left-side neck pain, and how these conditions may be diagnosed and treated. is the body’s response to injury or infection. It can cause pain, swelling, stiffness, numbness, and other symptoms. are usually the first line of defense in treating short-term pain and inflammation. Most can be bought over the counter (OTC). If you spend hours leaning forward at your computer, cradling a phone between your right ear and your shoulder, or otherwise stressing your neck muscles, you can end up with pain on the left side of your neck. Most can be successfully at home with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). A pinched nerve (cervical radiculopathy) occurs when a becomes irritated or squeezed as it branches out from the spinal cord. If it’s on the left side, it may also cause numbness and pain in the left shoulder. Here are for a pinched nerve. You can also try these to relieve a pinched nerve in your neck. You can get when your head is forcefully thrust back and forth. This can happen from a football tackle, a vehicle accident, or a similar violent incident. Whiplash can often lead to a painful neck injury. Neck stiffness and headaches are among the other common symptoms of whiplash. Doctors typically prescribe OTC pain medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin (Bufferin) to relieve symptoms of whiplash. More severe injuries may require prescription painkillers and muscle relaxants to reduce muscle spasms. In addition to medication, you may also want to apply ice or heat to the injured area. You might also be given a foam collar to keep your neck stable. Collars should only be used the first couple of days after your injury and worn no more than three hours at a time. occurs when the muscles in your neck suddenly contract, causing your head to twist to one side. It usually causes pain on one side of the neck and may be triggered by sleeping awkwardly without much head support. It can also be caused by poor posture or even leaving your neck exposed too long in cold temperatures. , , and massage may help to relieve pain. Applying is also recommended. The seven bones at the top of the vertebrae are known as the cervical vertebrae. A cervical fracture, also known as a , can occur from violent contact in sports, serious falls, vehicle accidents, or other traumatic injuries. The most serious risk with a cervical fracture is damage to the spinal cord. In between the bones in your vertebrae are tough, but flexible discs that serve as shock absorbers to protect the bones. The outside of each disc is the annulus fibrosis, a tough structure that encloses a fluid-filled nucleus, the nucleus pulpous. Over time, these discs become less flexible. The annulus fibrosis may degenerate and tear, leading to the material of the nucleus pulpous impinging or resting on the spinal cord or a nerve root. This can result in neck pain. A occurs when the tough outer layer of a cervical disc tears and allows the nucleus to push through and press on the nerves and spinal cord encased in the vertebrae. In addition to pain in the neck, the condition can cause numbness, weakness, or tingling that can extend down into the arms. is usually caused by a virus, but there are also bacterial, fungal, and parasitic versions of the inflammatory condition. It can cause pain and stiffness in the neck, as well as headaches. Untreated bacterial meningitis can lead to brain swelling and seizures. is an inflammatory disease that affects about 1.3 million Americans. It damages the lining of the joints and can cause considerable pain, stiffness, numbness, and muscle weakness. Pain from this condition may be felt on the left or right side, or in the middle of the neck, depending on which part of the joint is affected. The bone-thinning disease called doesn’t always bring on symptoms, but it does raise the risk of painful fractures of the cervical vertebrae. The cause of remains unknown, and it affects each person who has it a little differently. It may cause pain in the neck and throughout the body and can be challenging to treat. is a narrowing of the spinal canal, which results in a pinching of the spinal cord or nerves extending from the spinal cord. This condition, caused by osteoarthritis, can occur in the cervical vertebrae and all the way down the spine to the lower back. In some cases, pain anywhere in the neck can be a sign of a . But there will usually be other noticeable symptoms, such as pain in the jaw, arm, or back, as well as shortness of breath, nausea, and a cold sweat. Women are more likely than men to report as a heart attack symptom. A spinal tumor is a growth that forms within the spinal canal or the bones of your spine. It may be benign (noncancerous) or cancerous, and can cause pain at the site of the tumor. Muscle weakness is another common sign. Symptoms tend to worsen until the tumor is treated. A range of conditions can affect newborn babies, causing pain on the left side of the neck and other similar symptoms. Among them are: , in which the neck is injured during delivery congenital vertebral defects, which can include abnormally shaped cervical vertebrae. Pain on the left side of your neck that lasts for more than a week and doesn’t respond to treatment should be evaluated by a doctor. If you start to feel pain running down your arms or legs, or you feel a numbness or tingling sensation in your neck, see a doctor as soon as you can. Neck pain accompanied by a headache should also be evaluated promptly. If neck pain is the result of an obvious incident, such as a car accident, fall, or sports injury, seek medical attention immediately. When you see a doctor about pain on the left side of your neck, they’ll first give you a physical examination. They’ll check your range of motion and areas of tenderness, swelling, numbness, weakness, and the specific areas causing you pain. The doctor will also review your medical history and discuss any other symptoms you may be experiencing. Screening tests may also be recommended. These include: The right treatment for your neck pain depends on your condition, its severity, and your overall health. For minor neck pain, try a heating pad or a hot shower for 20 minutes or so at a time for the first two to three days. Then use ice packs for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day. Here are a few other simple remedies and lifestyle tips to try: Take anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen (Advil). Use good posture when standing, sitting, and walking. Adjust your chair so that your eyes are looking straight at your computer screen. Sleep with your head and neck aligned with the rest of your body. Avoid carrying heavy suitcases or other items that pull too much on one shoulder. You may be advised to have physical therapy to help relieve your pain. In addition, you’ll learn exercises, posture changes, and other adjustments you can make to feel better and prevent future problems. You may also need a procedure to relieve your pain or correct a problem in your neck. Depending on the source of the pain, your doctor may inject corticosteroid medications into the nerve roots, muscles, or in between bones of the vertebrae on the left side of your neck to relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. If your spinal cord or nerve roots are being compressed, or if there’s a fracture to be repaired, surgery may be necessary. Sometimes wearing a neck brace is enough to keep the cervical vertebrae stable while they heal without surgery. Nonspecific pain on the left side of the neck — meaning pain that’s not caused by a specific injury or condition — is a common occurrence. Nonspecific neck pain affects about at some stage in life, more often in middle age. Most neck pain that develops from muscle strain or similar causes usually disappears with rest after a few days. If your pain lingers for more than a week or is accompanied by other symptoms, seek medical attention. The pain may still be due to a muscle strain that’s just taking longer to heal, but getting a thorough medical evaluation will keep you from guessing if it might be something more serious. — Pain can occur on either side of your neck and may be related to simple muscle strain or more serious conditions like nerve damage or spinal injury.

5bc5cc3d-ba20-46be-9f32-ff9234cf4fcd,"including , are one of the more common reasons for physician visits for musculoskeletal symptoms. The shoulder is the most movable joint in the body. However, it is an unstable joint because of the range of motion allowed. This instability increases the likelihood of joint injury, often leading to a degenerative process in which tissues break down and no longer function well. Shoulder pain may be localized or may be referred to areas around the shoulder or down the arm. Other regions within the body (such as , , or , or disease of the cervical spine of the neck) also may generate pain that the brain may interpret as arising from the shoulder. Tendinitis, bursitis, impingement syndrome, and rotator cuff tears Arthritis or osteolysis of the AC (acromioclavicular) joint The joint is composed of three bones: the (collarbone), the (shoulder blade), and the (upper arm bone) (see diagram). Two joints facilitate shoulder movement. The is located between the (part of the scapula that forms the highest point of the shoulder) and the clavicle. The , to which the term """" commonly refers, is a ball-and-socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. The ""ball"" is the top, rounded portion of the upper arm bone or humerus; the ""socket,"" or , is a dish-shaped part of the outer edge of the scapula into which the ball fits. Arm movement is further facilitated by the ability of the scapula itself to slide along the rib cage. The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. The bones of the shoulder are held in place by , , and . Tendons are tough cords of tissue that attach the shoulder muscles to bone and assist the muscles in moving the shoulder. Ligaments attach shoulder bones to each other, providing stability. For example, the front of the joint capsule is anchored by three glenohumeral ligaments. The is a structure composed of tendons that, with associated muscles, holds the ball at the top of the humerus in the glenoid socket and provides mobility and strength to the shoulder joint. Four filmy sac-like structures called permit smooth gliding between bone, muscle, and tendon. They cushion and protect the from the bony arch of the acromion. Following are some of the ways doctors diagnose shoulder problems: Medical history (the patient tells the doctor about an injury). For shoulder problems the medical history includes the patient's age, dominant hand, if injury affects normal work/activities as well as details on the actual shoulder problem including acute versus chronic and the presence of shoulder catching, instability, locking, pain, paresthesias (burning sensation), stiffness, swelling, and weakness. Other salutary information includes OPQRST (onset, palliation/provocation, quality, radiation, severity, timing) and a history of issues that could lead to referred pain (pain felt at the shoulder but actually coming from another part of the body) including cervical spine disorders, heart attacks, peptic ulcer disease, and pneumonia. Standardized questionnaires like the Penn Shoulder Score that assess shoulder pain and function can aid in eliciting the required history to make a diagnosis and monitor condition progression. to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can home in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited. Tests to confirm the diagnosis of certain conditions. Some of these tests include: —Diagnostic record that can be seen on an X-ray after injection of a contrast fluid into the shoulder joint to outline structures such as the rotator cuff. In disease or injury, this contrast fluid may either leak into an area where it does not belong, indicating a tear or opening, or be blocked from entering an area where there normally is an opening. MRI ()--A non-invasive procedure in which a machine produces a series of cross-sectional images of the shoulder. Other diagnostic tests, such as injection of an anesthetic into and around the shoulder joint. The shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force that pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket. Dislocation commonly occurs when there is a backward pull on the arm that either catches the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability. A partial dislocation where the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a subluxation. In the medical community, dislocation is commonly referred to as luxation. Almost all shoulder dislocations are downwards (inferior) and of these, 95 percent are in a forward direction. Clinically this is referred to as an anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint. Not only does the arm appear out of position when the shoulder dislocates, but the dislocation also produces pain. Muscle spasms may increase the intensity of pain. Swelling and bruising normally develop, and in some cases there may be numbness and muscle weakness. Problems seen with a dislocated shoulder are tearing of the ligaments or tendons reinforcing the joint capsule and, less commonly, nerve damage. Doctors usually diagnose a dislocation by a physical examination, but X-rays are taken to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out a related fracture and other complications. X-rays are also taken after relocation to ensure it is in the correct place. Doctors treat a dislocation by putting the head of the humerus back into the joint socket (glenoid fossa) of the scapula—a procedure called . This is usually followed up with an X-ray to make sure the reduction did not fracture the surrounding bones. The arm is then immobilized in a sling or a device called a shoulder immobilizer for several days. Usually the doctor recommends resting the shoulder and applying ice three or four times a day. After pain and swelling have been controlled, the patient enters a rehabilitation program that includes exercises to restore the range of motion of the shoulder and strengthen the muscles to prevent future dislocations. These exercises may progress from simple motion to the use of weights. After treatment and recovery, a previously dislocated shoulder may remain more susceptible to reinjury, especially in young, active individuals. Ligaments are stretched and may tear due to dislocation. Torn ligaments and other problems resulting from dislocation can increase the chance of repeated dislocation. A shoulder that dislocates severely or often, injuring surrounding tissues or nerves, usually requires surgery to repair the damaged parts of the shoulder. Sometimes the doctor performs surgery through a tiny incision into which a small scope (arthroscope) is inserted to observe the inside of the joint. After this procedure, called arthroscopic surgery, the shoulder is generally restrained by a sling for three to six weeks, while full recovery, including physical therapy, takes several months. Arthroscopic techniques involving the shoulder are relatively new and many surgeons prefer to repair a recurrent dislocating shoulder by the time-tested open surgery under direct vision. There are usually fewer repeat dislocations and improved movement following open surgery, but it may take a little longer to regain motion. A shoulder separation occurs where the collarbone (clavicle) meets the shoulder blade (scapula). When ligaments that hold the AC (acromioclavicular) joint together are partially or completely torn, the outer end of the clavicle may slip out of place, preventing it from properly meeting the scapula. Most often the injury is caused by a blow to the shoulder or by falling on an outstretched hand. After injury it is hard to do a 180 degrees rotation. Shoulder pain or tenderness and, occasionally, a bump in the middle of the top of the shoulder (over the AC joint) are signs that a separation may have occurred. Sometimes the severity of a separation can be detected by taking X-rays while the patient holds a light weight that pulls on the muscles, making a separation more pronounced. A shoulder separation is usually treated conservatively by rest and wearing a sling. Soon after injury, an ice bag may be applied to relieve pain and swelling. After a period of rest, a therapist helps the patient perform exercises that put the shoulder through its range of motion. Most shoulder separations heal within two or three months without further intervention. However, if ligaments are severely torn, surgical repair may be required to hold the clavicle in place. A doctor may wait to see if conservative treatment works before deciding whether surgery is required. While not directly a shoulder problem, this may affect shoulder functionality due to problems with sternoclavicular rotation. A sternoclavicular separation occurs when the separates from the clavicle at the . Sternoclavicular separations (dislocation and subluxation) are rare and generally caused by accident. If the clavicle is separated posteriorly (i.e. the clavicle separates and goes behind the sternum) the situation can be dangerous and the clavicle can cause damage to interior arteries, veins or organs. An X-ray or CT Scan may be necessary to accurately diagnose a sternoclavicular separation. Treatment consists of the standard use of plenty of rest, icing, NSAIDs and a sling. The joint may need to be reduced (i.e. put back in place), especially after posterior separations. In severe cases, surgery may be advised. Tendinitis, bursitis, impingement syndrome, and rotator cuff tears These conditions are closely related and may occur alone or in combination. If the rotator cuff and bursa are irritated, inflamed, and swollen, they may become squeezed between the head of the and the . Repeated motion involving the arms, or the aging process involving shoulder motion over many years, may also irritate and wear down the tendons, muscles, and surrounding structures. is inflammation (redness, soreness, and swelling) of a tendon. In tendinitis of the shoulder, the rotator cuff and/or biceps tendon become inflamed, usually as a result of being pinched by surrounding structures. The injury may vary from mild inflammation to involvement of most of the rotator cuff. When the rotator cuff tendon becomes inflamed and thickened, it may get trapped under the acromion. Squeezing of the rotator cuff is called impingement syndrome. An inflamed bursa is called . Tendinitis and impingement syndrome are often accompanied by inflammation of the bursa sacs that protect the shoulder. Inflammation caused by a disease such as rheumatoid arthritis may cause rotator cuff tendinitis and bursitis. Sports involving overuse of the shoulder and occupations requiring frequent overhead reaching are other potential causes of irritation to the rotator cuff or bursa and may lead to inflammation and impingement. Signs of these conditions include the slow onset of discomfort and pain in the upper shoulder or upper third of the arm and/or difficulty sleeping on the shoulder, similar condition can have sharp pain or discomfort when the upper shoulder is positioned at certain angles. Tendinitis and bursitis also cause pain when the arm is lifted away from the body or overhead. If tendinitis involves the biceps tendon (the tendon located in front of the shoulder that helps bend the elbow and turn the forearm), pain will occur in the front or side of the shoulder and may travel down to the elbow and forearm. Pain may also occur when the arm is forcefully pushed upward overhead. Diagnosis of tendinitis and bursitis begins with a medical history and physical examination. X-rays do not show tendons or the bursae but may be helpful in ruling out bony abnormalities or arthritis. The doctor may remove and test fluid from the inflamed area to rule out infection. are frequently used to confirm a suspected tendinitis or bursitis as well as rule out a tear in the rotator cuff muscles. Impingement syndrome may be confirmed when injection of a small amount of anesthetic (lidocaine hydrochloride) into the space under the acromion relieves pain. Anti-inflammatory medicines such as , or among others can be taken to help with pain. In some cases the physical therapist will use and electrical stimulation, as well as manipulation. Gentle stretching and strengthening are added gradually. If there is no improvement, the doctor may inject a medicine into the space under the acromion. However, recent showed limited efficacy of corticosteroid injections for pain relief. While steroid injections are a common treatment, they must be used with caution because they may lead to tendon rupture. If there is still no improvement after six to 12 months, the doctor may perform either arthroscopic or open surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the tendons and bursae. In those with of the shoulder high energy can be useful. It is not useful in other types of tendonitis. The term ""rotator cuff"" refers to a group of four tendons that blend together as they attach to the upper end of the arm bone (humerus). Normally these tendons transmit the force of muscles originating on the shoulder Blade (scapula) to the arm providing motion and stability. The most commonly affected tendon is that of the supraspinatus muscle. Defects in the rotator cuff can come from an injury (cuff tear) or from degeneration (cuff wear). The degree to which a tendon is reparable depends on its quantity and quality. Degenerated tendons are often frail and retracted and may not be amenable to repair. Individuals that are elderly, smokers, or those having had cortisone injections often have weaker tendon tissue that fails without a significant injury. By contrast those whose tendon was torn by a substantial fall often have good quality tendon that can be repaired if surgery is performed promptly after the injury. The symptoms of rotator cuff disease include difficulty lifting the arm. Repair of a rotator cuff requires that the tendon be securely anchored to the bone at surgery and that the repair be protected for several months during healing. Tentative evidence suggests exercise may reduce pain in the short-term. Combination of exercise and joint mobilization can result in long term benefits. Other evidence demonstrates the use of corticosteroids injections to be more effective. A SLAP (superior labrum anterior to posterior) tear occurs when the cartilage of the shoulder (labrum) delaminates from glenoid. This causes an instability of the shoulder, typically in overhead movements. Symptoms include a dull ache deep in the shoulder joint, trouble sleeping due to the instability and discomfort, and extreme weakness in overhead activities. The best diagnosis for a SLAP tear is a clinical exam followed by an MRI combined with a contrast agent. Very few cases recover to complete mobility without surgical intervention. Some patients are able to strengthen their shoulders to limit the day to day dull ache, but with limited mobility and function. Surgery reattaches the labrum to the glenoid through the use of surgical anchors. Recovery is often a lengthy process. The first four or so weeks the patient is required to wear a sling. Following this, there is a month of physical therapy to regain range of motion. At two months limited strength training occurs. At six months the patient is typically released to full active use, although many patients find that full recovery takes longer than this. As the name implies, movement of the shoulder is severely restricted in people with a """". This condition, which doctors call , is frequently caused by injury that leads to lack of use due to . Rheumatic disease progression and recent shoulder surgery can also cause frozen shoulder. Intermittent periods of use may cause inflammation. Adhesions (abnormal bands of tissue) grow between the joint surfaces, restricting motion. There is also a lack of , which normally lubricates the gap between the arm bone and socket to help the shoulder joint move. It is this restricted space between the capsule and ball of the humerus that distinguishes adhesive capsulitis from a less complicated painful, stiff shoulder. People with diabetes, stroke, lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and heart disease, or who have been in an accident, are at a higher risk for frozen shoulder. The condition rarely appears in people under the age of 40. Further information: , , and A of the shoulder involves a partial or total crack through one of the three bones in the shoulder, the , the , and the . The break in a bone usually occurs as a result of an impact injury, such as a fall or blow to the shoulder. Fractures usually involve the or the neck (area below the ball) of the humerus. Fractures of the scapula sometimes occur through the . A shoulder fracture that occurs after a major injury is usually accompanied by severe pain. Within a short time, there may be redness and bruising around the area. Sometimes a fracture is obvious because the bones appear out of position. (However this occur in non-involved dislocations and separations.) Both diagnosis and severity can be confirmed by X-rays. When a fracture occurs, the doctor tries to bring the bones into a position that will promote healing and restore arm movement. If the clavicle is fractured, the patient must at first wear a strap and sling around the chest to keep the clavicle in place. After removing the strap and sling, the doctor will prescribe exercises to strengthen the shoulder and restore movement. Surgery is occasionally needed for certain clavicle fractures, especially for disunions. Fracture of the neck of the humerus is usually treated with a sling or shoulder immobilizer. If the bones are out of position, surgery may be necessary to reset them. Exercises are also part of restoring shoulder strength and motion. In arthritis of the shoulder, the cartilage of the ball and socket (glenohumeral joint) is lost so that bone rubs on bone. It may be caused by wear and tear (degenerative joint disease), injury (traumatic arthritis), surgery (secondary degenerative joint disease), inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis) or infection (septic arthritis). Arthritis of the shoulder causes pain and loss of motion and use of the shoulder.X-rays of the shoulder show loss of the normal space between the ball and socket. X-ray can provide . Early on arthritis of the shoulder can be managed with mild analgesics and gentle exercises. Known gentle exercises include warm water therapy pool exercises that are provided by a trained and licensed physical therapist; approved land exercises to assure free movement of the arthritic area; cortisone injections (administered at the minimum of every six months according to orthopedic physicians) to reduce inflammation; ice and hot moist pact application are very effective. Moist heat is preferred over ice whereas ice is preferred if inflammation occurs during the daytime hours. Local analgesics along with ice or moist heat are adequate treatments for acute pain. In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, specific medications selected by a rheumatologist may offer substantial relief. When exercise and medication are no longer effective, shoulder replacement surgery for arthritis may be considered. In this operation, a surgeon replaces the shoulder joint with an artificial ball for the top of the humerus and a cap (glenoid) for the scapula. Passive shoulder exercises (where someone else moves the arm to rotate the shoulder joint) are started soon after surgery. Patients begin exercising on their own about three to six weeks after surgery. Eventually, stretching and strengthening exercises become a major part of the rehabilitation programme. The success of the operation often depends on the condition of rotator cuff muscles prior to surgery and the degree to which the patient follows the exercise programme. In young and active patients a partial shoulder replacement with a non-prosthetic glenoid arthroplasty may also be a consideration Arthritis or osteolysis of the AC (acromioclavicular) joint The consists of the and a small disk of cartilage located in between the acromion and the clavicle. This disk can wear down through , extreme joint stress (via ) or normal wear. Pain is perceived on shoulder motion, especially on certain movements. Often a crossover arm test is utilized in diagnosis because this compresses the AC joint, exacerbating the symptoms. X-rays of the shoulder joint may show either of the ac joint or . Conservative treatment for this joint is similar to treatments for other types of arthritis, including restricting activity, anti-inflammatory medications (or supplements), physical therapy, and occasionally cortisone shots. If the pain is severe, surgery may be an option. The most common surgical treatment, known as resection arthroplasty, involves cutting a very small portion off the clavicle end and letting scar tissue fill in its place. Some portions of the acromioclavicular ligament may still remain attached. A for the basic treatment principles of any musculoskeletal problems is : rotection, est, ce, ompression, and levation: : Guard the shoulder to prevent further injury. : Reduce or stop using the injured area for 48 hours. : Put an ice pack on the injured area for 20 minutes at a time, 4 to 8 times per day. Use a cold pack, ice bag, or a plastic bag filled with crushed ice that has been wrapped in a . : Compress the area with , such as an wrap, to help stabilize the shoulder. : Keep the injured area elevated above the level of the . Use a to help elevate the injury. According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) visits to orthopedic specialists for shoulder pain has been rising since 1998 and in 2005 over 13 million patients sought medical care for shoulder pain, of which only 34 percent were related to injury. .

The microfibers are also hypoallergenic, making this pillow suitable for anyone with down or feather allergies. You can choose from three pillow densities that affect the loft, or thickness, as well as how supportive the pillow feels. The soft option features the lowest loft and is a good choice for stomach sleepers who’d rather not sleep face-down on a thick pillow. The medium feel is a mid-loft option, and should be most comfortable for back sleepers. The firm pillow offers the thickest loft. We recommend this feel for side sleepers because more fill can help to promote even spinal alignment – a common concern with this position. The fill is encased in smooth and breathable cambric cotton. The loft shouldn’t absorb or trap too much body heat, so we recommend the Down Alternative Pillow for hot sleepers.

The Medcline Shoulder Relief Pillow is primarily designed for side sleepers, but back sleepers may also be able to use one or more of the pillow’s components. All three pillows are cushioned with dense memory foam, which is considered one of the best materials for reducing shoulder pain. The pillows are especially well-suited for people with rotator cuff injuries, as well as arthritis, bursitis, and/or nerve impingement around the shoulder area. A symmetrical design enables any side sleeper to use the pillow, whether they prefer the left or right side. The pillows include cases that can be removed for washing and drying in a household machine. While the Medcline Shoulder Relief Pillow may be a bit expensive, this product can be a valuable investment if shoulder pain is negatively affecting your sleep. The pillow is backed by a 100-night sleep trial and a one-year warranty. “Shoulder” is the shorthand term for the ball-and-socket joint that allows both of your arms to move freely. indicate that roughly 15 out of every 1,000 medical patients sees a physician about shoulder pain, and some studies suggest 70 percent of adults will experience shoulder pain at least once during their lifetime. The shoulder joint consists of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), scapula (shoulder bone), and humerus (upper arm bone). According to the , shoulder pain can also develop from a wide range of injuries and medical conditions. These include the following: Frozen shoulder characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of range of motion Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or septic arthritis If you experience along with the shoulder pain, such as shortness of breath or an uncomfortable tightening sensation in the chest, you should call 911 immediately – these could be signs of a more serious condition. Sudden pain, swelling, warmth, and/or loss of movement may necessitate a visit to the emergency room or your physician’s office. The also notes several treatment methods for ongoing shoulder pain. Less invasive options include physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications or injections, or simply resting until the pain subsides. You may need to undergo certain medical procedures if the pain persists or worsens over time. Surgical treatments for shoulder pain include arthroscopy, open shoulder surgery, shoulder resurfacing, and replacement. The information and tips in this guide should never replace the advice of a credentialed medical professional. Please contact your physician or another certified healthcare provider to learn more about diagnosing and treating shoulder pain. According to Ruben Gobezie, M.D., founding director and chief of surgery at the , discomfort in bed and sleep problems are common issues for people with shoulder pain. Patients frequently feel discomfort regardless of which sleep position they employ. Some also feel numbness, tingling, and muscle spasms. While any of the conditions listed above could contribute to shoulder pain-related sleep problems, Dr. Gobezie notes three specific conditions are the most common culprits: , an inflammation of the bursa sacs that cushion bones around joints in the body. Inflamed bursa produce more liquid which can lead to painful swelling. , a condition that occurs due to prolonged deterioration of the biceps tendon that connects shoulder bones and muscles. Tendinopathy is characterized by sharp pains around the tendon. , a grouping of muscles that cushions and stabilizes the shoulder joint. Before seeing medical attention for any of these conditions, Dr. Gobezie recommends taking anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. You can also try sleeping in a recliner, applying ice or heat to the pain-affected areas, or wearing a compression sleeve. While replacing your pillow is not always effective, this measure may mitigate some of the nightly shoulder aches and pains that accompany these and other conditions. Dr. Gobezie notes that a large pillow to support the entire body or a smaller pillow behind the upper arm can also . Finding a new pillow to reduce shoulder pain might seem like a straightforward task, but there are several factors to consider based on your body type, normal sleep position(s), firmness and thickness preferences, and level of pain. Below, we’ll list some of the most important variables to take into account when choosing a pillow and discuss the most common pillow types based on fill material. What to Consider When Purchasing a Pillow for Shoulder Pain If you take pillow manufacturers at their word, then every pillow on the market today will reduce shoulder pain and deliver nightlong comfort regardless of your needs or preferences. However, very few pillows are designed to specifically target and alleviate shoulder pain. Furthermore, a pillow that is not soft, firm, thick, or thin enough can cause added discomfort based on your body type, head size, shoulder dimensions, and sleep position. Before buying a pillow for shoulder pain, check the following specs – and reach out to the manufacturer if you can’t track down any of these details. : Loft, or thickness, affects how supportive the pillow feels. typically need more loft to ensure even spinal alignment, which reduces pressure around the shoulders, lower back, and hips. Back and stomach sleepers often prefer less loft because this allows their head to lie evenly with the rest of their body and lowers their potential for neck and shoulder pain. : A supportive pillow will keep your head upright while cradling the neck, while a less supportive pillow will sink beneath the weight of your head. Some sleepers prefer the latter but many people with chronic shoulder pain need a pillow that will support the head and cushion the neck and shoulders. The ideal firmness level for any given sleeper depends largely on personal preference. Some feel more comfortable on a softer, plusher pillow, while others prefer a pillow that feels firmer and more supportive. Since support is often crucial for pain relief, those with shoulder pain may want to consider a firmer pillow – though excessive firmness can also lead to added aches and pressure points. The best pillows for pressure relief support the head and neck without sinking too deeply. If your head is on the smaller side and your wingspan is somewhat narrow, then a softer pillow provides adequate pressure relief, but those with larger heads and wider shoulders will probably find that a firmer pillow reduces more pressure instead. Some specialty pillows for people with neck pain have irregular shapes that differ from the rectangular cut of traditional pillows. These include wedge pillows that keep the head and neck inclined, and body pillows you can embrace for an added bolster around the neck and shoulders. You should be able to find a high-quality pillow that alleviates at least some of your shoulder pain for less than $100. These include wedge pillows, body pillows, and other models with irregular shapes. For a specialized pillow with multiple components, expect to pay a bit more. The materials used to construct a pillow can tell you a lot about its expected longevity and supportive qualities. In the next section, we’ll take a closer look at the most popular fill materials for pillows sold today. The best pillow materials include memory foam, buckwheat hulls, latex, and other fills that provide sufficient support to keep the head and neck upright and aligned with the spine. If a pillow sinks too much or loses shape quickly, the potential for more shoulder pain increases. Viscoelastic polyurethane foam – for short – is engineered to soften when exposed to body heat and return to its former shape when the heat is removed. By contouring close to the body, memory foam can alleviate pain and pressure around the neck and shoulders. Solid memory foam is used to construct many wedge and specialty pillows for neck pain, including a few of our top picks listed above. Shredded memory foam does not provide the same level of support, but many models with this fill offer adjustable loft. Buckwheat pillows are filled with hulls, the hard outer casings of buckwheat kernels. They tend to be quite firm but also highly supportive, so your head and neck won’t sink too deeply into the surface. Buckwheat pillows also offer adjustable loft. By adding or removing the hulls, you can make the pillow more comfortable for different sleep positions. Latex is a naturally resilient material derived from the sappy extract of rubber trees. It provides gentle contouring and won’t conform as closely as memory foam, but latex is also highly durable and won’t flatten as easily. refers to the soft inner plumage of ducks and geese located beneath their outer feathers. It is exceptionally soft and light, so resting your head and neck on a down pillow can alleviate tension and pressure to some degree. At the same time, down is not particularly supportive and won’t be suitable for sleepers who want more firmness from their pillow. Made from polyester microfibers, down alternative is a very soft and light material designed to mimic authentic down. Down alternative is hypoallergenic, making it suitable for people with down allergies, and these pillows tend to be much cheaper than their authentic counterparts. However, they don’t offer many advantages over regular down for sleepers with shoulder pain. The outer feathers of ducks and geese are slightly more supportive than down, but they still provide minimal levels of support. Unless you prefer a softer pillow, a feather-filled model may not keep your head and neck upright. Like memory foam pillows, polyfoam pillows may contain solid or shredded fill. Polyfoam doesn’t contour too closely and feels somewhat responsive foam, so these pillows may be a good alternative to memory foam models if you find the latter too adaptive. What Is the Best Pillow Positioning for Shoulder Pain? If you experience chronic shoulder pain, it’s entirely possible that no sleep position will feel totally comfortable. However, certain angles and pillow configurations may reduce some types of shoulder pain better than others, depending on specific condition and symptoms. Four useful pillow positioning arrangements are outlined below: A good rule of thumb for side sleepers with pain in one shoulder is to avoid lying on the affected side. With the sore shoulder upright, place one pillow under that shoulder’s armpit, another between the legs, and cuddle with a third pressed against your stomach. With a fourth pillow beneath your head, this configuration should promote even spinal alignment and help alleviate your shoulder pain. Since back sleeping promotes even spinal alignment without putting added pressure on either shoulder, this is often the best position for people with shoulder pain. If you notice soreness or stiffness in one or both shoulders, try placing a pillow in the armpit beneath the shoulder(s). Often the chosen pillow position for pregnant women, a pillow between the knees can improve spinal alignment for side sleepers by reducing pressure in the lower back and hips. Side sleepers with broad shoulders often experience uneven alignment because their hips and lower back don’t receive the same level of cushioning. A thin pillow placed under the back and hips can even out the spine and alleviate pain throughout the body – including the shoulders. Stomach sleeping is generally associated with more aches and pains than back or side sleeping. Neck and shoulder pain from craning the neck to avoid lying face-down on the pillow is a common issue for stomach sleepers. For this reason, we don’t recommend stomach sleeping for people with shoulder pain. In addition to using a pillow that offers adequate support, sleepers with shoulder pain can try one or more of the following strategies in order to find relief. As with pillows, a mattress can help reduce shoulder pain or exacerbate your discomfort – and again, this usually comes down to support level. A mattress that feels too soft and sinks excessively can worsen shoulder pain. Generally, side sleepers feel more comfortable on softer mattresses because they cushion the shoulders and hips while supporting the lower back, leading to better spinal alignment. The back position already promotes proper alignment on its own, so these sleepers need more firmness and support to prevent excessive sinkage beneath the shoulders. Physical therapy and stretching are commonly prescribed to medical patients with shoulder pain. The nature of these treatments largely depend on the nature of your injury and severity of symptoms, so please consult your doctor or another credentialed medical provider for more information. Slouching while sitting can greatly exacerbate shoulder pain. According to the , certain exercises can not only improve posture but also reduce pain in the process. These include “rolling the shoulders up and back, then letting them relax down, tucking chin down slightly, and sitting up from the hips.” You can also try standing against a wall by resting your head, lower back, and hips against the surface with your shoulder blades down and close together. Frequently Asked Questions About Pillows for Shoulder Pain Absolutely. If a pillow does not provide enough support for the head and neck, then you’re more likely to feel new or worsening shoulder pain. A less durable pillow that flattens or loses shape over time can mean more pain, as well. The best pillow for shoulder pain should properly support the head and neck, promote spinal alignment, and stabilize the affected shoulder(s). What is the most important consideration when choosing a pillow for shoulder pain? The most important factors when choosing a pillow for shoulder pain include loft (or thickness), firmness, shape, and fill material. Since everyone has different pillow preferences, we suggest trying different models to see which ones alleviate pain. As you’re starting out, consider pillows that offer sleep trials with free or mostly free returns. You’ll be able to test out these models without financially committing to them at first. What is the worst pillow type for shoulder pain? Down, down alternative, and feather pillows are generally considered the worst pillows for shoulder pain because they provide the least support and tend to flatten during the night. A mattress topper is a thin layer of cushioning material that rests on top of the mattress surface. Toppers are intended to change the firmness of the mattress – either softer or firmer – so using one can definitely reduce shoulder pain if your mattress sinks too much or feels excessively stiff. However, make sure the pillow you’re using also suits your needs; otherwise the topper on its own may not provide much pain relief. What Is the Best Pillow Positioning for Shoulder Pain?

Every time you drive, look over your shoulder, or talk to a group of people, your neck goes to work, bending your head anywhere you need to face. While you normally don’t notice your neck in action, when it is in pain, your neck becomes a very noticeable body part. The question of why you experience neck pain can have a variety of answers. It could be the way you sit at work, how you sleep, or the natural degeneration of aging. We’ve gathered some of the most common causes of neck pain in the following article, along with treatments that can offer pain relief when you need it most. At one time or another, nearly everyone has fallen asleep in an unpleasant position. Sometimes you start out that way, or sometimes the twisting and shifting you do while asleep leaves you in pain. Whether it’s on an airplane, in the car, or in your own bed, when you fall asleep in a way that bends your neck uncomfortably, you may wake up with a crick. The good news is that this cause of neck pain is usually not very serious. Better Sleep Positions and Treatment for Your Neck There are better and worse sleep positions for your neck. One of the worst is sleeping on your stomach. When you sleep this way, your back arches, and your head has to twist to the side to allow you to breathe. This puts extra pressure on your neck and shoulders and can lead to pinched nerves. You may not be able to do anything about the position you end up in while sleeping, but you can start your evening in a healthier sleep position. If your body is comfortable from this position, you may be less likely to move to an uncomfortable position in the middle of the night. When sleeping on your back, you naturally relieve the pressure that other positions can place on your spine. You can improve this natural advantage by choosing the right pillow. Back sleepers should choose a flat, soft pillow that is rounded for the space left open beneath your neck, providing it support. If your pillow doesn’t come with this type of neck support, you can tuck either a neck roll or a rolled-up hand towel into your pillowcase for the same kind of support. You can also use a feather pillow, which conforms to the space left between your neck and your mattress. Feather pillows break down over time, so if you choose this option, be prepared to replace your pillow every year or so. Watch out for pillows that are too high or too stiff—these can overextend your neck and cause pain. Side-sleepers should choose a pillow that is higher in the neck than the head, which will keep your spine aligned in a more natural position. A traditional pillow can work too if it’s made of memory foam, which allows your head to sink in while still providing neck support. If you do happen to wake up with a sore neck, an over-the-counter pain reliever along with rest should take care of it. Have you been looking up more than usual? Maybe you were bird watching, stargazing, or taking in an airshow. Whatever the reason, if you hold your neck in an unusual position for very long, you’ll be using your muscles in a way they aren’t used to. That leads to predictable discomfort the next day. For starters, don’t hold your neck in positions it isn’t used to unless absolutely necessary. When it is necessary, try to take frequent breaks with stretching and moving your neck in other directions. This will help keep your muscles loose and relaxed. Those tips are good for preventing strains in the neck. But what if you’re already in pain? Try to give your neck as much rest as possible. While you rest, use over-the-counter pain medicine to relieve the agony. If it still hurts after a few days or you find your mobility is limited, tell your doctor. Go to any bus stop or waiting room in America, and you’ll see it. People with shoulders slumped forward, necks down, noses in their cell phones. Perhaps the latest cause of neck pain, so-called “text neck” is a repetitive strain injury that can add stress and pain to your shoulders, lower back, and, yes, your neck. This cause of neck pain is unusual in that it affects younger people more than older people. While your phone gets all the blame for this ailment, it’s not the only culprit. Anytime you spend long periods hunched over, whether on the phone, at your computer, or at a workbench, you stand the same risk. To ease text neck, start with your posture. Straighten up your neck and back so that your spine is aligned. Your ears should be directly over your shoulders while you stare at your phone. You can improve your posture with a simple stretch; arch your upper back and neck backward, which will tuck your shoulders back as well. This can relieve the pain and stress that heavy cell phone use can cause. Finally, try lifting your smartphone to eye level. By looking forward rather than down, your neck won’t feel the strain as your head drops. If you play contact sports, sooner or later you’ll end up with a stinger. That’s the slang term for the shooting pain—almost like a lightning bolt—you might experience when you are hit in the nerves of your shoulders or neck. These usually go away after a few moments, but sometimes stingers last for days. Football tackles are the No. 1 cause of stingers, sometimes also called “burners.” They occur when a cord of nerves that runs from your shoulder to your neck called the brachial plexus is injured. Some people get them from spinal stenosis as well. And they can leave your arm weak and numb. Usually the pain and numbness of a stinger goes away after a few seconds to a minute or two. But itthey can linger, lasting for days in some cases. If this is true for you, or if you have received many stingers over your life, you should see a doctor. A doctor will test you to determine how much pain your neck is inyou have, how much weakness the injury has caused, whether or not both arms are affected, and how many stingers you’ve accumulated over your life. You will then be given a recommended course of treatment. If your stinger injury has lingered, your doctor will probably tell you to discontinue your sport until your symptoms have completely cleared up. Physical therapy can be a useful tool to regain your range of motion and strength. Recurrent stingers may require extra protective gear, such as special shoulder pads for football players. If you’ve been hit from behind by another car, you may develop whiplash. Whiplash is caused by blunt force from behind, and is most commonly a result of auto accidents. Other injuries can cause them it too, such as being tackled from behind. The name comes from the whip-like motion your head makes as it jerks forward and quickly back. That whipping motion can stretch and sprain the soft tissues in your neck. Symptoms of whiplash can come on gradually over the course of several hours. They include neck pain and stiffness, shoulder and arm pain, and spasms in your shoulders. You may also experience headaches, and some develop memory loss, dizziness, exhaustion, and other symptoms as well. Whiplash often gets better on its own after a few weeks or months have passed. Troublesome cases can last much longer, though. There are ways to ease the pain while your body recovers, as well as relieve any stiffness your injury has caused. After the initial acute symptoms are gone, you should be moving your neck, and avoid keeping it in the same position for too long. Although moving your neck is likely to be painful, movement is also what will help you recover more quickly. Don’t worry about doing greater damage—the damage is done at this point, and even painful movement will help you get better. That’s why doctors typically discourage using collars or braces that restrict movement, although they may be recommended for short-term use in some cases Try to remember this when you sit or lie down. Exercises are available that can help hasten recovery as well. While the movement can be painful, there are remedies for your pain. You can try either cold or warm compresses. Using a pillow firm enough to support your neck is encouraged. Keep your posture in line and remain upright whether you’re walking, standing, or sitting still. Gentle neck massages can help, too. When these at-home remedies aren’t enough, painkillers can help. Ibuprofen is good for relieving inflammation and pain. Sometimes over-the-counter pain relievers don’t do enough to stop severe pain. If that’s true in your case, talk to your doctor about prescription painkillers. Slipped disks in your spine are a common cause of neck pain. Also called herniated disks, slipped disks occur when the spongy pad between the hard bones of your spine ruptures and its jelly-like substance leaks. That places pressure on your spinal nerves, which are very sensitive to even light pressure. The result is typically pain. If the disk that has slipped is part of your neck, it can lead to pain, weakness, and numbness in your neck and arms. You may experience this as a burning pain. If you suspect a spinal disk has ruptured, you should see your doctor for a diagnosis. Your doctor will want to know your medical history and will perform a physical exam. If your doctor suspects a herniated disk, he or she may want to follow up with an MRI scan to confirm. Treatment may involve a combined approach using medicine and rest. Rest is important, as overusing the affected areas can cause your pain to return. When you do move, try to make your movements slow and controlled. That’s especially true when you need to lift something or bend over. While resting the area is key, you will want to avoid sitting for long periods. Your doctor may recommend short walks. Traction may be used as well. Medicine can range from over-the-counter painkillers to prescription muscle relaxers and pain medicine. Work with your doctor to find the combination that works best for you. Although surgery is not usually needed, some people with slipped disks will need an operation. That’s usually only recommended after other procedures have failed to ease symptoms. The surgery is called discectomy and fusion. In this procedure, the whole disk is removed, and bone is fused in its place. Spinal stenosis refers to a narrowing in your spine that pinches the vulnerable nerves in and around your spinal cord. When this occurs in your neck, it is called cervical stenosis. As you age, your risk of developing spinal stenosis increases; aging can cause bone spurs that narrow the spinal column. Only rarely do people under age 50 develop this condition, and when they do, it is usually the result of an injury. When you have neck pain, it is most commonly due to degeneration in your spine. Stenosis is one of the most serious consequences. Neck pain is only one of the symptoms. You may also find that your legs are weak and you may lose control of their movement, making it difficult to walk. You may find that your arms or legs become numb. You could also lose your “position sense,” which is the innate sense of where your limbs are when your eyes are closed. Cervical stenosis should be treated by a doctor. When preparing for your doctor’s visit, think about your neck pain and other symptoms. When did they start? What is the pain like? How often do you experience this pain? What are you doing when you feel your symptoms? Also think about any health problems you have that may be related, such as trouble with your arms, legs, or bowel or bladder control. After reviewing your medical history and giving you a physical exam, your doctor may take images of your spine via MRI scan or x-ray. Once a diagnosis has been made, surgery is often the best option. There are several types of surgery available for this condition, and you will want to discuss your options with your doctor. Bone spurs are smooth growths that develop as you age. They develop as your spinal discs wear down, causing the ligaments that hold them together to loosen. This wear can be the natural effect of aging, but it can also be hastened by arthritis. Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of bone spurs. As your ligaments loosen, they may compensate for the instability this causes by thickening. Thickened ligaments can start to form new bone that puts pressure on your spinal nerves. These bone spurs can cause tenderness in your joints and neck muscles, as well as inflammation. Bone spurs range in severity. Some cause only mild or moderate pressure on the spinal nerves, while others can cause muscle spasms, weakness, and more intense pain. Most patients will start with a conservative treatment for bone spurs that may include the following: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin. These can ease pain, relax muscles, and reduce swelling for a month to a month and a half. Physical therapy for improving strength, flexibility, and posture. Steroid shots, which reduce pain and swelling in the joints. Only three of these can be safely taken per year, and their effects are temporary. While these treatments may be enough, more serious cases of bone spurs could require surgery. Spinal tumors affect about 10,000 Americans every year. They can form in the neck or anywhere else along the spine. These tumors can be cancerous or benign, but even noncancerous tumors can pose serious health risks as they press against the spine. In many cases, spinal tumors start somewhere else in the body and spread (metastasize) to the spine. Although the causes of spinal tumors are not fully understood, having a family history of certain disorders elevates your risk. These include immune system disorders, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, and neurofibromatosis type 2. Although rare, these tumors can be passed down from generation to generation. Genetic testing is available to screen for this possibility. A wide variety of treatments and surgery are available for people with spinal tumors. What treatment options are best for you will depend on the location of the tumor, what type of spinal tumor you have, and how healthy you are. Here are some of the available care options: may be administered to reduce swelling. This can relieve pressure if part of the tumor is pressing against the spinal cord. A skilled surgeon can remove some spinal tumors. If surgery is unable to remove the entire tumor, radiation may be used to relieve more pressure. For cancerous tumors, chemotherapy may be ordered. These cancer-killing drugs may be given through injection or orally. attack cancer cells specifically, and are useful for certain spinal tumor types. This procedure focuses powerful radiation on the tumor directly. Doing this eliminates damage to healthy cells. Just by getting older, your neck becomes vulnerable to degenerative disk disease. The wear and tear of aging can cause the fibrous disc between your backbones to thin, crack, or dry out. This problem and the symptoms it causes are referred to as degenerative disk disease. Most people experience some spinal disc degeneration if they live long enough. By the time we reach 35, 30% of us show some amount of disc degeneration. By age 60 more than nine out of every 10 people show signs of degeneration. Degenerating discs are not necessarily painful, in which case the condition is simply referred to as “disc degeneration.” But when it does cause pain, degenerative disc disease can bring other problems as well. Your back’s discs can herniate or bulge, and they can cause bone spurs as well. Symptoms may include weakness and numbness in the arms and legs. It can also compress your spine, which can cause you to lose bowel and bladder control. Pain from disc degeneration in the neck tends to be worse when you move your head or stand or sit upright. You also may experience burning or tingling. What do you do if the discs in your neck are causing pain? It turns out you have several options. To begin with, try to avoid postures that cause you pain. A neck brace can be helpful in this way. There are other ways to relieve this painful condition, such as painkillers, epidurals, and anti-inflammatory drugs. When these approaches fail, surgery may be necessary. Traditionally this has meant spinal fusion, in which rods, screws, and bone grafts are used to secure the spine after the affected disc is removed. This approach has the downside of often accelerating the degeneration of nearby vertebral discs. Cervical disc placement is a newer approach that carries less risk of impacting nearby backbones.

3be5d677-f52d-470f-b0b9-2241ec13fe47,"5 Recommended Exercises for Healing a Bulging Disc in Your Neck — is a common ailment that can derail physical activity and make daily activities difficult to perform. For some people, the pain is temporary and only causes minor disruptions in their life. But for others, neck pain can be a result of a more serious condition, such as a , that requires a specific treatment plan to feel relief. “A bulging disc happens when the vertebral disc, located in between two spinal vertebrae, is compressed and causes the disc to be pushed out of its normal placement,” explained Grayson Wickham, PT, DPT, CSCS, founder of . The disc usually protrudes out of the back of the spine, either on the right or left side. A variety of treatment options exist for a bulging disc, including exercises you can do at home. Here are five expert-approved moves you can do for a bulging disc. “This exercise targets the deep neck flexors, as well as causing your neck vertebrae to move into extension,” said Wickham. Over time, this can help reduce pain and improve neck strength. Sit up tall as if you had a string attached to the top of your head. Make sure your neck is straight. Gently push your head backward. This will cause your chin to tuck, making a double chin. You should feel the muscles underneath your chin activating. “A lot of times, people are afraid to move when they have a disc injury, but this exercise helps activate your neck muscles and prove to your body that it’s OK to move,” said Wickham. Start on your hands and knees or on an exercise ball. Arch your neck upward as far as is comfortable and pain-free. Hold in this position for 3 seconds, then come back to the starting position, which is a straight neck. This joint mobilization targets the individual cervical vertebrae joints and the discs between the joints. “Light neck mobilizations like this have been shown to decrease pain and increase neck movement over time,” explained Wickham. Place a rolled-up towel behind the back of your neck. Grab both ends of the towel, and take up any slack in the towel. Gently pull forward with your hands while performing a chin tuck. “This stretch can help loosen the upper trapezius muscle, which often gets tight when you have neck pain,” says , assistant professor of rehabilitation and regenerative medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. Seated or standing, slowly tilt your head in order to bring your ear close to your shoulder. Switch to the other side and hold for 10 to 20 seconds. If you’re not feeling much of a stretch, you can gently use your hand to pull your head further to the side. Do 2 sets — both sides is 1 set — 2 to 3 times per day. “Poor posture and rounding of your shoulders forward can also increase the pressure on disc bulges, which can lead to pain,” explained Hameed. “A scapular setting stretch can increase the stretch in the front of your chest, improve your overall alignment, and bring your shoulder blades backward in a better position to help relax your neck muscles,” she added. Seated or standing, place your fingers on your shoulders. Roll your shoulders back and glide your shoulder blades down and together at the back with your elbows bent, as though you’re trying to place them down and back toward your back pocket. Repeat this exercise several times throughout the day, especially if you’ve been sitting for a while. Performing stretches and exercises designed specifically for rehab purposes are an excellent way to target your neck and the surrounding areas. That said, there are exercises you should avoid when you’re dealing with a bulging disc in the neck. Wickham says some common movements and stretches to stay away from include any movement that applies pressure to your neck, and any movement or stretch where your neck is flexed significantly. “If you’re experiencing pain from a bulging disc in the neck, you should avoid heavy weight lifting, especially anything overhead, until a physician has evaluated you.” — Dr. Farah Hameed, assistant professor of rehabilitation and regenerative medicine at Columbia University Medical Center You should also avoid exercises or positions that may put direct pressure on the neck, such as headstands and shoulderstands in yoga. Lastly, Hameed says to avoid high impact exercises such as jumping and running. Anything that may cause you to do sudden sharp movements may aggravate pain from a bulging disc. As always, if a particular movement increases your pain or exacerbates your symptoms, stop doing it, and talk with a doctor or physical therapist for alternative exercises. Other remedies that might help with a bulging disc In addition to any stretches or exercises you’re performing on your own, your doctor may also recommend taking a , such as ibuprofen, to help ease pain and inflammation. Treatment may also include weekly visits with a physical therapist who can use a combination of stretches, muscle activation techniques, and hands-on manual therapy. According to the , in more serious cases, a cortisone injection in the spine can provide relief. “There are cases where the herniation is severe enough in which surgery is warranted, but in almost all cases, it is best to try physical therapy before getting surgery,” said Wickham. If you’re already under a doctor’s care for a bulging disc, they’ll likely have steps for you to follow for return visits. But in general, some red flags indicate it may be time to make an appointment sooner rather than later. “If your symptoms do not get any better in 1 to 2 weeks or you have moderate to severe numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in your neck shoulders, arms, or hands, you should see a doctor,” said Wickham. Because there’s a close relationship in the spine of the discs and spinal nerve roots and spinal cord, Hameed says having any neurologic symptoms — such as persistent numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms — warrants a trip to your physician to undergo an evaluation and physical examination. Additionally, if you experience any of the following signs of cord compression, you should see a physician for urgent evaluation: Treating a bulging disc in a timely manner is critical, especially since discs can eventually . Performing the exercises and stretches listed above is a great place to start. A doctor or physical therapist can assist you with developing a more comprehensive exercise program to help manage any pain you may feel in your neck and strengthen the muscles in the surrounding areas. — How to Prevent and Treat a Stiff Neck: Remedies and Exercises A stiff neck can be painful and interfere with your daily activities, as well as your ability to get a good night’s sleep.

Your neck is made up of vertebrae that extend from the skull to the upper torso. Cervical discs absorb shock between the bones. The bones, ligaments, and muscles of your neck support your head and allow for motion. Any abnormalities, inflammation, or injury can cause neck pain or stiffness. Many people experience neck pain or stiffness occasionally. In many cases, it’s due to poor posture or overuse. Sometimes, neck pain is caused by injury from a fall, contact sports, or whiplash. Most of the time, neck pain isn’t a serious condition and can be relieved within a few days. But in some cases, neck pain can indicate serious injury or illness and require a doctor’s care. If you have neck pain that continues for more than a week, is severe, or is accompanied by other symptoms, seek medical attention immediately. Neck pain or stiffness can happen for a variety of reasons. This is usually due to activities and behaviors such as: working at a desk for too long without changing position The neck is particularly vulnerable to injury, especially in falls, car accidents, and sports, where the muscles and ligaments of the neck are forced to move outside of their normal range.

Even if it doesn’t seem related, you should also let your doctor know about any recent injuries or accidents you’ve had. Treatment for neck pain depends on the diagnosis. In addition to a thorough history and physical exam by your doctor, you may also need one or more of the following imaging studies and tests to help your doctor determine the cause of your neck pain: , which allows your doctor to check the health of your muscles and the nerves that control your muscles Depending on the results, your doctor may refer you to a specialist. Treatment for neck pain may include: hospital treatment if a condition such as meningitis or heart attack is the cause transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) Make sure you’re seeing a licensed professional when using these methods. If you have minor neck pain or stiffness, take these simple steps to relieve it: Apply ice for the first few days. After that, apply heat with a , hot compress, or by taking a hot shower. Take , such as or . Take a few days off from sports, activities that aggravate your symptoms, and heavy lifting. When you resume normal activity, do so slowly as your symptoms ease. Exercise your neck every day. Slowly stretch your head in side-to-side and up-and-down motions. Avoid cradling the phone between your neck and shoulder. Change your position often. Don’t stand or sit in one position for too long. Don’t use a neck brace or collar without your doctor’s approval. If you don’t use them properly, they can make your symptoms worse. Many people experience neck pain because of poor posture and muscle strain. In these cases, your neck pain should go away if you practice good posture and rest your neck muscles when they’re sore.

Whether throwing a ball, paddling a canoe, lifting boxes, or pushing a lawn mower, we rely heavily on our shoulders to do a number of activities. Normally, the shoulder has a wide range of motion, making it the most mobile joint in the body. But because of this flexibility, it is not very stable and is easily injured. The shoulder is made up of 2 main bones: the end of upper arm bone (humerus) and the shoulder blade (scapula). The end of the humerus is round and fits into a socket in the scapula. Surrounding the shoulder is a group of muscles and ligaments. Ligaments connect the bones of the shoulders. Tendons connect the bones to surrounding muscle. To keep shoulders healthy and pain-free, it's important to know how to spot and avoid common injuries. Shoulder instability happens most often in young people and athletes. When muscles and ligaments that hold it together are stretched beyond their normal limits, the shoulder becomes unstable. For younger people, this health problem may be a normal part of growth and development. Shoulders often stiffen or tighten with age. In athletes, shoulder instability is caused by certain motions used in tackling or pitching, for example. These motions put great force on the shoulder, stretching the shoulder ligaments over time. It can cause pain that comes on either quickly or gradually, a feeling that the shoulder is loose, or a weakness in the arm. Treatment includes rest, physical therapy, or surgery. A shoulder separation, or sprain, happens when the ligaments that hold the clavicle to the acromion tear. If this happens, the clavicle is pushed out of place and may form a bump at the top of the shoulder. Sprains often happen during a fall, when your hand or arm is outstretched to stop the fall, or when you fall on a hard surface. When the sprain happens, it causes severe pain, a misshapen shoulder, and decreased shoulder movement. Treatment depends on the severity of the sprain. To help ease pain and swelling, apply ice right after the injury. Keeping the arm in a sling to limit the movement of the shoulder lets ligaments heal. This is often followed by physical therapy exercises. Sometimes, surgery is needed. If the ligaments holding the shoulder bones tear and can't hold the joint together, the shoulder is dislocated. Falling onto an outstretched hand, arm or the shoulder itself, or a violent twisting, can cause a shoulder dislocation. The main symptom is pain in the shoulder that becomes worse with movement. To treat a dislocation, apply ice right after the injury to ease pain, swelling, and bleeding around the joint. Within 15 to 30 minutes of the injury, the joint will be painful and swollen. A dislocated shoulder needs urgent care. Healthcare providers treat dislocations by using gentle traction to pull the shoulder back into place. When the shoulder pops out of the socket repeatedly, it’s called recurrent instability. Recurrent instability can be treated with surgery to fix the torn ligaments. The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles of the upper arm. They allow you to raise and rotate the arm. The muscles are attached to the bones by tendons. The tendons of the rotator cuff allow the muscles to move the arm. If the tendons tear, the humerus can't move as easily in the socket. This makes it hard to move the arm up or away from the body. As people age and are less active, tendons start to degenerate and lose strength. This weakening can lead to a rotator cuff tear. Most rotator cuff injuries happen to middle-aged or older adults who already have shoulder problems. They can happen in younger people, too. The shoulder has a poor blood supply. This makes it harder for the tendons to fix and maintain themselves. Using your arm overhead puts pressure on the rotator cuff tendons. Repetitive movement or stress to these tendons can lead to impingement. This is when the tissue or bone in that area becomes misaligned and rubs or chafes. The rotator cuff tendons can be injured or torn by trying to lift a very heavy object with an extended arm. It can also happen from falling, or by trying to catch a heavy falling object. Symptoms of a torn rotator cuff include tenderness and soreness in the shoulder when using the shoulder. If the tendon has ruptured, you may not be able to raise the arm at all. It may be hard to sleep lying on that side. You may feel pain when pressure is put on the shoulder. Treatment depends on the severity of the injury. If the tear is not complete, your healthcare provider may suggest RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation). Resting the shoulder is probably the most important part of treatment. But after the pain has eased, you will need to start physical therapy to regain shoulder movement. Your healthcare provider may prescribe a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for pain. This extreme stiffness in the shoulder can happen at any age. It affects about 2% of Americans, most often between 40 and 60 years of age. The causes are not fully understood. Frozen shoulder can affect people with diabetes, thyroid disease, heart disease, or Parkinson disease. It can also happen if the shoulder has been immobile for a period of time. It can happen when a minor shoulder injury heals with scar tissue that affects how the joint moves. This scar tissue reduces flexibility in the shoulder and makes it more prone to injury. The main symptom is not being able to move the shoulder in any direction without pain. Treatment can be NSAIDs, cortisone shots, or physical therapy. You can reduce further injury and stiffness by stretching before starting activities. A sudden increase in activity can place great stress on the shoulders and lead to a loss of flexibility. This is a common problem in middle age, especially among people who don't exercise regularly, but go out every now and then for an intense sport. Although painful and inconvenient, overuse problems can often be treated with rest, NSAIDs, and stretching exercises. Starting as early as age 50, some people get osteoarthritis, which causes painful movement. This happens as the smooth surfaces of the cartilage that line the bones of the shoulder joint are worn away, and joints start to wear out. The most common cause of osteoarthritis is overuse. Treatments for arthritis in the shoulder depend on the severity of pain. The usual treatments are rest, NSAIDs, and cortisone shots. In some cases, a replacement of the shoulder joint is needed.",130,neck and shoulder stretches,-10.858268737792969,33

Mobility has its price, however. It may lead to increasing problems with instability or impingement of the soft tissue or bony structures in your shoulder, resulting in pain. You may feel pain only when you move your shoulder, or all of the time. The pain may be temporary or it may continue and require medical diagnosis and treatment. This article explains some of the common causes of shoulder pain, as well as some general treatment options. Your doctor can give you more detailed information about your shoulder pain. This illustration of the shoulder highlights the major components of the joint. Your shoulder is made up of three bones: your upper arm bone (humerus), your shoulder blade (scapula), and your collarbone (clavicle). The head of your upper arm bone fits into a rounded socket in your shoulder blade. This socket is called the glenoid. A combination of muscles and tendons keeps your arm bone centered in your shoulder socket. These tissues are called the rotator cuff. They cover the head of your upper arm bone and attach it to your shoulder blade. Most shoulder problems fall into four major categories: Tendon inflammation (bursitis or tendinitis) or tendon tear Other much less common causes of shoulder pain are tumors, infection, and nerve-related problems. Bursae are small, fluid-filled sacs that are located in joints throughout the body, including the shoulder. They act as cushions between bones and the overlying soft tissues, and help reduce friction between the gliding muscles and the bone. Sometimes, excessive use of the shoulder leads to inflammation and swelling of the bursa between the rotator cuff and part of the shoulder blade known as the acromion. The result is a condition known as subacromial bursitis. Bursitis often occurs in association with rotator cuff tendinitis. The many tissues in the shoulder can become inflamed and painful. Many daily activities, such as combing your hair or getting dressed, may become difficult. A tendon is a cord that connects muscle to bone. Most tendinitis is a result of inflammation in the tendon. Excessive ball throwing or other overhead activities during work or sport can lead to acute tendinitis. Degenerative diseases like arthritis or repetitive wear and tear due to age, can lead to chronic tendinitis. The most commonly affected tendons in the shoulder are the four rotator cuff tendons and one of the biceps tendons. The rotator cuff is made up of four small muscles and their tendons that cover the head of your upper arm bone and keep it in the shoulder socket. Your rotator cuff helps provide shoulder motion and stability. Learn more: , Splitting and tearing of tendons may result from acute injury or degenerative changes in the tendons due to advancing age, long-term overuse and wear and tear, or a sudden injury. These tears may be partial or may completely separate the tendon from its attachment to bone. In most cases of complete tears, the tendon is pulled away from its attachment to the bone. Rotator cuff and biceps tendon injuries are among the most common of these injuries. Learn more: , Shoulder impingement occurs when the top of the shoulder blade (acromion) puts pressure on the underlying soft tissues when the arm is lifted away from the body. As the arm is lifted, the acromion rubs, or ""impinges"" on, the rotator cuff tendons and bursa. This can lead to bursitis and tendinitis, causing pain and limiting movement.  Learn more: Shoulder instability occurs when the head of the upper arm bone is forced out of the shoulder socket. This can happen as a result of a sudden injury or from overuse. Shoulder dislocations can be partial, with the ball of the upper arm coming just partially out of the socket. This is called a subluxation. A complete dislocation means the ball comes all the way out of the socket. Once the ligaments, tendons, and muscles around the shoulder become loose or torn, dislocations can occur repeatedly. Recurring dislocations, which may be partial or complete, cause pain and unsteadiness when you raise your arm or move it away from your body. Repeated episodes of subluxations or dislocations lead to an increased risk of developing arthritis in the joint. Shoulder pain can also result from arthritis. There are many types of arthritis. The most common type of arthritis in the shoulder is osteoarthritis, also known as ""wear and tear"" arthritis. Symptoms such as swelling, pain, and stiffness, typically begin during middle age. Osteoarthritis develops slowly and the pain it causes worsens over time. Osteoarthritis, may be related to sports or work injuries or chronic wear and tear. Other types of arthritis can be related to rotator cuff tears, infection, or an inflammation of the joint lining. Often people will avoid shoulder movements in an attempt to lessen arthritis pain. This sometimes leads to a tightening or stiffening of the soft tissue parts of the joint, resulting in a painful restriction of motion. Fractures are broken bones. Shoulder fractures commonly involve the clavicle (collarbone), humerus (upper arm bone), and scapula (shoulder blade). Shoulder fractures in older patients are often the result of a fall from standing height. In younger patients, shoulder fractures are often caused by a high energy injury, such as a motor vehicle accident or contact sports injury. Fractures often cause severe pain, swelling, and bruising about the shoulder. Learn more: In the case of an acute injury causing intense pain, seek medical care as soon as possible. If the pain is less severe, it may be safe to rest a few days to see if time will resolve the problem. If symptoms persist, see a doctor. Your doctor will conduct a thorough evaluation in order to determine the cause of your shoulder pain and provide you with treatment options. The first step in the evaluation is a thorough medical history. Your doctor may ask how and when the pain started, whether it has occurred before and how it was treated, and other questions to help determine both your general health and the possible causes of your shoulder problem. Because most shoulder conditions are aggravated by specific activities, and relieved by specific activities, a medical history can be a valuable tool in finding the source of your pain. A comprehensive examination will be required to find the causes of your shoulder pain. Your doctor will look for physical abnormalities, swelling, deformity or muscle weakness, and check for tender areas. He or she will observe your shoulder range of motion and strength. Your doctor may order specific tests to help identify the cause of your pain and any other problems. These pictures will show any injuries to the bones that make up your shoulder joint. These imaging studies create better pictures of soft tissues. MRI may help your doctor identify injuries to the ligaments and tendons surrounding your shoulder joint. This tool combines x-rays with computer technology to produce a very detailed view of the bones in the shoulder area. Your doctor may order a test, such as an EMG (electromyogram), to evaluate nerve function. During this x-ray study, dye is injected into the shoulder to better show the joint and its surrounding muscles and tendons. It may be combined with an MRI. In this surgical procedure, your doctor looks inside the joint with a fiber-optic camera. Arthroscopy may show soft tissue injuries that are not apparent from the physical examination, x-rays, and other tests. In addition to helping find the cause of pain, arthroscopy may be used to correct the problem. Rotator Cuff and Shoulder Rehabilitation Exercises Treatment generally involves rest, altering your activities, and physical therapy to help you improve shoulder strength and flexibility. Common sense solutions such as avoiding overexertion or overdoing activities in which you normally do not participate can help to prevent shoulder pain. Your doctor may prescribe medication to reduce inflammation and pain. If medication is prescribed to relieve pain, it should be taken only as directed. Your doctor may also recommend injections of numbing medicines or steroids to relieve pain. Surgery may be required to resolve some shoulder problems. However, the large majority of patients with shoulder pain will respond to simple treatment methods such as altering activities, rest, exercise, and medication. Certain types of shoulder problems, such as recurring dislocations and some rotator cuff tears, may not benefit from exercise. In these cases, surgery may be recommended fairly early. Surgery can involve arthroscopy to remove scar tissue or repair torn tissues, or traditional open procedures for larger reconstructions or shoulder replacement.

This tool combines x-rays with computer technology to produce a very detailed view of the bones in the shoulder area. Your doctor may order a test, such as an EMG (electromyogram), to evaluate nerve function. During this x-ray study, dye is injected into the shoulder to better show the joint and its surrounding muscles and tendons. It may be combined with an MRI. In this surgical procedure, your doctor looks inside the joint with a fiber-optic camera. Arthroscopy may show soft tissue injuries that are not apparent from the physical examination, x-rays, and other tests. In addition to helping find the cause of pain, arthroscopy may be used to correct the problem. Rotator Cuff and Shoulder Rehabilitation Exercises Treatment generally involves rest, altering your activities, and physical therapy to help you improve shoulder strength and flexibility. Common sense solutions such as avoiding overexertion or overdoing activities in which you normally do not participate can help to prevent shoulder pain. Your doctor may prescribe medication to reduce inflammation and pain. If medication is prescribed to relieve pain, it should be taken only as directed. Your doctor may also recommend injections of numbing medicines or steroids to relieve pain. Surgery may be required to resolve some shoulder problems. However, the large majority of patients with shoulder pain will respond to simple treatment methods such as altering activities, rest, exercise, and medication. Certain types of shoulder problems, such as recurring dislocations and some rotator cuff tears, may not benefit from exercise. In these cases, surgery may be recommended fairly early. Surgery can involve arthroscopy to remove scar tissue or repair torn tissues, or traditional open procedures for larger reconstructions or shoulder replacement.

Reviewed By: Flip flops are a convenient way to keep your feet cool in the summertime. But not all flip flops are pain-free. When you choose a pair, see how they bend. If you can bend them in half, don’t buy them. They should only bend at the ball of the foot where your foot naturally bends. Also look for pairs with arch support, and be sure your toes don’t bend over them—that can lead to injuries. Whatever pair you choose, don’t walk in them for too long. Long walks in flip flops can cause plantar fasciitis, a tenderness and/or inflamed pain in your heel. Along with many conveniences, smartphones have brought with them a few health problems. Some people who use their smartphones heavily have found problems in their thumbs and necks. These conditions are called “text thumb” and “text neck.” Have you noticed your thumb popping and snapping when you bend it? Does it hurt? You may have text thumb. The kind of repetitive motions you use to click, drag, swipe, and drop can cause this painful condition. In serious cases the thumb may even get locked into a curling position. If your thumb has lost mobility from smartphone use, your doctor may recommend cortisone injections. When injected into a stiff area, cortisone reduces inflammation, which also reduces pain in most cases. When treated, text thumbs can be restored to full mobility about 80% of the time. As we get older it’s common to develop shoulder, neck, and lower back pain. But these symptoms are now being seen in younger people who spend too much time hunched over while absorbed in their smartphones. By dropping your head to look down at your phone, your head puts far more pressure on your neck—as much as 60 pounds of force. To relieve text neck, your best hope may be to focus on good posture. Do you stand and sit up straight? If not, focus on keeping your spine in line. Try holding your phone up to your face rather than bending your neck to see the screen. And if the problem keeps happening, shoulder extensions are a simple stretch that can ease your pain. For some, sitting on a fat wallet can aggravate hips and buttocks. The pain refers to piriformis syndrome, sometimes called “fat wallet syndrome” or “wallet butt.” About 1 in 5 people have a sciatic nerve—the largest in the body—that cuts through the small piriformis muscle that extends from the tailbone to the hip bone. They are more likely to develop this problem. This painful problem is treatable. About 80% of wallet pain-sufferers find relief from ice, rest, over-the-counter pain medicines like ibuprofen, and in some cases prescription muscle relaxers. Stretching and strengthening the muscles in that area can also be helpful, and these techniques can be learned through physical therapists or from your doctor. If those treatments fail, shots of botulism, steroids, or lidocaine hydrochloride can also be effective; consult your doctor before getting treatments. Your drive to work can be a pain in the neck. Over time, all those hours on the road add up. It can lead to necks overstretched in awkward positions and out-of-place neck joints. There are a few ways to deal with this painful problem. The first is to adjust the way you sit when driving. Pitch your seat forward so that your head actually rests in the headrest, and your neck is centered above your hips. Use both hands to steer, too, as using only one can twist your neck and shoulders. Stretching can help, too. You can even do some stretching in the car. Try pushing your head back into the car’s headrest and holding it there for 30 seconds at a time. Or try pulling your head forward as far as you can go while keeping your chin parallel with the ground for about five seconds at a time. Shrugging your shoulders toward your ears can work, too. A few of these stretches a day can help take some of the pain out of your commute. Are your video games hurting your health? When the Nintendo Wii was first introduced in 2006, patients started appearing in doctors’ offices with a variety of injuries to their necks, wrists, arms, and shoulders. Collectively, these cases came to be called “Wiiitis.” Other injuries have included bruises, black eyes, and cuts on the hand. Not long after this video game system was released, other manufacturers followed suit, leading to more injuries. Doctors are advised to ask their patients what games they are playing, and for how long. As it turns out, many of video game injuries run parallel to the sports they imitate. In the worst cases, these injuries can even be life-threatening. One woman who fell from her sofa playing Wii Tennis developed a serious accumulation in her lungs, for instance. A man fractured his spine while swinging the controller too intensely. On the whole these systems are considered relatively safe, but clearly it is important to follow the recommended safety procedures. Among them, make sure you have a clear area to play in, and warn those who aren’t playing not to walk into the playing area. There’s a headache-triggering chemical lurking in aged cheese. Your body breaks down the amino acid tyrosine into tyramine after you eat sharp cheddar or some well-aged parmesan. That seems to have a tendency to bring on migraines for those who suffer from them, though some studies dispute this. Cheeses thought to bring on headaches include: If you think this might be causing your headaches, consider keeping a migraine journal. Make a note when you eat a food that could be causing your migraines, including how much you ate, when you ate it, whether you experienced symptoms, and how bad they were. Over time you should be able to recognize a pattern. When you’re inactive for long stretches, the muscles that protect your spine can become weak. One study found that men who laid in bed all day for eight weeks had noticeable weakened spine muscles. The same thing happens if you park in front of your TV set for hours at a time. Back and neck pain are aggravating conditions for many people. While sometimes people have a sense of what’s causing this pain, often they are left baffled. Paying attention to the way you sit can help improve many of these cases. If you want to make improvements while you sit, remember these tips: Change position frequently. Muscles long at rest are more prone to stiffness, strain, and pain. Get up and stretch now and then. If it’s been more than an hour since you got up, get up! Moving around can keep muscle pain away. you are seated or reclining, avoid twisting at your spine. Consider investing in a lumbar pillow or other cushion. Redistributing your weight can help. Even your baby, despite his or her adorable ways, could be causing you pain. Some women develop a shooting pain in their wrists and thumbs known as DeQuervain’s tendonitis, also known as “baby wrist.” It’s a repetitive stress injury caused by lifting your baby with fatigued wrists drooped toward the ground, and some dads experience it, too. The problem is exacerbated in new mothers. Tendons tend to loosen and relax near the time of childbirth to give women greater flexibility. Plus the fluid they retain during pregnancy can make tendons chafe and swell. That plus picking up a baby over and over can lead to pain. Wrist braces and cortisone injections can help reduce the inflammation and swelling of baby wrist. Laptops make life a lot easier most of the time. But carrying them from place to place can make things more difficult for your back, shoulders, and elbows. Muscle pain caused by laptop cases slung over the shoulder or worn on the back are fairly common. One study of nearly 400 laptop-wielding students found that more than 75% complained of shoulder pain. More than 35% also complained of elbow pain Solving this problem may require a new case, but not necessarily. If you stuff unnecessary laptop accessories and other items into your case, just clearing out those things could solve your problem. As a rule of thumb, don’t carry more than 10% of your body weight. If that doesn’t do the trick, consider replacing the case. If your shoulders hurt, investing in a bag with a broad shoulder strap with padding could help. There are also rolling options available with wheels. Does your head ache after a day wearing a ponytail? There’s actually a medical term for this: “ponytail headache syndrome.” This disorder doesn’t affect everyone, but those who experience it know this can be a painfully frustrating type of discomfort. Ponytail headache syndrome seems to be a type of allodynia. Allodynia, which is associated with fibromyalgia, causes normal sensations to be perceived as painful. Some with allodynia might experience pain from even a light touch on the arm. There are a few ways to deal with ponytail headache syndrome. One is to make sure you get a good night’s sleep—lack of sleep can cause you to perceive pain more intensely. Another is to reduce stress for the same reason. You can also wear your hair more loosely of course. But if you are set on your tight hairstyle, consider taking ibuprofen when you style your hair. Also, at some point during the day, let your hair down. Even one minute of relief can make a difference at the end of the day. For migraine sufferers, many things can trigger intense pain. Certain smells can set them off, for example. This seems to be the case in 25% to 43% of all those who suffer from migraines. One study found that the odor most likely to trigger a headache was perfume, followed by paint, gasoline, and bleach. Other offenders include fried foods, cleaning products, exhaust, onions, and cigarette smoke. It only takes a few minutes for a given smell to send headache sufferers reeling. That’s why learning what smells trigger your headaches is important. Whether or not certain smells trigger them, people with chronic migraines are more likely than others to be offended by smell. Researchers tested 50 people who get migraines and 50 who don’t to determine how sensitive they were to a variety of smells. Out of migraine sufferers, 42 were bothered by odors, while only nine non-sufferers were bothered. Depending on how your spine is curved, you could be causing a lot of stiffness and pain in your back and neck while you sleep. Stomach-sleepers are the most likely to throw their spine out of alignment, but it can happen for back-sleepers and side-sleepers too. To relieve this type of pain, you need to pay close attention to your sleep position. If you sleep on your back, make sure the normal curve of your spine is maintained. If you sleep on your side, be sure the portion of your spine that crosses into your neck remains even with the portion that goes through your ribcage—a big, firm pillow helps. If you’re a stomach-sleeper, switch! Stomach sleeping is tied to the most cases of back and neck pain because sleeping on your stomach forces you to turn your head in an awkward way, which often causes pain. Does your head hurt after you drink? There are two times when alcohol can cause a headache. The first is right after you drink—about 30 minutes to 3 hours after, to be specific. The second is the morning after when the hangover starts. It doesn’t seem to matter what type of alcohol you drink. Red wine is frequently accused, but studies show the variety doesn’t much matter. How much you drink could make a difference, though. Instead of the type of alcohol, it seems to be the alcohol itself—ethanol—causing head-pounding pain. About a third of migraine-sufferers seem to be triggered by alcohol. But drinking can bring on tension and cluster headaches, too. Been awhile since you last ate? Feeling a little nauseas, with a thumping headache? That’s common. When you skip a meal, diet too rigorously, or fast, your body’s glucose level drops. Glucose is the sugar that keeps your body functioning, and when your blood-sugar level drops, you tend to feel fatigued, weak, shaky, and sometimes headachy. Compared to most headache triggers, the solution for hunger headaches is very simple—eat! Specifically, you should try to find a high-protein meal with complex carbohydrates to give your body the fuel it needs to function normally. Eventually nearly everyone experiences some amount of back pain. One of the common sources of this is lifting without proper technique. Most of this pain can be avoided, fortunately, once you know the movements and positions more likely to leave your back in agony. When you need to lift something, pay attention to your posture. Your posture should be as neutral as possible. Avoid: Always lift with your legs, and not your back. This is because the muscles in your legs are stronger and can manage a greater burden than your back muscles can. Keep your shoulders square. If an object is too heavy and you sense back pain on the horizon, get a friend, family member, or coworker to help divide the load. Do you feel stiffness and pain in your neck and back after work? Millions of people do. But you don’t have to agonize every day at the office. A big part of the solution is to say no to slouching. Sadly many people don’t know what it takes to maintain a good posture throughout the workday. To make sure your spine is properly aligned at work, pay attention to your posture. Keep your feet flat on the floor. Sit so that your weight is distributed across your buttocks, not your tailbone. Also, make sure you’re not straining to look up or down at your computer monitor-keep it at eye level. For more tips tailored to your work situation, get in touch with your human resources department. Find out if ergonomic tips have been designed for your work situation, and follow them. Is your eye in pain? Strangely enough this usually isn’t a problem with your eye. Most eye pain is actually caused by headaches. To make matters more complicated, one of the problem that starts with your eyes can cause headaches: eyestrain. If you have vision problems, you may find yourself straining to see clearly and with focus. Sometimes this is a matter of being nearsighted, farsighted, or suffering from astigmatism. Sometimes it means your eyes aren’t properly aligned. This kind of strain happens after long stretches spent staring at a single point, like you do when you stare at your phone or computer screen, or a book or magazine. If eye problems are causing your headaches, make sure your glasses are fitted with the proper prescription. If they are and the pain continues, talk to your eye doctor about further remedies. Have you ever heard someone complain that their joints hurt when the weather shifts? It’s not a myth—pain from weather changes really do happen. There are three weather changes that can make your joints ache: pressure changes, temperature drops, and humidity. When the barometric pressure changes, this can indicate a storm is about to move through. It can also mean your joints are in pain. It’s not so important where the pressure stands at a given moment—the changes in pressure are what seem to cause the pain. This may be because your tendons, bones, and muscles expand and contract as the pressure shifts. When the thermometer drops, joint pain tends to rise. It’s not well understood why this happens, but it could involve the thickness of your joint fluid. Joints have fluid that keep them lubricated, and cold weather makes this fluid thicker, which could lead to stiffness. This problem is worse when it’s wet outside, as cold weather and high humidity have been shown to cause more pain than either by itself. When you lift weights, soreness comes on the next day and can last for four or five days. Why is this? Lifting heavy weights actually damages your muscle fiber. That triggers an inflammatory response that makes your pain receptors more sensitive afterwards. This is known as delayed-onset muscle soreness, or DOMS. The pain is worse, though, when you start a particularly intense routine. Anyone who works out intensely enough will experience DOMS. The thing is, after you get used to a routine over time, the soreness decreases. Your pain receptors seem to be less sensitive after weight lifting as your body becomes more accustomed to a workout. But what if you never get used to a routine? If you work out infrequently, you are dooming yourself to the same soreness again and again. Those pain receptors never have time to grow accustomed to the inflammation that comes with weight training. So if you find yourself intensely sore after each workout, consider hitting the weights more often. It’s not often talked about, but many new mothers and fathers are in for a lot of physical pain in the first few years. That tiny bundle of joy you carry from place to place gets bigger and bigger. As your baby grows, so does the burden placed on your shoulders and neck. When you need to lift your child, lift with your legs, not your back. Don’t favor one arm over the other—this can put strain on your dominant shoulder. When you’re carrying your baby, keep your shoulders back and stand nice and tall. This helps distribute the extra weight around your body and can help prevent pain and even injury. Nursing mothers should be especially careful to avoid staring down at their infant while breast or bottle feeding. Of course you can look at your baby, but stretch out your shoulders as you do, and take breaks. This can help you avoid a common neck pain associated with new moms. Ever wake up with an ache in your jaw? A lot of people grind their teeth at night, and this can leave your jaw aching painfully the next day. If you are grinding your teeth while you sleep, you may have other symptoms, such as insomnia, headaches, ear aches, anxiety, and depression. If you have jaw pain, it may be caused by grinding teeth, or it may not. A doctor can assess you for other potential causes, including infections, ear problems, TMJ problems, and dental issues. If you are grinding your teeth, you will be encouraged to take daily steps to relieve the problem. These may include reducing stress, sleeping enough, drinking enough water, and avoiding gum and hard, chewy foods like nuts, steaks, and hard candies. Have you ever had a headache during sex? Sex headaches are real, and they come in two types. The first is a dull, gradual ache that worsens as you approach climax. The second is an intense, pounding headache that occurs at or near orgasm. These headaches are usually not a cause for concern, but they may indicate other health problems. Usually they come in clusters over the course of a few months and then go away for awhile. Some people actually find that sex relieves their headaches, but whether this is likely depends on the type of headache you tend to experience. About 60% of those who have experienced sexual activity during a migraine attack report relief from their headache. Some with cluster headaches also find that sex relieves their pain, though the percentage is smaller—a little over 35%. Everyone experiences stress sometimes. Stress is the feeling we get when the body goes into its “fight or flight” response. It may be triggered by an argument with a loved one, getting stuck in traffic, or anything else that your body perceives as a threat. When your body reacts to a threat, several changes take place. One is that your heart starts beating faster. Another is that your muscles get tense—ready to fight or run. That’s great if the threat is a physical one like a dangerous animal. But in modern life most of our stressors are not like this. In fact some of our stressors last months or even years, which can lead to chronic stress. If you’re chronically stressed out, those tense muscles can leave your body aching all over. If you recognize yourself in that scenario, you need to find a way to reduce your stress in order to feel good again. Different forms of relief work better for different people. Some find that intense exercise helps them relax. For others yoga or tai chi may work better. Meditation, deep breathing, massage, and other therapies work better for others. Finding the right way to destress can help ease the overall body pains you may be experiencing. Some forms of pain are more serious than others. You need to see a doctor emergently if you experience any of the following: Chronic pain can also be cause to see a doctor, particularly if it deprives you of your sleep, your work, or activities with family or friends. If your pain doesn’t fall into these categories, you may decide to treat it yourself. If that’s the case, consider your over-the-counter pain relieving options. Drugs like ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen are useful for various minor pains. Be careful – do not exceed the recommended doses as too much pain medicine can be toxic or even lethal.

That uncomfortable and tight feeling that makes movement almost impossible and causing you a lot of discomfort throughout the entire day. Stiff neck are frequently experienced by many and it will usually go away by itself after a few days. You may rest assure that stiff neck is not an indication of any . A stiff neck is typically characterized by difficulty moving the neck, especially when trying to turn the head to the side. It may also be accompanied by a headache, neck pain, or arm pain. In order to look sideways an individual may need to turn the entire body instead of the stiff neck. Most people are familiar with the pain of a stiff neck. In most cases, pain and stiffness go away naturally within a week. If a stiff neck has not improved after a week, it should be checked by a doctor. Also, regardless of how long it has lasted, a stiff neck accompanied by fever, headache, nausea or unexplained sleepiness should be treated by a medical professional immediately. Injuries are one of the most common reasons that one will experience stiff neck. A sudden jerking movement at the neck region can injure the muscles and ligaments, causing injury and subsequent pain and stiffness. Injuries can be caused by sports, accidental falls or even a car accident. Our body response to stress is the natural tensing of our muscles. If you did not suffer any injuries recently and is experiencing stiff neck, it could be an indication that you are under tremendous stress. It’s time to take things easy and relax. Muscle spasm are due to the signalling of certain messages from our nerves to the muscles which will result in them involuntary contracting, causing stiff neck. Improper sleeping posture is probably the most common reason for stiff neck. Our body is in a relaxed state when we are asleep and an improper sleeping posture can cause the pulling of the neck muscles without us being aware of it. Only when we finally wake up do we realise it and it is often too late. is an autoimmune disorder that targets the joints, especially those in the neck. It will result in neck pain and stiffness. Meningitis is a very serious inflection of the fluid that surrounds our brain and spinal cord and if you suffer from neck pain and stiffness and they are not caused by the factors listed above, you should consult a doctor immediately as a stiff neck is a common symptom of meningitis. Your doctor will take a medical history and do an exam. He or she will check for tenderness, numbness and muscle weakness, as well as see how far you can move your head forward, backward and side to side. Your doctor might order imaging tests to get a better picture of the cause of your stiff neck. Examples include: X-rays can reveal areas in your neck where your nerves or spinal cord might be pinched by bone spurs or other degenerative changes. CT scans combine X-ray images taken from many different directions to produce detailed cross-sectional views of the internal structures of your neck. MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create detailed images of bones and soft tissues, including the spinal cord and the nerves coming from the spinal cord. It’s possible to have X-ray or MRI evidence of structural problems in your neck without having symptoms. Imaging studies are best used as an adjunct to a careful history and physical exam to determine the cause of your pain. An individual can do several things to begin treating a stiff neck. Some common self-care strategies include:  Taking it easy for one or two days gives injured tissues a chance to begin to heal, which in turn will help relieve stiffness and possible muscle spasm. For example, someone who swims may want to avoid certain swim strokes that involve lots of head twisting for a few days. However, it is recommended to limit rest to one or two days, as too much inactivity can lead to a weakening of the muscles, and weak muscles have to struggle to adequately support the neck and head.  Cold therapy/ice packs help relieve most types of neck stiffness by reducing local inflammation. Applying ice during the first 24 to 48 hours of a painful flare-up usually has the most benefit in terms of reducing inflammation. Applying heat to the neck can spur blood flow, which fosters a better healing environment. Some patients prefer ice, whereas others prefer heat. Both may be used alternately.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which work by reducing inflammation, are typically a first line of treatment for neck stiffness and soreness. Even non prescription medications have risks, possible side effects, and drug interactions, so be sure to discuss any medications with a doctor.  Stretching, as soon as tolerated, helps ease the stiffness and restore the neck to a more natural range of motion. For many, it is a good idea to learn appropriate stretches with the help of a physical therapist.  Stretching or any form of low-impact aerobic exercise, such as walking, is often helpful in relieving any type of stiffness. Even if walking does not directly involve the neck, it helps circulate oxygen to the soft tissues throughout the spine, which in turn promotes healing.

This can be due to a major trauma or other events but usually results in shoulder pain and treatment being needed. They typically occur in less than 1% of the population but do still happen from time to time. The most common age group that suffers from shoulder blade fractures are young men between the ages of 25 and 45. This is basically because of the types of activities and events that age group participates in. A shoulder blade fracture can be caused by different traumatic events. An automobile accident is one such event that can cause your shoulder pain and to fracture the scapula. Another common cause of this injury is a fall that pertains to direct impact on the shoulder. This could be an example of falling off a ladder and onto your shoulder, or falling from a height that ends in landing on your shoulder itself. This could also result in direct injuries from a baseball bat or even an impact from a hammer. Symptoms of a scapula fracture can include one holding their arm close to the body to reduce the pain, swelling and inflammation, and the inability to use the arm. If moving the arm increases the pain, this may mean that you have a shoulder fracture. Most of the time shoulder blade fractures do not require surgery for treatment. In some severe cases, surgery will be required but this is not the norm. Typically ice and anti-inflammatory medications are used to help reduce swelling and the shoulder pain that is associated with this injury. Your shoulder may also be immobilized in a sling for up to four weeks or more depending on the severity of the injury. This keeps you from moving the shoulder and potentially reinjuring it before it is properly healed. Physical therapy may also be needed to help in rebuilding the mobility after the injury has taken place. While most times shoulder blade fractures are easily treated, they need to be seen by a medical doctor before letting them go. This is because most often a shoulder fracture has been caused by a very traumatic injury. This could also be a sign that other injuries have taken place in the body that you may not be aware of. Always have a medical examination after a fall or injury such as a car accident to rule out any life-threatening injury. Impingement of the shoulder is an extremely common problem associated with shoulder pain. It occurs due to the impingement of tendons in the shoulder. Repeated usage of the shoulder joint will increase the chances of one suffering from shoulder impingement. This is especially so for athletes involved in sports such as tennis, swimming and badminton. Unlike other injuries, pain is extremely persistent in shoulder impingement and will affect all of the daily activities. The structure giving our body its shape are the bones and surrounding it are the muscles. When an injury is suffered, blood will rush to the site in order to combat against infection. When this happens, the area will swell up and lead to a chain event. The swelling up of muscles will create tremendous pressure and impinge onto soft tissues such as the ligaments and tendons. The usual symptoms associated with shoulder impingement include tenderness and soreness. There will be persistent pain throughout that does not go away with treatments such as using hot pack or massages. Over time, the shoulder muscles will weaken and it is nearly impossible to place the arm over your head. Prolonged impingement will lead to the tearing of the shoulder muscles, leading to a rotator cuff injury. Symptoms of a shoulder impingement is classified into 3 different stages from 1 to 3. Stage 1 involves young patients who are below 25 years. In this stage, the only type of symptom observed is swelling and imflammation. This is due to the ability of the body to repair itself. In stage 2 which involves people from 25 years to 40 years, there will be a significant loss of ability to use the shoulder joint due to it weakening. In stage 3 which happens to people above 40 years old, the symptoms will be much more serious as it often involves the tendons, muscles and bones. The initial stages of treatment is non-surgical. Oral medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen will be prescribed in an attempt to reduce inflammation. Physical therapy will also be conducted to strengthen the shoulder muscles and improve the range of motion and rotation. If these do not seem to have an effect, a cortisone injection will be injected directly to combat infection. If no improvement is seen after 2 months, the patient will have to undergo a MRI scan and a surgery will need to be performed if it is diagnosed to be a rotator cuff tear. , , , Importance of Recovery Period In Your Exercise Regime Rest and recovery is probably the most important part of your exercise regime. Sufficient rest is required to maintain high level performance levels but many people still choose to over train and overuse their muscles. Too much rest will cause you to lose the intensity while too little will cause you to burn out fast. You need to strike a balance between rest and training. Repair and strengthening of the body doesn’t take place during the exercise itself. Instead, they happen when the body is at rest. Recovery starts the moment you stop exercising. The glycogen in your muscle will be replenished and your body will start to repair muscles that are damaged such as minor muscle tears. It is through this process that your muscles get stronger and firmer. Imagine yourself twisting a paper clip now. The more you twist it, the stronger and more difficult it becomes. Your muscles will be able to withstand stronger loads the next time. However, all these are only possible through rest and recovery. Sufficient recovery time also helps to burn more fats in your body. You can be doing a lot of cardiovascular training but without sufficient rest, you cannot burn off the fats effectively. Recovery allows the body to have time to fully stretch and contract the muscles and increase the heart rate. This increases metabolism and eat away excess fats. Many athletes suffer from injuries simply because they over train and overuse their muscles. Without sufficient recovery periods, the muscles are unable to cope with the intense activities going on and pre-existing injuries will be amplified. Insufficient rest will also cause you to lose focus on what you are doing at the moment and this can be very dangerous, especially if you are lifting heavy weights. Another extremely important reason why recovery is important is to allow sufficient rehydration of the entire body. Intensive training will use up all the fluids in the body and if they are not replenished, it can cause muscle cramps and even cause the body to break down. The muscles need to be constantly fed with electrolytes to keep them in optimum condition. Rest and recovery are the most important part of a training regime. Although you may be tempted to not rest during exercises hoping to gain more muscles, it can lead to injuries and cause a negative effect for the body. Recovery also helps to repair the body and prevent injuries such as or especially if you are playing sports such as tennis. The function of the shoulder joint is to provide mobility to the shoulder and it is one of the parts of the body which is heavily used every single day. Many people suffer from . Many different reasons can result in shoulder pain and it is important to know the exact orthopaedic reason and only then can the correct diagnosis and treatment be made. Shoulder pain can suddenly happen and many people are unsure of it. Let’s try to unravel the mystery of shoulder pain today. Since the shoulder joint is heavily used, there are a lot of rubbing actions throughout the day. There are small fluid filled sacs called bursae to cushion the bones and the soft tissues. These will help to reduce friction and increase gliding motions. However, due to excessive repetitive usage of the shoulder joints, inflammation can happen on the bursae, leading to pain and swelling known as . This can cause difficulty in performing simple actions such as lifting of the hand or wearing of clothes. Impingement of the shoulder happens when the shoulder blade exerts too much pressure onto the surrounding soft tissues such as the bursa or the tendons, causing bursitis. Over a period of time, shoulder can possible result in a rotator cuff tear. Shoulder instability can be due to overuse of the shoulder joint or due to an injury which causes the arm bone to be loose and slip out of the socket joint. The shoulder joint acts as a ball and socket model where mobility can be easily obtained without much limitation. However when the ball and socket is loose, it can cause subluxation. The surrounding ligaments and tendons are weakened and they are unable to fully support the motions, causing pain and . Tearing of the tendons could possibly occur due to ageing or injuries, overuse or wear and tear. Depending on the severity of the tear, it can be a partial one or a complete one. A complete will result in tremendous pain and loss of stability. Arthritis is a common cause of shoulder pain and the most common form is osteoarthritis or wear and tear. Arthritis usually occurs during mid-age around 30 years old and over time, it will become worse. Osteoarthritis can also happen at a young age due to injuries or overuse and it will result in rotator cuff tendon tears or inflammation. will cause simple daily motions to be almost impossible and you will often experience stiffness of the joints. There are many reasons that can cause shoulder pain. I hope that the above article had help to unravel some of the mysteries and after you know the exact reason, you will be able to use the correct treatment method. , , , , , , , , Our shoulder is a very delicate and complex component of our body that is kept together by bones, tendons and muscles. A shoulder injury is very painful and can cause a lot of discomfort and inconvenience to us. There are many different kinds of and they are caused by different reasons such as strain, cyclic motion and injuries. is a common injury which is due to an inflammation of a tendon located in the shoulder. 4 muscles make up the rotator cuff namely the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis. The most common reason for a rotator cuff strain is because of insufficient warm up prior to the start of an activity or overload of the muscles. Poor posture and accidentally falls causing you to land on your shoulders can also cause rotator cuff strain. A strain can slowly evolve into a tear if it is left untreated. For immediate treatment, RICE is sufficient. If symptoms get worse, Our shoulder joint is an unstable joint due to the functions of it. The shoulder joint can be described as a ball and socket joint and the ball is the arm bone and the socket is the shoulder blade. It is the part of our body which has the most motion compared to all other joints. It is because of this fact that causes instability to the area. Instability can get worse when the ligaments are overstretched and are unable to hold the ball and socket firmly in place. Dislocation of the shoulder joint can occur due to injuries or trauma, causing the ball to go out of the socket. of the shoulder joint occurs when the supraspinatus, bicep tendons, bursa and subacromial are compressed over time, causing inflammation. It is due to repeated overhead usage of the shoulder joints. Activities which causes these include swimming and overhead press. To prevent impingement, you should allow adequate rest period between activities and strengthening of the rotator cuff muscles to allow it to take more load. Our muscles are connected to the bones through connective tissues called tendons and tendonitis is an inflammation of these tendons. The tendons that are most susceptible are the biceps tendons as well as the rotator cuff muscles. are usually caused by overuse, pulling or over-compression of the tendons, causing pain, tenderness and discomfort. To prevent tendonitis, ensure that proper warm up of the whole body is done and add on weights gradually to allow the body to adapt to it. Above are 4 shoulder injuries that are frequently experienced by people. Our shoulder is an integral part of our daily life and any injuries to it will cause great discomfort and inconvenience our lives. They can be easily reduced by doing proper stretching, gradually load up and sufficient rest periods between activities. A is a common injury suffered by many and it causes pain and disability among adults. It will not only weaken your shoulder but will also hinder your day to day activities, such as wearing your clothes, brushing your teeth and combing your hair. The rotator cuff is a group of tendons that are joined together, surrounding the front, back and top of your shoulder joint connected to each other. When one or more muscles are torn, the tendons are detached from the humerus and they start to fray. As time passes, the tendon can entirely tear either on its own or during activities that exert huge load on the shoulders. The most common symptom experienced by many is aching at the top and front of the shoulder. The pain is significantly higher when the arm is lifted overhead. Often, the patient is unable to have a good rest at night as the pain gets worse at night. Some patients may experience weakness in the injured arm and in a worst case scenario; the entire arm cannot be lifted at all. When patients experience inability to lift their arm above their shoulder, it is normally due to their supraspinatus tendon rubbing against the under portion of their shoulder blade known as the Acromium. It can be acute and it can also be a gradual pain depending on the initial injury. Swelling and inflammation will be observed and the muscles in the rotator cuff will be weakened as a result. Overuse of the shoulder causes bursitis or tendonitis which is also known as impingement. Impingement will cause the tissues below the acromioclavicular joint to be rubbing against the bone, causing irritation and pain. Normally the doctor will prescribe pain killers or cortisone injections. However if all fails, an arthroscopic acromioplasty or shoulder acromioplasty will be carried out. As the surface of our acromion can be mis-shaped, bone spurs might develop. By jutting further down when the tendons are, it will cause much pain too the patient in the injured shoulder. The surgeon can reshape the acromion through arthroscopy, a minimal invasive surgery method or through open shoulder surgery. Gentle exercises to obtain back full range of motion will start the day after the surgery and patients are advised to stop using the arm sling in the shortest possible time. The sutures will be removed a week after surgery and strengthening exercise will be taught to them. It will take approximately 3 months for the shoulder to recover fully.

That uncomfortable and tight feeling that makes movement almost impossible and causing you a lot of discomfort throughout the entire day. Stiff neck are frequently experienced by many and it will usually go away by itself after a few days. You may rest assure that stiff neck is not an indication of any . A stiff neck is typically characterized by difficulty moving the neck, especially when trying to turn the head to the side. It may also be accompanied by a headache, neck pain, or arm pain. In order to look sideways an individual may need to turn the entire body instead of the stiff neck. Most people are familiar with the pain of a stiff neck. In most cases, pain and stiffness go away naturally within a week. If a stiff neck has not improved after a week, it should be checked by a doctor. Also, regardless of how long it has lasted, a stiff neck accompanied by fever, headache, nausea or unexplained sleepiness should be treated by a medical professional immediately. Injuries are one of the most common reasons that one will experience stiff neck. A sudden jerking movement at the neck region can injure the muscles and ligaments, causing injury and subsequent pain and stiffness. Injuries can be caused by sports, accidental falls or even a car accident. Our body response to stress is the natural tensing of our muscles. If you did not suffer any injuries recently and is experiencing stiff neck, it could be an indication that you are under tremendous stress. It’s time to take things easy and relax. Muscle spasm are due to the signalling of certain messages from our nerves to the muscles which will result in them involuntary contracting, causing stiff neck. Improper sleeping posture is probably the most common reason for stiff neck. Our body is in a relaxed state when we are asleep and an improper sleeping posture can cause the pulling of the neck muscles without us being aware of it. Only when we finally wake up do we realise it and it is often too late. is an autoimmune disorder that targets the joints, especially those in the neck. It will result in neck pain and stiffness. Meningitis is a very serious inflection of the fluid that surrounds our brain and spinal cord and if you suffer from neck pain and stiffness and they are not caused by the factors listed above, you should consult a doctor immediately as a stiff neck is a common symptom of meningitis. Your doctor will take a medical history and do an exam. He or she will check for tenderness, numbness and muscle weakness, as well as see how far you can move your head forward, backward and side to side. Your doctor might order imaging tests to get a better picture of the cause of your stiff neck. Examples include: X-rays can reveal areas in your neck where your nerves or spinal cord might be pinched by bone spurs or other degenerative changes. CT scans combine X-ray images taken from many different directions to produce detailed cross-sectional views of the internal structures of your neck. MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create detailed images of bones and soft tissues, including the spinal cord and the nerves coming from the spinal cord. It’s possible to have X-ray or MRI evidence of structural problems in your neck without having symptoms. Imaging studies are best used as an adjunct to a careful history and physical exam to determine the cause of your pain. An individual can do several things to begin treating a stiff neck. Some common self-care strategies include:  Taking it easy for one or two days gives injured tissues a chance to begin to heal, which in turn will help relieve stiffness and possible muscle spasm. For example, someone who swims may want to avoid certain swim strokes that involve lots of head twisting for a few days. However, it is recommended to limit rest to one or two days, as too much inactivity can lead to a weakening of the muscles, and weak muscles have to struggle to adequately support the neck and head.  Cold therapy/ice packs help relieve most types of neck stiffness by reducing local inflammation. Applying ice during the first 24 to 48 hours of a painful flare-up usually has the most benefit in terms of reducing inflammation. Applying heat to the neck can spur blood flow, which fosters a better healing environment. Some patients prefer ice, whereas others prefer heat. Both may be used alternately.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which work by reducing inflammation, are typically a first line of treatment for neck stiffness and soreness. Even non prescription medications have risks, possible side effects, and drug interactions, so be sure to discuss any medications with a doctor.  Stretching, as soon as tolerated, helps ease the stiffness and restore the neck to a more natural range of motion. For many, it is a good idea to learn appropriate stretches with the help of a physical therapist.  Stretching or any form of low-impact aerobic exercise, such as walking, is often helpful in relieving any type of stiffness. Even if walking does not directly involve the neck, it helps circulate oxygen to the soft tissues throughout the spine, which in turn promotes healing.

This can be due to a major trauma or other events but usually results in shoulder pain and treatment being needed. They typically occur in less than 1% of the population but do still happen from time to time. The most common age group that suffers from shoulder blade fractures are young men between the ages of 25 and 45. This is basically because of the types of activities and events that age group participates in. A shoulder blade fracture can be caused by different traumatic events. An automobile accident is one such event that can cause your shoulder pain and to fracture the scapula. Another common cause of this injury is a fall that pertains to direct impact on the shoulder. This could be an example of falling off a ladder and onto your shoulder, or falling from a height that ends in landing on your shoulder itself. This could also result in direct injuries from a baseball bat or even an impact from a hammer. Symptoms of a scapula fracture can include one holding their arm close to the body to reduce the pain, swelling and inflammation, and the inability to use the arm. If moving the arm increases the pain, this may mean that you have a shoulder fracture. Most of the time shoulder blade fractures do not require surgery for treatment. In some severe cases, surgery will be required but this is not the norm. Typically ice and anti-inflammatory medications are used to help reduce swelling and the shoulder pain that is associated with this injury. Your shoulder may also be immobilized in a sling for up to four weeks or more depending on the severity of the injury. This keeps you from moving the shoulder and potentially reinjuring it before it is properly healed. Physical therapy may also be needed to help in rebuilding the mobility after the injury has taken place. While most times shoulder blade fractures are easily treated, they need to be seen by a medical doctor before letting them go. This is because most often a shoulder fracture has been caused by a very traumatic injury. This could also be a sign that other injuries have taken place in the body that you may not be aware of. Always have a medical examination after a fall or injury such as a car accident to rule out any life-threatening injury. When it comes to lifting, moving, writing, and doing everyday chores, your biceps go through a lot of movement. If you’re doing too much you can begin to notice biceps pain start to creep in and you may think it’s just overuse of your muscles. However, it is important to know that your biceps can be injured through lifting heavier than normal objects, overusing the muscle or other ways. One of the injuries you can develop is called biceps tendinitis. Discover below what biceps tendinitis treatment is available and how you can tell if that is what you have going on. The main cause of tendinitis is due to overuse of the bicep muscle. This could be because you’re a baseball player, you lift heavy objects on a daily basis or you love to swim. You can have this show up in your bicep, elbow or shoulder. It is generally caused by the repetitive motions being done over and over by your arm. So if you have a job that is a repetitive movement, or if your favorite sport does the same, you can have a cause of tendonitis start to show up. You may have biceps pain start in one or both of your arms depending on which arm is affected. Pain is generally located in the shoulder or elbow and not in both places at the same time. You may notice a sharp pain if you have a tear in the tendon or even bruising and swelling. You may also notice pain during movement that has caused the problem in the first place. If you have torn the tendon, then you may require surgery to fix the problem. There are a few different options for biceps tendinitis treatment. You can start with ice packs on the affected area. This can help to reduce any inflammation in the joint or bicep area that is causing the pain. You can also take an over the counter anti-inflammatory to help make sure it reduces inflammation and the pain. Resting the arm that is hurting is also highly advised. Try to take some time off of the activity that caused the pain so that your arm can rest and heal. Biceps pain can be quite difficult to deal with, especially when it starts to affect your daily life. Be sure to take preventative measures if you have a repetitive job or task done each day. Change up your routine and get plenty of rest to make sure you don’t injure your arm further. , , , , , Everyone wants to be healthier and stronger. One way to do that is with a healthy diet plan and exercise, combining both cardio and strength training. While strength training is a great method of toning and getting stronger, there are some very common weight lifting injuries that you should be aware of before getting started. They range from shoulder injuries to knee and back injuries. Learning what they are and how to avoid them to be safe when lifting is key in making the type of progress you wish to make. When you are performing such tasks as overhead lifting like bench presses or shoulder press, you can run into an injury called shoulder impingement. This injury is when you have inflammation and swelling in the rotator cuff area. At first you may only notice pain in the shoulder when you’re lifting your arms, but eventually the pain can be felt no matter what you’re doing as it progresses. If you’re not cautious, then this shoulder impingement injury can also lead to a tear in the rotator cuff itself. Lifting heavy weights with your back instead of your legs can result in serious back strains or sprains. If you’re lifting with your back, you may also experience a herniated disc which is quite painful. Sprains are typically caused by acute injuries or trauma to the back making the ligaments stretch to far or even tear. Strains typically affect the muscles instead of the ligaments in the back. Most of these weight lifting injuries can be treated with medication and relaxation. The herniated disc however may require physical therapy or even surgery to correct the problem. Remember to also protect your knees as you’re lifting weights. The knee joint or patellar tendon can be injured by repetitive squatting motions, deep knee bends, and extension of the knee.  As you are bending and squatting during your weight lifting, the tendon can start to get tiny tears in it. Then you may start to feel pain below the kneecap. It is important that you keep an eye on this and get treatment as soon as you can. Some cases are helped with patellar tendon strap or physical therapy. In extreme cases, surgery may be needed to repair the knee. Lifting weights is a great way to get your body into shape and to help you feel and be stronger. While you’re lifting, it’s very important that you take the necessary safety steps and precautions to prevent yourself from having any weight lifting injuries. Baseball is an all-time favorite pastime not only in America, but around the world. From the backyard family games to the pitcher’s mound in the big stadiums, baseball is a game everyone can enjoy watching or playing. While this game is fun and exciting, it can also be dangerous to the players if the proper caution and preventative measures are not taken. From elbow injuries to hurting the pitcher’s shoulder, there are several different injuries that can occur when one plays on a regular basis. Here are the top four common baseball injuries and what you can do to prevent them from happening to you or your children. When it comes to the sport, there are several injuries that are commonly seen. One of the most common is muscle strains or soft tissue type injuries. This can occur when you pull a muscle during pitching, catching, or running bases. Two more types of injuries that are commonly seen include cuts and bruises. This happens due to running into another player, sliding into the bases, or even getting hit with the ball during a play. One other type of typical baseball injury is a ligament injury. This includes spraining the ligament which happens a lot when pitching, catching or running the bases. All of these can be minor injuries but others can be quite detrimental to the player. It can cause you to miss a full season if the injury is severe enough. How do you stop these injuries from happening? What can you do to avoid elbow injuries such as overuse or avoid injuring your pitcher’s shoulder? Here are a few tips to help you prevent these most common injuries from happening. Always make sure to warm up gradually and properly each time you go to play. Do not skip the warm up as this can help you get your muscles and body prepared for what you are about to do.  Start with easy slow pitches, running at a slow pace around the bases, and getting your body prepared for the game. Rotate the pitchers to other positions. Make sure that you do not overuse your pitcher or overuse your arm as the pitcher. Also as the coach of a baseball team, follow the guidelines on age appropriate pitching. For example, teens and adults can typically pitch two games a week while the younger crowd should max out around 75-100 pitches a week. This will help to prevent them from injuring their shoulder. Always wear your protective equipment such as helmets, shin guards and catcher’s mitt if you’re playing baseball. This can help you to prevent any major injuries and keep you playing your favorite sport. What Is Swimmer’s Shoulder? Prevention & Treatment Swimmer’s shoulder is an inflammatory condition that got its name from the common occurrence of shoulder pain that swimmers get from overuse during training. Patients experience a musculoskeletal pain that can extend from the shoulder joint to the neck and arms. Patients get swimmer’s shoulder from recurring traumatic impact on the shoulder over a period of time of overtraining or impaired posture from poor swimming/paddling techniques. The muscles and ligaments in the shoulder are overworked and if the condition is ignored and untreated, it may lead to more serious injuries like rotator cuff tears or cartilage damage. The rotator cuff is the main group of muscles that controls the shoulder movements and keeps the shoulder centred on the joint. If the shoulder ball goes out of place, the shoulder would be dislocated. Since swimmer’s shoulder occurs gradually with repetitive movements, it is more effective to prevent the injury by correcting the stroke techniques than treating it when after it occurs. To prevent the injury, swimmers have to use proper strokes with the hand facing flat and fingertips first entering the water. The shoulders are pulled back and chest thrust forward. However, take note that the body is still relaxed and not tensed up. Make sure that the arms are not fully straightened or dropped. This wrong method produces a push down force and puts stress on the shoulder muscles. Raise the elbows a little and keep it slightly bent to effectively press back against the water. The proper technique should utilise the chest muscles and not just the shoulders. You would also find yourself swimming more efficiently with the generated force fully pushed backwards, propelling you forward faster. Be careful of wearing out the shoulder muscles when there are changes in training techniques or an increase in training frequency. Ease in the changes gradually to let your muscles strengthen up and get used to the training. You can also prevent it by stretching your shoulder, chest and neck muscles regularly. It helps to warm up the muscles and keep them flexible. You can apply the basic treatment method of RICE – Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation – if the condition is recognised early on. Just icing can also help reduce the pain and swelling. If your condition does not improve with the basic methods of treatment or the pain keeps recurring, you may have to see a physiotherapist to manage the injury. Regular physiotherapy sessions would help strengthen the muscles and correct your posture. Your physiotherapist would advise you to rest your arm as much as possible and even wear a sling to keep the weight off your shoulders. You may have to sleep upright or with a pillow support. A doctor may prescribe you anti-inflammatory and pain medicine to reduce the pain and swelling faster. But just the medicine will not treat the root of the problem. The healing process only begins with proper exercises done in physiotherapy and utilizing preventive methods to avoid further aggravating the injury. , , , , Shoulder Joint Tear (Glenoid Labrum Tear): Symptoms & Prevention The shoulder joint is composed of three different types of bones: the shoulder blade, upper arm bone and collarbone. This type of joint is a ball and socket joint, allowing for extreme flexibility and wide range of motion. The upper arm bone acts like a ball and is securely inside the shoulder blade socket. For stabilization purposes, the upper arm bone is slightly larger than the socket, ensuring that the fit is tight. To further enhance the stability, there is a layer of soft tissue called the labrum. Injuries to the labrum is the cause of a shoulder joint tear. In this article, we will look at some of the symptoms and preventive measures. Symptoms of Glenoid Labrum tears are difficult to be diagnosed. The pain is unable to be localized to the exact location and pain is severely increased when actions involving the injured shoulder is attempted. Such actions can include stretching the arm or raising a hand. As time passes, the shoulder will be weaker and instability will start to set in. Shoulder joint tears are often caused by a sudden trauma to the shoulder blade. These can include falling on an outstretched arm or a direct blow to the shoulder. In order to prevent this, protective measures should be taken: Have you ever taken a rubber band and pulled it suddenly? The rubber band will end up breaking immediately. This is the same for our muscles and it is the reason why warm ups and stretching are extremely important. Warming up will loosen the muscles and enable the tendons and to stretch. This will allow them to function properly and hold the shoulder joint together. Shoulder joint tears are also much more common in players engaging in high impact sports such as rugby and baseball. Players often wear protective paddings designed for the shoulder. These cushioning pads are able to cushion and absorb shocks to a certain extent. Some are even able to prevent fractures and dislocations. Building up strength in the shoulders will increase the ability of tendons, ligaments and muscles to withstand the impact experienced by the shoulder. Strong muscles will hold the shoulder together and prevent any muscular tears during an impact. Shoulder joint tears are extremely painful and affects our daily lifestyle. Players who participate in high impact or repetitive sports shoulder consider investing in good protective gears and ensure that proper warm ups are performed prior to the start of their activity. Impingement of the shoulder is an extremely common problem associated with shoulder pain. It occurs due to the impingement of tendons in the shoulder. Repeated usage of the shoulder joint will increase the chances of one suffering from shoulder impingement. This is especially so for athletes involved in sports such as tennis, swimming and badminton. Unlike other injuries, pain is extremely persistent in shoulder impingement and will affect all of the daily activities. The structure giving our body its shape are the bones and surrounding it are the muscles. When an injury is suffered, blood will rush to the site in order to combat against infection. When this happens, the area will swell up and lead to a chain event. The swelling up of muscles will create tremendous pressure and impinge onto soft tissues such as the ligaments and tendons. The usual symptoms associated with shoulder impingement include tenderness and soreness. There will be persistent pain throughout that does not go away with treatments such as using hot pack or massages. Over time, the shoulder muscles will weaken and it is nearly impossible to place the arm over your head. Prolonged impingement will lead to the tearing of the shoulder muscles, leading to a rotator cuff injury. Symptoms of a shoulder impingement is classified into 3 different stages from 1 to 3. Stage 1 involves young patients who are below 25 years. In this stage, the only type of symptom observed is swelling and imflammation. This is due to the ability of the body to repair itself. In stage 2 which involves people from 25 years to 40 years, there will be a significant loss of ability to use the shoulder joint due to it weakening. In stage 3 which happens to people above 40 years old, the symptoms will be much more serious as it often involves the tendons, muscles and bones. The initial stages of treatment is non-surgical. Oral medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen will be prescribed in an attempt to reduce inflammation. Physical therapy will also be conducted to strengthen the shoulder muscles and improve the range of motion and rotation. If these do not seem to have an effect, a cortisone injection will be injected directly to combat infection. If no improvement is seen after 2 months, the patient will have to undergo a MRI scan and a surgery will need to be performed if it is diagnosed to be a rotator cuff tear. A slap tear is an injury to the shoulder. SLAP stands for “superior labrum, anterior to posterior”.  This means that the top portion of the labrum is injured from the front to the back. The labrum is a ring of tissue located around the shoulder socket and it is there to stabilize the shoulder due to the extensive amount of movement associated with it. So what exactly causes a SLAP tear and what are the symptoms? This article will help to answer some of these questions. Our shoulder is made of a ball and socket joint consisting of three different bones. The bones are the upper arm bone, the shoulder blade and the collarbone. The head of the upper arm bone is designed to fit nicely into the socket in the shoulder blade. Each person’s ball and socket joint is unique to him only. The labrum is a thick and strong fibrous tissue that helps to deepen the socket and promote stability to the shoulder joint. It also helps to attach the and tendons in the area. A SLAP tear will occur from the area just in front or behind the biceps tendon. SLAP injuries were first observed in baseball players due to the nature of the game. SLAP tears are often due to repeated usage of the shoulder joint. It can also be due to sudden trauma to the shoulder such as a traction force or a pull on the arm. An attempt to break a fall using the shoulder can also be responsible. The most accurate symptom of a SLAP tear is pain. However, almost everything can cause pain! Almost every movement associated with the shoulder joint will result in pain for the patient. There will also be a decrease in shoulder strength and a feeling of instability. The range of motion will also be significantly decreased. Baseball players may also observe a decrease in the velocity of their throw after pitching. A trained medical specialist should only diagnose SLAP tears. There are several tests such as the O’Brien’s test, Apprehension Sign and Jobe Relocation Test that are highly reliable when used together as a whole package. This can be aided by a MRI scan which will help to identify the presence of a SLAP tear and the exact location. A SLAP tear is a challenging medical injury and the treatment must be done in a timely manner due to the many ptifalls in the diagnosis and management of such injury.

Neck pain is also called cervicalgia. The condition is common and usually isn’t a reason to worry. Neck pain can happen for many reasons and can usually be remedied through simple lifestyle changes. For example, your muscles may be tense from sitting for hours at work with poor posture. Neck pain may also be a result of injury from a car crash or even muscle strain from overextending yourself during exercise. neck pain that gets worse if you hold your head in one place Although this condition can quite literally be a pain in the neck, you can do many things to treat it at home. In fact, a good number of people who have neck pain can see big improvements in just of at-home care. Did you know that your head weighs around a whopping ? That’s a lot for your muscles and ligaments to support all day long throughout your many activities. Your neck pain may be the result of doing too much. One way to help with this pain is to relax. Take days off from doing anything strenuous. Activities to avoid include weight-bearing exercise, like running, hiking, or playing tennis, and heavy lifting. Try to lessen both pain and inflammation by or ice wrapped in a towel to your neck. You can apply this cold therapy to the area for up to a few times a day. If you have or circulatory issues, you should limit using ice to just at a time. You can also cold therapy with heat. With heat, you’re working to ease muscle tension and pain. You may want to take a warm shower or hold a heating pad on your neck. Again, apply this therapy for up to , but only 10 if you have circulatory problems. You can find a variety of different over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers at your corner drug store. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a popular option. There’s also ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), which combines pain relief with anti-inflammatory power. (Aleve) is another option. No matter , your neck pain may last for some time. Taking time to stretch your neck each day may also help. You might want to wait to do any exercises until the worst of your pain has gone away. Before you try any of these moves, consider warming up the area with a heating pad or performing them after taking a warm shower or bath. Look forward. Simply bring your chin slowly down to your chest. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds. Return back to your starting position. Tilt your head back and look up toward the ceiling. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds. Return to your starting position. Gently bring left your ear toward your left shoulder without actually making contact. Only tilt your head until you get a little stretch in your neck. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds. Return to your starting position. Repeat the entire sequence three to five more times. Once you stretch out your neck to your basic range of motion, you can also work on rotating your neck a bit. Turn your head to one side, like you’re looking over your shoulder. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds. Slowly turn 180 degrees the other way. Hold again for 5 to 10 seconds. Now that you’ve warmed up, you can apply what’s called overpressure to extend the stretches you just tried. Sitting down, put your right hand under your right leg. This will keep your . Position your left arm over your head so that you can cover your right ear with your left hand. Moving your left ear toward (but not actually touching) your left shoulder like you did with the rotations, gently pull with your left hand to add extra stretch. Work up to doing this stretch three times on each side. Check out: 5 essential oils for headaches and migraines » Staying in one position for too long may cause neck pain. In fact, you should aim to get up or move every from sitting or standing positions. While you may want to rest the first few days after hurting your neck, getting into a regular exercise routine may help in the long run. Try doing aerobic exercises, like walking or using a stationary bike. Slumping over all day can create a lot of aches and pains. Take a look at yourself in the mirror to see if you’re standing or sitting up straight. If not, you may be straining the muscles and ligaments that support different parts of your body, like your head, creating neck pain. What is exactly? The answer depends on whether you’re sitting, standing, or lying down. You should avoid crossing your legs. Instead, try putting your feet on the floor or even a footrest. You’ll want to keep a little space between the back of your knees and the front of your seat. Try keeping your knees at or below your hips. If your chair has an adjustable backrest, make sure it’s supporting the lower and middle parts of your back. Then relax your shoulders and get up from time to time to stretch. You’ll want to focus your weight on the balls of your feet and keep your knees slightly bent. Your feet should be shoulder distance apart. Let your arms fall to the sides of your body naturally. Tuck your core in and stand up straight with your shoulders slightly pulled backward. Resist the urge to hold your head forward, backward, or even to the side — neutral is best. If you’re standing for a long period of time, shift your weight from your toes to your heels or from one foot to another. It’s important to make sure you’re using a mattress that works best for you. Firm may be best for back and neck pain. Sleeping with a pillow can also help. If you’re a stomach sleeper, you may want to try and change your position. That’s right, even a tweak like sleeping on your side or back can help. Try putting a pillow between your knees if you sleep on your side, as it can help keep your body in better alignment. You may have heard that going to the can help with all sorts of aches and pains. It’s true. Chiropractic adjustments . The neck is also called the cervical spine, so chiropractors work this area of the body as well. All that you’ll hear is actually from very controlled forces applied to your joints. Call ahead to ask about cost. Not all insurance carriers cover chiropractic work. Some offices offer what is called sliding scale pricing according to your ability to pay. It’s important to note that adjustments usually only provide short-term relief, so you may need to keep going many times to stay pain-free.

During a massage session, the muscles and other tissues in your neck are manipulated. This helps blood and other fluids flow freely. There scientific evidence that massage helps significantly with neck pain. That said, it may be a good complementary therapy to combine with other treatments that your doctor recommends. A neck pillow may make or break your night of sleep. The effects can even last into the next day. Many different pillows on the market are supposed to help with neck pain. Evidence for which ones work is anecdotal, rather than research-based. Alison Freer at recently shared that a certain brand “stopped [her] neck and shoulder pain cold.” What worked for her? The . This pillow has a triangular divot in the center that helps to cradle your head during sleep. In other words, it helps to support your cervical curve. It comes in seven different sizes to suit different body sizes and shapes. Freer shares she purchased the petite version and that the regular or larger versions may actually be too big for some people. Another brand you might try is . The size of the pillow you choose is based on your height, body type, and sleep position. It has a special contoured design that helps to ergonomically cradle your head and neck as you sleep. Acupuncture is an often used for pain relief. It’s performed by inserting tiny needles into different points of your body. While studies on acupuncture for neck pain have had , it may be worth trying a few times. In fact, people often see the best results after several acupuncture sessions versus just trying it once or twice. Before you head to your appointment, make sure your acupuncturist is certified and using sterile needles. You may also want to call your insurance company to ask about coverage. Some insurance plans won’t cover acupuncture, while others will cover some or all of the appointment cost.

Remember: Most people see improvement with their neck pain after of at-home treatment. Although most causes of cervicalgia aren’t a reason for concern, there are certain serious conditions, like , that may be causing your discomfort. You should also let your doctor know if you experience numbness, lose strength in your hands or arms, or feel a shooting pain going down your arm from your shoulder.

BEST, M.D., PH.D., University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, Wisconsin   This is Part I of a two-part article on clinical evaluation of the painful shoulder. will appear in the next issue of AFP. Family physicians need to understand diagnostic and treatment strategies for common causes of shoulder pain. We review key elements of the history and physical examination and describe maneuvers that can be used to reach an appropriate diagnosis. Examination of the shoulder should include inspection, palpation, evaluation of range of motion and provocative testing. In addition, a thorough sensorimotor examination of the upper extremity should be performed, and the neck and elbow should be evaluated. Shoulder pain is a common complaint in family practice patients. The unique anatomy and range of motion of the glenohumeral joint can present a diagnostic challenge, but a proper clinical evaluation usually discloses the cause of the pain. The shoulder is composed of the humerus, glenoid, scapula, acromion, clavicle and surrounding soft tissue structures. The shoulder region includes the glenohumeral joint, the acromioclavicular joint, the sternoclavicular joint and the scapulothoracic articulation . The glenohumeral joint capsule consists of a fibrous capsule, ligaments and the glenoid labrum. Because of its lack of bony stability, the glenohumeral joint is the most commonly dislocated major joint in the body. Glenohumeral stability is due to a combination of ligamentous and capsular constraints, surrounding musculature and the glenoid labrum. Static joint stability is provided by the joint surfaces and the capsulolabral complex, and dynamic stability by the rotator cuff muscles and the scapular rotators (trapezius, serratus anterior, rhomboids and levator scapulae). The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis . The subscapularis facilitates internal rotation, and the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles assist in external rotation. The rotator cuff muscles depress the humeral head against the glenoid. With a poorly functioning (torn) rotator cuff, the humeral head can migrate upward within the joint because of an opposed action of the deltoid muscle. Scapular stability collectively involves the trapezius, serratus anterior and rhomboid muscles. The levator scapular and upper trapezius muscles support posture; the trapezius and the serratus anterior muscles help rotate the scapula upward, and the trapezius and the rhomboids aid scapular retraction. A complete history begins with the patient's age, dominant hand and sport or work activity. It is important to assess whether the injury prevents or hampers normal work activities, hobbies and sports. The patient should be asked about shoulder pain, instability, stiffness, locking, catching and swelling. Stiffness or loss of motion may be the major symptom in patients with adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), dislocation or glenohumeral joint arthritis. Pain with throwing (such as pitching a baseball) suggests anterior glenohumeral instability. Patients who complain of generalized joint laxity often have multidirectional glenohumeral instability. Distinguishing between an acute and a chronic problem is diagnostically helpful . For example, a history of acute trauma to the shoulder with the arm abducted and externally rotated strongly suggests shoulder subluxation or dislocation and possible glenoid labral injury. In contrast, chronic pain and loss of passive range of motion suggest frozen shoulder or tears of the rotator cuff. Key Findings in the History and Physical Examination Seizure and inability to passively or actively rotate affected arm externally Pain radiating below elbow; decreased cervical range of motion Shoulder pain in throwing athletes; anterior glenohumeral joint pain and impingement Key Findings in the History and Physical Examination Seizure and inability to passively or actively rotate affected arm externally Pain radiating below elbow; decreased cervical range of motion Shoulder pain in throwing athletes; anterior glenohumeral joint pain and impingement Once the location, quality, radiation, and aggravating and relieving factors of the shoulder pain have been established, the possibility of referred pain should be excluded. Neck pain and pain that radiates below the elbow are often subtle signs of a cervical spine disorder that is mistaken for a shoulder problem. The patient should be asked about paresthesias and muscle weakness. Pneumonia, cardiac ischemia and peptic ulcer disease can present with shoulder pain. A history of malignancy raises the possibility of metastatic disease. The patient should be asked about previous corticosteroid injections, particularly in the setting of osteopenia or rotator cuff tendon atrophy. A complete physical examination includes inspection and palpation, assessment of range of motion and strength, and provocative shoulder testing for possible impingement syndrome and glenohumeral instability. The neck and the elbow should also be examined to exclude the possibility that the shoulder pain is referred from a pathologic condition in either of these regions. The physical examination includes observing the way the patient moves and carries the shoulder. The patient should be properly disrobed to permit complete inspection of both shoulders. Swelling, asymmetry, muscle atrophy, scars, ecchymosis and any venous distention should be noted. Deformity, such as squaring of the shoulder that occurs with anterior dislocation, can immediately suggest a diagnosis. Scapular “winging,” which can be associated with shoulder instability and serratus anterior or trapezius dysfunction, should be noted. Atrophy of the supraspinatus or infraspinatus should prompt a further work-up for such conditions as rotator cuff tear, suprascapular nerve entrapment or neuropathy. Palpation should include examination of the acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints, the cervical spine and the biceps tendon. The anterior glenohumeral joint, coracoid process, acromion and scapula should also be palpated for any tenderness and deformity. Because the complex series of articulations of the shoulder allows a wide range of motion, the affected extremity should be compared with the unaffected side to determine the patient's normal range. Active and passive ranges should be assessed. For example, a patient with loss of active motion alone is more likely to have weakness of the affected muscles than joint disease. Shoulder abduction involves the glenohumeral joint and the scapulothoracic articulation. Glenohumeral motion can be isolated by holding the patient's scapula with one hand while the patient abducts the arm. The first 20 to 30 degrees of abduction should not require scapulothoracic motion. With the arm internally rotated (palm down), abduction continues to 120 degrees. Beyond 120 degrees, full abduction is possible only when the humerus is externally rotated (palm up). The Apley scratch test is another useful maneuver to assess shoulder range of motion . In this test, abduction and external rotation are measured by having the patient reach behind the head and touch the superior aspect of the opposite scapula. Conversely, internal rotation and adduction of the shoulder are tested by having the patient reach behind the back and touch the inferior aspect of the opposite scapula. External rotation should be measured with the patient's arms at the side and elbows flexed to 90 degrees. Apley scratch test. The patient attempts to touch the opposite scapula to test range of motion of the shoulder. Testing abduction and external rotation. Testing adduction and internal rotation. Apley scratch test. The patient attempts to touch the opposite scapula to test range of motion of the shoulder. Testing abduction and external rotation. Testing adduction and internal rotation. In evaluating the rotator cuff, the patient's affected extremity should always be compared with the unaffected side to detect subtle differences in strength and motion. A key finding, particularly with rotator cuff problems, is pain accompanied by weakness. True weakness should be distinguished from weakness that is due to pain. A patient with subacromial bursitis with a tear of the rotator cuff often has objective rotator cuff weakness caused by pain when the arm is positioned in the arc of impingement. Conversely, the patient will have normal strength if the arm is not tested in abduction. The supraspinatus can be tested by having the patient abduct the shoulders to 90 degrees in forward flexion with the thumbs pointing downward. The patient then attempts to elevate the arms against examiner resistance . This is often referred to as the “empty can” test. Supraspinatus examination (“empty can” test). The patient attempts to elevate the arms against resistance while the elbows are extended, the arms are abducted and the thumbs are pointing downward. Supraspinatus examination (“empty can” test). The patient attempts to elevate the arms against resistance while the elbows are extended, the arms are abducted and the thumbs are pointing downward. Next, with the patient's arms at the sides, the patient flexes both elbows to 90 degrees while the examiner provides resistance against external rotation . This maneuver is used to evaluate the function of the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles, which are mainly responsible for external rotation. Infraspinatus/teres minor examination. The patient attempts to externally rotate the arms against resistance while the arms are at the sides and the elbows are flexed to 90 degrees. Infraspinatus/teres minor examination. The patient attempts to externally rotate the arms against resistance while the arms are at the sides and the elbows are flexed to 90 degrees. Subscapularis function is assessed with the lift-off test. The patient rests the dorsum of the hand on the back in the lumbar area. Inability to move the hand off the back by further internal rotation of the arm suggests injury to the subscapularis muscle. In one study, the investigators noted that only a few of the patients with confirmed subscapularis ruptures actually demonstrated a positive result on the lift-off test; the remainder could not complete the test because of pain. A modified version of the lift-off test is useful in a patient who cannot place the hand behind the back. In this version, the patient places the hand of the affected arm on the abdomen and resists the examiner's attempts to externally rotate the arm. Provocative tests provide a more focused evaluation for specific problems and are typically performed after the history and general examination have been completed . Tests Used in Shoulder Evaluation and Significance of Positive Findings Patient touches superior and inferior aspects of opposite scapula Forward flexion of the shoulder to 90 degrees and internal rotation Forward elevation to 90 degrees and active adduction Spine extended with head rotated to affected shoulder while axially loaded Anterior pressure on the humerus with external rotation Posterior force on humerus while externally rotating the arm Elbow flexed 20 to 30 degrees and forearm supinated Rotation of loaded shoulder from extension to forward flexion Tests Used in Shoulder Evaluation and Significance of Positive Findings Patient touches superior and inferior aspects of opposite scapula Forward flexion of the shoulder to 90 degrees and internal rotation Forward elevation to 90 degrees and active adduction Spine extended with head rotated to affected shoulder while axially loaded Anterior pressure on the humerus with external rotation Posterior force on humerus while externally rotating the arm Elbow flexed 20 to 30 degrees and forearm supinated Rotation of loaded shoulder from extension to forward flexion Neer's impingement sign is elicited when the patient's rotator cuff tendons are pinched under the coracoacromial arch. The test is performed by placing the arm in forced flexion with the arm fully pronated . The scapula should be stabilized during the maneuver to prevent scapulothoracic motion. Pain with this maneuver is a sign of subacromial impingement. Neer's test for impingement of the rotator cuff tendons under the coracoacromial arch. The arm is fully pronated and placed in forced flexion. Neer's test for impingement of the rotator cuff tendons under the coracoacromial arch. The arm is fully pronated and placed in forced flexion. The Hawkins' test is another commonly performed assessment of impingement. It is performed by elevating the patient's arm forward to 90 degrees while forcibly internally rotating the shoulder . Pain with this maneuver suggests subacromial impingement or rotator cuff tendonitis. One study found Hawkins' test more sensitive for impingement than Neer's test. Hawkins' test for subacromial impingement or rotator cuff tendonitis. The arm is forward elevated to 90 degrees, then forcibly internally rotated. Hawkins' test for subacromial impingement or rotator cuff tendonitis. The arm is forward elevated to 90 degrees, then forcibly internally rotated. A possible rotator cuff tear can be evaluated with the drop-arm test. This test is performed by passively abducting the patient's shoulder, then observing as the patient slowly lowers the arm to the waist. Often, the arm will drop to the side if the patient has a rotator cuff tear or supraspinatus dysfunction. The patient may be able to lower the arm slowly to 90 degrees (because this is a function mostly of the deltoid muscle) but will be unable to continue the maneuver as far as the waist. Patients with acromioclavicular joint dysfunction often have shoulder pain that is mistaken for impingement syndrome. The cross-arm test isolates the acromioclavicular joint. The patient raises the affected arm to 90 degrees. Active adduction of the arm forces the acromion into the distal end of the clavicle . Pain in the area of the acromioclavicular joint suggests a disorder in this region. Cross-arm test for acromioclavicular joint disorder. The patient elevates the affected arm to 90 degrees, then actively adducts it. Cross-arm test for acromioclavicular joint disorder. The patient elevates the affected arm to 90 degrees, then actively adducts it. The tests described in this section are useful in evaluating for glenohumeral joint stability. Because the shoulder is normally the most unstable joint in the body, it can demonstrate significant glenohumeral translation (motion). Again, the uninvolved extremity should be examined for comparison with the affected side. The anterior apprehension test is performed with the patient supine or seated and the shoulder in a neutral position at 90 degrees of abduction. The examiner applies slight anterior pressure to the humerus (too much force can dislocate the humerus) and externally rotates the arm . Pain or apprehension about the feeling of impending subluxation or dislocation indicates anterior glenohumeral instability. Apprehension test for anterior instability. The patient's arm is abducted to 90 degrees while the examiner externally rotates the arm and applies anterior pressure to the humerus. Apprehension test for anterior instability. The patient's arm is abducted to 90 degrees while the examiner externally rotates the arm and applies anterior pressure to the humerus. The relocation test is performed immediately after a positive result on the anterior apprehension test. With the patient supine, the examiner applies posterior force on the proximal humerus while externally rotating the patient's arm. A decrease in pain or apprehension suggests anterior glenohumeral instability. Patients with rotator cuff tendonitis frequently have concomitant inflammation of the biceps tendon. The Yergason test is used to evaluate the biceps tendon. In this test, the patient's elbow is flexed to 90 degrees with the thumb up. The examiner grasps the wrist, resisting attempts by the patient to actively supinate the arm and flex the elbow . Pain with this maneuver indicates biceps tendonitis. Yergason test for biceps tendon instability or tendonitis. The patient's elbow is flexed to 90 degrees, and the examiner resists the patient's active attempts to supinate the arm and flex the elbow. Yergason test for biceps tendon instability or tendonitis. The patient's elbow is flexed to 90 degrees, and the examiner resists the patient's active attempts to supinate the arm and flex the elbow. Speed's maneuver is used to examine the proximal tendon of the long head of the biceps. The patient's elbow is flexed 20 to 30 degrees with the forearm in supination and the arm in about 60 degrees of flexion. The examiner resists forward flexion of the arm while palpating the patient's biceps tendon over the anterior aspect of the shoulder. With the patient's arm in a neutral position, the examiner pulls downward on the elbow or wrist while observing the shoulder area for a sulcus or depression lateral or inferior to the acromion. The presence of a depression indicates inferior translation of the humerus and suggests inferior glenohumeral instability . The examiner should remember that many asymptomatic patients, especially adolescents, normally have some degree of instability. Sulcus test for glenohumeral instability. Downward traction is applied to the humerus, and the examiner watches for a depression lateral or inferior to the acromion. Sulcus test for glenohumeral instability. Downward traction is applied to the humerus, and the examiner watches for a depression lateral or inferior to the acromion. Posterior instability of the shoulder can be assessed by using a simple test. With the patient supine or sitting, the examiner pushes posteriorly on the humeral head with the patient's arm in 90 degrees of abduction and the elbow in 90 degrees of flexion. Glenoid labral tears are assessed with the patient supine. The patient's arm is rotated and loaded (force applied) from extension through to forward flexion. A “clunk” sound or clicking sensation can indicate a labral tear even without instability. No physical examination in a patient with shoulder pain is complete without excluding cervical spine disease. Referred or radicular pain from disc disease should be considered in patients who have shoulder pain that does not respond to conservative treatment. The patient should be questioned about neck pain and previous neck injury, and the examiner should note whether pain worsens with turning of the neck, which suggests disc disease. Pain that originates from the neck or radiates past the elbow is often associated with a neck disorder. Plain film is a useful screening tool for degenerative cervical disc disease. Further work-up and imaging studies depend on the differential diagnosis and the treatment plan. In a patient with neck pain or pain that radiates below the elbow, a useful maneuver to further evaluate the cervical spine is Spurling's test. The patient's cervical spine is placed in extension and the head rotated toward the affected shoulder. An axial load is then placed on the spine . Reproduction of the patient's shoulder or arm pain indicates possible cervical nerve root compression and warrants further evaluation of the bony and soft tissue structures of the cervical spine. Spurling's test for cervical root disorder. The neck is extended and rotated toward the affected shoulder while an axial load is placed on the spine. Spurling's test for cervical root disorder. The neck is extended and rotated toward the affected shoulder while an axial load is placed on the spine. Choose a single article, issue, or full-access subscription.

Your shoulder is made up of several joints combined with tendons and muscles that allow a great range of motion in your arm. Because so many different structures make up the shoulder, it is vulnerable to many different problems. The rotator cuff is a frequent source of pain in the shoulder. This illustration of the shoulder highlights the major components of the joint. Your shoulder is made up of three bones: your upper arm bone (humerus), your shoulder blade (scapula), and your collarbone (clavicle). Your arm is kept in your shoulder socket by your rotator cuff. These muscles and tendons form a covering around the head of your upper arm bone and attach it to your shoulder blade. There is a lubricating sac called a bursa between the rotator cuff and the bone on top of your shoulder (acromion). The bursa allows the rotator cuff tendons to glide freely when you move your arm. The rotator cuff is a common source of pain in the shoulder. Pain can be the result of: The rotator cuff tendons can be irritated or damaged. The bursa can become inflamed and swell with more fluid causing pain. When you raise your arm to shoulder height, the space between the acromion and rotator cuff narrows. The acromion can rub against (or ""impinge"" on) the tendon and the bursa, causing irritation and pain. Rotator cuff pain is common in both young athletes and middle-aged people. Young athletes who use their arms overhead for swimming, baseball, and tennis are particularly vulnerable. Those who do repetitive lifting or overhead activities using the arm, such as paper hanging, construction, or painting are also susceptible. Pain may also develop as the result of a minor injury. Sometimes, it occurs with no apparent cause. Rotator cuff pain commonly causes local swelling and tenderness in the front of the shoulder. You may have pain and stiffness when you lift your arm. There may also be pain when the arm is lowered from an elevated position. Beginning symptoms may be mild. Patients frequently do not seek treatment at an early stage. These symptoms may include: Minor pain that is present both with activity and at rest Pain radiating from the front of the shoulder to the side of the arm Athletes in overhead sports may have pain when throwing or serving a tennis ball Difficulty doing activities that place the arm behind the back, such as buttoning or zippering If the pain comes on suddenly, the shoulder may be severely tender. All movement may be limited and painful. After discussing your symptoms and medical history, your doctor will examine your shoulder. He or she will check to see whether it is tender in any area or whether there is a deformity. To measure the range of motion of your shoulder, your doctor will have you move your arm in several different directions. He or she will also test your arm strength. Your doctor will check for other problems with your shoulder joint. He or she may also examine your neck to make sure that the pain is not coming from a ""pinched nerve,"" and to rule out other conditions, such as arthritis. Your doctor will test your range of motion by having you move your arm in different directions. Reproduced with permission from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. Other tests which may help your doctor confirm your diagnosis include: Becauses x-rays do not show the soft tissues of your shoulder like the rotator cuff, plain x-rays of a shoulder with rotator cuff pain are usually normal or may show a small bone spur. A special x-ray view, called an ""outlet view,"" sometimes will show a small bone spur on the front edge of the acromion.  Normal outlet view x-ray.  Abnormal outlet view showing a large bone spur causing impingement on the rotator cuff. These studies can create better images of soft tissues like the rotator cuff tendons. They can show fluid or inflammation in the bursa and rotator cuff. In some cases, partial tearing of the rotator cuff will be seen. Rotator Cuff and Shoulder Rehabilitation Exercises The goal of treatment is to reduce pain and restore function. In planning your treatment, your doctor will consider your age, activity level, and general health. In most cases, initial treatment is nonsurgical. Although nonsurgical treatment may take several weeks to months, many patients experience a gradual improvement and return to function. Your doctor may suggest rest and activity modification, such as avoiding overhead activities. Drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen reduce pain and swelling. A physical therapist will initially focus on restoring normal motion to your shoulder. Stretching exercises to improve range of motion are very helpful. If you have difficulty reaching behind your back, you may have developed tightness of the posterior capsule of the shoulder (capsule refers to the inner lining of the shoulder and posterior refers to the back of the shoulder). Specific stretching of the posterior capsule can be very effective in relieving pain in the shoulder. Once your pain is improving, your therapist can start you on a strengthening program for the rotator cuff muscles. If rest, medications, and physical therapy do not relieve your pain, an injection of a local anesthetic and a cortisone preparation may be helpful. Cortisone is a very effective anti-inflammatory medicine. Injecting it into the bursa beneath the acromion can relieve pain. A cortisone injection may relieve painful symptoms. Reproduced with permission from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. When nonsurgical treatment does not relieve pain, your doctor may recommend surgery. The goal of surgery is to create more space for the rotator cuff. To do this, your doctor will remove the inflamed portion of the bursa. He or she may also perform an anterior acromioplasty, in which part of the acromion is removed. This is also known as a subacromial decompression. These procedures can be performed using either an arthroscopic or open technique. In arthroscopy, thin surgical instruments are inserted into two or three small puncture wounds around your shoulder. Your doctor examines your shoulder through a fiberoptic scope connected to a television camera. He or she guides the small instruments using a video monitor, and removes bone and soft tissue. In most cases, the front edge of the acromion is removed along with some of the bursal tissue. Your surgeon may also treat other conditions present in the shoulder at the time of surgery. These can include arthritis between the clavicle (collarbone) and the acromion (acromioclavicular arthritis), inflammation of the biceps tendon (biceps tendonitis), or a partial rotator cuff tear. In open surgery, your doctor will make a small incision in the front of your shoulder. This allows your doctor to see the acromion and rotator cuff directly. After surgery, your arm may be placed in a sling for a short period of time. This allows for early healing. As soon as your comfort allows, your doctor will remove the sling to begin exercise and use of the arm. Your doctor will provide a rehabilitation program based on your needs and the findings at surgery. This will include exercises to regain range of motion of the shoulder and strength of the arm. It typically takes 2 to 4 months to achieve complete relief of pain, but it may take up to a year.

For information:  Questions and Answers for Patients Regarding Elective Surgery and COVID-19. For patients whose procedures have not yet been rescheduled:  What to Do If Your Orthopaedic Surgery Is Postponed. A rotator cuff tear is a common cause of pain and disability among adults. Each year, almost 2 million people in the United States visit their doctors because of a rotator cuff problem. A torn rotator cuff will weaken your shoulder. This means that many daily activities, like combing your hair or getting dressed, may become painful and difficult to do. Your shoulder is made up of three bones: your upper arm bone (humerus), your shoulder blade (scapula), and your collarbone (clavicle). The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint: the ball, or head, of your upper arm bone fits into a shallow socket in your shoulder blade. This illustration of the shoulder highlights the major components of the joint. Your arm is kept in your shoulder socket by your rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that come together as tendons to form a covering around the head of the humerus. The rotator cuff attaches the humerus to the shoulder blade and helps to lift and rotate your arm. The rotator cuff tendons cover the head of the humerus (upper arm bone), helping you to raise and rotate your arm. There is a lubricating sac called a bursa between the rotator cuff and the bone on top of your shoulder (acromion). The bursa allows the rotator cuff tendons to glide freely when you move your arm. When the rotator cuff tendons are injured or damaged, this bursa can also become inflamed and painful. When one or more of the rotator cuff tendons is torn, the tendon no longer fully attaches to the head of the humerus. In most rotator cuff tears, the tendon is torn away from the bone. Most tears occur in the supraspinatus tendon, but other parts of the rotator cuff may also be involved. In many cases, torn tendons begin by fraying. As the damage progresses, the tendon can completely tear, sometimes with lifting a heavy object.  This type of tear is also called an incomplete tear. It damages the tendon, but does not completely sever it.  This type of tear is also called a complete tear. It separates all of the tendon from the bone. With a full-thickness tear, there is basically a hole in the tendon.   Overhead view of the four tendons that form the rotator cuff.   A full-thickness tear in the supraspinatus tendon. A full-thickness tear in the supraspinatus tendon. There are two main causes of rotator cuff tears: injury and degeneration. If you fall down on your outstretched arm or lift something too heavy with a jerking motion, you can tear your rotator cuff. This type of tear can occur with other shoulder injuries, such as a broken collarbone or dislocated shoulder. Most tears are the result of a wearing down of the tendon that occurs slowly over time. This degeneration naturally occurs as we age. Rotator cuff tears are more common in the dominant arm. If you have a degenerative tear in one shoulder, there is a greater likelihood of a rotator cuff tear in the opposite shoulder -- even if you have no pain in that shoulder. Several factors contribute to degenerative, or chronic, rotator cuff tears.  Repeating the same shoulder motions again and again can stress your rotator cuff muscles and tendons. Baseball, tennis, rowing, and weightlifting are examples of sports activities that can put you at risk for overuse tears. Many jobs and routine chores can cause overuse tears, as well.  As we get older, the blood supply in our rotator cuff tendons lessens. Without a good blood supply, the body's natural ability to repair tendon damage is impaired. This can ultimately lead to a tendon tear.  As we age, bone spurs (bone overgrowth) often develop on the underside of the acromion bone. When we lift our arms, the spurs rub on the rotator cuff tendon. This condition is called shoulder impingement, and over time will weaken the tendon and make it more likely to tear. Because most rotator cuff tears are largely caused by the normal wear and tear that goes along with aging, people over 40 are at greater risk. People who do repetitive lifting or overhead activities are also at risk for rotator cuff tears. Athletes are especially vulnerable to overuse tears, particularly tennis players and baseball pitchers. Painters, carpenters, and others who do overhead work also have a greater chance for tears. Although overuse tears caused by sports activity or overhead work also occur in younger people, most tears in young adults are caused by a traumatic injury, like a fall. The most common symptoms of a rotator cuff tear include: Pain at rest and at night, particularly if lying on the affected shoulder Pain when lifting and lowering your arm or with specific movements Crepitus or crackling sensation when moving your shoulder in certain positions Tears that happen suddenly, such as from a fall, usually cause intense pain. There may be a snapping sensation and immediate weakness in your upper arm. Tears that develop slowly due to overuse also cause pain and arm weakness. You may have pain in the shoulder when you lift your arm, or pain that moves down your arm. At first, the pain may be mild and only present when lifting your arm over your head, such as reaching into a cupboard. Over-the-counter medication, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, may relieve the pain at first. Over time, the pain may become more noticeable at rest, and no longer goes away with medications. You may have pain when you lie on the painful side at night. The pain and weakness in the shoulder may make routine activities such as combing your hair or reaching behind your back more difficult. It should be noted that some rotator cuff tears are not painful. These tears, however, may still result in arm weakness and other symptoms. After discussing your symptoms and medical history, your doctor will examine your shoulder. He or she will check to see whether it is tender in any area or whether there is a deformity.

Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. Your doctor will check for other problems with your shoulder joint. He or she may also examine your neck to make sure that the pain is not coming from a ""pinched nerve,"" and to rule out other conditions, such as arthritis. Other tests which may help your doctor confirm your diagnosis include:  The first imaging tests performed are usually x-rays. Because x-rays do not show the soft tissues of your shoulder like the rotator cuff, plain x-rays of a shoulder with rotator cuff pain are usually normal or may show a small bone spur.  These studies can better show soft tissues like the rotator cuff tendons. They can show the rotator cuff tear, as well as where the tear is located within the tendon and the size of the tear. An MRI can also give your doctor a better idea of how ""old"" or ""new"" a tear is because it can show the quality of the rotator cuff muscles. Rotator Cuff and Shoulder Rehabilitation Exercises If you have a rotator cuff tear and you keep using it despite increasing pain, you may cause further damage. A rotator cuff tear can get larger over time.  Chronic shoulder and arm pain are good reasons to see your doctor. Early treatment can prevent your symptoms from getting worse. It will also get you back to your normal routine that much quicker. The goal of any treatment is to reduce pain and restore function. There are several treatment options for a rotator cuff tear, and the best option is different for every person. In planning your treatment, your doctor will consider your age, activity level, general health, and the type of tear you have. There is no evidence of better results from surgery performed near the time of injury versus later on. For this reason, many doctors first recommend management of rotator cuff tears with physical therapy and other nonsurgical treatments. In about 80% of patients, nonsurgical treatment relieves pain and improves function in the shoulder.  Your doctor may suggest rest and limiting overhead activities. He or she may also prescribe a sling to help protect your shoulder and keep it still.  Avoid activities that cause shoulder pain.  Drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen reduce pain and swelling.  Specific exercises will restore movement and strengthen your shoulder. Your exercise program will include stretches to improve flexibility and range of motion. Strengthening the muscles that support your shoulder can relieve pain and prevent further injury.  If rest, medications, and physical therapy do not relieve your pain, an injection of a local anesthetic and a cortisone preparation may be helpful. Cortisone is a very effective anti-inflammatory medicine; however, it is not effective for all patients. A cortisone injection may relieve painful symptoms. The chief advantage of nonsurgical treatment is that it avoids the major risks of surgery, such as: Your doctor may recommend surgery if your pain does not improve with nonsurgical methods. Continued pain is the main indication for surgery. If you are very active and use your arms for overhead work or sports, your doctor may also suggest surgery. Other signs that surgery may be a good option for you include: You have a large tear (more than 3 cm) and the quality of the surrounding tissue is good You have significant weakness and loss of function in your shoulder Surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff most often involves re-attaching the tendon to the head of humerus (upper arm bone). There are a few options for repairing rotator cuff tears. Your orthopaedic surgeon will discuss with you the best procedure to meet your individual health needs.

You may have pain in the shoulder when you lift your arm, or pain that moves down your arm. At first, the pain may be mild and only present when lifting your arm over your head, such as reaching into a cupboard. Over-the-counter medication, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, may relieve the pain at first. Over time, the pain may become more noticeable at rest, and no longer goes away with medications. You may have pain when you lie on the painful side at night. The pain and weakness in the shoulder may make routine activities such as combing your hair or reaching behind your back more difficult. It should be noted that some rotator cuff tears are not painful. These tears, however, may still result in arm weakness and other symptoms. After discussing your symptoms and medical history, your doctor will examine your shoulder. He or she will check to see whether it is tender in any area or whether there is a deformity. To measure the range of motion of your shoulder, your doctor will have you move your arm in several different directions. He or she will also test your arm strength. Your doctor will test your range of motion by having you move your arm in different directions. Reproduced with permission from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. Your doctor will check for other problems with your shoulder joint. He or she may also examine your neck to make sure that the pain is not coming from a ""pinched nerve,"" and to rule out other conditions, such as arthritis. Other tests which may help your doctor confirm your diagnosis include:  The first imaging tests performed are usually x-rays. Because x-rays do not show the soft tissues of your shoulder like the rotator cuff, plain x-rays of a shoulder with rotator cuff pain are usually normal or may show a small bone spur.  These studies can better show soft tissues like the rotator cuff tendons. They can show the rotator cuff tear, as well as where the tear is located within the tendon and the size of the tear. An MRI can also give your doctor a better idea of how ""old"" or ""new"" a tear is because it can show the quality of the rotator cuff muscles. Rotator Cuff and Shoulder Rehabilitation Exercises If you have a rotator cuff tear and you keep using it despite increasing pain, you may cause further damage. A rotator cuff tear can get larger over time.  Chronic shoulder and arm pain are good reasons to see your doctor. Early treatment can prevent your symptoms from getting worse. It will also get you back to your normal routine that much quicker. The goal of any treatment is to reduce pain and restore function. There are several treatment options for a rotator cuff tear, and the best option is different for every person. In planning your treatment, your doctor will consider your age, activity level, general health, and the type of tear you have. There is no evidence of better results from surgery performed near the time of injury versus later on. For this reason, many doctors first recommend management of rotator cuff tears with physical therapy and other nonsurgical treatments. In about 80% of patients, nonsurgical treatment relieves pain and improves function in the shoulder.  Your doctor may suggest rest and limiting overhead activities. He or she may also prescribe a sling to help protect your shoulder and keep it still.  Avoid activities that cause shoulder pain.  Drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen reduce pain and swelling.  Specific exercises will restore movement and strengthen your shoulder. Your exercise program will include stretches to improve flexibility and range of motion. Strengthening the muscles that support your shoulder can relieve pain and prevent further injury.  If rest, medications, and physical therapy do not relieve your pain, an injection of a local anesthetic and a cortisone preparation may be helpful. Cortisone is a very effective anti-inflammatory medicine; however, it is not effective for all patients. A cortisone injection may relieve painful symptoms. The chief advantage of nonsurgical treatment is that it avoids the major risks of surgery, such as: Your doctor may recommend surgery if your pain does not improve with nonsurgical methods. Continued pain is the main indication for surgery. If you are very active and use your arms for overhead work or sports, your doctor may also suggest surgery. Other signs that surgery may be a good option for you include: You have a large tear (more than 3 cm) and the quality of the surrounding tissue is good You have significant weakness and loss of function in your shoulder Surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff most often involves re-attaching the tendon to the head of humerus (upper arm bone). There are a few options for repairing rotator cuff tears. Your orthopaedic surgeon will discuss with you the best procedure to meet your individual health needs.

If It Doesn't Challenge You It Doesn't Change You Hunched Shoulders – What Causes Them and How to Correct Them? Hunched Shoulders – What Causes Them and How to Correct Them? How’s your posture? Are your shoulders properly aligned with the rest of your body or are they rounded and pushed forward? If you said the latter, you’ve suffered from hunched shoulders, one of the most common postural alignment problems. It’s a problem that’s epidemic, thanks to too much sitting and standing in a slouched position. How many times do you bend your head down to look at your smartphone? Every time you do this, your shoulders fall forward and it places added stress on your upper back and neck. Do it enough and it becomes an ingrained habit that you do unconsciously and then wonder why your neck hurts. Look around and you’ll see it’s a silent epidemic. We are truly a hunched-over society. How do you identify shoulders that are hunched or rounded? It’s easiest to see when you look at someone from the side. Rounded shoulders are not only unattractive, but they also place added stress on your back and neck and can lead to chronic pain issues, including neck pain, upper back pain, and headaches. When you constantly let your shoulders fall forward, whether you’re sitting or standing, your upper back falls forward, your chest muscles tighten, and your shoulders internally rotate. How Do You Know if You Have Rounded or Hunched Shoulders? A simple test for this common alignment problem is to stand up straight and let your arms fall naturally at your side. Which way are your palms facing in this position? Normally, they should be facing inward towards your body. If they’re pointing behind you, it’s likely you have rounded shoulders. Now that you know you have them, how did you correct the problem? As mentioned, sitting in a hunched position with your shoulders falling forward reinforces this abnormal posture. Muscle imbalances are also a factor. If you’re hunched, some of the muscles in the front of your body, particularly your anterior deltoids, upper trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis muscles are too tight. As a result, they’re pulling your shoulders forward. In turn, the opposing muscles that keep your shoulders in proper alignment are weak. These include the posterior deltoids, mid and lower trapezius, rotator cuff muscles, and rhomboids. To tackle the problem, we have to correct the muscle imbalance. One way to do this is to stretch the tight muscles that are pulling your shoulders forward, the pectoralis muscles, upper trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and anterior deltoids and strengthen the muscles that pull your shoulders back. First, let’s look at how to relax the tight muscles that pull your shoulders too far forward. A Simple Stretch to Help Correct Chest Tightness Due to Hunched Shoulders Here’s one of the easiest ways to relax tight chest muscles arising from hunched shoulders. Stand inside a doorway. Place the palm of each hand on the frame of the door on either side. Now, gently let your body fall forward as you hold your palms against the frame until you feel the stretch. Hold for 20 seconds and relax. The beauty of this exercise is you can do it anytime that you have access to a doorway. It’s an easy stretch you can do throughout the day when you take a break. Now that you know how to stretch and lengthen the muscles that pull your shoulders forward, let’s work on strengthening the muscles that help pull your shoulders back. For this, you need to strengthen the muscles in your upper back and the back of your shoulders. One of the best exercises for doing this is the bent-over row. Bent-over rows are effective because they strengthen the middle trapezius, and rhomboids, muscles that help pull your shoulders back. Another effective exercise that strengthens these muscles are inverted rows with wide elbows. Be sure you’re pulling up using your back muscles rather than leading with your hips. Another effective exercise “anti-hunch” exercise to add to your arsenal is bent-over reverse dumbbell flies. This exercise targets the muscles in the upper back, like the upper trapezius and posterior deltoids, that help pull your shoulders back. Strengthening your scapular retractors helps rebalance your shoulders and keep them from falling forward as well. If you have an elastic band, there’s a simple exercise you can do to strengthen the muscles that retract your scapula. In a standing position, loop the band around a secure object and hold onto each side with your hands. Position the band somewhere around the midline of your body. With your elbows bent to 90 degrees, pull on each side of the band as you try to bring your shoulder blades together. Hold this position for a few seconds and then relax. Complete 8 repetitions and 3 sets total. Other exercises that strengthen the muscles that keep your shoulders in alignment are inverted rows and chin-ups. If you can’t manage chin-ups, lateral pull-downs are a good substitute. Make sure you’re including these exercises in your routine. Finally, watch your posture when you’re using mobile and desktop technology. Hold your smartphone at eye level rather than letting your head and shoulders fall forward. Place laptops and iPads on a stack of books or another device that keeps them at eye level. Hunched shoulders are typically not an isolated problem. The same behaviors that reinforce rounded shoulders, including leaning the head forward and sitting too much, also cause other muscle imbalances that lead to posture problems. The two most common are text neck and anterior pelvic tilt. Text neck is caused by leaning the head forward and down to look at a smartphone or other device for long periods. It’s easy to see how the two go together. Anterior pelvic tilt comes from an imbalance between the hip flexors and hip extensors and is usually caused by prolonged sitting. What happens is the hip flexors shorten and the hip extensors lengthen and become weaker. Correcting these problems is a subject for another post but be aware that if you have hunched shoulders you may very well have other postural problems as well. Have someone you know and trust evaluate your posture and see if you’re suffering from hunched shoulders. Identifying the problem is the first step. Then change your workstation so you’re sitting upright and not bending your head down. Then, work on stretching the tight muscles and strengthening the weak ones. Your back and neck will thank you!

If you’re looking for a non-invasive, easy-to-use treatment, shoulder braces for pain may provide just the relief you need. The shoulder girdle is an incredibly complex collection of bones, muscles, and tendons that work together to allow us to lift, lower, and rotate our arms in their sockets. It consists of three separate joints that provide the largest range of motion of any part of the body. These three joints are the glenohumeral joint, the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, and the sternoclavicular joint. All three joints move and are stabilized through the complex interworkings of: Bones: The three main bones of the shoulder are the clavicle (also known as the collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blades), and the humerus (upper arm bone). Muscles: The muscles of the rotator cuff are the suprasinatus, the infraspinatus, the teres minor, and subscapularis. These muscles hold the head of the humerus in the cavity of the scapula called the glenoid. In and around the three joints are tendons, ligaments, and cartilage, all designed to stabilize and mobilize the shoulder to perform daily actions both large and small. Any injury or inflammation in any of these structures can lead to pain. A few are most common though, including: Most types of shoulder pain are easily treated with non-invasive options like shoulder braces for pain, rest, and exercise. However, some require most focused care. Rotator cuff injuries, in particular, are one of the most common causes of pain. Whenever we raise up our children, carry groceries in from the car, or take a three-point shot, our rotator cuff comes into play. A rotator cuff injury can include tears or tendinitis, a condition in which the tendons of the rotator cuff become inflamed (also called impingement syndrome). A rotator cuff injury occurs when the tendons incur a tear or a strain. This can be an actual separation of the tendons from the muscles, or it can be irritation or inflammation. Your injury can range from mild to severe. The main cause of rotator cuff injury is overuse or repetitive motion over a period of time. This can take many forms including: A regular athletic practice that works or overworks the muscles of the shoulders Professional musicians such as cellists and violinists who are prone to rotator cuff injury in their bowing hands Suffering an injury to the shoulder, as in a car accident or in full-contact sports The large range of motion and involvement in daily tasks make injury to the rotator cuff very common. It may not be a dramatic movement that causes the injury, but the symptoms are similar regardless of how the injury occurs. They include: All of these symptoms need not be present to receive a diagnosis, but they are the most common signs. Due to the location of the injury and the area’s involvement in daily life, it would seem that shoulder pain is inevitable. However, there are a few risk factors that make it more likely. These include: Age: Arthritis is often an age-related disease. In addition, rotator cuff injury also most commonly occurs in adults over age 40 due to degeneration of the tendons, cartilage, and ligaments. Activity level: Professional athletes or those who exercise in highly repetitive sports (e.g., tennis and baseball or softball) have an increased risk of shoulder injury. On the flip side, those who sit at desks all day with their head jutting forward and neck flexed may be at risk for . Tradesmen: House painters and carpenters who work with their arms over their heads on a regular basis are more likely to experience shoulder issues. Even if you’re at risk for shoulder pain, there are many treatments that can help. (And a bit of prevention, as we’ll discuss shortly, never hurts either.) One of the best ways to deal with a recent injury or chronic case of shoulder pain is with a brace. Depending on the cause of your pain, however, braces can help. They can provide the support and stability your shoulder needs to heal after an injury. For some injuries, it’s vital to use a brace so your injury doesn’t worsen or heal improperly. Compressing the shoulder joint to reduce inflammation Reducing shoulder instability to allow injuries to heal more quickly and in the right position Keeping the shoulder elevated to improve blood flow and aid healing Allowing you to adjust the temperature of your brace for hot or cold therapy Correcting postural habits that are leading to pain There are a few different types of braces, ranging from simple slings that keep the shoulder immobile to shoulder stabilizers that still allow you to exercise. Some people may also benefit from posture support devices that can help you prevent pain from incorrect posture. Before using any brace, always talk to your doctor. Always. You only want to use a brace after they’ve diagnosed the source of your pain and have advised you to use a brace. If they haven’t, we discuss some other alternative treatments later on in this post. Some types of injuries, for example, require surgery. The best shoulder braces are those that work for your type of injury. For example, you may choose a brace that has more mobility if you’re suffering from a mild case of arthritis. Or, if your pain is due to a more severe injury, your doctor will probably recommend an immobilizing brace. Beyond finding the appropriate type of brace, there are a few other considerations to take into account: support, comfort, and discretion. “The most important factor to consider when choosing a shoulder brace is supportability. For a shoulder brace to work properly, it needs to provide good support in the right places. That means well placed straps and a snug fit. The less your shoulder joint sags, the better. High quality materials are also a good indication of a well designed shoulder brace. Strong straps and sturdy slings will make a comfortable and durable shoulder brace.” They also go onto note that comfort is another consideration. Finally, you should avoid braces that are too bulky or chafe, if you can. The best ones are discrete and can even hide under your clothes. With that in mind, here are some of the best shoulder braces for pain. (Note: PainDoctor.com does not endorse, nor do we make any money off the sale of these products. This information is provided for the benefit of patients based on patient reviews. Braces should always be used after consultation with a patient’s doctor.) If you’re suffering from an injury or are recovering after surgery, talk to your doctor about the best sling or brace to use. They’ll likely have very specific suggestions on what they’d like you to use and for how long. Some of the highest-rated slings include the DonJoy UltraSling III and the Aircast Arm Immobilizer available at . This shoulder sling is often recommended for patients recovering from surgery or injuries, such as rotator cuff repairs, Bankart procedures, or strains. While it provides a great deal of support, it’s also easily-customizable and comfortable. Sizes range from small (up to 11″) to extra-large (above 15″). The Aircast is a more affordable option for those recovering from more mild injuries. It provides a custom fit with back, shoulder, and under-arm straps. It can help with some types of fractures, injuries, or dislocations. 3. Shoulder Abduction With Pillow Brace from 4. Ergonomic Arm Sling With Split Strap Technology from Many patients suffering from mild arthritis or injuries may benefit from using a shoulder brace, especially during activity. Here are some of the best. The Vive shoulder support brace is one of the easiest to use and most affordable, especially for those suffering from mild cases of pain.

Shoulder Support Brace & Rotator Cuff Compression Sleeve by  If your shoulder pain is caused by neck pain due to postural issues, you could look into a brace for posture. This posture brace is comfortable, easy to put on and take off, and helps prevent pain caused by bad posture. It also fits chests sizes 29″ to 40″. If a shoulder brace for pain isn’t the best solution, there are other treatments for pain that can help. Of all treatment options the best choice is very simple: prevention. Even in its complexity, the shoulder girdle is designed to move freely and support the work (and play) of our lives. While degeneration of the joint as we age is inevitable, there are ways to help support the shoulder before a rotator cuff injury occurs. Daily strengthening and flexibility exercises for the muscles of the back can help support the work of the ligaments and tendons. Varying your physical routine to include activities that do not stress the shoulder is another way to prevent injury. Finally, taking breaks during repetitive activities and icing your shoulder after long periods of work overhead can help keep inflammation at bay. This is so is important, as more activity in the joint can cause further injury. Rest is usually indicated for a short period of time, as too much time off can result in thickening of tissue in the shoulder, leading to frozen shoulder. After the initial period of rest, a physical therapist can help to restore safe movement in the shoulder through guided stretching and strengthening. This can also help increase range of motion. Some over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen can help with swelling and pain. Your doctor may offer you a prescription for the initial stage of injury, but often minor tendinitis and tears can be treated safely with low doses of NSAIDS. For pain that is not resolved with NSAIDS, your doctor may recommend steroid injections to reduce pain and swelling. These injections can result in weaker tendons in the shoulder and should not be used frequently. However, they can be a useful alternative to be done alongside physical therapy. In this way, you can reduce your pain at its source while reducing your pain during the strengthening exercises themselves. Surgery is a much more invasive option and would only be considered when all other options were exercised, or if the location and severity of the injury indicated that surgery was the best choice. Surgeries for shoulder pain can include: Further, as notes, even if you’re suffering from a rotator cuff tear or similar injury, it may not mean surgery. There are a number of factors to consider: “Rotator cuff tears may involve either operative or non-operative treatment. Surgery is often the last resort to repair the torn tendons, and the exact type of operation may depend on several factors, including the degree of tendon disruption, location of the tendon tear, and physical activity of the patient.” If you’re suffering from shoulder pain, it’s important to talk to a doctor before your pain gets worse. And it’s always important to talk to them before trying one of these shoulder braces for pain. Fast and appropriate treatment can help you avoid pain in the future.

For serious injuries, the prognosis is usually good, some six weeks of physical therapy being required following surgery What are some quick fitness exercises a busy mom could do? According to the article ""Exercises For Busy Moms"", by Tracy Mallet, there are several good, quick exercises for mothers. For example, rotator-cuff strengtheners, triceps push-up extensions, and butterfly abs curls. What are the normal results of rotator cuff surgery? The prognosis for the long-term relief from rotator cuff syndrome is good, especially when both conservative and surgical therapeutic approaches are used.Complete recovery following surgery may take several months. It is a very good question! There are four muscles, which compose rotator cuff. They all keep the head of the humerus in opposition to the glenoid cavity of the scapula bone. The head of the humerus is very large. The glenoid cavity is very small. So they act like a tendon. They are 'functionally' contracting tendons. That is the beauty of this joint. That is the beauty of the nature. Exercise is good, but improper form--specifically, lifting weights while moving in a way that is unnatural for your body--can be dangerous, especially if you're prone to a rotator cuff injury. People who bodybuild, swim or play sports that require repetitive overhead arm movements are more likely to develop this injury, which can take anywhere from two to six months to heal. That's a long time to be out of the game.Here's what you need to know about your rotator cuff--and how you can exercise to avoid this painful injury.Your Rotator Cuff: Why it MattersTo lift, move and push objects, we depend on the movements of our arms. The rotator cuff, a series of muscles and tendons gathered around the humerus, helps us do that by enabling our arms to move freely. Without it, we wouldn't be able to lift boxes, rotate our arms, or do anything that involves the free movement of our upper arms.Normally, these tendons and muscles work together and enable the arm to do repetitive moving tasks. When the rotator cuff is overused, however, such as lifting weights repeatedly above your head with movements that are unnatural for your arms, the muscles and tendons can wear down, eventually leading to a tear. If any part of the rotator cuff is injured, you'll notice it. You may have significant trouble lifting or rotating your arm and notice significant front shoulder pain, which may travel down to your arm.Most people who experience a rotator cuff injury get it from years of overuse. Although these injuries can occur after direct trauma to the arm, people who weightlift or swim often report experiencing these injuries. The injury may build up over time, and eventually escalate into a tear that can severely weaken your arm.Avoiding Rotator Cuff Injuries with ExerciseAlthough exercise may cause some injuries, exercise can also help prevent them. Proper stretching, using correct form, and doing exercises that strengthen the muscles and tendons of the cuff can help decrease your risk, while making it stronger--and that means you can lift or push more weights. Here are the most crucial exercises for strengthening this key area:1. Dumbbell raise:Lying on your stomach on a flat bench, hold a dumbbell in your left hand. Your left hand should be dangling off the bench, with your other arm securely on the bench. Slowly lift the weight while bending your elbow at a 90 degree angle. Stop when your elbow is parallel to your shoulder. Hold it for a few seconds before slowly releasing it to the starting position.2. Cable rotation:Using a cable machine, move the pulley until it is parallel to your elbow, then grasp the handlebar. Standing parallel to the bar, take your hand, keep your elbow close to your body, and pull it towards your chest by rotating your shoulder. Rotate the shoulder back to the starting position and repeat for 12 repetitions. Switch sides when the repetitions are finished.3. Dumbbell rotations: Using light dumbbells, hold both dumbbells in front of your lower stomach. Your palms should be facing your body. Slowly bend your arms into a 90 degree angle and pull the weights up until the weights are level with your shoulders. Lower the weight and repeat for ten repetitions.Continue to do these exercises regularly as part of your workout program, being careful to use proper form. Doing so will gradually increase the strength of your rotator cuff, allowing you to lift heavier weights and avoid shoulder injuries. *IMPORTANT* - Get your doctor's clearance before starting any exercise for a joint injury. Also, no exercise can heal rotator cuff. It can increase mobility and decrease pain.

The procedure can be done with a large (""open"") incision or with shoulder arthroscopy, which uses small button-hole sized incisions.DescriptionThe rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that form a cuff over the shoulder joint. These muscles and tendons hold the arm in its ""ball and socket"" joint and help the shoulder to rotate. The role of the tendons is to hold the powerful shoulder muscles to the shoulder and arm bones. The tendons can be torn from overuse or injury.Your doctor will first check your shoulder with a small camera (arthroscope) to look at the tear and determine if it can be fixed. The arthroscope is inserted into the shoulder through a small poke-hole. The camera is connected to a video monitor. The surgeon looks around the entire joint to check the cartilage, tendons, and ligaments of your shoulder.After evaluating the shoulder joint, the surgeon places the camera in the space above the rotator cuff tendons, called the subacromial space. The surgeon can check the area above the rotator cuff, clean out inflamed or damaged tissue, and remove a bone spur (subacromial spur).If a tear is going to be fixed, the surgeon may perform the surgery with a larger, open incision. Other surgeons use the arthroscope and 1 to 3 additional small poke-holes or smaller incisions to perform the surgery. The additional small incisions allow the surgeon to insert other instruments to repair damaged tissue.The goal is to attach the tendon back to the bone where it tore off. The tendon is attached with sutures. Small rivets (called suture anchors) are often used to help attach the tendon to the bone. The suture anchors can be made of metal or material that dissolves over time, and do not need to be removed.At the end of the surgery, the incisions are closed, and a dressing is applied. If arthroscopy was performed, most surgeons take pictures of the procedure from the video monitor to show you what was found and what was done.Why the Procedure Is PerformedRotator cuff repair may be recommended for shoulder problems such as:Torn rotator cuff with weakness and painPain, especially using the arm overheadA bone spur or inflammation around the rotator cuffRisksThe risks for any anesthesia are:Allergic reactions to medicationsProblems breathingThe risks for any surgery are:BleedingInfectionNerve damageAdditional risks include:Stiffness of the shoulderFailure of the surgery to relieve symptomsFailure of the repair to healWeakness of the shoulderAfter the ProcedureSurgery to repair a torn rotator cuff is usually very successful at relieving pain in the shoulder. The procedure may not always return strength to the shoulder. Rotator cuff repair can require a long recovery period, especially if the tear was large.In many cases, arthroscopy reduces the need to surgically open the shoulder joint. This can result in less pain and stiffness. In cases of repair, the body still needs to heal after arthroscopic surgery, just as if it were open surgery, so the overall recovery time will still be long.Outlook (Prognosis)The recovery can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months, depending on the size of the tear and other factors. You may have to wear a sling for 1 to 6 weeks after surgery. Pain is usually managed with medications.When you can return to work or play sports will depend on the surgery that was performed, but it will usually take several months to resume your regular activities.Physical therapy may help you to regain the motion and strength of your shoulder. The length of therapy will depend on the repair that was performed.ReferencesMatsen FA III, Fehringer EV, Lippitt SB, Wirth MA, Rockwood CA Jr. Rotator cuff.

The rotator cuff is a group of tough, flexible fibers () and muscles in the . Rotator cuff disorders occur when tissues in the shoulder get irritated or damaged. Rotator cuff disorders include: Inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) or of a bursa (). In the shoulder, a bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that serves as a cushion between the tendons and the bones. Impingement, in which a tendon is squeezed and rubs against bone. Calcium buildup in the tendons, which causes a painful condition called . Partial or complete . How does the shoulder work, and what does the rotator cuff do? The shoulder is a joint with three main bones: the upper arm bone (humerus), the collarbone (clavicle), and the shoulder blade (scapula). The bones are held together by muscles, tendons, and . The rotator cuff keeps the upper arm bone in the shoulder socket and lets you raise and twist your arm. The shoulder is a ball-and-socket . The ball at the top of the upper arm bone fits into the socket of the shoulder blade. This socket is shallow, which lets you move your arm in a wide range of motion. But it also means that the muscles and tendons of the rotator cuff have to work hard to hold the bones in place. As a result, they are easy to injure and are prone to wear and tear. Most rotator cuff disorders are caused by a combination of: Using your shoulder for many years slowly damages the rotator cuff. As you age, everyday activities can lead to changes in the rotator cuff, such as thinning and fraying of the tendons and reduced blood supply. Activities in which you use your arms above your head a lot—such as tennis, swimming, or house painting—can lead to rotator cuff problems. Even normal motions made often over a long period can stress or injure the rotator cuff. It takes great force to tear a healthy rotator cuff tendon. This can happen during sports, an accident, or a severe fall. But even a simple movement like lifting a suitcase can cause a rotator cuff tear in an older adult or someone whose shoulder is already damaged. Symptoms of a rotator cuff disorder include pain and weakness in the shoulder. Most often, the pain is on the side and front of the upper arm and shoulder. It may hurt or be impossible to do everyday things, such as comb your hair, tuck in your shirt, or reach for something. You may have pain during the night and trouble sleeping. To diagnose a rotator cuff disorder, doctors ask about any shoulder injuries or past shoulder pain. They also do a physical exam to see how well the shoulder works and to find painful areas or activities. Moving your arm in certain ways can help a doctor learn about the condition of the rotator cuff. You may have an to check the bones of the shoulder. If the diagnosis is still unclear, the doctor may order an imaging test, such as an or an . It is important to treat a rotator cuff problem. Without treatment, your shoulder may get weaker and you may not be able to lift up your arm. For most rotator cuff disorders, doctors recommend these steps first: Use the arm, but do so carefully. Don't keep the shoulder still with a sling or brace. This can lead to stiffness or even a frozen shoulder (). whichever feels better. (NSAIDs) to relieve pain and reduce swelling and inflammation. Examples include ibuprofen (such as Advil) and naproxen (such as Aleve). Or try (such as Tylenol). It can help with pain but will not reduce swelling or inflammation. Be safe with medicines. Read and follow all instructions on the label. Avoid positions and activities that are uncomfortable, such as lifting or reaching overhead. Stop any activity that hurts the shoulder. The doctor may also suggest . Physical therapy can reduce pain and help make your shoulder stronger and more flexible. In physical therapy, you learn exercises to stretch and strengthen your shoulder. After you learn the exercises, you can do them at home. It is important to give treatment time to work. It may take from a couple of weeks to several months to get good results. If other treatments don't help, your doctor may give you shots of steroid medicine in the shoulder. The shots probably don't cure rotator cuff disorders. But they can help relieve pain and inflammation so you are able to do exercises to strengthen the shoulder. The shots may also help your doctor find out if your shoulder pain is from your rotator cuff. If a steroid shot near the rotator cuff relieves your pain, even if the pain comes back later, it means the rotator cuff—not some other shoulder problem—is causing the pain. Most rotator cuff disorders aren't treated with surgery. But doctors may do surgery if a rotator cuff tendon is torn or if several months of other treatments have not helped. Surgery may be a good choice if you are young and your rotator cuff has been in good shape. Surgery may not work as well if your tendons are weak and frayed. Surgery is not a substitute for physical therapy. Even after surgery, you may need months of physical therapy to have a full recovery.

Rotator Cuff Problems: Exercises You Can Do at Home In a rotator cuff disorder, tendons that make up the rotator cuff get squeezed and rub against bone. They become damaged and irritated. This causes bleeding and inflammation. The tendons can develop scar tissue, which is not as strong and flexible as normal tendon tissue. Over time, the tendons get weaker and less flexible. Eventually, they can tear. Normal wear and tear and overuse cause most rotator cuff problems. It takes great force to tear a healthy rotator cuff tendon. This can happen during sports, an accident, or a severe fall. But even a simple movement like lifting a suitcase can cause a rotator cuff tear in an older adult or someone whose shoulder is already damaged. A rotator cuff disorder causes pain and weakness in your shoulder. It may be uncomfortable or impossible to do everyday activities, such as combing your hair, tucking in your shirt, or reaching above your head. Most often, you will feel the pain on the side and front of your upper arm and shoulder. You may have pain during the night and have trouble sleeping on that side. Pain is almost always worse when you make overhead movements. Because of the pain, you may try not to use your arm. And that can cause even more weakness and stiffness in the shoulder. The amount of pain usually depends on how much damage there is: Pain most often occurs only when you are active and is usually relieved with rest. You will likely notice pain both during and after activity. Pain may also occur at night, especially when you lie on your shoulder. Sometimes the pain isn't directly related to the amount of damage. For example, your rotator cuff may have minor damage, but strength and the loss of range of motion may be severe because it's too painful to move in certain ways. This is especially true if you normally make a lot of overhead movements. In tendinitis (inflammation in the ), the pain usually starts gradually, over the side of the shoulder and the upper arm. Your shoulder and arm aren't particularly weak but it hurts to use them. The pain may spread down the outside of the upper arm, even to the elbow. The pain may be worse at night and may keep you awake, especially if you lie on that side. Lifting the arm to the side or to the front makes the pain worse. Over time, the pain may get worse or you may have constant pain. In some cases, this is because you actually have one or more small tendon tears. Some people also have tendinitis in other parts of the shoulder. And some people have neck pain from using other muscles to help move the shoulder. Pain when you move your arm, especially overhead or against resistance. Weakness in your shoulder, although some people don't notice any weakness if the tear is small. A popping sound or tearing sensation in your shoulder. Weakness and pain when you lift or rotate your arm. Limited range of motion and inability to raise your arm because of pain or weakness. You can have a complete tear without symptoms, especially if you are an older adult who is not very active. In rare cases, shoulder pain may be a sign of a more serious problem with your heart or lungs. The is a group of four tendons. These tendons connect the main muscles of the shoulder to the upper arm. The tendons and muscles stabilize the shoulder joint so you can raise and rotate your arm. Every time you raise your arm above your head, the upper tendon glides under the upper end of your shoulder blade. Sometimes the shoulder blade is rough or abnormally shaped and rubs or scrapes the tendon. Over time, this can cause tiny tears and bleeding. When these tears heal, the scar tissue is weaker and less flexible than normal tendon, so the whole rotator cuff gets weaker. The weaker the tendon becomes, the greater its chances of tearing. Without treatment, this cycle of inflammation, wear and tear, and limited use can lead to other shoulder problems, such as stiffness or . Activities that require repeated overhead arm movements can lead to problems like and . Here are the things that can gradually lead to rotator cuff problems. They often occur together or overlap: These can affect how the rotator cuff moves. You may be born with these irregularities, or they may occur after some type of injury, such as a broken bone. As you age, everyday activities and normal wear and tear lead to some changes in the rotator cuff, such as: General thinning, fraying, and tearing of the tendon. Joint looseness and muscle imbalance in the shoulder. This can damage tissue. Repeated activities, especially forceful overhead motions, are common in certain sports or occupations, including throwing a baseball, the overhead swing in tennis, swimming, lifting, or painting. These motions can eventually lead to tendons scraping against bone (). This may occur with or be closely related to repetitive activities. Normal motions made often over a long period can stress or injure rotator cuff tissues. Athletes, including young people, may get tendinitis from overuse in throwing, swimming, and racquet sports. It takes tremendous force to tear a healthy rotator cuff tendon. This may happen while you are playing sports or during an accident or a severe fall. In older, less active adults, even simple movements such as lifting a suitcase can cause a . Things that may increase the risk of rotator cuff disorders include: Holding or moving your arm overhead frequently, such as when you regularly paint; work as a waiter; or play tennis, baseball, and other throwing sports. Previous shoulder injuries, such as dislocations and broken bones. Irregularities of the muscles, tendons, and bones in the shoulder that increase wear on the rotator cuff tendons. Having received multiple injections in the shoulder, which may weaken tendons and increase your risk. Smoking, which decreases the blood supply and slows the healing process. As the rotator cuff and the shoulder weaken, the risk for a partial or increases. if shoulder or arm pain occurs with chest pain or other , such as shortness of breath and nausea. if you have an injury to your shoulder and: You have signs of damage to the nerves or blood vessels, such as numbness; tingling; a ""pins-and-needles"" sensation below the injury; or pale, cold, or bluish skin. You have had a shoulder problem in the past and you have shoulder pain. Watchful waiting is a period of time during which you and your doctor observe your symptoms or condition without using medical treatment. A watchful waiting period may vary from a few days to weeks or possibly months. Watchful waiting is not appropriate if: The skin around your shoulder is pale, cold, or bluish. Health professionals who can diagnose and manage rotator cuff disorders include: Primary care health professionals who are familiar with shoulder injuries. These include: (for severe symptoms or injury). For treatment, you may be referred to a specialist, such as: To diagnose a rotator cuff disorder, your doctor will ask about your injury or shoulder pain history and will do a physical exam to see how your shoulder is working. If your symptoms and exam show that you may have a complete rotator cuff tear, you may have one or more of these tests to confirm the diagnosis: Your age, job, and activity level are considered when your doctor is deciding about further testing. For example, if you are a competitive athlete or have a job that requires frequent overhead activity, you may need further testing sooner than a relatively inactive older adult. A more complete diagnosis is important if you are likely to continue activities that may further damage your shoulder. Treatment of rotator cuff disorders should begin soon after an injury or soon after symptoms develop, to give you the best chance of restoring flexibility and strength to your shoulder. Without treatment, inflammation and tears can build up, causing pain, weakness, and loss of function. Treatment depends on your symptoms, age, and activity level, and on whether your symptoms appear to be related to a rotator cuff injury. Most rotator cuff disorders are treated without surgery. Your treatment may include: Home treatment, such as rest and applying cold or heat. For more information, see . . For more information, see . If symptoms don't improve after a few months of nonsurgical treatment, you and your doctor may consider testing (such as X-rays or an MRI) to find out if you have a rotator cuff tear. Or your doctor may give you a corticosteroid shot. Surgery often is used to repair a torn rotator cuff in a healthy young person, because good results are more likely if there is little or no evidence of degeneration or . People who have advanced rotator cuff disorders and tendons that are tough, stringy (fibrous), and stiff usually respond less well to surgery. Surgery may successfully repair the tear, but it can't repair all the damage caused by age or degeneration. You have a rotator cuff tear caused by a sudden injury. Your shoulder doesn't get better after 3 to 6 months of other treatment. Recovery from a rotator cuff disorder varies with each person. Your physical therapy and home exercise program should continue until your shoulder is as strong and flexible as possible. Some treatments for rotator cuff disorders can last up to a year. Most people can return to their previous activities after several weeks of rehabilitation. Experts have differing opinions about treating rotator cuff tears. Some prefer nonsurgical treatment for people older than 60. But other experts believe that the sooner a rotator cuff tear is surgically repaired, the better the chance of a successful outcome, regardless of age. Some believe that small tears do not need surgery. Other experts feel that small tears should be repaired early to prevent further tearing. The long-term changes that occur in and around the shoulder joint because of everyday wear and tear cannot be totally prevented. But you may be able to prevent some rotator cuff problems if you: Keep the muscles in your shoulders flexible and strong. Daily exercises to maintain strength and flexibility may be the best defense against rotator cuff disorders. Have good posture at all times. Stand straight and relaxed, without slumping. Don't lift objects that are too heavy for you—especially over your head. Avoid sports or other activities where forceful contact or falls are likely or common. Don't keep your arms out to the side or raised over your head for long periods of time, such as when painting a ceiling. If you must do these activities: Take frequent breaks, and ice your shoulder several times a day and at night. Take a to relieve any swelling and pain in the tissues that are being pinched. Be safe with medicines. on the label. Ask your doctor if it would be helpful to take an anti-inflammatory medicine before activities that may stress your shoulder. Home treatment is often the first treatment for a rotator cuff problem. Treatment can help relieve the discomfort and keep the problem from getting worse. although gentle movement of the shoulder is recommended. Limit repetitive movement, and avoid strenuous activity and activities where your arms move above your head. Be sure to follow your doctor's advice on how long to limit movement. Most people don't rest long enough. The rest period for a rotator cuff disorder may be a couple of days to several weeks. During rest: Avoid putting your arm in a sling. It is important that you don't keep your shoulder completely still (immobilized), because it can cause the joint to stiffen or can even lead to . Move your arm carefully through its full several times a day. Progress slowly to avoid injury. Avoid activities or positions that cause discomfort, such as playing golf or tennis or carrying heavy bags of groceries. Stop any activity that hurts your shoulder. () such as ibuprofen or naproxen to relieve pain. NSAIDs come in pills and in a cream that you rub over the sore area. Be safe with medicines. on the label. People respond to heat and ice differently. Use whichever one makes you feel better. In some cases, heat feels good for a while but may make pain and stiffness worse after 1 to 2 hours. For a sudden injury, don't use heat for the first 48 hours. ice helps relieve pain and reduce swelling. Try applying ice to your shoulder for the first 48 hours after discomfort begins: To avoid harming your skin, place a thin towel between the ice pack and your body, or put a pillowcase over the ice pack. Apply ice 2 or 3 times a day, up to 20 minutes at a time. Apply an ice pack after exercising your shoulder, to help prevent swelling. start moving your shoulder with the aid of moist heat: Soak a towel in hot water, and wring it out. Fold the towel to about square. While holding the towel on your shoulder, relax your shoulder, lean forward so your arm hangs freely, and gently swing your arm back and forth like a pendulum. You also can do this exercise standing under a warm shower. Heat relaxes your muscles and tendons by increasing blood flow to them. When combined with gentle motion, heat can ease inflammation. Repeat these steps 2 or 3 times a day to reduce the risk of permanent stiffness in the joint. Eventually, your doctor may want you to do more to stretch and strengthen your shoulder. For exercises you can do at home (with your doctor's approval), see: Rotator Cuff Problems: Exercises You Can Do at Home. Medicines don't heal rotator cuff disorders. They help with pain and . This allows you to start exercises to stretch and gradually strengthen the shoulder, which reduces the risk of stiffness or a . (NSAIDs). These are the most common medicines used to help manage rotator cuff disorders. NSAIDs are available with or without a prescription. NSAIDs come in pills and in a cream that you rub over the sore area. Or you can use . . These are strong medicines that are usually given only after 3 to 4 weeks of other treatment. If the first shot doesn't help much, a second shot may be given to make sure that the first shot was given in the right place. But there is rarely a need for more than a few shots. Be safe with medicines. on the label. You have severe pain and loss of shoulder function that haven't responded to other treatment. You have shoulder weakness caused by a complete tear, especially when the rotator cuff is otherwise healthy. Surgery typically is used to repair a torn rotator cuff in a healthy young person, because good results are more likely if there is little or no evidence of other problems. People who have advanced rotator cuff disorders and tendons that are tough, stringy (fibrous), and stiff usually respond less well to surgery. Surgery may successfully repair the tear, but it can't repair all the damage caused by age or degeneration. If surgery isn't done right away, repair of a large tear may not be as successful. But it still usually relieves pain and restores enough strength for you to do routine, nonstrenuous activities. After surgery, a program of physical rehabilitation (rehab) is very important. You may not do as well after surgery if you aren't willing or able to commit to completing a challenging physical rehab program. Shoulder surgery for rotator cuff disorders usually involves one or more of the following: These procedures may be done , by traditional open surgery, or by a combination of the two approaches. Sometimes a rotator cuff tear is so severe that it can't be fixed in the usual ways. If this happens in a younger person, the doctor may suggest moving another tendon to substitute for the torn tendon. In an older person, the doctor may suggest a special shoulder replacement. The success of surgery for rotator cuff tears depends on many things, such as: Other medical conditions. Some may cause you to heal slower. Your recovery goals and commitment to and compliance with a physical rehabilitation program. Whether you smoke. Smoking decreases the blood supply throughout the body and slows the healing process. A physical therapy and rehabilitation (rehab) program usually involves exercises to stretch and gradually strengthen the shoulder. Some physical therapists may use other techniques, such as massage or ultrasound, to relieve pain and reduce muscle spasms. This program of treatment may be used without surgery or as part of recovery after surgery. It can reduce pain in the soft tissues (such as the muscles, ligaments, and tendons), improve function, and build muscle strength. Impatience during the long periods of rest needed to let your shoulder heal. Athletes and people whose jobs depend upon the use of their arms may find it hard to be patient with this stage of treatment. Although completing a rehab program may be hard, a successful outcome after surgery depends on your commitment to treatment. If you follow your physical therapy plan closely and get help when you need it, you are more likely to restore shoulder strength and movement. These are often the most important part of physical therapy for rotator cuff disorders, especially when stiffness is a major symptom. Stretching includes exercises. In general, you won't start these exercises until your rotator cuff has healed and is able to perform the stretching and range-of-motion exercises comfortably. Strengthening exercises can help you build and keep shoulder function and stability. Rotator Cuff Problems: Exercises You Can Do at Home (with your doctor's approval) Experts are studying a new treatment for chronic calcifying tendinitis of the rotator cuff. The treatment uses sound waves to create shock waves that destroy calcium deposits in the rotator cuff tendons. This is called extracorporeal shock wave therapy. Some studies show pain relief and increased range of motion. But more studies are needed to see whether these results can be duplicated and to measure long-term results.

For patients whose procedures have not yet been rescheduled:  What to Do If Your Orthopaedic Surgery Is Postponed. The following article provides in-depth information about surgical treatment for rotator cuff injuries, and is a continuation of the article ""Rotator Cuff Tears."" For a good introduction to the topic of rotator cuff injuries, please refer to . Surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff most often involves re-attaching the tendon to the head of humerus (upper arm bone). A partial tear, however, may need only a trimming or smoothing procedure called a debridement. A complete tear is repaired by stitching the tendon back to its original site on the humerus. The rotator cuff tendons cover the head of the humerus (upper arm bone), helping you to raise and rotate your arm. Your doctor may offer surgery as an option for a torn rotator cuff if your pain does not improve with nonsurgical methods. Continued pain is the main indication for surgery. If you are very active and use your arms for overhead work or sports, your doctor may also suggest surgery. Other signs that surgery may be a good option for you include: You have a large tear (more than 3 cm) and the quality of the surrounding tendon tissue is good You have significant weakness and loss of function in your shoulder Front (left) and overhead (right) views of the tendons that form the rotator cuff. The blue arrows indicate a full-thickness tear in the supraspinatus tendon, the most common location for rotator cuff tears. There are a few options for repairing rotator cuff tears. Advancements in surgical techniques for rotator cuff repair include less invasive procedures. While each of the methods available has its own advantages and disadvantages, all have the same goal: getting the tendon to heal. The type of repair performed depends on several factors, including your surgeon's experience and familiarity with a particular procedure, the size of your tear, your anatomy, and the quality of the tendon tissue and bone. Many surgical repairs can be done on an outpatient basis and do not require you to stay overnight in the hospital. Your orthopaedic surgeon will discuss with you the best procedure to meet your individual health needs. You may have other shoulder problems in addition to a rotator cuff tear, such as biceps tendon tears, osteoarthritis, bone spurs, or other soft tissue tears. During the operation, your surgeon may be able to take care of these problems, as well. The three techniques most commonly used for rotator cuff repair include traditional open repair, arthroscopic repair, and mini-open repair. In the end, patients rate all three repair methods the same for pain relief, strength improvement, and overall satisfaction. A traditional open surgical incision (several centimeters long) is often required if the tear is large or complex. The surgeon makes the incision over the shoulder and detaches one of the shoulder muscles (deltoid) to better see and gain access to the torn tendon. During an open repair, the surgeon typically removes bone spurs from the underside of the acromion (this procedure is called an acromioplasty). An open repair may be a good option if the tear is large or complex or if additional reconstruction, such as a tendon transfer, is indicated. Open repair was the first technique used for torn rotator cuffs. Over the years, new technology and improved surgeon experience has led to less invasive procedures. During arthroscopy, your surgeon inserts a small camera, called an arthroscope, into your shoulder joint. The camera displays pictures on a television screen, and your surgeon uses these images to guide miniature surgical instruments. During athroscopy, your surgeon can see the structures of your shoulder in great detail on a video monitor. Because the arthroscope and surgical instruments are thin, your surgeon can use very small incisions (cuts), rather than the larger incision needed for standard, open surgery. Illustration and photo show an arthroscope and surgical instruments inserted through portals in a shoulder joint. All-arthroscopic repair is usually an outpatient procedure and is the least invasive method to repair a torn rotator cuff.  Arthroscopic view of a healthy shoulder joint. In this image of a rotator cuff tear, a large gap can be seen between the edge of the rotator cuff tendon and the humeral head. The same rotator cuff tear, as seen from above the tendon. The rotator cuff tendon has been re-attached to the greater tuberosity of the humeral head with sutures. The mini-open repair uses newer technology and instruments to perform a repair through a small incision. The incision is typically 3 to 5 cm long. This technique uses arthroscopy to assess and treat damage to other structures within the joint. Bone spurs, for example, are often removed arthroscopically. This avoids the need to detach the deltoid muscle. Once the arthroscopic portion of the procedure is completed, the surgeon repairs the rotator cuff through the mini-open incision. During the tendon repair, the surgeon views the shoulder structures directly, rather than through the video monitor. After surgery, you will feel pain. This is a natural part of the healing process. Your doctor and nurses will work to reduce your pain, which can help you recover from surgery faster. Medications are often prescribed for short-term pain relief after surgery. Many types of medicines are available to help manage pain, including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and local anesthetics. Your doctor may use a combination of these medications to improve pain relief, as well as minimize the need for opioids. Be aware that although opioids help relieve pain after surgery, they are a narcotic and can be addictive. Opioid dependency and overdose has become a critical public health issue. It is important to use opioids only as directed by your doctor. As soon as your pain begins to improve, stop taking opioids. Talk to your doctor if your pain has not begun to improve within a few weeks after your surgery. Rehabilitation plays a vital role in getting you back to your daily activities. A physical therapy program will help you regain shoulder strength and motion. After surgery, therapy progresses in stages. At first, the repair needs to be protected while the tendon heals. To keep your arm from moving, you will most likely use a sling and avoid using your arm for the first 4 to 6 weeks. How long you require a sling depends upon the severity of your injury. Active exercise during rehabilitation may include isometic external rotation exercises, such as the one shown here. Even though your tear has been repaired, the muscles around your arm remain weak. Once your surgeon decides it is safe for you to move your arm and shoulder, a therapist will help you with passive exercises to improve range of motion in your shoulder. With passive exercise, your therapist supports your arm and moves it in different positions. In most cases, passive exercise is begun within the first 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. After 4 to 6 weeks, you will progress to doing active exercises without the help of your therapist. Moving your muscles on your own will gradually increase your strength and improve your arm control. At 8 to 12 weeks, your therapist will start you on a strengthening exercise program. Expect a complete recovery to take several months. Most patients have a functional range of motion and adequate strength by 4 to 6 months after surgery. Although it is a slow process, your commitment to rehabilitation is key to a successful outcome. Rotator Cuff and Shoulder Rehabilitation Exercises The majority of patients report improved shoulder strength and less pain after surgery for a torn rotator cuff. Each surgical repair technique (open, mini-open, and arthroscopic) has similar results in terms of pain relief, improvement in strength and function, and patient satisfaction. Surgeon expertise is more important in achieving satisfactory results than the choice of technique. Factors that can decrease the likelihood of a satisfactory result include: Poor patient compliance with rehabilitation and restrictions after surgery After rotator cuff surgery, a small percentage of patients experience complications. In addition to the risks of surgery in general, such as blood loss or problems related to anesthesia, complications of rotator cuff surgery may include: This typically involves the nerve that activates your shoulder muscle (deltoid). Patients are given antibiotics during the procedure to lessen the risk for infection. If an infection develops, an additional surgery or prolonged antibiotic treatment may be needed. During an open repair, this shoulder muscle is detached to provide better access to the rotator cuff. It is stitched back into place at the end of the procedure. It is very important to protect this area after surgery and during rehabilitation to allow it to heal. Early rehabilitation lessens the likelihood of permanent stiffness or loss of motion. Most of the time, stiffness will improve with more aggressive therapy and exercise. There is a chance for re-tear following all types of repairs. The larger the tear, the higher the risk of re-tear. Patients who re-tear their tendons usually do not have greater pain or decreased shoulder function. Repeat surgery is needed only if there is severe pain or loss of function.

1ec800b8-0725-4050-803f-c6e4b9384ba2,"from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Rotator Cuff and Shoulder Rehabilitation Exercises Tendons attach muscles to bones. Your biceps tendons attach the biceps muscle to bones in the shoulder and in the elbow. If you tear the biceps tendon at the shoulder, you may lose some strength in your arm and have pain when you forcefully turn your arm from palm down to palm up. Many people can still function with a biceps tendon tear, and only need simple treatments to relieve symptoms. If symptoms cannot be relieved by nonsurgical treatments, or if a patient requires complete recovery of strength, surgery to repair the torn tendor may be required. Your shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint made up of three bones: your upper arm bone (humerus), your shoulder blade (scapula), and your collarbone (clavicle). There are two attachments of the biceps tendon at the shoulder joint. The head of your upper arm bone fits into a rounded socket in your shoulder blade. This socket is called the glenoid. A combination of muscles and tendons keeps your arm bone centered in your shoulder socket. These tissues are called the rotator cuff. They cover the head of your upper arm bone and attach it to your shoulder blade. The upper end of the biceps muscle has two tendons that attach it to bones in the shoulder. The long head attaches to the top of the shoulder socket (glenoid). The short head attaches to a bump on the shoulder blade called the coracoid process. Biceps tendon tears can be either partial or complete. Many tears do not completely sever the tendon. A complete tear will split the tendon into two pieces. In many cases, torn tendons begin by fraying. As the damage progresses, the tendon can completely tear, sometimes when lifting a heavy object. Illustration shows a complete tear of the long head at its attachment point in the glenoid. The long head of the biceps tendon is more likely to be injured. This is because it is vulnerable as it travels through the shoulder joint to its attachment point in the socket. Fortunately, the biceps has two attachments at the shoulder. The short head of the biceps rarely tears. Because of this second attachment, many people can still use their biceps even after a complete tear of the long head. When you tear your biceps tendon, you can also damage other parts of your shoulder, such as the rotator cuff tendons. There are two main causes of biceps tendon tears: injury and overuse. If you fall hard on an outstretched arm or lift something too heavy, you can tear your biceps tendon. Many tears are the result of a wearing down and fraying of the tendon that occurs slowly over time. This naturally occurs as we age. It can be worsened by overuse - repeating the same shoulder motions again and again. Overuse can cause a range of shoulder problems, including tendinitis, shoulder impingement, and rotator cuff injuries. Having any of these conditions puts more stress on the biceps tendon, making it more likely to weaken or tear. Older people have put more years of wear and tear on their tendons than younger people. Too much load during weightlifting is a prime example of this risk, but many jobs require heavy overhead lifting and put excess wear and tear on the tendons. Repetitive overhead sports, such as swimming or tennis, can cause more tendon wear and tear. Nicotine use can affect nutrition in the tendon. Using corticosteroids has been linked to increased muscle and tendon weakness. Cramping of the biceps muscle with strenuous use of the arm Bruising from the middle of the upper arm down toward the elbow Because a torn tendon can no longer keep the biceps muscle tight, a bulge in the upper arm above the elbow (""Popeye Muscle"") may appear, with a dent closer to the shoulder. After discussing your symptoms and medical history, your doctor will examine your shoulder. The diagnosis is often obvious for complete ruptures because of the deformity of the arm muscle (""Popeye Muscle""). A biceps tendon tear is made more obvious by contracting the muscle (""Popeye Muscle""). Partial ruptures are less obvious. To diagnose a partial tear, your doctor may ask you to bend your arm and tighten the biceps muscle. Pain when you use your biceps muscle may mean there is a partial tear. It is also very important that your doctor identify any other shoulder problems when planning your treatment. The biceps can also tear near the elbow, although this is less common. A tear near the elbow will cause a ""gap"" in the front of the elbow. Your doctor will check your arm for damage to this area. In addition, rotator cuff injuries, impingement, and tendinitis are some conditions that may accompany a biceps tendon tear. Your doctor may order additional tests to help identify other problems in your shoulder. Although x-rays cannot show soft tissues like the biceps tendon, they can be useful in ruling out other problems that can cause shoulder and elbow pain. These scans create better images of soft tissues. They can show both partial and complete tears. Rotator Cuff and Shoulder Rehabilitation Exercises For many people, pain from a long head of biceps tendon tear resolves over time. Mild arm weakness or arm deformity may not bother some patients, such as older and less active people. In addition, if you have not damaged a more critical structure, such as the rotator cuff, nonsurgical treatment is a reasonable option. This can include: Apply cold packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day to keep down swelling. Do not apply ice directly to the skin. Drugs like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen reduce pain and swelling. Avoid heavy lifting and overhead activities to relieve pain and limit swelling. Your doctor may recommend using a sling for a brief time. Flexibility and strengthening exercises will restore movement and strengthen your shoulder. Surgical treatment for a long head of the biceps tendon tear is rarely needed. However, some patients who develop cramping of the muscle or pain, or who require complete recovery of strength, such as athletes or manual laborers, may require surgery. Surgery may also be the right option for those with partial tears whose symptoms are not relieved with nonsurgical treatment. Several new procedures have been developed that repair the tendon with minimal incisions. The goal of the surgery is to re-anchor the torn tendon back to the bone. Your doctor will discuss with you the options that are best for your specific case. Complications with this surgery are rare. Re-rupture of the repaired tendon is uncommon. After surgery, your shoulder may be immobilized temporarily with a sling. Your doctor will soon start you on therapeutic exercises. Flexibility exercises will improve range of motion in your shoulder. Exercises to strengthen your shoulder will gradually be added to your rehabilitation plan. Be sure to follow your doctor's treatment plan. Although it is a slow process, your commitment to physical therapy is the most important factor in returning to all the activities you enjoy. Successful surgery can correct muscle deformity and return your arm's strength and function to nearly normal.

570d4ced-a34a-4f81-8d68-ce6991461718,"Rotator cuff injuries are very common, affecting over 3 million people in the United States every year. Most people with rotator cuff injuries can recover with rest and physical therapy. However, more serious injuries, such as complete rotator cuff tears, may require surgical repair. When should I see a doctor for a rotator cuff tear? The rotator cuff of the shoulder is made up of four muscles. Tendons of these muscles come together to form a covering around the head of the upper arm bone (humerus) and top of the shoulder. The rotator cuff muscles are important stabilizers and movers of the shoulder joint. As the name implies, the rotator cuff functions to allow you to rotate your shoulder and lift your arm. Diagram of the shoulder, including the location of the rotator cuff Common rotator cuff injuries include rotator cuff and rotator cuff strain, which is a partial or complete tear of the rotator cuff. Rotator cuff tendonitis is inflammation or irritation in the tendons and cuff muscles that help move your shoulder joint. This injury typically occurs over time, usually as a result of keeping your shoulder in a single position for a prolonged period (such as sleeping on your shoulder every night), by overhead work-related activities, or athletic activities such as , baseball, cricket or jai alai. A rotator cuff tear may be partial or complete. A partial tear is when one of the tendons of the rotator cuff is frayed or damaged. A complete tear (also called a full-thickness tear) is when the tendon in is severed in half or pulled completely off of the bone. Rotator cuff tears often occur over time from prolonged wear and tear. However, the rotator cuff may also be acutely injured by trauma involving a fall on the arm and shoulder or from heavy lifting. (It is common among weightlifters.) A injury may also cause a torn rotator cuff. Rotator cuff tendonitis is the inflammation or irritation of the tendons and muscles in the shoulder joint. Symptoms of rotator cuff tendonitis typically get worse over time. These symptoms may include: Symptoms of a partial or complete torn rotator cuff may include: pain in the front and/or down the outside of the shoulder feeling pain when the arm is moved in certain ways A doctor will first take the patient’s medical history and perform a physical examination to: test the range of motion and, possibly, the strength of the shoulder joint If a tear is suspected, an and/or may be ordered. When diagnosing a shoulder cuff injury, a doctor will also rule out conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as a compressed (called a ""pinched nerve"") or . The treatment for rotator cuff tendonitis includes first reducing swelling and inflammation then strengthening muscles and improving range of motion. Treatments may include: All of the above treatments are usually followed by supervised to regain shoulder motion and strength. Mild rotator cuff tears may be treated nonsurgically with anti-inflammatory medication, steroid injections and/or physical therapy. However, for more severe tears or for active individuals who engage in sports or overhead work, surgery is often recommended. A partial or complete tear of the rotator cuff tendon is generally repaired by . Open surgery (using a larger incision) may be necessary for large, complicated full tears of the rotator cuff. How long does it take to recover from a rotator cuff injury? The minimum recovery time for rotator cuff tendonitis is generally two to four weeks. Left untreated, rotator cuff tendonitis can worsen and may lead to a partial or complete rotator cuff tear. Symptoms of a partial or complete rotator cuff tear can last from several weeks up to several months depending on the severity of the injury and the treatment plan. When should I see a doctor for a rotator cuff tear? You should see an orthopedic surgeon or sports medicine doctor if pain from a rotator cuff injury is affecting your daily life, waking you up from sleep or reducing your range of motion. Make an appointment to see a doctor if: Your shoulder hurts when you do the same activity over and over. Shoulder pain is accompanied by swelling, redness, or tenderness around the joint.

02796c6c-bf27-40e8-927c-1c59fa919f03,"A Guide to Injury Prevention for Olympic Weightlifters listed in , originally published in Republished with permission from  As a dedicated Olympic athlete, nothing is more disruptive than a threatening injury. An injury, more often than not, can set your progress back substantially and evaporate all of your hard work. However, this depends on the nature of the injury. That being said there are exercises that you may have overlooked within your current exercise program. You could (or should) integrate more effective but safer workouts into your routines so you can minimize the probability of injuries. Having a very active lifestyle does often result in wear and tear. This is the primary burden of practicing Olympic weightlifting. It comes with the territory and while it seems unavoidable, we believe that we can help. All injuries fall into one of two categories, traumatic and cumulative are generally derived from repetitive wear and tear. A cumulative injury can be vastly amplified and it is more likely to continuously re-occur if your form is poor when performing exercises in the wrong posture. A cumulative injury is common among weightlifters. Someone who practises Olympic weightlifting most often strains when performing a snap or clean and jerk. These strains can cause damage to the muscle tissue of an individual. Due to the nature of a tear, weakened tissue can be torn again, this time much easier. This is why Olympic weightlifters often gain cumulative injuries; can also occur. People who practise Olympic weightlifting actually perform exercise that applies pressure on to the shoulders of their skeleton. This is why high intensity exercise or movement practised by Olympic weightlifters increase the probability of shoulder dislocation. Obviously, Olympic weightlifting is a dangerous sport because it requires great amount of exerted force from an athlete. Without correct form and posture, activities can often result in the occurrence of traumatic injuries. Cumulative injuries are far common for Olympic weightlifters. They occur more often than traumatic injuries, which are far more common within contact sports such as Rugby. The repetitive nature of Olympic weightlifting is what causes these injuries. This is why we have addressed the two most common injuries. We intentionally developed this article with additional depth and evaluation so you can minimize damage while practising a variety of exercises. Before we begin, I must emphasize the fact that not enough empirical evidence has been conducted to categorically identify injury prevention methods for a sport as new as Olympic weightlifting, especially in contrast to alternative sports and activities. For example, for a sport like long distance running there has been extensive research conducted by sport scientists who have successfully identified injury prevention exercises while also gathering substantial evidence that reinforces the need for injury prevention methods in not only long distance running, but all physical exercise. We can only conjecture a methodology for Olympic weightlifting based on a propensity for logic as well as an emulation of conventional principles from similar sports. By doing this we can deduce methodologies that will reduce the possibility of injury and prosper practitioners of Olympic weightlifters. A study conducted by the by reinforces this notion. They agree that limited research is endangering Olympic weightlifters careers and physiology. Within their study they conclude that “Since little has been studied regarding possible risk factors to injuries, further research is therefore warranted to explain why athletes get injured and how to prevent injuries.”While Asa and Syartholm’s conclusion is warranted, there has been progress within the field injury prevention. A substantial enquiry about the injuries incurred by a Olympic weightlifters was published by Calhoun (1999). ‘Injury rates and profiles of elite competitive weightlifters’ is a study that collected and analysed medical injury records of resident athletes also during numerous training camps to generate an injury profile. The study concludes, “The injuries typical to elite weightlifters are primarily overuse injuries, not traumatic injuries compromising joint integrity. These injury patterns and rates are similar to those reported for other sports and activities”. Not only does the study reference the probability of an Olympic weightlifter contracting a cumulative injury, it also highlights the points of weakness. These points of weakness include the knees, shoulders and lower back. During Calhoun’s study he deduced that for every 1000 minutes of physical engagement, a Olympic weightlifter will suffer an average of 3.30 lower back injuries. The physical strain brought about by posture, pressure and regiment of Olympic weightlifting is problematic. This is why we have devised a guide of injury prevention exercises that will not only minimize the chances of injury for Olympic weightlifters, but also maximize performance during training and eventual competition. During this article we will provide injury prevention exercises that can prevent the three of the most common injuries that Olympic weightlifters encounter. These include: PPS (Patellofemoral pain syndrome) within the knee; Due to the mature of Olympic weightlifting these injuries occur often. However, follow these injury prevention exercise guides to minimize the threat of injury and carry on practizing your passion. Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PPS) occurs over a long period of time and it is your atypical injury incurred by an Olympic weightlifter. Olympic weightlifting involves a variety of pressuring movements such as squats, jerks and snatches. All of these movements place a huge amount of pressure on the kneecap. The kneecap’s scientific name is the patella. The patella is a small flat triangular bone that is embedded in a tendon in the front of the knee. It slides along a groove across the front of the femur (thigh bone). It acts as a protective casing that protects the knee joint but it also adds leverage to the tendon by increasing its angle. This can be damaged when subjected to large amounts of pressure that can be exerted by incorrect positioning or involuntary movement. Practising Olympic weightlifting via an improper mannerism can onset PPS. Early symptoms usually start with a minor ache when moving. It can then develop into a hindrance for even the most basic of everyday tasks, that are completely non-weight bearing. PPS can also be caused by pre-determined weaknesses in the inner quadriceps as well as a lack of muscular stability within your hip flexors. Now that we understand the anatomical arrangement of the patella and how Olympic weightlifting can certainly damage it, we will explain how to prevent such injuries. Firstly, ensure that you have the appropriate footwear before practising Olympic weightlifting. This should go without saying. Always consult a doctor if you begin to experience knee pain, they are a leading authority in physically therapy and they can correctly diagnose you. There are many knee related injuries and treatment varies depending on the type of injury that you have sustained, do not presume it is PPS. By incorporating a range of valuable stretches and strength exercise into your normal day-to-day gym routine, you will undoubtedly prevent the onset of injury in both a minor and major way. Incorporating these exercises also have many physical benefits that will also optimize your performance. Muscles work in synchronization with their muscle groups. Therefore, any patella orientated stretches will directly correlate with the rest of your leg muscles and make you limber in your performance. Some of the exercises below would be ideal for Olympic weightlifters to practice. They will certainly prove beneficial: Isometric exercises are a type of strength training in which the joint angle in muscle and muscle length does not change during contraction. One isometric exercise that stretches the quadriceps while building isometric strength and endurance in the legs muscle group surrounding the patella is a wall sit. To perform an effective wall sit you should follow these instructions; Start with your back against a wall with your feet apart at shoulder width. Your feet should be in front of the wall by a short distance of two feet (If you are feeling any pain use a medicine ball as a make weight); Slowly slide your back down the wall till your thighs are parallel with the ground; Adjust the placement of your feet so your knees are vertically parallel with your ankles. Measure the position of your knees by making sure they are not poking over the top of your toes; Moreover, make sure that your back is positioned properly. It should be flat against the wall; Hold this position for 30 seconds. Afterwards, rest 30 seconds and repeat the exercise three times over; Increase the duration of your hold by 5 seconds each time to stimulate your quadriceps. This will increase their strength and provide a secure scaffold to your patella. The wall sit is a great isometric exercise because it directly addresses a direct cause of PPS. By strengthening the muscle groups within your leg you are less likely to gain an injury on your knee. It also benefits your performance by increasing the strength and explosiveness of your quadriceps that are instrumental in moves such as the clean and jerk. Finally, the wall sit is easy to practise and requires minimal resources. If you are experiencing pain, make sure to use a medicine ball and know your limits. An adductor stretch targets the group of muscles that reside on the inside of the thigh. The groin is just one of these muscles. These muscles work to pull the thigh inward while also stabilizing your pelvis. By doing this you will be able to withstand more pressure on your lower skeleton while subtracting the amount of tension exerted on your knees during lifting. This will certainly minimize your chances of injury while also making your more confident in your performances. A very effective adductor exercise is the side lying stretch. Here are some instructions to complete an effective and safe side lying stretch.  Start by placing yourself in a comfortable position. Use a yoga mat to ensure you are completely comfortable. This will enable you to focus on perfecting your stretch; Start of by lying on your right hand side and bend your right knee so your torso is stabilised and you have balance; Rest your head on your right hand. Lift your leg upward. Once your leg is elevated you can hold it in position. You can either hold your knee. However, if you want to maximize your stretch you should hold your foot. Straighten your leg and hold for 20 seconds. This will stimulate the muscles around your pelvis as well as the adductor muscles; Swap sides and repeat again. If you want to maximize your workouts increase the time that you hold your straight leg by 10 seconds. While it is not comparable in practice to isometric stretches, it is comparative in its effectiveness when preventing PPS injuries. An adductor stretch is an injury prevention exercise for Olympic weightlifters because it stabilizes and strengthens your pelvis and other leg muscles. By securing these points, you will be able to minimize the amount of pressure placed other parts of your legs like the patella. The Iliotibial Band (ITB) is a thick band of fibrous tissue that runs down the outside of your leg from your pelvis to the knee. Buttock and hip muscles are also attached to it. The ITB dictates how your hip and buttock muscles move. It also helps stabilize the bones within your knees including your patella bone. It is essential as an Olympic weightlifter to practise Iliotibial band exercises. The tightening of the ITB can make subtle changes to the way the knee moves, resulting in knee pain. This can often lead to maltracking that disables the kneecap from providing leverage. This will most certainly hinder Olympic weightlifting progress. A very effective ITB exercise is a clamshell. Here is the correct way to complete a clamshell exercise. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on your mat; Place a pillow between your knees and lengthen your spine; Exhale as you engage your inner thighs while squeezing the pillow; Inhale as you release the pressure without letting the pillow drop through your legs; Make sure that your tailbone stays towards the mat by keeping your spine long; Perform 10 squeezes. Make sure that your pelvis is steady and engage your inner thighs by removing the pillow. As you can surmise, this exercise does not directly target the Iliotibial band. Instead it is an  injury prevention exercise that is designed to strengthen the pelvis. Your pelvic region connects the spine to the lower limbs. It is a bridge and it has to be secure. As an Olympic weightlifter you need to ensure that you are strong from the very top to the bottom of your posture. Without a strong skeleton you are likely to gain an abrupt injury in your lower limbs. Glute stretches are also very important for Olympic weightlifters because they help improve flexibility, relieve back and knee pain while also preventing substantial injuries on these areas. Tightness in your glutes can often be a factor in knee pain because it can cause uneven weight distribution on your knees. Just by performing a few glute stretches each morning and night, you will ironing the creases of your glute muscles and relieving pressure from the patella. Follow these instructions to correctly loosen your glute muscles of any excess stiffness.  Sit in a chain and cross one leg so that your foot rests on the opposite knee; Gently lean forward until a stretch is felt in the buttock of the crossed leg. Hold this for 30 seconds; Repeat 3 times, twice a day before and after a exercise; Once you feel comfortable, push down on your knee to increase the glutes stretch; Progress further by leaning away from the side you are stretching. As you can see, it is very easy to complete this exercise. You need a limited amount of resources, time and effort. In all honesty, you will be reciprocated 10 fold. You will be preventing possible injuries while also limbering your glutes. It is also a time to relax and reflect on your progress and training. Whether you are an Olympic weightlifter or not, you will benefit from retrospection. Another exercise that is very similar to the previous exercise, the figure 4 glute stretch is a glute bridge. While it requires a lot more physical effort, it still stimulates the same muscle areas, the glutes. We already understand what how the glutes can minimize the risk of PPS. By performing a glute bridge you can also do the very same. Here is how to effectively perform a glute bridge. Lie face upwards, on the floor. Bend your knees and position your feet so that they are flat on the ground. Keep your arms at your side with your palms pressed to the floor as well; Lift your hips off the ground until your knees, hips and shoulders form a straight line; Squeeze your glutes hard and keep your abs drawn inwards so you do not over extend your back during the exercise; Hold your bridged position for a couple of seconds before easing your body back towards the mat. By doing this you are maximizing the strength of your glutes while also preventing any injuries to your patella. A glute bridge is also an effective bodyweight exercise. It will stimulate and strengthen your maximus, medius and minimus. These muscles have a large part in the practice of squats. As an Olympic weightlifter you will squatting under bars a lot. By strengthening your maximus, medius and minimus, you will increase the strength that you need to lift heavier weights in cleaner motion. In summary, to avoid PPS you need to distribute your weight accordingly. By using these stretching and strengthening exercises you can condition your body to share weight between points of pressure when weightlifting. You are addressing the issue before it becomes disruptive to your training. Another common injury among Olympic weightlifter is shoulder impingement pain. It is a condition where your shoulder rotator cuff tendons are intermittently compressed during shoulder movements. This can often cause injury to the shoulder tendons that results in painful shoulder movements. Impingement is often caused by impact of bone into rotator cuff tendon. Once the impact has occurred, the rotator cuff becomes inflamed and swollen. Your rotator cuff will be trapped or pinched under the acromion. This is because a rotator cuff tendon sits under the subacromial bursa (a lubrication sack). The subacromial bursa helps protect the tendons from touching the bone. It also provides enough moisture for the tendons to glide over the bone and not get trapped. Olympic weightlifters often exert a lot of pressure on their shoulders when completing movements such as the snatch. It would be wise to practise injury prevention exercises on your shoulders if you are doing any kind of weightlifting. Here are some exercises that will help to develop strong and flexible shoulders. However, the likelihood of contracting a shoulder issue as an Olympic weightlifter is very likely. It comes with the territory. If you do gain a shoulder impingement injury, here are some relief exercises that can nullify your pain. To easily recover from shoulder impingement pain you should practise a multitude of exercises that focus upon a range of motion. This range of motion should lubricate the subacromial bursa while also re-conditioning your rotator cuff to sharp movements. To complete this exercise you will need 3-5 lb weights or a household object that you can easily grasp. Gently rotate your arm in a circular motion while keeping your arm and shoulder relaxed; Rotate your shoulder cuff clockwise for 2-3 minutes; Then you should rotate your shoulder cuff counter clockwise for 2-3 minutes; Your shoulder should feel loosened. If not, repeat again. This exercise can also be completed in a household environment. All you need to complete this exercise is a bath towel. Place the hand of the effected shoulder at the lower end of the towel, behind your back; Pull your lower arm up your back by pulling up with your higher arm; This will naturally lift your lower hand and put a small amount of pressure on your effected arm; Hold this stretch for five seconds and then return to the starting position by pulling down your lower arm; Repeat 10 times and then make sure to switch arms. To compete this exercise you will need a weighted bar or even a household object like a broom. This makes it easier for you to treat injuries because they are cost efficient and simple to follow. A good posture consists of a tight core, upwards chest and downward shoulders; Make sure your shoulders are in line with your palms; Keep your arms perfectly straight and raise the bar up directly over your head; Hold this position for 5 seconds and then slowly bring it back down to your starting position. A lumbar spine injury is the most typical injury that is contracted by Olympic weightlifters. Earlier in this article, I shared a statistic from Calhoun’s paper, Injury rates and profiles of elite competitive weightlifters. The stat said that every 1000 minutes a personal trainer gains an average of 3.30 lower back injuries. This makes perfect sense. There is a lot of pressure exerted on the lower back on of an Olympic weightlifter. For this very reason, I have suggested many hip and glute strengthening exercises as blockades for other joint injuries. By strengthening your lower back you can reinforce your skeletal structure so it will withstand the force of heavy weights while also avoiding a lumbar spine injury. The lumbar spine is located in the lower back below the cervical and thoracic sections of the spine. This area of the spine consists of five vertebrae. These lumbar are numbered from L1 to L5. These vertebrae contain spinal cord tissue and nerves that control communication between the bran and legs. Without these nerves your body would not work in complete oscillation. As well as this, damage to the lumbar spinal cord subsequently affects the hips and groin area while also impacting the lower abdominals and flexions within an individual’s thighs, as well. To put it concisely, in extreme cases lumbar spine injuries have been known to immobilize athletes. As an Olympic weightlifter, you need the strength of your lower back and the mobility of your hips and legs. A lumbar spine injury can hinder all these important factors. Therefore, preventing a lumbar spine injury is of the upmost importance. I have gathered some exercises that will make sure you avoid such an instance. These exercises are better described as lumbar spine stabilization exercises. You can stabilize your frame by making it both stronger and more limber. Follow these exercises and you will be doing your body and sporting interest, a great service. Ways to Prevent Lumbar Spine Injury within the Lower Back This is a passive exercise that requires little effort. Start by lying on the floor with your knees bent and your feet on the floor; Proceed to slowly straighten either one of your legs; Make sure your heel is facing the ceiling while supporting the back of your thigh with both of your hands; Proceed to complete the exercise with your opposite leg; If you have any trouble straightening your leg, you should rest it against the wall to create a static position with a healthy amount of pressure. You may be wondering why a hamstring stretch can help any issues concerning the lumbar vertebrae in your spine. The explanation is fairly simplistic. Tightness in the hamstring or any upper leg muscles can lead to a limited range of motion in your pelvis. This can increase pressure across the lower back while also corrupting your posture. By stretching your hamstrings you can lengthen your muscles and avoid any stress on your lower back. This exercise requires an exercise ball and safe space to practise. An exercise ball bridge is considered an advanced stabilization exercise that utilizes an exercise ball so the individual can practice unconventional movements that remedy any abnormalities in the lower spine. Start by lying in the floor with both feet propped up an exercise ball; Find a neural spine position and hold it as you slowly tighten your buttock muscles; By tightening your buttock muscles you will lift your hips off the floor by 2 to 3 inches; Repeat this exercise till you feel a light burning sensation in your hips. Exercise ball treatment options are very effective because they are designed to help minimize lower back pain. They strengthen your core body muscles while stabilizing your spines. They are essentially balance exercises that inadvertently strengthen your back muscles. Believe it or not, aerobic exercise is a very effective way to re-condition your lower back. It is very useful to the maintenance of your lower back. By completing a rehabilitation course, primarily devised of aerobic exercises, you are less likely to experience lower back pain. Aerobic exercise also improves your functionality and this can be instrumental in the avoidance of lower back issues. One example of aerobic exercise that is very engaging is water therapy exercises. Practising aerobics within water provides effective conditioning while also minimizing stress on the lower back. This is due to the buoyancy of water counteracting gravity. This nullifies the usual compression on an individual’s spine. This makes a person ‘un-weighted’ within the water and an individual can become more mobile. It also makes exercises less painful which makes water aerobics the perfect physiotherapy. To reduce the lower back pain you must practise exercises that provide mobility to your hips. If you are already experiencing pain in your lower back, you should be fine due to your increased mobility. This is a conventional water aerobic exercise that will increase your mobility and strengthen your hips. If you struggle gaining balance, you can hold yourself against the side of the pool; Make sure to perform this exercise both sides with both legs. This exercise helps create strength in your lower back muscles. Start by reaching one of your arms to the front of your body; When returning your arm to the back of your body in a swift motion, pull the water back so you can feel its resistance; Repeat this exercise 10 to 15 times on both sides of your body. Both of these water aerobic exercises utilize the water’s resistance to both strengthen and stimulate either the hips or lower back muscles. By completing these exercises you are lowering the chances of gaining a lumber spine injury. Also, by strengthening your spine you are less likely to injure your lower limbs as well. By practising any of your exercises you are reinforcing your skeletal structure. Olympic weightlifters need a strong and stable form so they can lift with positive form and posture. This article is republished with permission from https://origympersonaltrainercourses.co.uk/blog/guide-injury-prevention-olympic-weightlifters/ Good general article and applicable suggestions to all sports. however the best ways to help prevent injuries in Olympic weightlifting and frequently overlooked is the training of assistance exercises. basically this means to progressively train the various compound movements involved in the complete lifts (i.e snatch/ clean and jerk).In fact this is as important to successful and progressive lifting as the execution of the two lifts themselves. All joints/muscles/connective tissues etc should be warmed prior to training and flexibility maintained and improved through stretching programmes such as PNF (proprioceptor neuromuscular facilitation).I was an Olympic weightlifting coach and fully qualified refereee with the BWLA (formally British amateur weightlifting association) for over 20 years and ran a centre of excellence, training and coaching over 40 olympic athletes, running seminars in sports performance, anatomy/physiology and sports nutrition. I hold powerlifting titles at County & regional level & hold an advanced Diploma instructor's certificate with the World amateur bodybuilding association (WABBA). There is no way to prevent traumatic injury in sport only to reduce the likelihood through thorough understanding of assistance exercise and mobility training.

31cd674d-38e6-47ef-9611-0f85a0b8f1de,"Medically reviewed by — — Our bodies adapt to the postures we spend the most time in If a typical day includes hunching over a desk or laptop for 8 to 12 hours a day and then couch-surfing for an hour or two in the evenings to watch “The Office,” you’re not alone. Americans are sitting an average of 13 hours a day, according to conducted in 2013. Add those hours up, and it’s no wonder our natural posture has become increasingly curved, slumped, and sore. And if just hearing the phrase “poor posture” conjures up memories of mom telling you to “Sit up straight!” then keep in mind that, in this case, mother know best. “When we spend time in suboptimal positions, certain muscles in our body — such as shoulders, back, core, and neck — actually shorten,” explains , DPT, CSCS, founder of . Simply put, our bodies adapt to the postures we spend the most time in, and, over time, those shortened muscles can cause more health problems. Poor posture does much more than just affect your body’s physical structure. , a yoga and mobility instructor for , says it impacts a wide range of things from “how our body produces hormones and how our blood is circulating, to how we feel in our bodies and how we’ll be able to move as we age.” We may not immediately recognize the damage our posture is doing — but our body does. For example, Wickham says, the body can associate closed, or slumped-over posture with stress, which results in the release of cortisol. On the other hand, open or high-power positions — which endorphins and even testosterone, — ward off stress and create feelings of confidence. So not only does your posture affect your height and health, it can affect your mental health and how you feel about yourself. With that as an incentive, try these seven poses in the morning to get your blood flowing, loosen up tight muscles, and increase body awareness so you can stand straight and tall as you stroll out the front door. Keeping the bottoms of your feet facing the ceiling, touch your big toes to each other. Crawl your hands forward, and either extend your arms straight out toward the front of the mat, or drape your arms on the floor alongside your body. Slowly start to drop your hips back to rest on your heels. Child’s Pose helps you explore the range of motion in your shoulders by stretching your arms above your head. It also helps lengthen and stretch the spine, which is used to being slouched after years of bad posture. With a generous bend in your knees to support and balance your body’s shape, exhale as you bend forward at your hips, lengthening the front of your torso. Bend your elbows. Hold on to each elbow with the opposite hand. Let the crown of your head hang down. Press your heels into the floor as you lift your sitting bones toward the ceiling. Pull your shoulders away from your ears. Drop your head and neck. Lengthen your legs until you feel a stretch in the hamstring muscle. Work on engaging your quadriceps muscle to help hamstring muscles release. If you can keep the front of your torso long and your knees straight, place your palms or fingertips on the floor beside your feet. Release deeper into the pose with each exhalation. Let your head hang as you feel the tension roll out of your shoulders and neck. This fold deeply stretches the hamstrings, opens the hips, and can help release any tension in the neck and shoulders, explains Morbitzer. This can be an intense stretch for the hamstrings, so be careful not to take it too far. Instead, allow the tension in your shoulders to roll out. Start on all fours. Your wrists should be stacked under your elbows, which are stacked under your shoulders. Keep your fingers spread against the ground for increased stability. Keep your knees stacked under your hips, toes untucked, with the top of your feet pressed into the ground. Lengthen from your tailbone down to your head, so that your neck is neutral and you’re looking down a few inches from your finger. This is your starting position. Begin the Cat phase. As you exhale, tuck your tailbone under, using your abdominal muscles to push your spine toward the ceiling, making the shape of a Halloween cat. Lengthen your neck. Allow your head to reach toward your chest so that your ears come down by your biceps. On an exhale breath, “swoop and scoop” the pelvis into Cow position so that your belly is dropped toward the floor. Lift your chin and chest and gaze up toward the ceiling. Broaden your shoulder blades. Draw your shoulders away from your ears. Cycle through Cat-Cow a few times. Be careful to avoid putting stress and pressure on your head and neck. This movement sequence will help increase spinal awareness, which is a large part of less-than-perfect posture. According to Morbitzer, “The Cat-Cow movement should be done through the core and the pelvis so that as you inhale, you are creating an anterior tilt to the pelvis so that your tailbone is facing the ceiling, and as you exhale you create a posterior tilt so that your tailbone is facing towards the ground.” With your legs hip-width apart and knees bent, place hands either out in front of you or on your thighs for added balance. Keep your legs static. Begin the Cat (upward) phase: As you exhale, tuck your tailbone under using your abdominal muscles to push your spine toward the ceiling, making the shape of a Halloween cat. Lengthen your neck. Allow your head to reach toward your chest, maintaining alignment with the spine. On an exhale breath, “swoop and scoop” the pelvis into Cow position so that your belly is dropped toward the floor. Lift your chin and chest and gaze up toward the ceiling. Broaden your shoulder blades and draw your shoulders away from your ears. This stretch activates different back muscles. It can help increase your awareness of your back in relation to the rest of your body. If your job requires you to be in the same position every day, take a break and cycle through Standing Cat-Cow a few times to help counteract the effects of sitting all day. Abdominals, abductors, obliques, glutes, shoulders Start on all fours with your fingers spread slightly. Keep your core engaged and active, and your pelvis neutral. Point your tailbone down toward your heels. Keep your legs active so that you’re pulling up on your kneecaps with your quads. Press back through your heels so that your calves are active, too. With elbows underneath your shoulders, create space between the shoulders and ears so that there’s a slight stretch. To make sure that the chest isn’t sinking, puff up the space between your middle and lower back so that your shoulder blades are almost moving away from each other. “If you notice that your stomach or hips are sinking, tilt your pelvis slightly forward,” suggests Morbitzer. “But if that is too intense, bring your knees down to the ground while keeping the core tight and pelvis neutral.” This position requires awareness of the spinal position as well as engagement of the abdominal muscles. This core strength is vital for encouraging posture corrections. Tuck your toes and lift your hips high, lifting your sitting bones toward the ceiling. Reach your heels back toward the mat without allowing them to plank on the ground. As you stay here, make sure that your wrist creases stay parallel to the front edge of the mat. To alleviate the pressure on your wrists, press into the knuckles of your forefinger and thumbs. “It is useful for opening the anterior chest wall and shoulders that are so often rounded with excessive desk work,” explains Morbitzer. Practice often, and you might be able to relieve neck and back pain associated with poor posture. You might even find yourself sitting up a little straighter, too. Remember to actively draw your shoulder blades back and create a space in your neck. If you find yourself scrunching your shoulder up to your ears, it may mean you don’t have enough upper body strength. If your shoulder blades begin to tense up, bend your knees and go into Child’s Pose, and rest until you’re ready to hold the position again. Start on all fours, with your fingers spread slightly. Place your left hand behind your head, but keep your right hand outstretched on the ground in front of you with fingers spread. Rotate your left elbow to the sky while exhaling, stretching the front of your torso, and hold for a deep breath, in and out. Return to the starting position. Repeat for 5 to 10 breaths. This exercise stretches and improves mobility in your torso, specifically your thoracic spine (the middle and upper back). It also reduces stiffness in the mid to lower back. Thoracic spine mobility is extremely important for loosening tightness in the back muscles. “The point of this exercise is to take the [muscles] around the spine through its full range of motion,” Wickham explains. Right now, there’s no direct evidence linking stretching to better posture, but science, as always, is at work to find one. An early 2010 suggests that stretching could improve posture, and some researchers at believe it could help enough that they’re currently recruiting participants for a clinical trial studying the link between stretching, better posture, and reduced back pain from sitting. But what about now? Where does all this stretching lead? Well, both Wickham and Morbitzer believe active yoga poses that incorporate breath and muscle contractions can help people gradually realign their bodies and improve posture. and can help increase body awareness, so that even when you’re not trying, your body, through an ache or slump, will remind you to “Sit up straight!” And you’ll adjust, just the way your mom wanted you to. rugby-playing, mud-running, protein-smoothie-blending, meal-prepping, CrossFitting, become a morning person, tried the Whole30 challenge, and eaten, drank, brushed with, scrubbed with, and bathed with charcoal — all in the name of journalism.

Back pain is quite common, as an estimated of the population experiences symptoms at some point in their lives. Back pain can range in severity and frequency and it often affects the . Workers suffering from back pain may miss days of work, or have limited mobility when they are on the job. There are multiple factors that can cause back pain, and consulting with a doctor is an important step in determining a treatment plan and finding relief. Injuries can often lead to back pain. This includes injuries from exercising, playing sports, and lifting heavy objects. These activities may strain the muscles and ligaments in the back. In addition to accidents and injuries, back pain can be caused by a ruptured, damaged, or herniated disk. Disks are part of the spine that sit between and cushion each vertebrae. Damage to a disk can also lead to nerve pain and muscle weakness. Underlying issues including arthritis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia can contribute to back pain.  Back pain is common during pregnancy, as the additional weight puts pressure on the lower back. Back pain can also be exacerbated by poor posture. There are several types of back pain, and understanding the severity and location of the pain can help when it comes to finding relief. It is important to work with a medical professional to determine the underlying cause of back pain. Being able to describe the type of back pain you are experiencing is important. Back pain can be considered acute or chronic: Acute back pain typically has a sudden onset, and is often caused by an injury. This type of back pain heals as the underlying cause is resolved. This may involve a torn muscle or ligament, or damage to the tissue. Tissue damage generally takes three months to heal, so acute back pain often lasts three months or less. That said, acute back pain can turn into chronic back pain if the body does not properly heal. Chronic back pain lasts longer than three to six months. It persists even after an injury heals. In these circumstances, the nervous system continues sending pain signals to the brain. Chronic back pain can also be the result of an underlying condition. Arthritis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia can all cause chronic back pain. Whether back pain is chronic or acute, it can manifest in different areas of the back. The location of back pain can often point to the underlying cause. Low back pain is the type of back pain. It manifests in the lumbar region, specifically vertebrae L1 through L5. These five vertebrae, and the disks, ligaments, tendons, and muscles connected to them, help support the upper body. As a result, this area is at risk of injury when exercising or lifting heavy objects improperly. Weight gain and pregnancy can also strain the lower back. Using a pillow under the lumbar region can reduce pressure on the spine and help alleviate lower back pain. Mid-back pain occurs between the lumbar region and the bottom of the rib cage. This type of back pain is less likely to be caused by heavy lifting. Mid-back pain can be connected to more serious health issues like tumors or underlying conditions. Posture can play a role in worsening or preventing mid-back pain. : Upper back pain occurs in the , or the 12 vertebrae between the rib cage and neck. This type of back pain includes the shoulders, and is often affected by posture. Trauma or injury can also cause upper back pain. Serious conditions, including osteoporosis, arthritis, tumors, and narrowing of the spine can all lead to upper back pain. Like other types of back pain, upper back pain can also be a result of damage to the vertebrae, disks, muscles, or ligaments. Pillow choice is especially important for those with upper back pain, as the right pillow will support the upper back, shoulders, and neck. Regardless of how severe your back pain is or where it manifests, speaking to your doctor about your symptoms is important. A medical professional can help diagnose and treat back pain. Anyone with knows how difficult it can be to get uninterrupted sleep each night. The relationship between back pain and sleep is complex. Back pain sufferers often get caught in a vicious cycle: back pain negatively affects sleep, and poor sleep quality can . Poor sleep and chronic pain also affect mood, physical function, and quality of life. Restless sleep often involves waking up throughout the night due to pain and discomfort. Adults generally need seven to nine hours of interrupted sleep each night, something that may feel impossible for those with back pain. It is important to note that your pillow and mattress play a role in sleep quality and pain management. Both affect sleep posture, which can alleviate or exacerbate back pain symptoms. The and pillow to combination should promote a neutral posture that keeps the spine aligned. Pillows can be used to support the head, neck, and shoulders. They can also be used under the lumbar region and legs to alleviate pressure on the spine. There is plenty to consider when selecting a pillow for back pain, which we’ll break down further here. The pillow you use affects how much support and pressure relief you experience throughout the night. Spinal alignment is important for every sleeper, as it can help prevent and alleviate back pain. The following factors determine how well a pillow supports the head, neck, and shoulders and should be carefully considered. These include the loft, firmness, and size of the pillow. Each shopper has unique needs, which should be accommodated by the right pillow. What to Consider When Purchasing a Pillow for Back Pain The following considerations affect the performance and quality of a pillow, and should be kept in mind by all shoppers. There are plenty of choices on the market, and it is not uncommon for companies to overstate certain features to entice shoppers. This can be distracting. Focusing on what is most important, namely the amount of support and comfort a pillow provides, will help shoppers narrow down their options. These factors can help shoppers filter out unnecessary marketing jargon and exaggerations and find the best pillow for them. When evaluating the following elements, back pain sufferers should also consider their sleeping position, head and shoulder size, and type of back pain. : Loft refers to the height of the pillow, which is one of the most important considerations when choosing a pillow for back pain. It determines the angle of the head and neck and how well the spine is kept in alignment. Loft can range from low to high. Some pillows have an adjustable loft, allowing sleepers to customize the height of the pillow by adding or removing fill. Stomach sleepers often need a low loft pillow to keep the head and neck at a comfortable angle. Back sleepers tend to choose a medium loft pillow that cradles the head and neck, while side sleepers may opt for a medium to high loft to fill the gap between the neck and shoulders. Support measures how well the spine is kept in alignment. The spine extends into the neck, so the pillow must be supportive enough to reduce pressure on the neck and shoulders. Some materials are more supportive than others, as they retain shape throughout the night and resist falling flat. The firmness of a pillow is measured on a scale of soft to firm. The best pillow firmness for back pain depends on sleeping position and weight, among other factors. The pillow should balance comfort and support. Stomach sleepers often prefer a soft pillow, while back and side sleepers may opt for a medium to firm pillow. Firmness and comfort are subjective, so shoppers should keep their personal preferences in mind. : How well the pillow conforms to the shape of the head and neck determines how much pressure relief it provides. Back pain can be worsened by undue pressure on the neck and shoulders. This is often caused by a pillow that is too firm, or one that puts the head and neck and an uncomfortable angle. A pillow that relieves pressure will cradle the head and neck and reduce tension. Pillows can also be used underneath the lumbar region to relieve pressure in the lower back. How well the pillow retains its shape throughout the night affects the amount of support sleepers receive. A pillow that retains its shape without constant fluffing or adjusting is beneficial for back pain sufferers, as it can help them sleep without interruptions. Some sleepers prefer a pillow that can be molded into their preferred shape. The best pillows for back pain can have an even shape, or can be contoured for additional neck support. Setting a budget is an essential part of shopping for a new pillow. Polyester and down-alternative pillows are often affordable, while more expensive options may include memory foam, latex, buckwheat, or down fill. The materials and construction impact price. The quality of materials used determine the lifespan of a pillow. This is important for back pain sufferers, as quality materials will provide consistent and even support. Latex, feathers, and high-density foams all tend to be durable materials. Shoppers should note that investing in a high-quality pillow may cost more upfront, but these pillows do not need to be replaced as often. There are benefits and drawbacks to each pillow type, but memory foam pillows are often considered to be the best for back pain. Back pain can manifest in different ways, and every shopper will have different needs and preferences. Some may find that down, poly fill, or latex pillows are more comfortable. We’ll break down common pillow types here. Viscoelastic foam, or , conforms to the shape of the head and neck by responding to heat and pressure. This type of pillow offers a customized feel that reduces tension in the neck and shoulders and helps keep the spine aligned. Pillows can have a solid memory foam core, or shredded memory foam fill. There are a couple drawbacks to memory foam to keep in mind, namely that it can have an initial odor and tends to retain heat. are filled with the outer shell of buckwheat seeds. The hulls have a naturally open shape that encourages airflow and helps dissipate heat. Buckwheat pillows often have an adjustable loft, as the hulls can be added or removed to change the firmness and height of the pillow as needed. The hulls conform to the shape of the head and neck to reduce aches and pains. That said, the buckwheat hulls may be too firm for some. They are also prone to making a rustling noise when the pillow is shifted. Feather pillows are filled with the outer feathers of ducks or geese. This results in a lightweight fill that compresses easily and cradles the head and neck. For sleepers with back pain, this can reduce tension in the head and neck. Feather pillows are often slightly firmer than down pillows, and the loft can be adjusted by adding or removing fill. is harvested from the sap of rubber trees, which is poured into molds and processed using the Talalay or Dunlop manufacturing method. The result is a durable, breathable material that offers moderate contouring for pressure relief. Latex retains its shape. It is often used as a solid pillow core, so latex pillows are less likely to be adjustable. They also tend to be expensive. refers to the insulating under-feathers of ducks or geese. It is softer and lighter than feathers, as there are no quills. Like feathers, down compresses easily and fills gaps for contouring support. This type of pillow cradles the head, neck, and shoulders and can ease tension in the upper back. That said, down may be too soft for some back pain sufferers. is a polyester fiber designed to mimic the feel of down at a lower price point. Polyurethane-based foam, or polyfoam, offers moderate contouring but is not as responsive as memory foam. It can relieve pressure for back pain sufferers. This type of foam pillow is typically affordable, but low-density polyfoam has a shorter lifespan that can result in inconsistent support or deep impressions. What is the Best Pillow Positioning for Back Pain? can exacerbate or alleviate back pain. Sleeping on your back is often considered the best positioning for back pain. This position is most likely to encourage sleepers to maintain a neutral posture, which keeps the spine aligned and reduces pressure on the lumbar region. Sleepers can use pillows strategically to relieve back pain. Stomach sleeping is one of the worst sleeping positions for back pain, as it puts pressure on the lower back and often leads to spinal misalignment. The following sleeping positions, along with their potential benefits and drawbacks, should be considered: : Sleeping on your back relieves pressure on the spine. To make this sleeping position even more beneficial, sleepers can use pillows underneath the head and knees. The pillow beneath the head should cradle the head, neck, and shoulders and keep the spine aligned. A pillow underneath the knees may help prevent pressure from building in the spine. : The fetal position can be beneficial for some back pain sufferers, but precautions should be taken to ensure body weight is evenly distributed. Sleepers should keep both knees evenly bent and curve their upper body towards their knees to promote natural alignment. : Side sleeping can be comfortable for back pain sufferers, but the mattress and pillow should be conforming and supportive. Placing a pillow between the knees squares the hips and alleviates pressure on the lumbar region. This helps keep the spine aligned. For back pain sufferers, pillow choice is crucial. In addition to choosing a supportive pillow, shoppers can take the following measures to help alleviate back pain and sleep comfortably. When selecting a , shoppers should consider their sleeping position and body type. These can affect how comfortable the mattress feels. The right mattress will help alleviate back pain for those already suffering, but it can also help prevent it. A supportive mattress will help keep the spine aligned and improve overall sleep quality. Physical therapy can help with both . Physical therapy includes exercises and stretches that improve mobility and strengthen muscles. This can reduce pain and tension throughout the body. Heat and cold therapy can also be used in physical therapy to relieve back pain. Working with a physical therapist can result in a long-term plan to manage back pain and its underlying causes. A adjusts the firmness of a mattress by acting as an additional comfort layer. For back pain sufferers, a mattress topper can cushion pressure points. Conforming materials like foam and latex help evenly distribute body weight and keep the spine aligned. Investing in a mattress topper is often a more affordable option than purchasing a new mattress, especially if the only issue with the mattress is its current firmness level. Frequently Asked Questions About Pillows for Back Pain The wrong pillow can worsen back pain, making it essential for sleepers with back pain to choose their pillows wisely. The wrong pillow will provide inadequate support, placing the head and neck at an uncomfortable angle. This can be the result of a loft that is too high or too low, or a pillow that is not the right firmness for the sleeper.

85fcd1ae-8f42-4851-85f5-b0ee92534942,"Tailbone Pain (Coccydynia): Causes, Symptoms & Treatments Dealing with pain is never an easy situation. And in the unfortunate situation when you are facing with Tailbone Pain (a.k.a. Coccydynia), it can be difficult to do even the most normal daily tasks such as sitting at your desk. Tailbone pain can come to you for variety of reasons and is more common in women than it is in men. In this post we’ll look at the symptoms of Coccydynia, causes of the pain and how it can be treated to get you back to living life as normal. The Tailbone or Coccyx is the triangular bony structure located at the bottom of the vertebral column between the buttocks. Composed of three to five bony segments it is held in place by joints and ligaments. It is the bottom most part of the Spine and helps support the Pelvis There are variety of causes that can lead to Tailbone Pain such as – Loosening of ligaments during pregnancy and childbirth Sitting on hard bench or uncomfortable surface for prolonged duration In some rare cases an infection or tumor in the area. As mentioned before this is more typical in women than men but men do suffer from it as well. The symptoms are usually pain that is worsened by sitting or putting pressure on the area itself. It may feel worse if you’re constipated or you may feel relief after having a bowel movement. You may also notice worse pain when you go from sitting to standing positions. Dealing with tailbone pain can be a difficult process but there are some things to try that will hopefully relieve the pain noninvasively. Your doctor may suggest using NSAID’s to help with the inflammation and swelling in the area. Applying cold packs to the area several times every day to help reduce the swelling. You can also add heat later to help reduce the pain. Changing your sitting posture – Sit with your back against the chair and feet flat on the floor to take the weight off your tailbone or Lean forward when you go to sit down Alternatively, utilize a donut shaped pillow to help reduce the pressure applied on the coccyx area when you’re in a seated position. Make sure not to sit in one position for too long, but get up and walk around to reduce the pressure on the tailbone area If you notice that constipation or a bowel movement causes or removes pain, then it’s important to be sure to get enough fluid and possibly take a stool softener to help reduce the pain during those times. Other methods that are non-surgical include gentle stretches, chiropractic manipulation of the area, and injections to block the pain. There are also physical therapy ultrasound techniques that can help to reduce the pain in the area. In severe cases where nothing else has helped after months of treatment, surgery may be required to fully get rid of pain.

A laminectomy procedure on the lower back is one of the most common procedures to treat spinal stenosis, a narrowing of space around the spinal cord. In a laminectomy, surgeons remove the lamina, a bony structure that protects the spinal cord, to relieve pressure causing neural issues and pain. Following a laminectomy surgery, orthopaedic care can aid in the recovery process and help you get back to feeling your best. Essentially, a laminectomy is performed when other options to alleviate the problem fail to work – it is often a last resort. The spine is a complex structure. It is made up of 33 vertebrae or bones. These bones of the spine protect the spinal cord. The spinal cord is home to an intricate network of neural bundles stemming from the brain. The brain and spinal cord are the structures that comprise the central nervous system. The central nervous system drives every movement, breath, and thought we make. It is the center of our being. Damage to the spinal cord can cause varying degrees of problems, including paralysis and regulatory functioning issues. The lamina is the back arch of the vertebrae bone. It protects the spinal cord from outside impact or harm. When abnormalities or bony overgrowths develop on the spine, neural functioning may become significantly impaired and pain may occur. , a narrowing of the spinal canal, may create pressure on the nerves that run through the spine. Bony overgrowths due to age or arthritis may also compress these fragile neural networks. Consequently, pain, numbness, and weakness may occur. In severe cases, the individual may struggle to walk and may lose control of their bladder and bowel movements. When the symptoms become severe enough that they impact day-to-day function and when other treatment options fail to work, a laminectomy is performed. In other words, the lamina portion of the vertebrae is removed. A laminectomy surgery in Singapore involves the use of general anesthesia. However, before surgery the appropriate tests and examinations are performed to ensure as little risk as possible. Your doctor will also ask you to avoid food and drinks for a set time before surgery. Your doctor will also ask that you avoid NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the week before your surgery. Depending on the part of the spine that the laminectomy is performed on, it often lasts 1-2 hours. The medical team measures your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels throughout the procedure. An incision is made at the affected vertebrae. The aggravating part of the lamina is removed, relieving pressure off of the spinal cord. Depending on the severity and type of condition you have, the surgery may also involve spinal fusion or the removal of a slipped disc. Your surgeon will discuss the plan with you beforehand. Following a laminectomy surgery, the surgery team will take you to a recovery room. Some will be required to stay in the hospital of a few days, while others may undergo a same-day discharge. It entirely depends on the severity of your situation and how invasive the surgery was. What Are the Risks of a Laminectomy Surgery in Singapore? As with any surgery, there are varying risks involved. These risks include: Frequently, individuals experience relief after surgery. However, surgery may not fully eliminate the cause and it will only remove the decompression in the part of the spine operated on. For example, arthritis or spinal stenosis may still progress after surgery. The surgeon will likely require you to walk and perform movements right after the surgery. These tests will ensure no damage was done to the spinal cord. They may also prescribe pain relief medication during the initial recovery stage. Take the advice of your surgeon, and slowly and gradually increase your activity levels. Follow-up appointments will help guide you through the recovery phases. Again, it may depend on your condition and the exact type of surgery performed. For example, if a bone fusion was also performed your doctor may recommend a back brace as part of the recovery process, and your recovery may be slightly longer. You will have to work to keep the incision clean and dry, particularly the first few days after surgery. If swelling or tenderness occurs at the incision site, seek out medical attention immediately. An infection could potentially develop. Your surgeon will outline how to avoid infection following the surgery. General advice following a laminectomy surgery in Singapore includes: Avoid driving for 2-4 weeks right after surgery. Discuss your options and prognosis with your surgeon. Do not bend or twist the torso. This could potentially open the incision and cause other problems. Do not smoke. Smoking may interfere with your body’s ability to heal properly and quickly. Avoid travelling. Car rides or plane rides may increase your risk of developing a blood clot. Back surgery sounds scary. It is absolutely normal to experience worries or concerns regarding your surgery and recovery. Ask questions beforehand and after the procedure. Our team of surgeons and doctors would be more than happy to address any concerns you may have. At the 6 week mark, regular activities can often gradually be resumed. Neural pain may subside in about 4-6 weeks. And pain and swelling will decrease over time and eventually, with use. Following a laminectomy, chiropractic care and physiotherapy may be recommended to help guide the rehabilitation process. Chiropractic treatment can also coincide with physiotherapy treatment, and vice versa. However, initial healing must take place before you seek out chiropractic or physiotherapy care. The body is fragile after surgery and a certain amount of rest and time must take place before any spinal manipulation is performed. Often, physiotherapy and chiropractic care can begin about 2 weeks post-surgery. Research has also supported post-surgery chiropractic and physiotherapy treatment. In the case of a laminectomy, patients reported improved function, mobility, and decreased pain with treatment. No adverse or detrimental effects were reported. Most experience reduced back pain symptoms. A Laminectomy surgery If you follow proper guidelines and instructions, your quality of life may significantly improve post-surgery. A positive attitude and proper care following your surgery can go a long way and can drastically impact your results. However, you may not notice the results straight away. It may take up to 6 weeks to notice any notable difference. Chiropractic care and physiotherapy can also help restore mobility and reduce incidences of pain during the later stages of your recovery. Your healthcare provider can recommend exercises throughout the recovery process to help you get back to your regular activities and improve your outcome. Make sure to always follow the direct advice and instructions from your doctor. For more information regarding laminectomy procedures and post-surgery care, contact us at +65 9734 3087.

Spinal stenosis is the result of the narrowing of free spaces in the spine. This will cause extra pressure to act onto the spinal cord and the nerves running through it. In majority of the cases, spinal stenosis affects the lumbar spine. This will eventually cause pain along the legs and make walking a difficult task to accomplish. There are many different possible causes for spinal stenosis: As we grow older, our soft connective tissues such as the tendons and ligaments will start to harden and thicken. When this happens, spurs will start to develop and some may make their way into the spinal canal. This will result in the damaging of the vertebrae and cause the facet joints to wear and tear. Eventually, this will cause the narrowing of the lower spine. When one of the many vertebrae slips over another, this will cause congestion and narrow the spinal canal. Spinal tumour. Spinal tumours are abnormal growth of soft tissues that will cause inflammation of the spinal canal. White blood cells will rush to the site and cause an overgrowth of new tissues. This will eventually result in the narrowing of the spinal canal. Accidents especially high impact ones may shatter or dislocate the spine, causing small bones to impinge onto the canal. Patients suffering from early stages of spinal stenosis often have no symptoms. Symptoms will develop slowly over time and may include: The pain in the legs are usually due to inefficient circulation of the blood. Leg pain will usually go away with rest but patients with spinal stenosis will get persistent leg pain despite resting. Narrowing of the spine will also cause nerve impingement, resulting in important nerves to be deprived of the abilities, leading to incontinence. Spinal stenosis have no unique signs nor symptoms and will worsen over time. Although x-ray results look promising, there is still uncertainties. The best method to manage lumbar spinal stenosis is to understand the disease better and to strengthen the back by engaging in strengthening activities daily. , , , Stiff neck causes pain and discomfort when attempting to move your neck. It is often due to injury to the soft tissues and at the neck region. It is usually accompanied by pain and soreness in the neck, shoulder and arm. Symptoms can last for quite a fair bit of time and it can be relieved using medication or a warm compress. For cases whereby the symptoms go away in a couple of days, there isn’t much of an underlying issue. Stiff neck can occur when you wake up after having slept in an awkward position for a long time. Sometimes, stiff neck can be an indication of an underlying spinal disorder. We must first know the basic anatomy of our neck. Our neck is divided into 2 regions namely the anterior and posterior. There is a part of our spine that moves through our neck and that is the cervical spine which is effectively made up of 7 vertebrae. Any slight problems in our spine can ultimately lead to neck pain since they are interlinked. There are 2 common spinal disorders which are Cervical Herniated Disc and Neck Arthritis. Cervical herniated disc is one of the leading causes for neck pain and indicates an injury to the cervical spine. Pain in the neck is caused by the disc pinching onto the cervical nerve, causing pain to flow down the nerve pathway down to the neck. Some patients may also experience numbness at the neck region. Another common cause is due to cervical osteoarthritis which is a degenerative joint disease or otherwise known as neck arthritis. Cervical osteoarthritis are characterised by the presence of bone spurs which may impinge onto a nerve. When impingement happens, the pain will radiate down the nerve onto the neck region, creating in neck pain similar to the cervical herniated disc. It can also be due to cervical spondylosis which is another degenerative disease that is increased by previous injuries. Cervical spondylosis can result in neck pain and stiffness and is due to the wear and tear of the cartilage and bones of the cervical vertebrae. There are many causes for stiff neck and it could indicate an underlying spinal disorder due to the mechanism for both neck arthritis and cervical herniated disc. The best way would be to seek a doctor immediately if you frequently encounter a stiff neck. , , , 4 Misconceptions About Epidural Steroid Injections is commonly administered to patients suffering from lower back or leg pain. Lower is due to the inflammation of spinal nerves, causing pain and discomfort to patients as the nerve passage is narrower compared to healthy patients. Corticosteroids are extremely strong pain relief medication that is injected directly into the area of concern, providing immediate relief. However, most patients undergo the procedure with the mentality that they will be . This is a misconception of it and in fact, there are many more misconceptions out there about ESI. Well, this is a misconception although it is true to a certain extent. Many people think that steroid injections are much safer than oral consumption of steroids. However, this really depends on the medication that is prescribed as the toxicity differs. While oral consumption of may cause irritation to the stomach and with the fact that it “travels” a longer distance down, there is a higher risk of allergy. However, ESI are injected directly into the affected area and when something bad occurs, it happens immediately without providing you much reaction time. Repeated treatments are required for visible results Many doctors tell their patients that a minimum of 3 ESI is required before they are effective. However, this is the average value comprising data from hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide. In fact, the exact amount of dosage required by each patient is never the same due to the differing genetics of each of us. Some patients get immediate relief after just a single injection while some may need a lot more to see results. Most of us would have visited the hospital for one reason or another and a high percentage of us have had multiple needles injected into us. ESI are totally different from your usual invasive treatments. Only a single needle is required to be as ESI is done under the guidance of an X-Ray machine, providing the doctor with the exact spot to inject. While you may get immediate pain relief from the , you may suffer temporary pain in the form of bruises and tenderness due to the injection. Although the technique is conducted under the guide of an x-ray machine, human error is bound to happen. Bruising and swelling will go away on its own in just a couple of days. Epidural Steroid Injections have been performed for a long time and it has a track record of being rather safe and successful. Since the procedure is an outpatient one, patients do not need to spend a night in the hospital, making it much more flexible and economical for them. , , , , , Our spine is composed entirely of bones called vertebrae and providing them with cushioning are small discs called the intervertebral discs. Over time, the intervertebral discs can lose their elasticity and will place the spine at a higher risk of injury. Pain in the spinal disc have many different terms, the common ones being “pinched nerve”, “slipped disc” and “slipped herniated disc”. The truth is, all of the terms refer to the same thing. Many patients who suffer from , leg pain and the weakening of the lower core muscles are usually diagnosed as suffering from slipped herniated disc. Over time as we age, the disc will lose its water content and become less elastic. If the event that it ruptures, the spinal disc will get pushed out of its normal position and if they pinch onto the spinal nerves, it is called . Slipped disc can also occur due to other reasons beside ageing such as traumatic injuries or cyclic loading of the spinal area. When the herniated disc pinches onto the spinal nerves, it will affect the normal signalling process of the nerves and can even stop the signals from being passed. Some common symptoms of a slipped herniated disc include sharp electric shock pain, muscle weakness, loss of bladder or bowel control and numbness. If the pinching of the nerves by the herniated disc causes high pressure, it can cause weird sensation such as a sharp electric shock kind of pain and the pain can travel down from the neck area to the arms and legs. Since there is a loss of signalling functions, the instructions from the brain can be interrupted and that can cause weakening of the muscles. One common way to diagnose this is to test for reflexes. If there is a lag in reflexes, it is a sign of nerve irritation. Another symptom is the loss of bowel and/or bladder function. Since there is an issue with nerve signalling, the body is unable to properly control the bowel and bladder and can cause them to release substances without you wanting to. It can also be the other way round where you wish to urinate or defecate but you are unable to. Another common symptom is numbness of a particular area for a long time as numbness usually indicates nerve damage. The loss of body functions due to nerve damages can affect our lives greatly and we should always take all precautions to protect our spine. This can be easily done by the usage of protective equipment during high impact sports as well as lifting heavy objects using the correct method. , , , , , , , , , , , , Top 4 Occupations that Negatively Affects the Musculoskeletal System Our musculoskeletal system consists of the bones, ligaments, tendons and many more that allows us to move around. will affect our locomotion and will cause problems to our daily lives. Disorders are often due to cyclic stresses and strains caused by our daily activities. Some occupations have an increased risk for Musculoskeletal disorders and our shoulders, hands, neck and back are the ones that are usually affected. Carpet layers are workers who lay carpets for customers. They are required to be in a kneeling position for prolonged periods of times daily and they not only have to kneel on a hard surface, they also have to use a knee kicker to stretch the carpet to ensure proper alignment. Whenever we kneel down, our body weight is fully on our both knees and keeling for long periods of time on a hard surface will cause even more damage to the . Over time, the meniscus will wear off and the kneecap will also get damaged. Movers are often required to carry heavy loads on their back and this will cause serious musculoskeletal problems such as chronic back pain, sprains, strains and even slipped disks. Back strains are often caused by overloading and poor lifting techniques. If it continues, the muscle can get torn and that will cause inflammation, causing pain and possibly muscle spasms. An injured back muscle will need to work even harder to protect and support the spine, leaving the spine at an additional risk to getting injured. Office workers work in probably the most relaxed and ideal conditions but they are one of the ones with the highest risk to musculoskeletal disorders. Sitting in a poor posture for a day causes more damage to the body than manual work. Poor posture such as hunching can cause and shoulder stiffness. Prolonged sitting in a fixed position can also cause an overload in the muscle structures. Construction workers are often required to carry heavy static loads throughout the day. To distribute the weight better, they often carry the items over their head in a outstretched position. The muscles are thus unable to contract and this will injure the muscles and even hinder the proper blood circulation around the body. Prolonged period of poor blood flow can cause the arms to swell. It is easy to prevent by making small changes to your daily lifestyle. The working environment needs to be changed and you also need to be aware of the hazards you are faced with and overcome them. , , , , , , , Difference Between Chiropractor and Orthopaedic Doctors An unfortunate accident occurred one day while you were playing contact sports and that left you with a knee injury. You know that you need to consult a medical professional for this injury and you start to evaluate the options available. Should you or should you go to a Chiropractor? Each has its own advantages. For some cases, chiropractic sports are great to treat certain injuries while some injuries fall outside the jurisdiction of chiropractic and only orthopaedic surgery can treat them. Who are Chiropractors and how do they treat ? First of all, Chiropractors are not medical doctors and they do not prescribe medications. Chiropractors believe in hands on and alternative treatment instead of surgery. They believe that the body is able to heal on its own. For example, if mobility to a certain part of the body is observed, they will manipulate that particular part to regain mobility. A visit to a Chiropractor usually cost a lot lesser than a visit to an Orthopaedic doctor. Some chiropractors even make the first consultation complimentary. Not only that, you are also able to fix an appointment at an earlier date as compared to an appointment with an Orthopaedic doctor. However, multiple visits to Chiropractors are required to be able to see results and in the long term, it may cost more than a visit to the latter. Orthopaedic doctors on the other hand are medical doctors. They specialise in the diagnosis and treatment of our musculoskeletal system. Many people have the idea that orthopaedic doctors are doctors who will recommend surgery for everything, from a torn meniscus to a dislocated bone. This is not true. Orthopaedic doctors will often only recommend when all other available options are exhausted. If the injury can be treated with physical therapy, they will recommend that unless patients insist on surgery in the first place. Orthopaedic doctors will make use of medical technologies such as X-Rays and to tell the patient what exactly is wrong with their body. They are also able to prescribe pain relief medications be it orally or via injections, something that Chiropractors are not able to. Deciding on a visit either to a Chiropractor or an Orthopaedic doctor is purely the decision of the patient. As a patient, you need to know what type of injury you have suffered and make your decision based on that. Different people prefer different things and be sure to know what results you really want. , , , , , , , After seeing the wonders of Tiger Woods in the golfing world, many people are suddenly interested in the sport and it has seen a huge growth not only in America but also around the world. People from young to old are starting to learn how to play golf and well to do parents are also forcing their kids to learn golf as it is seen as a game that rich businessmen sign contracts over. However with the increasing in golfers, there is also an increase in injuries related to golf. What are they? Shoulder injuries especially to the muscles and tendons are extremely common due to overuse. Depending on the severity of the injury, it can cause a slight strain to a complete tear. Golf requires the use of the rotator cuff muscles during the swinging of the club and over prolonged usage of them, inflammation can occur, causing pain and tenderness. Amateur golfers are at a higher risk as they use their rotator cuff muscles much more than professional golfers due to incorrect swinging techniques. Golfer’s elbow is similar to tennis elbow just that they are caused by 2 different sports and the location of the pain differs. Golfer’s elbow are caused by overuse and cyclic loading of the tendons and it will result in inflammation, causing immense pain to the player. Pain will be felt at the elbow joint inside of the arm and it will cause a sharp pain even during simple task like squeezing something. De Quervain’s tenosynovitis affects the tendons that are at your thumb and will cause immense pain whenever you try to move your wrist or clench your fingers together. They are caused by repeated hand movement such as swinging the golf club for a prolonged period of time. Trigger finger occurs when an attempt to bend the finger towards the palm, the finger is locked in the position due to the tendon getting stuck. Trigger finger are common in people who frequently uses their hands repeatedly and can cause swelling of the tendons in the fingers, causing it to get locked in the opening of the sheath. Knee injuries can occur when the golfer swings the club and it results in a rotation of the knee, causing huge stress on the ligaments and the stress can cause the anterior cruciate ligament to tear. Depending on the power of the turn, it can even cause meniscus tear. associated with golf are common and are increasing mainly due to the increase in number of golfers nowadays. As mentioned above, most injuries are caused by repeatedly usage and incorrect usage of various muscle groups. Do take care when you are playing and give your body plenty of rest in-between golfing sessions. Regular exercise is good for our body and it lowers the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Many people thus have the impression that all kinds of exercise are good and safe. Due to time constraints, many of us choose to work out in a gym. However, not all of the exercise machines in a gym are safe. Some gym exercises are a complete waste of time while some may hurt your spine if they are not properly done or if you have existing problems. Many of us bend our knees when we are doing squats. Bending our knees too deep will cause our spine to get misaligned as it is unable to maintain the proper alignment. When misalignment occurs, our pelvis will start to tilt and our lower back will take over control and this will increase the stress to our back muscles, increasing the chances of injury to our spinal discs. We often see many people doing behind the head lat pull downs in the gym. However, this is not to be performed by everyone. Only those with very flexible shoulder joints should do it and extreme care must be taken not to injure their back with the pull down bar. Upright rows are done by holding a weight in the centre and placing both hands close together, bringing them up to just under your chin. However, this exercise will compress the nerves, causing issues to both the shoulders and the spine. While tight hamstring may contribute to back pain, improper usage of the hamstring stretching machine can contribute to spinal disc injuries. When we stretch out to touch our toes, it feels good for the hamstring but will add a huge amount of strain to our back. The entire weight of the body is weighing down onto the disc and it contributes injurious pressure to the discs and causing spine injuries. Many of us love to do free weights exercise in the gym and it can help us build wonderful muscles. However, headlining is bad for the back. Dead lifting is done when you bending over at your waist to lift a weight. Although it helps to build up strong back and leg muscles, it is straining the back and causing harm to your spinal discs. Not all gym exercises are for everyone and not every is good for the body. If you have existing conditions, always consult a specialist before doing certain exercises in the gym. Know your limits and do not attempt to do weights that are beyond yours as you will start using other parts of your body to lift them instead.

The device is inflated using the pump attached to it. To use it, it is wound around the neck region and slowly pumped to fill the air. Fill in the air until it stretches to a comfortable level. As the device gets strong, it shifts the weight from the neck downwards onto the shoulders. The pain reduces with the relaxing of the muscles and the decreasing pressure from nerves and the blood vessels as well. The discs also come in line so they can hydrate again. Advantages of using the air neck traction device are: Can be easily carried while traveling, while working, etc Can be used in any position, sitting, standing, lying down, walking, etc There are also some disadvantages of this device which are: The quality of these devices has to be checked properly before buying. As there are devices that wear out too soon and are of very poor quality you need to invest in a branded quality product. Sometimes the pressure applied is not accurate and can be a little too much for the neck and jaw areas. Posture Pump® for neck pain is of comparatively higher cost than the other two neck traction devices. Made up of highly durable high-quality medical materials, these devices are very well-built and powerful. It is said that they mimic the cervical traction that is done in a clinic and the treatment is very much similar to that given by the doctor.

Assembly is required as it has to be hung from a door’s back. The straps of the device need to be tied around the back of the person’s head and also the chin. Tighten the straps by using a cord or something that is available and suitable. Take care not to use anything that can hurt the neck (like a water bag). Advantages of using over the door traction device are: Place the straps correctly over a firm door and then tie it around the neck, this makes it easier to use. As the device plays its part, the person can sit comfortably on the chair doing his favorite reading, watching television, etc. There also major disadvantages of this device. They are not as portable as the air neck traction devices, as they need a door to be tied to. The person has to sit on the chair throughout and there is no choice to lean or lie down and relax. The correct stretch takes a little more time here and the chin has to take up most of the pressure from the traction. When compared to the air neck traction devices, these are not simple to use.

Besides this, various forms of massage, devices, and medicines are recommended to treat the problem and ensure better health and safety. Osteomyelitis or bone infection is also a condition where experts do not suggest using cervical traction therapy for pain relief. As a slight pressure to the infected vertebrae region may cause weakness or fracture to the vertebrae bones this method should be avoided. Finally, cervical traction is not recommended to apply to the excessive joint motion or hypermobility which already exists in the cervical spine. Proper consultation and massage therapy are advised right to support the spinal vertebrae.

This article will explain the types and symptoms of rotator cuff injury along with its causes, risk factors, treatment options, and preventive measures. The muscles and tendons that help in the movement of your shoulders are called the rotator cuff. Any injury to this group of muscles can cause a dull ache in the shoulder, which worsens with shoulder movement. This type of injury is commonly seen in athletes and people who repeatedly move their shoulders like painters and carpenters. Most people recover from this injury with the help of physiotherapy. The group of muscles and tendons that work together to stabilize the shoulder and allow you to move it is called rotator cuff. The muscles that make the rotator cuff are: - It keeps the upper arm stable and helps in lifting the arm. - It helps in shoulder rotating action. - It connects the upper arm to the shoulder blade and helps in rotating the shoulder. - It is the smallest muscle and also helps in rotation. These tendons get injured easily as they move in a very tight space. When you move your shoulder properly, these muscles move and help with the movement. But when you stress or strain it beyond its capacity, these muscles rub against the bony process in the shoulder bone (acromion). This results in the muscles getting injured and inflamed. - Repetitive movements and advancing age can cause general wear and tear of these muscles. What treatment would you suggest for my father's shoulder condition? - Overuse can cause inflammation of the tendons in the rotator cuff. This type of injury is commonly seen in athletes who swim or play tennis and volleyball. - The inflammation of the bursa, which is the fluid-filled sac between the shoulder joint and rotator cuff tendons, is called shoulder bursitis. - The tendons, that are the fibers that connect the muscle to the bone, can tear fully or partially. It can occur from a sudden injury or due to repetitive motion. Untreated rotator cuff can eventually lead to a tear. This causes shoulder pain, inability to move the shoulder fully, and shoulder weakness. - Shoulder impingement is when the muscles in the rotator cuff rub or impinge on the shoulder bones. It is the most common cause of shoulder pain and rotator cuff tear. Symptoms are not seen with all types of rotator cuff injuries. Repetitive motions can gradually damage the muscles over the years. The common symptoms include: Shoulder pain while performing certain activities. Inability to achieve a full range of shoulder motion. If these symptoms last for more than a week, or if you lose sensation or function of your arm, consult a doctor immediately. The following are the most common causes of rotator cuff injury: Arthritis and patients with knee pain sit and rise from the chair by putting excess force on their arm. As their knees hurt, they take support from the chair handles. The shoulder joint is not built for this, and this results in crushing and grinding of the rotator cuff tendons. Shoulder injuries from falls, accidents, and sports collisions. Repetitive activities like pushups, swimming, painting a house, etc., can cause injury of the rotator cuff. Sudden overhead arm movements commonly seen in athletes can result in rotator cuff tear. Your doctor will press your shoulders in different areas, and he or she will tell you to perform various shoulder movements. Physical examination also tests for the strength of the rotator cuff muscles. If needed, your doctor might tell you to get the following tests: - X-rays will not show a rotator cuff tear, but it is used to rule out other conditions that can cause shoulder pain like bone spurs or . - Here, sound waves are used to produce images of muscles and tendons in the shoulder. You can also see how your muscles stretch with movements. - Strong radio waves magnets are used to obtain a detailed view of all hard and soft structures in the shoulder. Most types of rotator cuff injuries get better with rest, ice compressions, and physical therapy. Surgery is indicated only in severe cases of rotator cuff tear. The treatment options include: 1) - Rest the affected shoulder, apply ice, and consult a physiotherapist for physical therapies. Your doctor will prescribe painkillers and anti-inflammatory medicines. 2) - Exercises specially designed for this type of shoulder injury will help reduce pain and restore flexibility and strength to the shoulder. 3) - If your pain did not get better with physiotherapy, the doctor might recommend getting a steroid injection directly into the shoulder joint.

Our handbags are where we keep our basics — and then some — like wallets, cosmetics, laptops, snacks, gym clothes, water bottles, ad nauseam. Let’s face it: We’d be lost without our bags.

Our guide to shoulder pain will help you pinpoint why yours hurts–and what you can do to ease the ache. Start Slideshow of What causes shoulder pain? Shoulder pain is a common ache in the U.S.: By some estimates, as many as 67% of people experience shoulder discomfort at some point over the course of their lives. The most mobile joint in your body, the shoulder is made up of bones held in place by muscles, tendons, and ligaments. They're all designed to work together to allow the shoulder to move freely in many different directions. This allows you to do everything from raising your arms over your head to throwing a baseball and scratching your back. ""Unfortunately, this mobility comes at the expense of stability,"" and that leaves the shoulder vulnerable to injury, says Clifford Stark, DO, medical director of Sports Medicine at Chelsea in New York City. Factor in the wear and tear of everyday life and it’s easy to see why you're, uh, so much pain. You'll need to consult your doctor for a formal diagnosis of your shoulder pain. That visit will include a physical exam, and possibly an X-ray, MRI, or ultrasound, or you may even be referred for physical therapy right off the bat, Dr. Stark says. Until you know what's causing your shoulder pain for sure, here are a few of the many reasons why your shoulder might hurt, and how to find relief. RELATED:  of of Rotator cuff tendonitis Credit: Getty Images Of all the reasons you can have shoulder pain, injury to your rotator cuff is the most common. In a recent study, two-thirds of people with had a rotator cuff problem. A group of muscles and tendons that attach to the bones of the shoulder joint, the rotator cuff keeps the ball of your upper arm bone centered in your shoulder socket and also helps you raise and rotate your arm. Doing the same motion over and over again can lead to inflammation of the rotator cuff tendons, also called tendonitis, which can cause shoulder pain. ""The rotator cuff is like a tire—with aging or frequent use it gets thinner and thinner and eventually wears down,"" says Robert Gotlin, DO, a sports and spine physician in NYC. With tendonitis, shoulder pain and weakness are often mild at first and only noticeable when you move the joint; after a while, they can become more severe and occur all the time. Rotator cuff tendonitis often gets better with a change in activities to avoid provoking pain so the tendon can heal. ""There's a fine line between doing too much and doing too little,"" says Dr. Stark, ""but it's generally okay to do things that don't aggravate it."" Ice or heat to the shoulder and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen can reduce pain as well. Your doctor may also refer you to a physical therapist for manual therapy and strengthening exercises to keep your muscles moving and to challenge weaker muscles. RELATED:  of of Rotator cuff tears Credit: Getty Images It's also possible to partially or completely tear a shoulder tendon, either from repetitive motion or from direct trauma, like a fall. The pain of an acute tear—one that happens suddenly—can be excruciating. But shoulder pain, weakness, and stiffness of a chronic tear worsen slowly over time, so you often don't notice when they begin. Everything You Need to Know About Runner's Knee–Even If You're Not a Runner Rest, ice or heat, and NSAIDs may help heal rotator cuff tears. But your doctor will likely suggest physical therapy to strengthen your shoulder muscles and improve the mechanics of the shoulder joint, as well as provide exercises to do at home. ""Your tires will last you a lot longer if your alignment and shocks are good, and the exact same thing is true of the shoulder,"" says Dr. Stark. Cortisone (steroid) injections, which give temporary pain relief so you can strengthen your muscles, or surgery may also be required. of of Frozen shoulder Credit: Getty Images This injury is exactly what it sounds like, says Dr. Stark. ""People with frozen shoulder come in with severe stiffness and inability to move their shoulder the way they normally would, with varying levels of shoulder pain."" Medically known as adhesive capsulitis, frozen shoulder results when the connective tissue that lines your shoulder joint becomes thickened and inflamed. Precisely why this happens isn't known, nor is the reason why middle-age women are especially prone to frozen shoulder. There are other factors that can put you more at risk of the condition. For instance, up to 20% of people with develop frozen shoulder, and people with or Parkinson's disease may also be vulnerable to this type of shoulder pain. You don't just wake up with frozen shoulder though. Doctors break the progression into three stages: ""freezing,"" ""frozen,"" and ""thawing."" ""Over time, you'll notice a decrease in your range of motion and then all of a sudden it escalates,"" says Dr. Gotlin. Most people get better without treatment–eventually. It usually takes about 18 months for a frozen shoulder to completely thaw. ""You can cut it down a few months with physical therapy, but it will still last a while,"" says Dr. Gotlin. Since some people wind up with a frozen shoulder on the opposite side as well, doctors often treat the good side too, just to keep it moving. of of Shoulder bursitis Credit: Sam Edwards/Getty Images Got deep, achy soreness that feels hot and swollen? Chances are you have shoulder bursitis, inflammation of the bursa, a fluid-filled sac that provides a smooth surface for muscles and bones to glide over. ""If you have two muscles aligned side by side and there isn't something between them to reduce friction, they wouldn't move,"" explains Dr. Gotlin. Normally these sacs, which are found in joints throughout the body, are filled with a small amount of fluid. Sometimes, though, when you overdo it (say, by throwing a ball or lifting something over your head repeatedly), the body responds by bringing more fluid to the bursa—and the swelling that influx produces is what's known as bursitis. ""A bursa is like a balloon that's practically flat, and bursitis is the balloon being filled up with lots of water,"" says Dr. Gotlin. The pain from bursitis is typically on the outside of your shoulder and it's made worse when using your arm above your head. Treatment is usually rest, ice or heat, and pain relievers, but your doctor may recommend physical therapy to stretch or strengthen the shoulder muscles and increase range of motion, and/or cortisone injections to reduce inflammation. of of Labral tears Credit: Lauren Shavell/Getty Images It's not unusual to hear about pro athletes suffering tears to the labrum, a thin rim of soft cartilage that surrounds the edge of the shoulder socket and helps keep the shoulder stable yet mobile. But these tears are a common injury in regular folks too. Indeed, probably half of middle-age men and women have some sort of labral tear from years of using their arms, says Dr. Gotlin. Often you won't even be aware you have one, since some tears are completely asymptomatic and cause no problems. But others can trigger shoulder pain, specifically when moving your arm in an overhead motion or across your chest—say, to scratch your left shoulder with your right arm. There are several types of labral tears and treatment depends on the severity of the injury. For instance, if the labrum is still attached to the socket and just frayed, rest, NSAIDs, and physical therapy usually help relieve pain; however, because these tears typically don't completely heal, the problem can flare up again. If the labrum is fully detached, surgery is usually required. RELATED: 10 Exercises You Should Never Do Again, According to Trainers of of Shoulder impingement Credit: Getty Images Shoulder impingement often occurs after repeated overhead activity, like swimming. Shoulder tendons and bursa get impinged, or pinched, between the bones of the shoulder, which makes it painful to move your arm. Various positions, including overhead motion, reaching back, or lying on the affected side, may all worsen the symptoms. Shoulder impingement can weaken the rotator cuff, so physical therapy is key to alleviating this pain and preventing further damage. ""Since one of the main jobs of the rotator cuff is to stabilize the joint, any weakness to it will lead to further impingement, creating an ever-vicious cycle,"" says Dr. Stark. Properly strengthening these muscles and balancing all the muscles and tissues that affect the position of the shoulder effectively can relieve the impingement. of of Osteoarthritis Credit: Getty Images Sometimes called degenerative joint disease, (OA) stems from ordinary wear and tear on the shoulder joint. The condition destroys the firm, rubbery cartilage that acts as a cushion between the bones and helps them to glide smoothly against each other. As the cartilage breaks down and the bones of the joint rub against each other, shoulder pain and swelling can limit your range of motion. For instance, it may become difficult to lift your arm to brush your hair or reach up to a shelf. Sometimes you'll hear a grinding, clicking, or snapping sound as you move your shoulder. Most people get relief from rest or a change in activities to avoid provoking pain, heat or ice, NSAIDs, and physical therapy exercises to both stretch and strengthen the muscles to help support the joint and improve its range of motion. Your doctor may also recommend steroid injections. of of Shoulder instability By design, shoulders are unstable—it's what allows them to move in so many ways. But the term ""instability"" is also a diagnosis that's given when the shoulder hurts because the ball of the joint is too loose and is able to slide around too much in the socket. Chronic strain and worsened instability can occur when an already loose shoulder is overused, especially if the use is repeatedly challenging the ligaments that help hold the shoulder in the socket, says Dr. Stark. ""We see this a lot in the throwing athlete, swimmer, or volleyball player—someone who uses their shoulder a lot through its full range of motion."" Instability is a likely cause of shoulder pain in younger people, especially if it comes on with certain sports, because wear-and-tear conditions like rotator cuff tears and arthritis tend to occur with age. Rest, heat or ice, and NSAIDs can help control pain and swelling. But the key fix for instability is physical therapy to strengthen the muscles that assist in keeping the ball of the joint in the socket. This will improve stability of the shoulder and allow your joint to move more smoothly. RELATED: 5 Exercises You Should Do to Avoid Injuries After 40 of of Dislocated shoulder Credit: Getty Images Shoulder instability exists on a continuum, and on the extreme end is complete dislocation, or when the ball of the joint becomes so loose it actually comes out of the socket. It's also possible to partially dislocate your shoulder, called subluxation, which occurs when the shoulder slips completely out of the socket, but then pops back in. With subluxation, people often notice that their shoulder feels loose and slips in certain positions—often when their arm is raised over their head. Both subluxation and dislocation can also result from trauma, such as a fall or blow that occurs with enough force to overpower the strength of the muscles and ligaments of the shoulder. If your shoulder dislocates, it's important to seek medical help: As tempting as it may be to let someone place the bone back in the socket (once a dislocation is ""reduced,"" the severe pain stops almost immediately), an X-ray to rule out a fracture is a must. ""Even if you know what you're doing, you can sever a nerve with a piece of sharp bone,"" says Dr. Stark. Your doctor will return the ball of the joint to the socket, then control the residual pain and swelling with rest, NSAIDs, and possibly cortisone injections. You may also have your shoulder immobilized in a sling for a few weeks. Physical therapy is also usually required to regain full use of your arm. In some cases, surgery to tighten loose ligaments is necessary. of of Fractured collarbone Credit: Getty Images (aka clavicle), one of the main bones in the shoulder, are fairly common—they account for about 5% of all adult fractures, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. This type of break usually occurs with trauma, like when you fall onto your shoulder or your outstretched arm. If your shoulder hurts due to trauma—you fell on it or you hear a pop while working out—see a health care provider right away, says Dr. Stark. Some injuries won't heal correctly if they're not tended to within a certain amount of time. Fractured collarbones can snap just slightly or into many pieces. In either case, the broken pieces of bone may line up straight or be far out of place. A broken collarbone is very painful and makes it difficult to move or lift your arm. Heat or Ice? Which to Use for Back Pain, Pulled Muscles, and More Treatment will depend on the break: ""Some collarbone fractures can heal with rest, but others require much more aggressive treatment,"" says Dr. Stark. If the ends of the bone have not significantly shifted out of place, a simple sling may be all that's needed to position your arm and shoulder during healing. If the broken ends of the bones have been significantly displaced, you may need surgery. Whether you require surgery or not, it can take several months for your collarbone to heal, and physical therapy to maintain or restore movement and strength will be necessary. of of Neck pain Credit: Getty Images To help pinpoint the cause of your shoulder pain, your doctor will usually take your medical history, do a physical exam, and ask a whole host of questions about your shoulder pain, including: When did you first start experiencing shoulder pain, what makes it better or worse, have you ever injured your shoulder, and is the shoulder pain associated with any neck pain? People often have shoulder pain that's actually stemming from the upper back or neck area; in fact, this overlap is so common it’s sometimes referred to as ""shneck"" pain.

Our guide to shoulder pain will help you pinpoint why yours hurts–and what you can do to ease the ache. Start Slideshow of What causes shoulder pain? Shoulder pain is a common ache in the U.S.: By some estimates, as many as 67% of people experience shoulder discomfort at some point over the course of their lives. The most mobile joint in your body, the shoulder is made up of bones held in place by muscles, tendons, and ligaments. They're all designed to work together to allow the shoulder to move freely in many different directions. This allows you to do everything from raising your arms over your head to throwing a baseball and scratching your back. ""Unfortunately, this mobility comes at the expense of stability,"" and that leaves the shoulder vulnerable to injury, says Clifford Stark, DO, medical director of Sports Medicine at Chelsea in New York City. Factor in the wear and tear of everyday life and it’s easy to see why you're, uh, so much pain. You'll need to consult your doctor for a formal diagnosis of your shoulder pain. That visit will include a physical exam, and possibly an X-ray, MRI, or ultrasound, or you may even be referred for physical therapy right off the bat, Dr. Stark says. Until you know what's causing your shoulder pain for sure, here are a few of the many reasons why your shoulder might hurt, and how to find relief. RELATED:  of of Rotator cuff tendonitis Credit: Getty Images Of all the reasons you can have shoulder pain, injury to your rotator cuff is the most common. In a recent study, two-thirds of people with had a rotator cuff problem. A group of muscles and tendons that attach to the bones of the shoulder joint, the rotator cuff keeps the ball of your upper arm bone centered in your shoulder socket and also helps you raise and rotate your arm. Doing the same motion over and over again can lead to inflammation of the rotator cuff tendons, also called tendonitis, which can cause shoulder pain. ""The rotator cuff is like a tire—with aging or frequent use it gets thinner and thinner and eventually wears down,"" says Robert Gotlin, DO, a sports and spine physician in NYC. With tendonitis, shoulder pain and weakness are often mild at first and only noticeable when you move the joint; after a while, they can become more severe and occur all the time. Rotator cuff tendonitis often gets better with a change in activities to avoid provoking pain so the tendon can heal. ""There's a fine line between doing too much and doing too little,"" says Dr. Stark, ""but it's generally okay to do things that don't aggravate it."" Ice or heat to the shoulder and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen can reduce pain as well. Your doctor may also refer you to a physical therapist for manual therapy and strengthening exercises to keep your muscles moving and to challenge weaker muscles. RELATED:  of of Rotator cuff tears Credit: Getty Images It's also possible to partially or completely tear a shoulder tendon, either from repetitive motion or from direct trauma, like a fall. The pain of an acute tear—one that happens suddenly—can be excruciating. But shoulder pain, weakness, and stiffness of a chronic tear worsen slowly over time, so you often don't notice when they begin. Everything You Need to Know About Runner's Knee–Even If You're Not a Runner Rest, ice or heat, and NSAIDs may help heal rotator cuff tears. But your doctor will likely suggest physical therapy to strengthen your shoulder muscles and improve the mechanics of the shoulder joint, as well as provide exercises to do at home. ""Your tires will last you a lot longer if your alignment and shocks are good, and the exact same thing is true of the shoulder,"" says Dr. Stark. Cortisone (steroid) injections, which give temporary pain relief so you can strengthen your muscles, or surgery may also be required. of of Frozen shoulder Credit: Getty Images This injury is exactly what it sounds like, says Dr. Stark. ""People with frozen shoulder come in with severe stiffness and inability to move their shoulder the way they normally would, with varying levels of shoulder pain."" Medically known as adhesive capsulitis, frozen shoulder results when the connective tissue that lines your shoulder joint becomes thickened and inflamed. Precisely why this happens isn't known, nor is the reason why middle-age women are especially prone to frozen shoulder. There are other factors that can put you more at risk of the condition. For instance, up to 20% of people with develop frozen shoulder, and people with or Parkinson's disease may also be vulnerable to this type of shoulder pain. You don't just wake up with frozen shoulder though. Doctors break the progression into three stages: ""freezing,"" ""frozen,"" and ""thawing."" ""Over time, you'll notice a decrease in your range of motion and then all of a sudden it escalates,"" says Dr. Gotlin. Most people get better without treatment–eventually. It usually takes about 18 months for a frozen shoulder to completely thaw. ""You can cut it down a few months with physical therapy, but it will still last a while,"" says Dr. Gotlin. Since some people wind up with a frozen shoulder on the opposite side as well, doctors often treat the good side too, just to keep it moving. of of Shoulder bursitis Credit: Sam Edwards/Getty Images Got deep, achy soreness that feels hot and swollen? Chances are you have shoulder bursitis, inflammation of the bursa, a fluid-filled sac that provides a smooth surface for muscles and bones to glide over. ""If you have two muscles aligned side by side and there isn't something between them to reduce friction, they wouldn't move,"" explains Dr. Gotlin. Normally these sacs, which are found in joints throughout the body, are filled with a small amount of fluid. Sometimes, though, when you overdo it (say, by throwing a ball or lifting something over your head repeatedly), the body responds by bringing more fluid to the bursa—and the swelling that influx produces is what's known as bursitis. ""A bursa is like a balloon that's practically flat, and bursitis is the balloon being filled up with lots of water,"" says Dr. Gotlin. The pain from bursitis is typically on the outside of your shoulder and it's made worse when using your arm above your head. Treatment is usually rest, ice or heat, and pain relievers, but your doctor may recommend physical therapy to stretch or strengthen the shoulder muscles and increase range of motion, and/or cortisone injections to reduce inflammation. of of Labral tears Credit: Lauren Shavell/Getty Images It's not unusual to hear about pro athletes suffering tears to the labrum, a thin rim of soft cartilage that surrounds the edge of the shoulder socket and helps keep the shoulder stable yet mobile. But these tears are a common injury in regular folks too. Indeed, probably half of middle-age men and women have some sort of labral tear from years of using their arms, says Dr. Gotlin. Often you won't even be aware you have one, since some tears are completely asymptomatic and cause no problems. But others can trigger shoulder pain, specifically when moving your arm in an overhead motion or across your chest—say, to scratch your left shoulder with your right arm. There are several types of labral tears and treatment depends on the severity of the injury. For instance, if the labrum is still attached to the socket and just frayed, rest, NSAIDs, and physical therapy usually help relieve pain; however, because these tears typically don't completely heal, the problem can flare up again. If the labrum is fully detached, surgery is usually required. RELATED: 10 Exercises You Should Never Do Again, According to Trainers of of Shoulder impingement Credit: Getty Images Shoulder impingement often occurs after repeated overhead activity, like swimming. Shoulder tendons and bursa get impinged, or pinched, between the bones of the shoulder, which makes it painful to move your arm. Various positions, including overhead motion, reaching back, or lying on the affected side, may all worsen the symptoms. Shoulder impingement can weaken the rotator cuff, so physical therapy is key to alleviating this pain and preventing further damage. ""Since one of the main jobs of the rotator cuff is to stabilize the joint, any weakness to it will lead to further impingement, creating an ever-vicious cycle,"" says Dr. Stark. Properly strengthening these muscles and balancing all the muscles and tissues that affect the position of the shoulder effectively can relieve the impingement. of of Osteoarthritis Credit: Getty Images Sometimes called degenerative joint disease, (OA) stems from ordinary wear and tear on the shoulder joint. The condition destroys the firm, rubbery cartilage that acts as a cushion between the bones and helps them to glide smoothly against each other. As the cartilage breaks down and the bones of the joint rub against each other, shoulder pain and swelling can limit your range of motion. For instance, it may become difficult to lift your arm to brush your hair or reach up to a shelf. Sometimes you'll hear a grinding, clicking, or snapping sound as you move your shoulder. Most people get relief from rest or a change in activities to avoid provoking pain, heat or ice, NSAIDs, and physical therapy exercises to both stretch and strengthen the muscles to help support the joint and improve its range of motion. Your doctor may also recommend steroid injections. of of Shoulder instability By design, shoulders are unstable—it's what allows them to move in so many ways. But the term ""instability"" is also a diagnosis that's given when the shoulder hurts because the ball of the joint is too loose and is able to slide around too much in the socket. Chronic strain and worsened instability can occur when an already loose shoulder is overused, especially if the use is repeatedly challenging the ligaments that help hold the shoulder in the socket, says Dr. Stark. ""We see this a lot in the throwing athlete, swimmer, or volleyball player—someone who uses their shoulder a lot through its full range of motion."" Instability is a likely cause of shoulder pain in younger people, especially if it comes on with certain sports, because wear-and-tear conditions like rotator cuff tears and arthritis tend to occur with age. Rest, heat or ice, and NSAIDs can help control pain and swelling. But the key fix for instability is physical therapy to strengthen the muscles that assist in keeping the ball of the joint in the socket. This will improve stability of the shoulder and allow your joint to move more smoothly. RELATED: 5 Exercises You Should Do to Avoid Injuries After 40 of of Dislocated shoulder Credit: Getty Images Shoulder instability exists on a continuum, and on the extreme end is complete dislocation, or when the ball of the joint becomes so loose it actually comes out of the socket. It's also possible to partially dislocate your shoulder, called subluxation, which occurs when the shoulder slips completely out of the socket, but then pops back in. With subluxation, people often notice that their shoulder feels loose and slips in certain positions—often when their arm is raised over their head. Both subluxation and dislocation can also result from trauma, such as a fall or blow that occurs with enough force to overpower the strength of the muscles and ligaments of the shoulder. If your shoulder dislocates, it's important to seek medical help: As tempting as it may be to let someone place the bone back in the socket (once a dislocation is ""reduced,"" the severe pain stops almost immediately), an X-ray to rule out a fracture is a must. ""Even if you know what you're doing, you can sever a nerve with a piece of sharp bone,"" says Dr. Stark. Your doctor will return the ball of the joint to the socket, then control the residual pain and swelling with rest, NSAIDs, and possibly cortisone injections. You may also have your shoulder immobilized in a sling for a few weeks. Physical therapy is also usually required to regain full use of your arm. In some cases, surgery to tighten loose ligaments is necessary. of of Fractured collarbone Credit: Getty Images (aka clavicle), one of the main bones in the shoulder, are fairly common—they account for about 5% of all adult fractures, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. This type of break usually occurs with trauma, like when you fall onto your shoulder or your outstretched arm. If your shoulder hurts due to trauma—you fell on it or you hear a pop while working out—see a health care provider right away, says Dr. Stark. Some injuries won't heal correctly if they're not tended to within a certain amount of time. Fractured collarbones can snap just slightly or into many pieces. In either case, the broken pieces of bone may line up straight or be far out of place. A broken collarbone is very painful and makes it difficult to move or lift your arm. Heat or Ice? Which to Use for Back Pain, Pulled Muscles, and More Treatment will depend on the break: ""Some collarbone fractures can heal with rest, but others require much more aggressive treatment,"" says Dr. Stark. If the ends of the bone have not significantly shifted out of place, a simple sling may be all that's needed to position your arm and shoulder during healing. If the broken ends of the bones have been significantly displaced, you may need surgery. Whether you require surgery or not, it can take several months for your collarbone to heal, and physical therapy to maintain or restore movement and strength will be necessary. of of Neck pain Credit: Getty Images To help pinpoint the cause of your shoulder pain, your doctor will usually take your medical history, do a physical exam, and ask a whole host of questions about your shoulder pain, including: When did you first start experiencing shoulder pain, what makes it better or worse, have you ever injured your shoulder, and is the shoulder pain associated with any neck pain? People often have shoulder pain that's actually stemming from the upper back or neck area; in fact, this overlap is so common it’s sometimes referred to as ""shneck"" pain.

10e54818-8632-46b5-952f-cbff1cea13d7,"Sprained Ankle Treatments in Singapore (How to Recover Fast) Sprained ankles are one of the most common sports-related injuries obtained by people. Although a sprained ankle may not be a major injury, it could be quite a hindrance to daily activities and of course, sports or other physical activities would not be possible without further injuring the ankle. Depending on the severity of the sprain, there are plenty of sprained ankle treatments in Singapore that can provide recovery from 6 weeks to up to 4 months. However, with adequate rest, proper treatment and rehabilitation, the healing process could be sped up significantly. Sprained ankles typically occur when the ankle is turned at an unnatural angle and the ligaments connecting the bone and ankle tears. Typically, an ankle sprain can be identified by the pain, swelling, stiffness and instability. A minor sprain involves a stretched ligament with slight tearing. The pain would not be too intense and it would still be possible to walk with a limp. If the , the ankle joint would lose its function and stability. Intense pain would be felt initially but it would wear off after a while till no pain is felt and swelling would be extensive. You can identify a sprained ankle by bruising around the affected area, a swollen or painful lump near the ankle, and a general instability of the area. Depending on the severity of the sprain, a doctor may recommend several treatment programmes to suit your needs. Most of the time, sprains will go away with adequate rest without further pressure on the feet, but extreme cases may call for surgical solutions like . As with many other kinds of leg and joint injuries, the R.I.C.E (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) method is the first form of treatment to contain the injury and reduce pain and swelling. Rest: Avoid weight bearing as much as possible to allow the ankle to heal and prevent further aggravation of the injury. Ice: Using an ice pack or ice wrap, apply it on the injured area for 10-15 minutes several times a day. This would reduce the pain and swelling. Compression: After icing, use bandage to wrap around the injured area snugly. Make sure that it is not too tight that it cuts off blood circulation. Elevation: Raise your leg above the heart level to further reduce the swelling. These four steps should be repeated at least three times a day or until the pain and swelling subside. During this time, you should also restrict movement and involvement in physical activities. If you have difficulty walking, consider a crutch or an ankle brace to assist you in your daily routine. Generally, no medication is required for a sprained ankle, but painkillers are sometime given out if necessary. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) can help to reduce the inflammation and reduce pain and swelling. Other than that, over-the-counter painkillers are also prescribed to handle the pain. These can include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Keeping your ankle immobilized for too long can result in stiffness. Always wriggle your toes or move your ankle lightly whenever possible to keep it flexible. Once the injury has stabilized and is recovering, you can start rehabilitation exercises to restore its motion, strength and balance. You can start off with sitting on a chair and moving your ankle up and down, followed by rolling your foot inward and outward. If these movements are bearable, proceed to stand with legs at hip width apart and lift up one foot at ankle level. Change to the other foot and repeat the reps. Slowly lift your feet off the ground on a tiptoe and hold the position before lowering it back down. Use a support if necessary. With a wall for support, lean forward with one leg bent and reach out for the wall with both hands at head level. The other leg should be kept straight and feeling the stretch along the calf. Do the same with the other leg. If you often suffer from sprains, you can lower the chances of such occurrences by wearing proper shoes or going through physiotherapy and stretching exercises to improve your balance and footwork. Other preventive measures can include ankle braces or sports tape which can hold and reinforce your ankle to prevent it from landing at susceptible angles. One of the most common causes of ankle sprains is weak ankle muscles. You can train your ankles to be stronger with a simple exercise. Wrap a towel around your foot to create some resistance and roll it inward as a simple movement. Do not attempt to do this if your ankle already hurts! , , , Chances are you or someone you know has suffered from back pain at some point in their life. It can catch you by surprise and drastically limit your mobility and function. 1 in 2 employees took 4-7 days off work for their back pain in the past year. It decreases productivity and one’s quality of life. However, back pain doesn’t have to be the norm. At the Singapore Sports and Orthopaedic Clinic, our experts can help you bounce back from back pain and prevent future incidents. The back is a complicated structure, consisting of neural networks, the spine, and muscles. However, everything in the body is connected. Back pain may be caused by a tight muscle, structural abnormalities, neurological issues such as nerve compression, and more. The spine consists of small bones called vertebrae. In between each bone is a disc. These discs prevent bone-on-bone contact, as well as act as shock-absorbers. Within the spine is the spinal cord. The spinal cord contains the nerves that connect the central nervous system to the rest of the body, allowing your brain to communicate to your muscles and joints to perform certain movements. Further, muscles connect to various points of the spine and pelvis. The condition of these muscles, such as strength and flexibility, can impact your posture and alignment. If these muscles aren’t functioning properly, back pain may occur. There are a variety of causes of back pain. Some of the most common causes include a slipped disc, osteoarthritis, poor posture, and tight muscles. A slipped disc, or herniated disc, is the displacement of the shock absorbing disc in between the spinal vertebrae. It may occur due to twisting or moving incorrectly or due to wear and tear over time. Consequently, it may place pressure on nearby nerves. ‘Sciatica’ is the common term used in conjunction with a slipped disc condition. The disc may place pressure on the sciatic nerve, causing numbness, pain, tingling, and weakness to occur down the legs. Osteoarthritis is the wearing down of the protective cartilage between bones. In the spine, it is often due to the wearing down of the protective discs. With age, these discs naturally become dehydrated. Some refer to this as ‘degenerative disc disease.’ It frequently occurs in the neck or low back, and may cause varying degrees of pain and functional limitations. Your body is made to move a certain way. Further, your joints, muscles, and tissues are optimized for proper posture. Unfortunately, a lot of people lack proper posture. Today, many people lead fairly sedentary lives. We sit at desks all day, jeopardizing our posture and causing certain muscles to shorten. Flexibility and strength decrease. When we place our body in unnatural positions, dysfunctions occur. For example, if you are leaning forward all day with your head protruding toward your computer screen, you are placing stress on your neck and shoulder muscles, bones, and tissues. Bad posture can also lead to added stress on the lower back. The body isn’t made to sit in such positions for prolonged periods. And as much as it tries to adapt, back pain is often inevitable without proper intervention or education. Sitting for long periods may also contribute to tight muscles. The hamstrings, hip flexors, and piriformis muscles may become tense or shortened. Due to their attachment points and locations, these muscles can pull on the pelvis and spine causing pain. Frequently called ‘Piriformis Syndrome,’ the piriformis muscle may spasm and compress the sciatic nerve creating radiating pain down the legs. However, can educate you and help you overcome these conditions. With proper treatment and care, you can decrease and eliminate your back pain issues. Back pain is treated in a number of ways. It frequently depends on the cause. Pain relievers, such as over-the-counter NSAIDs, may help decrease initial pain and inflammation. However, it isn’t recommended to use these medications in the long-term. Negative side-effects, including gastrointestinal issues, may occur with chronic use. Exercise, supervised and provided by a trained professional, can help decrease your risk of back pain and eliminate future injuries. Frequently, back pain in Singapore is caused by inactivity and muscle weakness. The most common form of rehab exercise for back pain involves the strengthening of the neglected transverse abdominals, or TA. The TA muscles are the deep and lower core muscles. They help support and stabilize the spine and pelvis, acting as a girdle. When this muscle is weak, we try to compensate in other ways. However, this often results in injury and pain, specifically in the low back. A back pain exercise program will focus on strengthening these abdominal muscles, as well as stretching out shortened or tight muscles. Doing so helps reduce pain and dysfunction of the spine. A basic TA exercise to get you started involves: Lying face up, with your knees bent and your feet planted on the ground. Imagine a tightrope pulling your hip bones together or stopping the flow of urine. You can feel with your fingers in between your hip bones to determine if you are tightening your TA muscle or not. Your stomach should not bulge upward, just tighten. Your low back should remain on the ground or bed. Make sure to keep breathing throughout the exercise. A lot of people tend to hold their breath. However, this is incorrect. Try holding the contraction for 5 seconds to start. Build up to 10 second holds. Perform the exercise 10-12 times and at least 2-3 times per day. Common problematic muscles that may also lead to back pain, include the hamstrings, hip flexors, and piriformis. The hamstrings or hip flexors may become tight, which may pull on the pelvis. In turn, this creates alignment issues. Your lower back may become under stress in this unnatural position. Thus, pain may occur. To correct these issues, your sports doctor will prescribe exercises to stretch out and elongate these muscles. They may also use manual techniques to promote healing and to release muscular tension. The piriformis, as aforementioned, can spasm and compress the sciatic nerve, causing back pain and radiating pain down the legs. Myofascial release techniques and stretches can help release this small muscle, reducing and preventing future incidences. In combination with exercise, a manual therapist or sport doctor can perform joint manipulations, traction, myofascial release, and other techniques to help alleviate your pain levels. Each treatment protocol is suited to your particular needs. In severe cases and where other treatment options fail to work, surgery may be used as a last resort. At the Singapore Sports and Orthopaedic Clinic, our sports doctor are qualified to perform such surgeries. They can prepare you before surgery and help guide recovery post-surgery. There are many types of back surgery. Again, it depends on the cause of your back pain as to what kind of surgery you have. Also, surgery is only considered when other interventions have failed to work. The 3 most common surgeries include: This surgery may be performed when an individual has a slipped disc. The doctors removes the damaged part of the disc. Spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal column, which can cause neural issues to arise. In this type of surgery, the lamina portion of the spine is removed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. 2 or more vertebrae are fused together in this type of surgery. It limits movement between the 2 vertebrae, reducing pain brought on by the motion of these 2 bones. This is often done in cases where the spine has been damaged or a deformity has occurred. Your sports doctor will thoroughly explain the surgery prior to. Again, these surgeries are only performed when all other interventions and treatments have been unsuccessful. Frequently, surgery will improve one’s pain levels. However, in some cases, it may not fully fix the problem. Exercises and other treatment protocols can help manage the remaining pain post-surgery. Orthopaedic Care & Treatment of Back Pain in Singapore At the Singapore Sports and Orthopaedic Clinic, our injury experts can help you thwart back pain in Singapore and get you back to your regular activities. Your sport doctor will conduct a thorough assessment. From their assessment, they will come up with an appropriate treatment plan, including exercise, manual techniques, and education. Regain back control of your life and rid yourself of back pain for good. A laminectomy procedure on the lower back is one of the most common procedures to treat spinal stenosis, a narrowing of space around the spinal cord. In a laminectomy, surgeons remove the lamina, a bony structure that protects the spinal cord, to relieve pressure causing neural issues and pain. Following a laminectomy surgery, orthopaedic care can aid in the recovery process and help you get back to feeling your best. Essentially, a laminectomy is performed when other options to alleviate the problem fail to work – it is often a last resort. The spine is a complex structure. It is made up of 33 vertebrae or bones. These bones of the spine protect the spinal cord. The spinal cord is home to an intricate network of neural bundles stemming from the brain. The brain and spinal cord are the structures that comprise the central nervous system. The central nervous system drives every movement, breath, and thought we make. It is the center of our being. Damage to the spinal cord can cause varying degrees of problems, including paralysis and regulatory functioning issues. The lamina is the back arch of the vertebrae bone. It protects the spinal cord from outside impact or harm. When abnormalities or bony overgrowths develop on the spine, neural functioning may become significantly impaired and pain may occur. , a narrowing of the spinal canal, may create pressure on the nerves that run through the spine. Bony overgrowths due to age or arthritis may also compress these fragile neural networks. Consequently, pain, numbness, and weakness may occur. In severe cases, the individual may struggle to walk and may lose control of their bladder and bowel movements. When the symptoms become severe enough that they impact day-to-day function and when other treatment options fail to work, a laminectomy is performed. In other words, the lamina portion of the vertebrae is removed. A laminectomy surgery in Singapore involves the use of general anesthesia. However, before surgery the appropriate tests and examinations are performed to ensure as little risk as possible. Your doctor will also ask you to avoid food and drinks for a set time before surgery. Your doctor will also ask that you avoid NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the week before your surgery. Depending on the part of the spine that the laminectomy is performed on, it often lasts 1-2 hours. The medical team measures your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels throughout the procedure. An incision is made at the affected vertebrae. The aggravating part of the lamina is removed, relieving pressure off of the spinal cord. Depending on the severity and type of condition you have, the surgery may also involve spinal fusion or the removal of a slipped disc. Your surgeon will discuss the plan with you beforehand. Following a laminectomy surgery, the surgery team will take you to a recovery room. Some will be required to stay in the hospital of a few days, while others may undergo a same-day discharge. It entirely depends on the severity of your situation and how invasive the surgery was. What Are the Risks of a Laminectomy Surgery in Singapore? As with any surgery, there are varying risks involved. These risks include: Frequently, individuals experience relief after surgery. However, surgery may not fully eliminate the cause and it will only remove the decompression in the part of the spine operated on. For example, arthritis or spinal stenosis may still progress after surgery. The surgeon will likely require you to walk and perform movements right after the surgery. These tests will ensure no damage was done to the spinal cord. They may also prescribe pain relief medication during the initial recovery stage. Take the advice of your surgeon, and slowly and gradually increase your activity levels. Follow-up appointments will help guide you through the recovery phases. Again, it may depend on your condition and the exact type of surgery performed. For example, if a bone fusion was also performed your doctor may recommend a back brace as part of the recovery process, and your recovery may be slightly longer. You will have to work to keep the incision clean and dry, particularly the first few days after surgery. If swelling or tenderness occurs at the incision site, seek out medical attention immediately. An infection could potentially develop. Your surgeon will outline how to avoid infection following the surgery. General advice following a laminectomy surgery in Singapore includes: Avoid driving for 2-4 weeks right after surgery. Discuss your options and prognosis with your surgeon. Do not bend or twist the torso. This could potentially open the incision and cause other problems. Do not smoke. Smoking may interfere with your body’s ability to heal properly and quickly. Avoid travelling. Car rides or plane rides may increase your risk of developing a blood clot. Back surgery sounds scary. It is absolutely normal to experience worries or concerns regarding your surgery and recovery. Ask questions beforehand and after the procedure. Our team of surgeons and doctors would be more than happy to address any concerns you may have. At the 6 week mark, regular activities can often gradually be resumed. Neural pain may subside in about 4-6 weeks. And pain and swelling will decrease over time and eventually, with use. Following a laminectomy, chiropractic care and physiotherapy may be recommended to help guide the rehabilitation process. Chiropractic treatment can also coincide with physiotherapy treatment, and vice versa. However, initial healing must take place before you seek out chiropractic or physiotherapy care. The body is fragile after surgery and a certain amount of rest and time must take place before any spinal manipulation is performed.

That uncomfortable and tight feeling that makes movement almost impossible and causing you a lot of discomfort throughout the entire day. Stiff neck are frequently experienced by many and it will usually go away by itself after a few days. You may rest assure that stiff neck is not an indication of any . A stiff neck is typically characterized by difficulty moving the neck, especially when trying to turn the head to the side. It may also be accompanied by a headache, neck pain, or arm pain. In order to look sideways an individual may need to turn the entire body instead of the stiff neck. Most people are familiar with the pain of a stiff neck. In most cases, pain and stiffness go away naturally within a week. If a stiff neck has not improved after a week, it should be checked by a doctor. Also, regardless of how long it has lasted, a stiff neck accompanied by fever, headache, nausea or unexplained sleepiness should be treated by a medical professional immediately. Injuries are one of the most common reasons that one will experience stiff neck. A sudden jerking movement at the neck region can injure the muscles and ligaments, causing injury and subsequent pain and stiffness. Injuries can be caused by sports, accidental falls or even a car accident. Our body response to stress is the natural tensing of our muscles. If you did not suffer any injuries recently and is experiencing stiff neck, it could be an indication that you are under tremendous stress. It’s time to take things easy and relax. Muscle spasm are due to the signalling of certain messages from our nerves to the muscles which will result in them involuntary contracting, causing stiff neck. Improper sleeping posture is probably the most common reason for stiff neck. Our body is in a relaxed state when we are asleep and an improper sleeping posture can cause the pulling of the neck muscles without us being aware of it. Only when we finally wake up do we realise it and it is often too late. is an autoimmune disorder that targets the joints, especially those in the neck. It will result in neck pain and stiffness. Meningitis is a very serious inflection of the fluid that surrounds our brain and spinal cord and if you suffer from neck pain and stiffness and they are not caused by the factors listed above, you should consult a doctor immediately as a stiff neck is a common symptom of meningitis. Your doctor will take a medical history and do an exam. He or she will check for tenderness, numbness and muscle weakness, as well as see how far you can move your head forward, backward and side to side. Your doctor might order imaging tests to get a better picture of the cause of your stiff neck. Examples include: X-rays can reveal areas in your neck where your nerves or spinal cord might be pinched by bone spurs or other degenerative changes. CT scans combine X-ray images taken from many different directions to produce detailed cross-sectional views of the internal structures of your neck. MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create detailed images of bones and soft tissues, including the spinal cord and the nerves coming from the spinal cord. It’s possible to have X-ray or MRI evidence of structural problems in your neck without having symptoms. Imaging studies are best used as an adjunct to a careful history and physical exam to determine the cause of your pain. An individual can do several things to begin treating a stiff neck. Some common self-care strategies include:  Taking it easy for one or two days gives injured tissues a chance to begin to heal, which in turn will help relieve stiffness and possible muscle spasm. For example, someone who swims may want to avoid certain swim strokes that involve lots of head twisting for a few days. However, it is recommended to limit rest to one or two days, as too much inactivity can lead to a weakening of the muscles, and weak muscles have to struggle to adequately support the neck and head.  Cold therapy/ice packs help relieve most types of neck stiffness by reducing local inflammation. Applying ice during the first 24 to 48 hours of a painful flare-up usually has the most benefit in terms of reducing inflammation. Applying heat to the neck can spur blood flow, which fosters a better healing environment. Some patients prefer ice, whereas others prefer heat. Both may be used alternately.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which work by reducing inflammation, are typically a first line of treatment for neck stiffness and soreness. Even non prescription medications have risks, possible side effects, and drug interactions, so be sure to discuss any medications with a doctor.  Stretching, as soon as tolerated, helps ease the stiffness and restore the neck to a more natural range of motion. For many, it is a good idea to learn appropriate stretches with the help of a physical therapist.  Stretching or any form of low-impact aerobic exercise, such as walking, is often helpful in relieving any type of stiffness. Even if walking does not directly involve the neck, it helps circulate oxygen to the soft tissues throughout the spine, which in turn promotes healing.

If you suffer from knee pain or have had an injury to the knee, your doctor may suggest knee to see what is going on. This procedure is an evaluation of the knee without making a large incision. It will permit your doctor to see exactly what is going on in your knee and what is causing your pain without a huge invasive procedure being done. Your doctor may suggest this less invasive procedure if you have torn a meniscus, have inflamed tissue that needs removed, have an infection in the knee, or if you have kneecap issues that can be repaired. Very tiny incisions are made into the knee where your surgeon can insert the arthroscope to see what is injured or going on in the knee. This camera will portray pictures on the monitor your doctor is watching to let them see exactly what may be causing your knee ailments at the time. During the procedure, your doctor may repair problems they find through other tiny incisions in the knee. There are special tools they can use that do not require the larger incisions of most surgeries that are performed. Your knee can be repaired while you’re in the procedure during the knee arthroscopy and it can help you heal faster. There are many benefits to having a knee arthroscopy done instead of major surgery. One of the major benefits is this is less invasive than most other knee surgeries out there. There are only tiny incisions made so the scarring is also reduced.  This also keeps the infection risk down as the incisions are smaller, and you do not have a huge wound to recover from. Using knee arthroscopy also helps to reduce the recovery time that is needed after knee surgery. If your knee has been completely opened or replaced, your recovery time will be much longer than with this procedure. You can typically return to normal activities within six weeks of this procedure and only be restricted from driving for about one to three weeks depending on the severity. You will still experience some pain as you have had a surgical procedure done. Your doctor may prescribe something for pain and also for inflammation to keep the swelling down. You’ll also be taught how to care for your wound before you leave the hospital and how to dress it as well. All in all, this procedure is a much better route to take, if possible, when you are experiencing injuries or knee problems. When it comes to everyday life your feet play a huge role.

Jumper’s Knee (Patellar Tendonitis): Symptoms & Treatments Whether you like to run for sport or just for fun, there is an injury that accounts for just less than 5% of all running injuries. Patellar Tendonitis, or jumper’s knee, is an injury to the patellar tendon that connects you knee to your tibia bone. This area takes on a huge load in any type of running or jumping movements and it can become injured quite quickly. This typically happens in men more than women but both are susceptible to this type of injury. There are a few different stages of jumper’s knee and depending on what stage you’re in will determine the symptoms you are showing. The first stage of patellar tendonitis is classified as pain after a certain exercise or movement. There is no true stopping of movement in this stage, just pain in the knee once the activity is finished. Those who are in stage two of the injury will deal with pain both after and during the activity they are participating in. In stage three, however, the pain is all the time and the activities that can be participated in are limited. The final stage of this injure is a tendon rupture and that requires the use of surgery to repair the knee injury. For those who are dealing with stage one of jumper’s knee, simple ice therapy typically does the trick. Make sure to use ice packs or even ice massage after the activity to help reduce inflammation and pain. Those in stage two will typically have physical therapy due to the pain interrupting normal everyday life. They may lose sleep because of the pain and by working with a physical therapist they can reduce the pain and get back to normalcy. Those who have reached a stage three injury should also work with the treatments above while adding in significant rest. This can be a period of three to six weeks depending on the injury and how physical therapy is working. You can also take prescription medication in any of these stages to help relieve pain if your doctor has prescribed it. Strengthening exercises and being careful about alternating your exercise regimen can help to prevent these patellar tendonitis injuries. They can cause severe pain in any level of the injury and it is imperative not to push your body too far. Be sure to talk with your doctor if you’re experiencing continuous pain during or after activity to rule out jumper’s knee. , , Scapula (Shoulder Blade) Fractures: Treatment & Management It is very uncommon to suffer from scapula fractures but it does happen. This can be due to a major trauma or other events but usually results in shoulder pain and treatment being needed. They typically occur in less than 1% of the population but do still happen from time to time. The most common age group that suffers from shoulder blade fractures are young men between the ages of 25 and 45. This is basically because of the types of activities and events that age group participates in. A shoulder blade fracture can be caused by different traumatic events. An automobile accident is one such event that can cause your shoulder pain and to fracture the scapula. Another common cause of this injury is a fall that pertains to direct impact on the shoulder. This could be an example of falling off a ladder and onto your shoulder, or falling from a height that ends in landing on your shoulder itself. This could also result in direct injuries from a baseball bat or even an impact from a hammer. Symptoms of a scapula fracture can include one holding their arm close to the body to reduce the pain, swelling and inflammation, and the inability to use the arm. If moving the arm increases the pain, this may mean that you have a shoulder fracture. Most of the time shoulder blade fractures do not require surgery for treatment. In some severe cases, surgery will be required but this is not the norm. Typically ice and anti-inflammatory medications are used to help reduce swelling and the shoulder pain that is associated with this injury. Your shoulder may also be immobilized in a sling for up to four weeks or more depending on the severity of the injury. This keeps you from moving the shoulder and potentially reinjuring it before it is properly healed. Physical therapy may also be needed to help in rebuilding the mobility after the injury has taken place. While most times shoulder blade fractures are easily treated, they need to be seen by a medical doctor before letting them go. This is because most often a shoulder fracture has been caused by a very traumatic injury. This could also be a sign that other injuries have taken place in the body that you may not be aware of. Always have a medical examination after a fall or injury such as a car accident to rule out any life-threatening injury.

669c30a4-d4b5-4129-b8d6-7d7a4787197f,"Our hips and knees undergo a lot of stress throughout our lives. These joints absorb substantial force and weight when we walk, jump, and move. With wear and tear over time, the cartilage in our joints breakdown causing pain during weight-bearing activities. Other than Cartilage wear out limb/joint misalignment, joint space narrowing, stiff joints, disease, or traumatic conditions may inflict pain and limit movement and mobility Arthroplasty surgery can lead to restored function of these joints and an improved overall quality of life. The new joint can last up to 15-20 years. Trends in Singapore continue towards most individuals having at least one arthroplasty procedure in their lifetime The most common Arthroplasty Surgeries in Singapore replace the hip or knee joint. It is one of the most effective and affordable surgeries in Singapore. With technological improvements, joint replacement surgery continually gets better, fast and cheaper. Undergoing an Arthroplasty surgery can benefit individuals by The overall outcome of these procedures are high, with almost all experiencing decreased pain levels and improved functioning. However, as with any surgery, the procedure does not come without its risks. Risks include: These risks are often higher in those that suffer from pre-existing conditions beforehand. Degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis, are the most common reasons for undergoing an Arthroplasty Surgery. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Over time, wear and tear causes the protective cartilage in between bones to breakdown. This creates painful bone-on-bone grinding. Other reasons for undergoing an Arthroplasty procedure include injury or damage to the joint, necrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. While physiotherapy and chiropractic care methods may help ease the pain via strengthening of the surrounding muscles, pain may still persist. When the pain begins to interfere with one’s quality of life and daily activities, an Arthroplasty procedure is often recommended. In short, the affected joint is either replaced or partially reconstructed. Since the 2 most common procedures involve the hip or knee, the following outlines hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries in a step-by-step process. A general anesthesia is administered. This will allow you to sleep during the surgery and allow your muscles to relax making the operation easier for the surgical team to perform. You will also feel no pain during the procedure. The ball portion of the femur bone is removed and replaced with an artificial part. Damaged portions of hip bone, such as cartilage, are removed. The replaced ball portion of the femur bone is then inserted into the hip. Tissue, such as muscle, is reattached, and the incision is, then, closed. A general anesthesia is administered. This will allow you to sleep during the surgery and allow your muscles to relax making the operation easier for the surgical team to perform. You will also feel no pain during the procedure. An incision is made vertically in the front of the kneecap. The kneecap is moved out of the way to make room to perform the surgery directly on the joint. Damage to the femur bone is removed. It is, then, resurfaced to fit the artificial piece. An artificial piece is attached to the end of the femur bone. The top of the shin bone is treated in a similar fashion. Damaged portions are removed and the top of the shin bone is fitted with an artificial piece. A plastic piece is snapped into the top of the shin bone’s new part to help the knee bend properly. The patella is adjusted. A plastic piece may also be added to the patella to allow it to fit properly in the new knee joint. The joint is moved to ensure each piece is functioning properly. Then, the incision is closed. Before surgery, the appropriate examinations and tests are carried out to minimize risks. Your surgeon will fully explain the procedure and answer any questions you may have. You will also be advised not to consume any food for a set time before the procedure. If you are on a waitlist for surgery or have months in advance to plan, it is recommended to begin strengthening around the area before undergoing the procedure. Strengthening these muscles beforehand will help with the recovery process. Discuss your options with your surgeon or your chiropractor and physiotherapist. Following an Arthroplasty surgery in Singapore, your surgical team may require that you move your joint the right away. For hip replacement surgery, you may be required to walk right after surgery.

Get back to your regular activities and get back to enjoying your life. Ligament Tears are a common injury people experience, especially with those who are active in sports. Yet, many of us are quite clueless while trying to imagine which of portion of the body it is that actually gets affected. And rightly so, coz Ligaments aren’t a prominent body organ nor is it something that visible externally to the human eye. So, ignorance on this subject can be quite rational. In this post lets learn more about Ligaments, get a bit well-versed in appreciating its functions and gain some understanding of what happens on someone has torn ligament injury. Ligaments are fibrous and flexible tissues that connect our bones to other bones. They help to support the joints and allow a normal range of motion for the joints. Ligaments have high tensile strength due to the high density of collagen present. Ligaments also provide proprioceptive inputs to the brain and allow the body to perform complex activities required in sports. Injuries to the ligament are common in high impact (such as Badminton), high speed sports (especially athletics) with the knee and ankle being the most vulnerable. A structural damage to the ligaments is known as ligament sprains. There are some ligament injuries that are much more common than others and let’s take a look at them. (ACL) injuries are common is high impact sports like football, soccer, rugby and basketball. The ACL is one of the 4 main ligaments in the knee which joins the femur to the tibia. Nearly 50% of patients who experience ACL injuries suffer it in combination with injuries to other parts of the knee such as the meniscus and medial collateral ligament. ACL injuries occur most commonly from sudden twisting motion when the foot is still firmly planted on the ground while the knee is trying to change direction, causing the ACL to rupture. An ACL reconstruction will be the most viable option after injury as ligaments cannot heal by themselves. The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is another main ligament of the knee which provides stability to the knee. The MCL is located from the end of the femur to the top of the tibia and it prevents the knee from opening up. Due to its preventive features, it is commonly injured when there is an impact on the outside of the knee joint which causes the knee to buckle and the knee to open up. MCL injuries are also mostly in conjunction with ACL and meniscus injuries. If it is a standalone MCL injury, surgery is often not required and patients can get on with their lives pretty well with the help of a knee brace to provide stability. The (GHL) are located in the shoulders at the Glenohumeral joint which provides stability to the shoulder. The Glenohumeral joint connects the upper arm bone to the humerus and the shoulder blade. Injuries to the Glenohumeral joint occurs due to a fall and the patient landing on an outstretched arm, sudden twisting of the arm to beyond the normal motion range and a sudden impact on the shoulder, causing the ligaments to tear. Above are 3 of the common ligament injuries that are experienced by many. Although ligaments are strong fibrous tissues, they can rupture if a sudden impact or twisting motion is applied on it. Ligaments are important in ensuring stability of the specific part of the body so extreme care should be taken to protect it. Our knee is supported by 4 main ligaments – anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), , lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Each of the ligament plays a different role in ensuring the stability of the knee. However, due to various reasons, the ligaments can be torn. Rupture of the ligament can be a partial one or a full one and this will affect the treatment administered. A ligament tear will also bring about instability in the knee and the inability for it to bear weight, causing problems when walking. In this article, we will look at some of the symptoms and treatments for ligament tears. As a general rule of thumb, a partially torn ligament will not bring about a pop sound while a fully ruptured one will produce a pop sound. A fully torn one can create instant instability and the knee may give way. Swelling occurs and the injured knee may start to turn purple due to the lack of proper blood flow to the area. Swelling occurs due to a build-up of blood from the injured ligament. The knee is unable to function properly, and you may feel that you are unable to control it. Resting the knee immediately following injury for at least 48 hours. If you need to move around, consider using crutches or walkers to prevent bearing weight on the injured knee. Ice will bring down swelling and reduce inflammation. Always try to ice the area every hour by using a cold compress or simply by wrapping knee in a towel and applying it locally. Compress the knee with a bandage to reduce swelling and prevent excessive movements. Elevate the knee to above your heart level to reduce swelling. This will cause excessive blood to flow away due to gravity towards your heart. Here are the common treatment options for recovery from torn or ruptured Ligaments. The intensity of treatment needed and estimated knee sprain recovery time are dependent upon the severity of the injury. Strengthening the knee and its surrounding muscles, tendons, and ligaments can help to repair ligament injuries. Specific knee ligament injury treatment exercises can help to repair ligament damage and restore full function to the knee. Wearing a knee brace or using crutches can help stabilize the knee and prevent sideways movements that may increase ligament damage and prevent healing and increase knee sprain recovery time. For serious injuries or tears associated with other injuries normal healing may not help, in such cases your doctor will most likely recommend a surgical solution. The ligament is a fibrous tissue and its main function is to connect bones to another bone and prevent abnormal joint motions. Injuries to ligaments will take a long time to heal. However, good nutrition can help to speed up the recovery process. The vitamins and minerals in food can help to facilitate healing. The first step of any injury is to reduce inflammation in the region and foods that contain are especially useful due to its anti-inflammatory properties which help to eliminate protein from the injured region. Foods that are rich in proteolytic enzymes include pineapples and ginger roots. is another mineral that is excellent in combating . The way our body works is fascinating. When one part of the body is injured, it will divert all the zinc in the body to the injured part to counter inflammation. As such, other parts of the body will have a zinc deficiency. In order to prevent zinc deficiency, it is important to consume foods that are rich in zinc such as oysters, wheat germ and veal liver. has excellent anti-inflammatory properties as well and when worked together with Proteolytic enzymes, it provides an even better result. Vitamin C is not a vitamin that they body can self synthesize. As such, patients will need to consume it in order for the body to possess it. Vitamin C is also required to produce collagen in the body and this is important in ligament healing. Foods that are rich in Vitamin C include citrus fruits, broccoli and tomatoes. is the building block of our body and it is required by the body for any healing process. Protein can easily be obtained from foods such as tofu, meat, eggs and soy products. Protein deficiency will lead to various in the body. Although the body’s metabolism is low during injury, there is still a need to consume sufficient on a daily basis. Calories are required in the healing process and if patients decide to cut down severely on their calorie intake, this will slow down the recovery process. Ligament injuries will require , surgery and proper nutrition to ensure a speedy recovery. Proper nutrition is not difficult to achieve. Although your movements will be severely limited, you can always ask a dear one to help you out in ensuring you receive sufficient nutrition daily.

It is a form of arthritis that causes stiffness, tenderness, and pain in the joints. It can make movement difficult and very painful. Luckily, gout treatment can help you manage your symptoms. Orthopaedic care offers a holistic approach to treating gout. At the Singapore Sports and Orthopaedic Clinic, our qualified experts can help find the best solution and gout treatment in Singapore, for you and your lifestyle. Gout (podagra) is a disease that results from an overload of uric acid in the body. This overload of uric acid leads to the formation of tiny crystals of urate that deposit in tissues of the body, especially the joints. When crystals form in the joints, it causes recurring attacks of joint inflammation (arthritis). Gout is considered a chronic and progressive disease. Chronic gout can also lead to deposits of hard lumps of uric acid in the tissues, particularly in and around the joints and may cause joint destruction, decreased kidney function, and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). .’ Why? Certain foods with a high purine content, such as shellfish and red meat, and alcohol trigger gout attacks. During this era, these foods and alcohol were limited to royalty and the extremely wealthy. Thus, middle and lower class civilians rarely experienced the disease. Today, the prevalence and incidences of gout have steadily increased. Our diets have changed. And with technology, we can detect and diagnose gout much easier than ever before. Gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid in the body. Usually, the kidneys filter and then excrete uric acid through the urine. In certain circumstances, the body may produce uric acid at a higher rate than it can expel it. When uric acid levels in the blood become too high, the body deposits monosodium urate crystals in the joints. These crystals irritate our joints, and cause the symptoms commonly associated with gout including: The body may be unable to keep up with uric acid levels for a number of reasons. Our body breaks purine down into uric acid. Purine is found in alcohol beverages, various meats, and seafood. When we consume foods high in purine, our bodies may lack the ability to keep up with the production of uric acid. This results in hyperuricemia, or high uric acid levels, in the blood. In other cases, kidney impairment may cause higher uric acid levels. If the kidneys are unable to excrete uric acid, it builds in the blood. Impaired kidney function may occur due to diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, thyroid disorders, or kidney failure. Genetics and certain medications are also thought to play a role in the development of gout. For example, used to treat high blood pressure can lead to gout. Diuretics increase your fluid output. Yet, the fluid left in the body may become highly concentrated with uric acid. Doctors advise drinking plenty of fluids when taking diuretics and avoiding foods high in purine to reduce the risk of gout. Prior to gout treatment in Singapore, a proper diagnosis must be made by a physician. Your doctor may take into account a number of factors. They may assess and ask questions relating to the following: Do you regularly consume alcoholic beverages in high amounts? Are you on certain medications, such as diuretics? A joint fluid test and blood test will confirm a gout diagnosis. In a joint fluid test, fluid is taken from the inflamed and painful joint via a needle. If crystals are present in the fluid, a gout diagnosis is made. Your doctor may further order an x-ray to ensure the pain is not caused by other problems. Exploring the Relationship Between Gout & Joint Pain Gout can cause sudden intense painful attacks at the joints, causing swelling and redness of the joint tissues. It usually attacks the joint of the big toe but this does not rule out the attacks on other joints. Gout usually affects men with 9 out of 10 patients being men. Once gout starts to attack other joints, it leads to inflammatory arthritis. Let’s look at the relationship between Gout and Joint pain here. Gout happens due to an excessive accumulation of uric acid. Uric acid is formed when the body breaks down an aromatic organic compound called purines. Purines are found in foods such as livers, beans, mackerel and beer. Overconsumption of such foods will lead to a high level of purines, resulting in too much uric acid. The body’s natural mechanism of dealing with uric acid is by passing them out through urination but when this urination process is less efficient, hyperuricemia occurs, leading to gout. This is the onset of gout. In this first stage, the patient starts to have an excessive accumulation of uric acid in the body but no other symptoms or problems are present. It is also in this stage that the problem can easily be reversed by significantly reducing the amount of purine-rich foods. When no actions were performed to limit the consumption of purine-rich foods, the uric acid levels will increased and lead to the formation of uric crystals in the spaces between the joint. Due to the crystals and high acidity, sudden onset of intense pain will occur and this can lead to swelling in the joints. Attacks will be infrequent and can be spaced weeks or even months apart from each, but as time passes, the attacks will become more and more common. This stage is the most serious and will only happen after 10 years. A patient will only reach this stage when he makes no attempt to seek treatment and gout has caused a permanent damage to the joints and kidneys. There is an exponential relationship between gout and joint pain, leading to sudden onsets of pain attack and swelling. However, reaching from one stage to the other takes time and during the periods, it can be treated by medication and reduction in consumption of purine-rich foods. Gout will cause a lot of trauma and severely affect patients. In some cases, gout is very dehabiliting. It can happen suddenly and be very painful. The most common spot for gout to occur is in the big toe. Although, it may spread to the ankles, feet, and knees. Fortunately, gout is a very treatable condition. And we offer a variety of ways to treat the disease. When a gout attack occurs, it will often resolve on its own in about a week. Thus, many health professions focus on relieving the symptoms and preventing future incidents. Medications are the most common go-to. NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may alleviate swelling and pain. Your doctor may also prescribe stronger pain medication if over-the-counter drugs aren’t helping. Medications that help lower uric acid levels may also be considered. These type of medications help to prevent attacks by reducing the production of uric acid. However, long-term use of most of these drugs is not recommended. Surprisingly, NSAIDs can have fairly dangerous side effects. With chronic use, heart problems may arise. Prescription NSAIDs are particularly problematic for this. You may experience gastro-intestinal issues. These medications may cause bleeding and ulcers when used for long-periods or at high dosages. Such medication may also lead to further impaired kidney function, which not only doesn’t help the problem but can amplify gout occurrences and symptoms. When using any medication, make sure to follow the direction on the label and read the warnings prior to consumption. Your healthcare provider may also consider the medication you are currently taking and make modifications where it is necessary. If your diet is the main problem, your healthcare provider may discuss other dietary options that do not increase your risk of gout. They will advise you to avoid foods high in purine and to drink plenty of water throughout your day. The treatment of an acute attack of gouty arthritis involves measures and medications that reduce inflammation. Preventing future acute gout attacks is equally as important as treating the acute arthritis. Prevention of acute gout involves maintaining adequate fluid intake, weight reduction, dietary changes, reduction in alcohol consumption, and medications to lower the uric acid level in the blood. Maintaining adequate fluid intake helps prevent acute gout attacks. Adequate fluid intake also decreases the risk of kidney stone formation in patients with gout. Alcohol is known to have diuretic effects that can contribute to dehydration and precipitate acute gout attacks. Alcohol can also affect uric acid metabolism to cause hyperuricemia. Therefore, alcohol has two major effects that worsen gout by slowing down the excretion of uric acid from the kidneys as well as by causing dehydration, both of which contribute to the precipitation of uric acid crystals in the joints. At the Singapore Sports and Orthopaedic Clinic, our experts can diagnose, treat, and prevent joint, neuro, and muscular disorders, such as gout. They can provide exercise and nutritional advice to help treat gout. Your doctor will address your nutritional and lifestyle choices, in combination with manual manipulation of the joints to eliminate your pain, improve mobility, reduce the incidences of gout attacks, and help increase your overall quality of life. Your healthcare provider may recommend the following foods to replace high-purine content foods in your diet: Surgery is a rare option for treating gout. However, in cases where there is a lack of draining, the area has become infected, or movement is severely impacted, surgery may provide the best option. Your healthcare provider may also recommend specific exercises to reduce joint pain and increase support to the commonly affected areas. Weaknesses in the body may lead to pain and conditions such as gout. Strengthening around these areas can lessen the pain symptoms associated with the condition. Weight management is also important to limit the stress placed on the joints that are prone to gout attacks. Your treatment will likely involve an exercise program tailored to your specific needs, including strengthening exercises and possible weight loss strategies.

That uncomfortable and tight feeling that makes movement almost impossible and causing you a lot of discomfort throughout the entire day. Stiff neck are frequently experienced by many and it will usually go away by itself after a few days. You may rest assure that stiff neck is not an indication of any . A stiff neck is typically characterized by difficulty moving the neck, especially when trying to turn the head to the side. It may also be accompanied by a headache, neck pain, or arm pain. In order to look sideways an individual may need to turn the entire body instead of the stiff neck. Most people are familiar with the pain of a stiff neck. In most cases, pain and stiffness go away naturally within a week. If a stiff neck has not improved after a week, it should be checked by a doctor. Also, regardless of how long it has lasted, a stiff neck accompanied by fever, headache, nausea or unexplained sleepiness should be treated by a medical professional immediately. Injuries are one of the most common reasons that one will experience stiff neck. A sudden jerking movement at the neck region can injure the muscles and ligaments, causing injury and subsequent pain and stiffness. Injuries can be caused by sports, accidental falls or even a car accident. Our body response to stress is the natural tensing of our muscles. If you did not suffer any injuries recently and is experiencing stiff neck, it could be an indication that you are under tremendous stress. It’s time to take things easy and relax. Muscle spasm are due to the signalling of certain messages from our nerves to the muscles which will result in them involuntary contracting, causing stiff neck. Improper sleeping posture is probably the most common reason for stiff neck. Our body is in a relaxed state when we are asleep and an improper sleeping posture can cause the pulling of the neck muscles without us being aware of it. Only when we finally wake up do we realise it and it is often too late. is an autoimmune disorder that targets the joints, especially those in the neck. It will result in neck pain and stiffness. Meningitis is a very serious inflection of the fluid that surrounds our brain and spinal cord and if you suffer from neck pain and stiffness and they are not caused by the factors listed above, you should consult a doctor immediately as a stiff neck is a common symptom of meningitis. Your doctor will take a medical history and do an exam. He or she will check for tenderness, numbness and muscle weakness, as well as see how far you can move your head forward, backward and side to side. Your doctor might order imaging tests to get a better picture of the cause of your stiff neck. Examples include: X-rays can reveal areas in your neck where your nerves or spinal cord might be pinched by bone spurs or other degenerative changes. CT scans combine X-ray images taken from many different directions to produce detailed cross-sectional views of the internal structures of your neck. MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create detailed images of bones and soft tissues, including the spinal cord and the nerves coming from the spinal cord. It’s possible to have X-ray or MRI evidence of structural problems in your neck without having symptoms. Imaging studies are best used as an adjunct to a careful history and physical exam to determine the cause of your pain. An individual can do several things to begin treating a stiff neck. Some common self-care strategies include:  Taking it easy for one or two days gives injured tissues a chance to begin to heal, which in turn will help relieve stiffness and possible muscle spasm. For example, someone who swims may want to avoid certain swim strokes that involve lots of head twisting for a few days. However, it is recommended to limit rest to one or two days, as too much inactivity can lead to a weakening of the muscles, and weak muscles have to struggle to adequately support the neck and head.  Cold therapy/ice packs help relieve most types of neck stiffness by reducing local inflammation. Applying ice during the first 24 to 48 hours of a painful flare-up usually has the most benefit in terms of reducing inflammation. Applying heat to the neck can spur blood flow, which fosters a better healing environment. Some patients prefer ice, whereas others prefer heat. Both may be used alternately.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which work by reducing inflammation, are typically a first line of treatment for neck stiffness and soreness. Even non prescription medications have risks, possible side effects, and drug interactions, so be sure to discuss any medications with a doctor.  Stretching, as soon as tolerated, helps ease the stiffness and restore the neck to a more natural range of motion. For many, it is a good idea to learn appropriate stretches with the help of a physical therapist.  Stretching or any form of low-impact aerobic exercise, such as walking, is often helpful in relieving any type of stiffness. Even if walking does not directly involve the neck, it helps circulate oxygen to the soft tissues throughout the spine, which in turn promotes healing.

Symptoms And Treatments For Osteoarthritis Of The Big Toe Osteoarthritis is a form of degenerative arthritis that causes pain and swelling in joints. Due to the wear and tear of cartilage in the joint, the bones become more prominent and as a result, rub against each other as they move. While the condition occurs gradually, it worsens over time if left untreated. The big toe is a common area to be affected by osteoarthritis. Most cases of osteoarthritis come with age, starting from ages 30 to 60. As the body system slows down, the cartilage deteriorates faster than it can heal, resulting in osteoarthritis to develop. Obesity also increases the risk of developing the condition. With additional pressure from the body weight, the bones of the feet are stressed and may accelerate the damage of cartilage in the big toe. Some people are born with an overgrowth of the big toe bone, making the toe joint stiff and difficult to bend, thus more susceptible to developing osteoarthritis. Some of the first signs of osteoarthritis of the big toe include stiffness, achiness, tenderness and pain in the affected toe, though may also be felt in the arch of the foot and other toes. The toe feels most achy and stiff in the morning and after sitting for a long period of time. Gradually, you would start to notice swelling around the joint. It might be some time before the bone spur becomes visibly noticeable. However, you would feel the bones rubbing together and causing the area to swell as they get more prominent. As the big toe gets stiffer, it gets harder to bend the toes. Walking and balancing becomes difficult and painful. The constant rubbing between the toes can cause corns and calluses to form, and even leading to other conditions such as hammer toes. Conservative treatment for osteoarthritis may not cure the condition but can relief the symptoms. Your doctor might prescribe painkillers and anti-inflammatory medicine to ease the pain and bring down the swelling. There are also creams and gels to reduce the swelling. Orthoses can be inserted in your shoes to decrease the pressure while walking. It is best to avoid high heels and pointy-toed shoes as these shoes give puts stress on the feet and may aggravate the symptoms. For very severe cases, your doctor might recommend a joint replacement surgery. The damaged cartilage is removed and the joint is held together in a fixed and immovable position so that the cartilage would not be affected again. However, the results of the surgery might cause a reduction in mobility. Thus, this procedure may only be suitable for elderly patients that do not require as much mobility in daily activities. , , , , Shoulder Joint Tear (Glenoid Labrum Tear): Symptoms & Prevention The shoulder joint is composed of three different types of bones: the shoulder blade, upper arm bone and collarbone. This type of joint is a ball and socket joint, allowing for extreme flexibility and wide range of motion. The upper arm bone acts like a ball and is securely inside the shoulder blade socket. For stabilization purposes, the upper arm bone is slightly larger than the socket, ensuring that the fit is tight. To further enhance the stability, there is a layer of soft tissue called the labrum. Injuries to the labrum is the cause of a shoulder joint tear. In this article, we will look at some of the symptoms and preventive measures. Symptoms of Glenoid Labrum tears are difficult to be diagnosed. The pain is unable to be localized to the exact location and pain is severely increased when actions involving the injured shoulder is attempted. Such actions can include stretching the arm or raising a hand. As time passes, the shoulder will be weaker and instability will start to set in. Shoulder joint tears are often caused by a sudden trauma to the shoulder blade. These can include falling on an outstretched arm or a direct blow to the shoulder. In order to prevent this, protective measures should be taken: Have you ever taken a rubber band and pulled it suddenly? The rubber band will end up breaking immediately. This is the same for our muscles and it is the reason why warm ups and stretching are extremely important. Warming up will loosen the muscles and enable the tendons and to stretch. This will allow them to function properly and hold the shoulder joint together. Shoulder joint tears are also much more common in players engaging in high impact sports such as rugby and baseball. Players often wear protective paddings designed for the shoulder. These cushioning pads are able to cushion and absorb shocks to a certain extent. Some are even able to prevent fractures and dislocations. Building up strength in the shoulders will increase the ability of tendons, ligaments and muscles to withstand the impact experienced by the shoulder. Strong muscles will hold the shoulder together and prevent any muscular tears during an impact. Shoulder joint tears are extremely painful and affects our daily lifestyle. Players who participate in high impact or repetitive sports shoulder consider investing in good protective gears and ensure that proper warm ups are performed prior to the start of their activity. Symptoms And Treatments For Osteoarthritis Of The Hip Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that affects any joint in the body. One of the most common places is the hip due to the tremendous amount of stress and workload it faces day in day out. As we age, the cartilage in our joint will start to lessen due to wear and tear. You can simply imagine the cartilage to be a soft cushion located in between the joints and its main function is to absorb any shock experienced by that particular joint. Without this cushion, there will be a direct bone-to-bone interaction. When this occurs, pain and tenderness will kick in. There will be restricted mobility in that joint due to severe pain and simple daily activities can be difficult. Let’s look at some symptoms and treatments for hip osteoarthritis below. The very first symptom one will experience is the discomfort at the hip joint. This pain is amplified after periods of inactivity such as sitting down for long periods or waking up from a sleep in the morning. When you start to work out the hip through activities such as walking or jogging, the pain is also increased tremendously. There may be also a cracking sound and feel experienced when you are using the hip. The very first form of treatment a doctor will administer is medication to help manage the pain. It can come in either an oral or injection form. Some of the common oral medications are ibuprofen, naproxen and acetaminophen. These are usually strong enough to help control the pain adequately. However in serious cases, corticosteroid drugs may need to be injected directly into the hip for an immediate reduction in pain and swelling. In serious cases where the pain persists despite medication treatment, a surgical treatment may be considered. The most common type is a total hip replacement surgery. The damaged bone and cartilage are removed entirely and replaced with man-made ones. The femoral head will be removed and a metallic stem will be placed into the hollow center of the femur. A ceramic ball will be placed at the upper stem and it acts as a replacement for the femoral head. Ceramics are preferred as they are much more biocompatible than metals. The worn out cartilage will also be removed and screws will be used to hold the socket in place. In order to provide a smooth surface, a ceramic spacer will be inserted to reduce coefficient of friction between the two surfaces. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not a selective disease. This indicates that RA can occur in any joint in the body, destroying it and causing pain and bringing disability to the patient. RA usually attack joints that are located in the upper groin region but is not limited to that only. In the initial stages, any form of strenuous activities such as jogging, running or even carrying a heavy object can aggravate the pain. As it slowly progresses, it will start to affect the quality of sleep and lead to patients being disorientated. Hip surgery is one of the most effective treatment methods of RA and we will look into it in this article. Total hip replacement (THR) is the most common form of surgical treatment for RA with the other being hip resurfacing. In THR, there are three different components for the implant; the stem, ball and socket. The stem will fit itself into the femur while the ball will replace the spherical head of the femur and finally the cup will replace the worn out hip socket. The materials used for the implant have specifically been chosen for the biocompatibility properties. This means that they will not react with the body fluids and chemicals and ultimately causing an undesired immune response from the host body. The materials are also resistant to corrosion and are long-lasting in the region of a decade or more. The mechanical properties are as good as or even better than the natural components of the hip. THR will be performed in a sterile operating theatre that is free of bacteria in order to prevent infection. Patients will be given a general anesthesia jab, which will cause them to fall asleep throughout the surgery. An incision will be made along the side of the hips and can be as long as 25cm. However, this incision will not be visible as the clothes will be able to cover it decently. The diseased joint will be removed with a surgical saw and the bone will be cleaned and prep for the arrival of the new prosthesis. There will be proper drainage systems to remove blood from the region and when everything is over, sutures will be used to close up the incision. As with all forms of surgery, there are risks involved. There will always be a slight chance of the formation of a blood clot and infection despite sterilizing the operating theatre. Possible Benefits Of Total Hip Resurfacing Arthroplasty Total hip resurfacing is a surgical procedure with the intention of restoring the function of a hip for a patient suffering from degenerative joint diseases. Some of the common degenerative joint diseases include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic arthritis to name a few. It is one of the few surgical techniques that can help patients lead an active lifestyle, with the next common one being hip replacement surgery. In recent years, there has been an increase in interest with regards to hip resurfacing. This is largely due to the fact that the bone will be preserved in this case unlike traditional hip replacement, which requires the removal of the hip joint and replaced with an artificial one. In this article, we will discuss about some of the possible benefits of total hip resurfacing arthroplasty over other techniques. Unlike traditional hip replacement surgery, hip resurfacing is much more future proof. Both hip replacement and hip resurfacing uses a man-made component, which will eventually wear out over time. The implant is designed to last between 10 to 20 years before failure. Once failure occurs, a surgery will be performed to remove the failed component and replaced with a brand new one. In a hip replacement surgery, the bone is removed from the femur and revision surgery will be made more difficult. Instead, hip resurfacing does not remove the bone from the femur. Therefore, replacement of the implants is much more simpler, effectively future-proofing it. The hip joint is essentially a ball and socket joint, which allows a wide range of motion. In a hip resurfacing surgery, the replacement ball is much bigger than the one used in hip replacement with dimensions closed to the original one. Since it provides a tighter fit, it is much more difficult to fall out of the joint. Thus, dislocation risks are restricted. Patients who choose hip resurfacing over hip replacement tend to enjoy an increased range of motion. This is due to the fact that bone was not removed from the body and the ball and socket joint is fitted better. Patients who had undergone hip resurfacing will be able to walk more naturally compared to patients who did hip replacement. There will be minimal limping and the hip is able to perform close to what it could previously. Recovery from a total hip resurfacing surgery will take roughly 6 weeks. Throughout this period, physical therapy will be required to prevent scarring and regain the strength and range of motion. Immediately after your total joint replacement surgery, you will be moved into a recovery room to be monitored for a couple of hours. After the anaesthesia has worn off and you are awake, you will then be moved to your ward where you will stay for the next few days. A typical stay in the hospital will be between 3 to 5 days depending on your progress. Before the effects of the anaesthesia have fully worn off, you should consume pain killers to prevent a sudden onset of unbearable pain. So how do you recover from total joint replacement surgery? Muscle atrophy is the result of depriving muscles activities, leading to muscle wastage. This can happen after a couple of days post surgery, leading to shrinking of muscles and muscular apoptosis. In order to prevent this, physical therapy will be required. helps to strengthen the hip joints through various small but effective exercises. It usually begins almost immediately after surgery in order to prevent scar tissues from forming. A physical therapist will be there to teach you some basic exercises to help you regain strength and full hip movement in the shortest time. It continues even when you have been discharged, and you will be required to show up for your physical therapy classes up to 4 times a week. Hip replacement surgery has a low risk and infections are at a low rate of 2%. However, this does not mean that you are completely clear of any complications. Blood clots in the leg veins can occur due to prolonged immobility, leading to serious consequences if they travel up to the heart or brain. Therefore, some surgeons will recommend the usage of compressive stockings. As time passes, the hip will be stronger and the usage of walking aids such as crutches or walkers will no longer be required. Some patients will tend to get complacent and start to skip physical therapy sessions or ignore symptoms which may indicate infection. Therefore, always be mindful of your responsibilities as a patient and continue your physical therapy sessions until your therapist has given you the all clear. Your new hip will be able to last you for at least a decade and provide you with freedom you never imagined. However, you still need to know that it is an artificial joint inside you and materials can fail due to various reasons and a second surgery may be required in future.
