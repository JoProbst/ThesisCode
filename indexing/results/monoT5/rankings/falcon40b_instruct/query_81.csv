The most common of these accommodations were flexible hours, written job instructions, the ability to work from home, and memory aids. Developing and achieving employment goals can be accomplished despite an MS diagnosis -- and the National MS Society is here to work with you as you navigate your options. The symptoms of MS commonly appear in early adulthood, at a time when young people are typically establishing themselves in their careers. While the initial symptoms might not interfere with work activities to any significant degree, symptoms can change over the years, likely requiring some adaptation in the working life of the person with MS. In this study by researchers at The State University of New York, Buffalo, 25.7% of people with MS surveyed had experienced a decline in employment over three years, most often a change from full-time to part-time employment or to complete unemployment. This loss within a short period of time highlights the need to identify those at risk for job issues quickly, and to find ways to address those issues with workplace accommodations. The factor most associated with negative employment changes was what the investigators called reduced conscientiousness (being diligent, organized). Accommodations might help to increase the ability of people with MS to better organize themselves and become more goal-oriented at work. The National MS Society provides for developing and achieving employment goals, including a video series, “,” guidance on deciding whether and when to disclose MS to employers,  how to identify and request effective , and , a workbook to help in considering career-related options. “Conscientiousness and deterioration in employment status in multiple sclerosis over 3 years” by Michael G Jaworski, III, Ralph HB Benedict, PhD, and colleagues at State University of New York, Buffalo, is published in the (Published online August 6, 2020).

e139a568-75c8-4518-be5e-f675f0ad865e,"Study identifies determinants of unemployment in individuals with multiple sclerosis Lauren Strober, PhD, at Kessler Foundation recently published results of the first prospective study of employment and multiple sclerosis (MS). Dr. Strober compared two groups of individuals with MS - those 'at risk' and 'not at risk' for unemployment, examining the influences of multiple factors on the likelihood of staying in the workplace. The article, ""Determinants of unemployment in multiple sclerosis (MS): The role of disease measures, person-specific factors, and engagement in positive health-related behaviors"" was epublished on September 2, 2020 by . Multiple sclerosis affects people aged 20 to 50 years, comprising the peak working years. More than 90% are in the workforce at the time of their diagnosis, but on average, only 30% to 45% are employed after diagnosis. Unemployment has a negative impact on individuals and their families, as well as on society, in terms of lost productivity. Researchers receive $651,997 funding to study memory dysfunction in MS Novel compound appears to protect myelin and nerve fibers Anti-inflammatory therapy helps slow progression of multiple sclerosis in a preclinical model Moreover, there are several physical and mental health ""costs"" associated with one becoming unemployed. Examining the factors that contribute to individuals with MS leaving the workforce is essential to identifying people at risk, and finding ways to help them maintain employment. For this prospective study, 252 individuals with MS aged 20 to 64, who were working full- or part-time, were recruited through the national and local chapters of the National MS Society. A survey administered at the outset of the study identified 67 participants at risk for unemployment, defined as considering reducing their hours or leaving their jobs in the near future. The 'at risk' and 'not at risk' groups were compared by disease measures, person-specific factors, and health-related behaviors. Individuals at risk tended to have progressive disease, more fatigue, poorer coping mechanisms, and less MS self-. They were also less likely to report engaging in positive behaviors such as healthful diets, exercise, and social and intellectual activities."" Dr. Lauren Strober, senior research scientist in the Center for Neuropsychology and Neuroscience Research at Kessler Foundation ""Risk of unemployment is highest during the first three to five years after diagnosis, so we need to be able to intervene early to prevent job losses, and their subsequent impact on physical and mental health, as well as on personal and family finances. This study points to factors related to risk of unemployment that may be amenable to early intervention,"" said Dr. Strober. ""While further research is needed, professionals who provide MS care should be aware of the potential impact of this diagnosis on future employment, and be prepared to intervene before individuals leave the work force.""

12d1a655-f624-4bce-84bb-178af7518403,"How I Created Flexible, Remote Work While Living with a Chronic Illness — by Jennifer Chesak If you get up in the morning with purpose and you finish the day having been productive — whatever that means to you — everything in your life will benefit from it. In 2008, I was a stay-at-home mom to two cute little girls, ages 4 and 6. I thought the exhaustion was just part of motherhood. It wasn’t until I woke up with my sight doubling that I went to see a doctor. I saw several doctors and eventually received a diagnosis of . The neurologist actually told me that he was glad I didn’t “work” because stress was the very worst thing for MS — and I should never consider working again. Was he kidding? He obviously had never stayed home with little ones. Now is stressful. Telling me I can’t do something is like daring me to do it. As soon as both kids were in school full-time, I went back to work — full-time. And I loved it. I loved the people. I loved the work. I loved everything about it, until one day, I couldn’t distinguish between the gas pedal and the brake. I wasn’t too sure which side of the road I was supposed to drive on either. Maybe that doctor was right. Stress really bad for MS. I had a full on relapse. That was the end of my career — or so it appeared. Being home, resting when I needed to, eating well, taking my meds, stretching out my spastic muscles throughout the day, and taking walks all helped turn my health around for the better. I got through that relapse and “rebalanced” my life. It was necessary and I knew I had made the right decision to leave my job. But it made me sad. I felt unproductive and sort of lost. Quitting work for my health meant that my paychecks quit coming, too. But my bills didn’t. I was ineligible for because of the break in my work history due to staying home raising my daughters. I decided that I needed to find a way to work remotely so that I could have an income, while also caring for myself and my health. When I tell you I tried a little bit of everything, I really did. I took a very expensive course in digital ads management, I did social media posting for local businesses, I took many, many other courses to learn how to do . I edited resumes for people, I wrote content for business websites, I sold my clothes to consignment stores. I hired an online business coach. I so wanted to find something flexible and remote that would allow me to take care of myself and still generate an income. Instead, I was throwing money away on scam courses and bogus coaching programs. When I was waiting for my diagnosis, everything I saw online about MS was horrible. So I started my own website, , to share my story and provide support to others with MS. I wanted it to be a soft place for people with MS to land and to see that there was life after diagnosis. I even started a to interview experts and other MSers. It was all done with no plan, just a desire to help other people in the same boat I found myself. One day, I was pulling weeds in my garden and thinking about how I could make an income from home when it suddenly occurred to me that I had assets that I could monetize: my website and podcast! I set out to learn how to make money from FUMS, which included even more online courses, mastermind groups, a lot of reading and studying, multiple podcast episodes, and posting a ton of questions all over the internet. Slowly, I started adding monetization strategies to my website. First, I added affiliate marketing, which is when you recommend a service or product, and if anyone purchases something using your unique URL, you’re rewarded with a commission. Next, I co-wrote an ebook and posted it on my site. “Write it once and sell it repeatedly,” as the saying goes. At about this same time, I was approached by a vice president at Healthline about producing a podcast for their new app — . He had heard my FUMS podcast and contacted me through my website. Because my blog posts were getting some attention by this point, I was also contacted by a company that was producing a diagnostic tool for MS. They invited me and several other MS bloggers to their headquarters in Nashville to pick our brains about how they could promote this new tool. It was on a bus after that meeting that I overheard two patient advocates talking about writing articles for various online health information sites. I tapped one on the shoulder and asked if I had heard that right: Can you really write about your own personal experiences with your disease and get paid for it? Yes, was their answer, and a light bulb went off in my head. When I got home from that trip, I sent out query emails to a lot of health information companies offering to share my experiences with MS. I started getting assignments and the VP from Healthline reached back out, asking if I’d consider being the “guide” for their MS app, running live chats and answering questions on the app. Of course I did! Next came a call from Healthline’s social media department. They needed an admin for their Facebook page to post four articles a day and monitor comments and messages. Yes, please! Other companies started coming around as well, and pretty soon, I was making good money. And I was working from bed, my recliner, the hospital infusion center — wherever! This was exactly what I had wanted and what my health needed. I no longer had to ask for time off to see a doctor or for a day off if I wasn’t feeling well enough to get showered, dressed, and drive to work. I could just stay in bed and work from there. It was a good feeling. I was productive, I had purpose, and I was bringing in an income, all while taking good care of myself. Helping others find work that accommodates their health One day, again while pulling weeds, it hit me: I was officially making more money working for myself and taking care of my health than I did when I was working full-time for someone else. What?! That epiphany led to another: I had to share this with others. I believe if you know something that can help someone else, it is your obligation to share it. Hence, the idea for was born. Patients Getting Paid is a community for people with chronic illness to learn how to find and create work opportunities that better accommodate their health. I work in patient advocacy and I’ll be teaching about that, but there will also be information on starting online businesses, affiliate marketing, how to build a website, how to find work through online recruiters, and how to work and maintain your disability payments, among other topics. My goal is to share my experience and my resources for the benefit of others. If there’s one thing I now know, it’s this: If you get up in the morning with purpose and you finish the day having been productive, whatever that means to you, everything in your life will benefit from it. Add some income in there, too, and you have a recipe for a much happier and potentially healthier life. Kathy Reagan Young is an MS patient advocate, blogger, and podcaster.

f307b75e-0d1f-4711-9c14-92b05f1b8049,"The Difficulties of Keeping Your Job When You Have Multiple Sclerosis — Multiple sclerosis can reduce productivity and affect cognitive abilities, forcing people with MS to cut back their hours, quit their jobs, or retire early. “I continued working with my company for four years after diagnosis and finally had to quit. It’s been an absolute nightmare and two years later I’m still battling for disability.” That’s how Anna Stokes described how multiple sclerosis has affected her productivity and ultimately her life in the workplace since she received a diagnosis in 2012. The former data entry/special projects manager is not alone. Recent shows fatigue and cognitive impairment as the two main reasons why an employee with multiple sclerosis (MS) has to change their job, reduce hours, or retire early. The implication from the research is that MS affects employment status before physical disabilities even set in. Some complain of fatigue and cognitive difficulties. Other neurological symptoms that can affect employment include speech impairments, vision problems, and transportation difficulties. Krista Brennan, a former IT executive and college professor, struggled with fatigue and cognitive difficulties as MS stole her career. “All was OK, but when I had to give up my teaching job, that hurt. It was my passion,” Brennan told Healthline. “I don’t feel sorry for myself. I’ve worked a lot longer than others have. I’m fortunate.” “These reports are consistent with other data which highlight that the so-called ‘invisible’ symptoms of fatigue and cognitive impairment on employment and work productivity in persons with MS can have more of an impact than an obvious physical disability,” Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. “Strategies such as flexible work schedules and other accommodations may mitigate these impairments,” emphasized Giesser. Work capacity is significantly affected by these invisible symptoms. One from Europe with 16,000 participants showed work capacity declined by as much as 74 percent. Fatigue and cognitive difficulties were the top two reasons. in the United Kingdom recently confirmed that cognitive impairment is common and occurs across a range of thinking domains among those with MS. The study looked at the extent of cognitive impairment in those with MS using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, a touch-screen program. In all, 90 people with MS were evaluated in working memory, executive function, processing speed, attention, and episodic memory. Executive function was the most frequently impaired domain, affecting 55 percent of the participants. Disease duration and severity correlated closely with performance across all domains. Patients with symptoms of depression were also more likely to have impaired processing speed. Data suggests that lost work productivity due to MS or the need to retire early is the largest single factor contributing to nonmedical costs of MS. Loss of income is also associated with a corresponding increase in disability claims for governmental programs and insurance providers. Nonmedical costs include short-term and long-term absence from work, reduced work hours, changing the type of work to a less physically challenging and stressful nature (usually at lower pay), and early retirement. Although the costs vary by person, these factors result in reduced productivity and substantial income loss for those with MS. In 2016, a confirmed that the main cost component for progressive MS patients is loss of productivity, up to 67 percent of their cost of illness. Compared with employees without MS, those with the disease had more than six times the number of sick-leave days. The annual cost for disability to employers were nine times greater for MS employees. Researchers in Australia looked at estimating MS-related productivity and losses. MS patients were present at work more often than they were missing work. The authors noted the importance of presenteeism being included in employment outcomes. But of the 740 employees with MS, 56 percent experienced work loss due to MS in the previous four weeks. This resulted in an annual per person loss of $4,985 in U.S. dollars. Other costs to employers include the loss of quality employees. “I had to leave my job because of MS,” Kathy Reagan Young, a long-time marketing executive who received a diagnosis in 2008, told Healthline. “I need to be able to work from anywhere, like a hospital bed or, more often, my recliner.” Employees with MS are protected by the American Disabilities Act (ADA) and in California, the Fair Employment and Housing Act. Employers who don’t make a reasonable effort to accommodate an employee with complications from MS can pay big fines. “MS is a disability. It’s a major life function,” said Jack Schaedel, partner and co-chair of Labor and Employment Practice at Scali Rasmussen, a law firm in Los Angeles. “Unlike most antidiscrimination law, where you have to treat people the same, this one says you have to make a reasonable accommodation for the employee to perform their job,” Schaedel told Healthline. “Reasonable accommodations don’t impose undue hardship. It can’t be just that it costs you more or you don’t have an A-plus worker anymore. Hardship is where you fail and others fail because of you.” Under the law, it’s the responsibility of the employer to figure how to help the worker be productive. Adjustments might be making a workspace more comfortable, using hands-free apps, dictation, or providing an assistant to carry things or type. “One’s job might be to give a lecture. Their job is not to carry their books to the lecture hall,” said Schaedel. Schaedel added that it’s the individual and not the disease that is the focus. “If the business can’t accommodate the employee, then they can’t,” said Schaedel. “But if they can, they must.” When an employee receives an MS diagnosis, Schaedel suggests the company work with them to figure out how to proceed. “Ask the employee what they need to do their job,” he said. Many with MS seek relief from fatigue and cognitive impairment in the form of prescription drugs, lifestyle changes, and alternative treatments. One treatment growing in popularity is . Medical marijuana is legal in California, but employers don’t need to allow it based on the in a 2008 California Supreme Court case. In 2013, the Department of Justice granted exemptions to Washington and Colorado, where recreational marijuana is legal, by saying “they will defer the right to challenge their legalization laws at this time.” This hands-off policy was reversed in January by the Trump administration. Patients can legally take prescription medications while working. This includes codeine, lorazepam, Xanax, and other drugs commonly prescribed for MS symptoms, as long as they don’t interfere with their work. MS causes people with the disease to redefine their lives. “I haven’t given up,” said Stokes, who moved from Arizona back home to North Carolina after her diagnosis. “I’ve attempted to teach myself stained glass this year and [on the] days I’m able to do so, it’s a nice mental getaway. It helps combat my feelings of worthlessness after being financially independent and a former avid outdoors enthusiast.” Stokes told Healthline she also attends a local mental healthcare facility for group therapy using meditation as a form of stress relief. After changing her diet and way of living, her energy and clarity returned. She went back to school for another degree and currently helps her husband with his marketing business. “Not what I used to do, but it’s what I do now,” she said. As a result of her improved health, Brennan recently started a consulting company, , to guide people through intermittent fasting, something she has used to clear up her fatigue and thinking problems. Young became an MS advocate. She started an and found a whole industry of patient advocacy that she’s now building a career around. “I want to help other chronically ill patients find legit work from home, patient advocacy opportunities, and share training on how to build an online business as well,” she said.

In the first phase, qualified participants will complete a few surveys and then meet for an online video conference (and if you have/would like to include a caregiver they are also welcome) for about 60-90 minutes. During this meeting you (and your caregiver) will be asked what features and information you would find helpful in the app. Both you and your caregiver will be compensated.   During the second phase, in April of 2020, once the app is developed based on your and your caregivers’ input, we will have another online video conference to discuss any additional feedback you have about the app. After completing the second phase, both you and your caregiver will also be compensated.   If you are interested, please fill out the online intake form at: For more information and to check if you qualify, please contact the Health Promotion & Rehabilitation Lab via any of the following ways: email: web: call toll free:844-800-9972 Healthcare professionals needed for MS research exploring the perceptions around psychosocial interventions Natalie Garnett, Trainee Health Psychologist at the University of the West of England is carrying out a doctorate study titled: A qualitative study exploring psychosocial professional’s perceptions of the acceptability and effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in Multiple Sclerosis care. The aim is to gain an understanding of how healthcare professionals think and feel about the psychosocial interventions they deliver for people with MS. This study has received ethical approval from the University of the West of England and involves participants completing an online survey consisting of 12 questions followed by some demographic questions, taking around 15/20 minutes to complete. Participation in this study will be of great importance in helping towards gaining a better understanding of healthcare professional’s perceptions of psychosocial interventions for people with MS. This could help guide future training, education and the development of psychosocial interventions. As a thank you for completing the survey, participants will have the opportunity to be entered into a prize draw.  For further information, healthcare professionals can contact Natalie Garnett at   To participate in this study, healthcare professionals can click the link below https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1ReQXSdElBkbAs5 Here are a few related topics that may interest you Our MS Navigators help identify solutions and provide access to the resources you are looking for.

MS Australia is a new Community Partner of Jean Hailes’ Women’s Health Week campaign to help reach women around Australia with important messages about the importance of looking after their health and raise awareness about multiple sclerosis. > > 19 August 2019 - New research shows more Australians having their careers cut short by MS MS is the go-to provider of information, advice and support for people affected by multiple sclerosis. We provide services in ACT, NSW, Victoria and Tasmania and have over 60 years' insight into how to live well with progressive neurological conditions. We offer vital support and services for people living with multiple sclerosis while the search for a cure continues. We are here so no one has to face MS alone. New research shows more Australians having their careers cut short by MS  A new report shows that keeping your job when you have multiple sclerosis (MS) is difficult, with almost two thirds of people (64%) reporting a loss of full-time employment and income. The findings of the (with over 2,000 respondents) suggest that work capacity is significantly affected by the disease’s invisible symptoms before any physical disabilities set in. Fatigue and cognitive impairment are the two main reasons why an employee with MS has to change their job, reduce hours, or retire early, a finding which is consistent with international studies. John Blewonski, CEO, MS Limited said that the report’s findings are concerning, given that MS is most commonly diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 40 years, when they are on a career path trajectory and getting closer to the top of their earning potential.  “With advanced options for therapy and care reducing the severity of disease progression and complications, people with MS are expected to live well for longer periods. The research shows people want more assistance to keep their employment,” said Mr Blewonski. Most of the people who remained in employment had disclosed MS to their employer. Of note, 73% of people who had disclosed their MS to their employer were satisfied with their support, compared to the 24% who had not told their employer. For people newly diagnosed with MS a key worry is that they will lose their job. Nina Dingey, who was first diagnosed about 20 years ago, was head of design for a leading clothing brand. With a passion for fashion, always at the back of Nina’s mind was that her condition was going to make her lose her job. She revealed her condition to a supportive employer six years ago, and successfully now works as a garment technician measuring and assessing sample garments, as a full-time employee. “MS affected the right side of my body, my right hand and my right leg. I got to the stage where I had to say something, and when I did it was a huge relief.  I’ve had a lot of support from my colleagues and the which set up a home office, where I work once a week. They also helped me with adaptations in my work environment and to set up a great NDIS plan.” Nina now works with a roller mouse which means she doesn’t have to use her right hand and wears headphones to speak into a microphone for her computer to write for her. She also has a workstation at home. With the report showing that one in four people (27%) have an unmet service need, Mr Blewonski said it’s crucial that services are accessible to the MS community. “We are committed to keep expanding our , so people living with MS can access the program and stay employed longer. Maintaining employment is an important part of helping people to live well with MS. Our team provides a range of support, especially assisting with workplace arrangements and comprehensive symptom management. We work with employers to implement strategies such as flexible work schedules, accessibility and making workspaces more efficient and comfortable,” said Mr Blewonski.  Over half (53%) of the respondents rated information about lifestyle changes (including employment) as the most required information during diagnosis stage. For those who indicated their employment has been affected by their MS, the overall impact of MS is most frequently seen to be greatest.  The impact on a carer’s capacity for employment (a drop of 30% in carers employed full time) was also significant, resulting in loss of income.   The Living with MS – Consumer Insights report is available here.

Approximately 250,000 to 350,000 people have been diagnosed with M.S. in the United States (Schoenstadt, 2006). Every week, 200 new people are diagnosed with M.S. in our country (National MS Society, n.d.). M.S. can affect each person differently. Damage to the myelin in the Central Nervous System and nerve fibers disturb the signals sent between the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body causing the primary symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (National MS Society, n.d.)Symptoms can come and go without any warning. An idea on how to help people suffering from M.S. is to have a dietitian either come to an M.S. housing building or support group, and introduce a healthy, nutritious diet that will help decrease the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. There are many diets out there that can help reduce symptoms and weight. Using a dietitian to introduce a healthy diet to those with M.S. can be very beneficial because it can decrease their pain and exacerbations, and improve the quality of their lives. There are four different types of M.S. that people can have. They are relapsing- remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS) and progressive-relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS) (National MS Society, n.d.). RRMS is when patients have relapses followed by periods of recovery (Mayo Clinic, 2012). SPMS occurs when there are relapses and partial recoveries, but the disability progressively gets worse until a steady progression of disability replaces cycles of exacerbations (Mayo Clinic, 2012). PPMS is when the disease progresses slowly and steadily from start with no periods of remissions (Mayo Clinic, 2012). Finally, PRMS is a rare type of M.S. where people experience both steadily worsening symptoms and attacks during times of remission (Mayo Clinic, 2012). To people who have Multiple Sclerosis, being diagnosed with any one of these types can be depressing. People with Multiple Sclerosis often suffer with extreme pain. My Mom has been living with M.S. for over 15 years now and she struggles with severe back pain every day. She is currently seeing a pain management doctor to help relieve some of her pain. M.S. patients can have pain in two different areas, which are neuropathic and musculoskeletal. Neuropathic pain is caused by the disruption in how the nerves carry messages within the brain and spinal cord (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Musculoskeletal pain is from damage to muscles, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Even with the use of pain medication, the pain associated with M.S. can be very hard to deal with. There are certain foods that can reduce inflammation and pain in people who have M.S. Anything that can lessen or stop the use of pain medication would be valuable to patients. Multiple Sclerosis affects a person’s brain and spinal cord causing a variety of troubling symptoms. The most common symptoms of M.S. are pain, fatigue, numbness, poor motor skills and vision problems. There are also many other symptoms that can trouble those who suffer from M.S. Other common symptoms are trouble walking, bladder, bowel dysfunction, dizziness, depression, and spasticity. Through diet and exercise, people with M.S. can improve some of those problems and lead a healthier, more productive life. A dietitian can help them focus on the foods and exercises that will eliminate or reduce the symptoms that bother them the most. M.S. patients struggle their whole lives dealing with exacerbations. They never know when one will come and how long it will last for. During an exacerbation, a lot of different problems can occur. An exacerbation is a relapse or flare up of Multiple Sclerosis symptoms. It can bring on new symptoms or... References: Gandy, J. Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics. (Feb 2007). 20 (1), 1.

This disease starts as an auto-immune disease in which CD4 T cells cross the blood brain barrier and attack myelin sheaths of olygodendrocytes resulting in demyelination (Gandhi et al., 2010; Lund et al., 2013). Initially this is a transient process and re-myelination occurs, so initial stage of the disease is characterized by neurological dysfunctions that eventually recover. However this re-myelination is not permanent (Compston and Coles, 2008; Wakerley et al., 2012). The continuous immune attacks cause serious pathological changes of myelin sheaths hence disease progression and development of serious disabilities . (Makris et al., 2013; Wakerley et al., 2012; Hafler, 2004; Nylander and Hafler, 2012; Eshaghi et al., 2013). Peak age of the initial diagnosis of MS is 30 and the disease progress overtime causing a in decline in health and even mortality (Makris et al., 2013). Though it is subjective the average decrease in life expectancy of a patient with MS is 5 to 10 years after the disease is being diagnosed (Keegan and Noseworthy, 2002). Disabilities caused by the disease vary between patients and depend on the abnormalities of the neuronal track that is affected (Leray et al., 2010). Some disabilities include numbness, muscle... Read More MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Essay ... Pathophysiology of (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, affecting the brain and spinal cord. MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States alone. The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012). Definition of Disorder is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well. This disorder affects movements, sensation, and bodily functions (National Society [NMSS], 2012). There are several types of MS, these include: mixed (general), spinal, and cerebellar. General MS affects both the CNS and PNS, while spinal and cerebellar affect the CNS. Causes and Etiological Factors The cause of MS is unknown, but factors act together to trigger or bring about the disease....

Around 400,000 people who have the disease reside in the United States. Of that 400,000 the ratio is roughly one woman to every seven men. is a disease where the individual’s immune system attacks the central nervous system. The immune system attacks and damages the myelin sheath which is a coating that is around the nerve fibers which eventually attacks and kills those nerve fibers as well. Every signal that controls your thoughts and daily movements’ originate from the brain and the spinal cord, it is extremely difficult to move or even think when those signals are not properly functioning.

Just about everything you do is dependent on how well the central nervous system functions, from movement of the muscles to though process throughout the day. Literally breaking down the name; means many and means scar tissue hence, many scar tissues. Before we can proceed to understanding , we have to look at the disease at the cellular level. MS is a selective progressive inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. In the brain and the spinal cord, we have grey and white matter. The outside of the brain is covered with grey matter with white matter running down as fascicles. The grey matters are cell bodies of neurons that have dendrites running down a bunch of axons. The axons are electric conducting pathways that send messages through the central nervous system. The myelin sheath (grey matter) that covers the axons (white matter) is a protecting sheet that serves as insulation of the electrical...

It is known as an autoimmune disease, Where the body’s immune system turns against the body and destroys the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. This damage to the nerve cells causes many problems for the patient including weakness, muscle stiffness, poor coordination and balance, tingling, numbness, tremors, blurred vision, slurred speech, and memory and concentration problems (Bren) There are three different versions of (“What is MS?”). The least severe being relapsing-remitting; this occurs when a person has an attack and then there are no further symptoms until there is a relapse or another flare up of the disease (Bren). The next kind is called primary progressive; this is where the disease and the symptoms just worsen with time, each attack building on the previous (Bren). The final type is secondary progressive and this is a combination of relapsing-remitting first which eventually will become progressive (Bren). There is an organization where people can get help for their , The National Society. It was founded in 1946 by Sylvia Lawry and has over 135 chapters throughout the United States (Bartlett).

In MS, the myelin sheath, a fatty tissue that surrounds and protects nerve fibers, is damaged. Inflammation also occurs which further destroys the sheath and eventually the nerves that it encompasses. This leads to areas of multiple scarring or sclerosis which can slow down or even block nerve signaling that is responsible for muscle coordination, strength, sensory information, and visual responses. Multiple sclerosis is chronic, however not contagious, and depending upon the severity of damage which occurs, can be debilitating. Most researchers of MS believe that it is an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly identifies its own tissues as foreign. This results in a response by the immune system to send antibodies and white blood cells to target the myelin sheath. It is still unclear as to why this action takes place, but it may be caused by a combination of genetic predisposition and exposure to a virus or bacterium. The virus entering the body may carry with it a protein that mimics the proteins of myelin, therefore causing an inappropriate reaction. This may be triggered by such situations as a viral infection of a cold ,flu, or even changes within the body following pregnancy. More than 300,000 people in the United States and over 1 million people worldwide are diagnosed with MS. The disease generally strikes women twice as often as men, between the ages of 20 to 40. The signs and symptoms of MS can vary widely depending on the individual and the specific nerves that may be affected. Some symptoms include abnormal sensations such as tingling, weakness or numbness in the arms or legs and possibly...

Pathophysiology of (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, affecting the brain and spinal cord. MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States alone. The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012). Definition of Disorder is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well. This disorder affects movements, sensation, and bodily functions (National Society [NMSS], 2012). There are several types of MS, these include: mixed (general), spinal, and cerebellar. General MS affects both the CNS and PNS, while spinal and cerebellar affect the CNS.

Symptoms may be mild, such as numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss of vision. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from one person to another. Today, new treatments and advances in research are giving new hope to people affected by the disease. (MS) affects women more than men. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 and 40, but can be seen at any age. MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow down or stop. The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body’s own immune cells attack the nervous system. This can occur along any area of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord. It is unknown what exactly causes this to happen. The most common thought is that a virus or gene defect, or both, is to blame. Environmental factors may play a role. You are slightly more likely to get this condition if you have a family history of MS or live in a part of the world where MS is more common. Symptoms vary, because the location and severity of each attack can be... Read More Essay about Multiple Sclerosis ...﻿ Managing What is ? Living With It and Managing the Disease The mysterious disease called has no boundaries; it infects people of all genders and nationalities. Although very little is known about the cause of this debilitating sickness, scientists and doctors are recognizing some patterns that may eventually lead to an answer. MS ( ) is a crippling disease that can change a person’s life significantly, but there are many treatment options and massive amounts of information available to help people who are diagnosed with MS manage the disease and still live a relatively normal life. According to the National MS Society, The number of women that develop this disease is more than double the amount of men that develop it FAQ’s About MS, 2010). Doctors have speculated that the levels of hormones in a woman’s body may play a part in the development of the disease. Physicians base this theory on the fact that more women than men develop the disease. This statement holds true with the women in my family.

Read More The Pathology of Multiple Sclerosis Essay ...The Pathology of (MS) is a disease which affects the nervous system, namely the brain and spinal cord. It causes damage the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells (Marieb, 2012). This damage slows down the process in which the brain relays messages to the rest of the body, leading to a variety of symptoms. Some of the most common include pain and numbness; fatigue; walking, balance, and coordination problems; bladder and bowel dysfunction; vision problems; cognitive dysfunction; emotional changes and depression (National Society, n.d.). Though the exact cause of MS is unknown, it’s widely thought to be an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases arise from an overactive immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body (Marieb, 2012). In other words, the body actually attacks its own cells. The immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks it. The disease affects women more than men, often beginning sometime between the ages of 20 to 40. Recently, a study found that the incidence of MS appears to be higher in African American women than in caucasians, contradicting previous findings (Langer-Gould, Brara, Beaber, & Zhang, 2013). The disease is usually mild; however, some people lose the ability to write, speak and/or walk. No cause or cure...

This increases the importance of long-term, specialized care in a comprehensive MS center to maintain independence and quality of life. As a National Multiple Sclerosis Society affiliated center for comprehensive care, we provide MS specialty services and coordinated rehabilitation therapy services that address the full spectrum of MS related problems. Our program includes the expertise of health care professionals from neurology, urology, pain medicine, psychiatry, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology. Our team of specialists aim to promote independence, comfort, and health and wellness. Rehabilitation is an integral part of comprehensive multiple sclerosis care, aiding in the management of the diverse set of problems many patients encounter. provides education, exercises, assistive devices and tools designed to improve and maintain function at all stages of the disease. eases problems related to walking and mobility. Exercises are designed to improve issues related to balance (including dizziness), posture, energy, and strength. Physical therapy may also include training in the use of mobility aids, such as canes and wheelchairs. focuses on enabling independence and safety in self-care activities (e.g. dressing, bathing), productive activities (e.g. work, home management), and leisure activities (e.g. recreational interests). Occupational therapists also perform mobility evaluations to determine the most appropriate mobility device for a particular situation. provides techniques for improving memory, learning, and thinking. helps individuals identify distressing thoughts, change their thinking and initiate behavioral change. CBT is used for depression, anxiety and adjustment difficulties. addresses problems related to speech and swallowing. Speech-language pathologists evaluate your speech patterns and facial muscular control to help you regain and maintain speech abilities. People with multiple sclerosis are at a greater risk for deconditioning, or the loss of muscle tone and fitness due to prolonged physical inactivity. One of the best ways to maintain your health while managing multiple sclerosis is through a regular exercise and weight lifting program. Studies have demonstrated that aerobic exercise helps people with MS achieve improved overall health and better perform activities of daily living. 30 minutes of aerobic activity four to five days per week (two to three days per week when recovering from a relapse) can help ease symptoms. Improved bone density and reduction in fracture risk Reduced muscle stiffness and involuntary muscle spasms It is important to consult with your doctor before beginning any type of exercise program. Your exercise program should fit your capabilities and limitations to prevent risk of strain to an already compromised muscular system. Our neurologists and physical therapists can work with you to develop a personal exercise program that meets your needs.

If you have a question, concern, or idea, please do not hesitate to contact us at or email us at . Can raising “good” cholesterol reduce fatigue in MS? A small pilot study found that increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) – the so-called “good cholesterol” – was associated with a significant reduction in fatigue. The research involved 18 people with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). They followed a diet that featured high intake of fruits and vegetables, as well as animal-based and plant-based protein; dairy, eggs, and grains that contain gluten were excluded. In addition, they participated in a program of exercise, neuromuscular stimulation, and stress reduction. After 12 months, study participants had an average increase of 6.0 mg/dL in their good cholesterol and saw their Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) scores decline from an average of 5.51 at baseline to 3.03. They also saw improvements in their total cholesterol (TC) level (mean decline of 29.2 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or “bad cholesterol” (mean decline of 10.4 mg/dL), and body mass index (BMI) (mean decline of 2.6 kg.m2). The association between reduced fatigue and increased HDL-C was statistically significant, as was the association between the lower fatigue score and lower TC. While stressing the need to replicate their findings on a larger scale, the investigators noted that the prevalence and impact of fatigue in MS, as well as the limited effectiveness of current treatment options for fatigue, underscore the importance of identifying dietary and other interventions that may help address the challenges that reduced energy levels pose for so many people with MS. Does the course of MS differ based on familial involvement? People with MS who have a first-degree relative also diagnosed with MS tend to have a slower onset of disease, but experience more exacerbations and disability than MS patients who do not have close relatives also affected by the condition. That’s the main finding of a Lithuanian study that examined disease course in 38 patients who had a parent, sibling, or child also diagnosed with MS (familial group) and 66 patients with no such family ties (control group). While people in the control group (with no family ties) were more likely to report an acute onset of MS, their subsequent course tended to be smoother than that of the familial group. People in the familial group had a higher number of average annual exacerbations (1.4 vs. 0.8) and a greater degree of disability, as measured on the Expanded Disability Status Scale and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score instrument, than the controls. In keeping with those clinical findings, patients with a family history had a higher incidence of MRI changes in the brainstem (74% vs. 30%) and cerebellum (58% vs. 30%) compared to controls. All of the clinical and MRI findings cited were statistically significant, as were findings that a higher proportion of people with MS experienced headache (37% vs. 9%) and backache (32% vs. 9%) than controls. Although this study was relatively small, it provides further evidence of the impact that heredity has on MS, and provides investigators with additional insights as they work to identify factors that may enable them to better predict the course of a person’s MS and individualize care accordingly. Employment and MS risk: The impact of long-term night-shift assignments Working the night shift for 20 years or longer more than doubles the risk for developing MS, according to an analysis of almost 200,000 women participating in the Nurses Health Study (NHS) and Nurses Health Study II (NHSII). Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna and Harvard Medical School undertook the analysis to examine persistent concerns that night-shift work might predispose people to MS. They examined data for 83,992 women participating in the NHS study and 114,427 women in the NHSII study. They categorized those subjects by the number of years they had engaged in night-shift work, which they defined as working three or more nights per month. There were 407 definite cases of new-onset MS during the study period. The investigators found no association between one-to-nine years or 10-19 years of night-shift work and an increased risk of MS. However, in examining data for the NHSII study, they found that women who worked overnight for 20 or more years were 2.62-times more likely than their peers to develop MS. While the authors did not identify a specific cause for the increased risk, they speculated that disruption of circadian rhythms, or sleep/wake cycles, that play a key role in physiological processes including rest and immune function might be involved. Editor’s note: In addition to the circadian rhythms that the authors mention, other factors may also be involved with working night shifts and an increased risk of MS. These might include an overall lower amount of sleep per day, lack of exercise, and reduced exposure to sunlight and Vitamin D, among other possibilities not yet investigated. Future studies may be able to explain why the risk is increased with this type of work. MS and unemployment risk: The impact of higher levels of disability, lower levels of education While aspects of a person’s employment may increase the risk for multiple sclerosis (MS), as Austrian (and Bostonian) researchers showed in the just-referenced study, aspects of MS may increase a person’s risk for unemployment, as well. This was shown by Australian researchers in a recently released study. The investigators surveyed people with MS in 2012, and then followed up with them in 2015. More than 1,200 people completed both surveys. In the 2.5 years between the first and second surveys, the proportion of study participants who were employed full-time or part-time fell from 61.4% to 57.1%. A higher level of disability at baseline and a lower level of education predicted loss of employment at follow-up. Overall, 25.5% of people experienced some change in employment status during the period between completing the first and second survey, with changes including involuntary loss of employment, retirement, and a shift from full-time work to part-time employment or vice-versa. At the time of the follow-up survey, almost 36% of participants were working full-time, about 25% had part-time employment, 3% were unemployed and seeking work, 16% were not in the labor force, and 20% had retired due to disability. The researchers found that having to retire because of disability was predictive of a lower mental health-related score on measures of quality of life. Almost two-thirds of respondents – 62% – said that MS had impacted their employment over their lifetime. In analyzing their findings, the study’s authors concluded: “Employment status was negatively impacted by MS for most participants. We showed for the first time that employment loss was prospectively associated with poorer mental health related quality of life. Employment support including vocational services, reasonable flexibility in the workplace, and legal protection against discrimination should be widely available to assist people with MS, especially for those with progressive onset MS, [as well as those with] higher disability and lower levels of education, who are at higher risk of employment loss.” Updated vaccine recommendations for people with MS Think of how far we’ve come in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) since the mid-1990s. Scientists have a much deeper understanding of the disease process, imaging, and other assessments, which have improved tremendously, while the number of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) available has grown from zero to 17. Given how much has occurred in the interim, the American Academy of Neurology recently updated its practice guidelines on vaccine-preventable infections and immunization in MS. An international panel analyzed the relevant evidence and issued several recommendations, advising clinicians to do the following: Recommend annual influenza vaccination to people with MS, unless a patient had a previous severe reaction or other specific reason not to receive the vaccine Weigh the local (that is, specific to the area in which the patient lives) risks of a vaccine-preventable illness in counseling people with MS about getting a vaccine to prevent that illness Recommend that people with MS follow the local vaccine guidelines that apply to them, again taking into consideration any specific reason that a patient should not get a particular vaccine Counsel people with MS about infection risks associated with specific immunosuppressive or immunomodulating (ISIM) medications, and about the treatment-specific vaccination guidance contained in the prescribing instructions for those agents If indicated based on local vaccine guidelines, vaccinate patients with MS at least four-to-six weeks before initiating ISIM therapy Screen for specific infections (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis, and varicella zoster virus [VZV]) based on prescribing information before initiating an ISIM medication, and treat patients testing positive for latent infections (e.g., hepatitis and tuberculosis) before MS treatment, again in keeping with the guidance in the MS medication’s prescribing information Recommend against using live-attenuated vaccines in people with MS who currently receive ISIM therapies or have recently discontinued these therapies, except in situations where the risk of infection is high and other vaccines are unavailable Delay vaccinating people with MS who are experiencing a relapse until clinical resolution or until the relapse is no longer active, which often may be many weeks after relapse onset The guidelines also stressed the importance of sharing the latest evidence on vaccines, MS, and MS medications with patients, along with exploring patients’ views, preferences, and questions regarding immunization. Please note that the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) and the Consortium of MS Centers (CMSC) officially endorsed these recommendations. MS does not increase overall risk of cancer, Finnish study finds Having multiple sclerosis (MS) does not increase a person’s risk of developing cancer, according to a Finnish study that tracked more than 1,000 people with MS and more than 10,000 of their peers without MS. The study followed 1,074 people in southwest Finland who were treated for MS from 2004 through 2012. Researchers compared the incidence of cancer among those people with that of randomly selected people who were matched to the MS patients by birth year and gender. During the study period, 5.7% of the MS group (61 people) and 7.0% of the control group (757 people) were diagnosed with cancer. That difference in cancer incidence was not statistically significant, the investigators noted. Interestingly, while breast cancer occurred at roughly the same rate between the women with MS and women in the control group, the average age at which women with MS were diagnosed with breast cancer was higher – 61.7 years vs. 55.7 years – and that difference was statistically significant, researchers said. The analysis found that risk for other types of cancers varied somewhat between MS patients and their peers, being higher for people with MS for oral cavity cancer and colon cancer, and lower among MS patients for prostate cancer, but the researchers cautioned that the numbers of people affected by each of these cancers were too small to allow for reliable conclusions. The investigators noted that larger studies conducted over longer periods of time and with longer exposure to various MS therapies are needed to further evaluate the issues they examined, particularly in terms of breast cancer risk. Meanwhile, people with MS can draw reassurance from the study’s main finding of no overall increased risk of cancer associated with MS. Access to a neurologist remains a challenge for many people with multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly those who live in rural areas or who cannot drive. A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester suggests that the connectivity of this digital age may hold the key to overcoming those obstacles. The study involved 36 people with MS. One-half of the group saw a clinician in-person at the university’s MS clinic during the first part of the study, and then switched to “virtual house calls” (VHCs), in which they communicated with the clinician from their homes via an audio-visual connection, for the remainder of the study. The other half of the patients reversed that pattern – having virtual visits initially followed by in-person sessions. At the conclusion of the study, 97.1% of participants reported that they would recommend telemedicine visits to others, and 94.3% said that it was easy for them to connect with a clinician via telemedicine. One reason for the high degree of patient satisfaction, researchers noted, was the time and cost savings provided by virtual visits.The investigators concluded “VHCs were found to be feasible, cost-effective, and appealing to persons with MS and physicians, supporting their utility as a care delivery method for MS.” Can a can opener open up a new approach to MS risk reduction? Fishing for answers When people consider the health benefits attributed to fish, they tend to think of a lean filet grilled to perfection, or perhaps a capsule of fish oil. But recent research suggests that the lowly can of tuna long consigned to lesser prominence in supermarket aisles, may actually be key to reducing the risk of a first demyelinating event. In this 2019 study, Australian researchers drew on data from the 2003-2006 Ausimmune Study, a case-control investigation of risk factors for a first clinical diagnosis of central nervous system demyelination (FCD) to look for possible associations between fish consumption and an FCD, which is a common precursor to multiple sclerosis (MS). They found that higher total fish consumption, defined as 30 grams per day, or roughly two servings per week, was associated with an 18% reduction in the risk for FCD. Further analysis found no significant association between eating grilled or fried fish and reduced risk of a first demyelinating event. However, higher consumption of “tinned fish” (Aussie for fish that comes in a can) was associated with a 41% reduction in the risk of an FCD. The researchers noted that, “Tinned fish is predominantly oily, whereas grilled and fried fish are likely to be a combination of oily and white types. Oily fish is high in Vitamin D and very long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, both of which may be beneficial in relation to MS.” What the octopus may be able to teach us about MS: Investigator goes out on a limb (or eight) Speaking of sea creatures and multiple sclerosis (MS), an Iranian neuroscientist has made a case for including the octopus among the animals that researchers study in seeking insights into the nature and treatment of MS. Writing in the October 2019 issue of the journal , Abdorreza Naser Moghadasi, MD, notes that while scientists often study mice and other small animals to explore the pathophysiology of MS and potential therapies, octopuses have distinct features that can open up new avenues of inquiry. In particular, he points to the fact that octopuses can regenerate defective tissue in both their central and peripheral nervous system. That capability, along with the ability to monitor the connection between specific activities and neurons in the brain of an octopus, “raise the question of what features can an octopus show when it is used as an organism to create experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [the laboratory-induced correlate to MS in humans].” Whether or not researchers will employ the octopus as a possible animal model for MS has not yet been determined, but the publication of this concept illustrates how scientists are looking beyond conventional practices to learn more about the pathophysiology of MS. Ideally, such studies will assist with the development of potential new treatments that will not only stop the disease, but also repair damaged nerves and return lost function. Dr. Moghadasi, who is on staff at the Research Center of the Neuroscience Institute at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, maintains that studying the octopus may prove particularly useful in seeking to prevent the degenerative processes that are hallmarks of MS.

d194e8df-120f-43fa-aaf0-589d65a9dcf9,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that damages nerve cells in your central nervous system (CNS). Your CNS is composed of your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. causes symptoms that gradually get worse, as well as symptoms that come on suddenly after a period of being controlled. This sudden appearance of symptoms is called a . There’s for MS, and the damage it causes can’t be reversed. However, certain medications can help you manage the condition. Condition management focuses on medication that can treat relapses, as well as modify the disease to reduce damage and disability. It also involves other drugs that treat the symptoms or complications of MS. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following drugs for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS): cladribine (Mavenclad), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), diroximel fumarate (Vumerity), fingolimod (Gilenya), monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam), ozanimod (Zeposia), siponimod (Mayzent), teriflunomide (Aubagio) interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron, Extavia), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa), peginterferon beta-1a (Plegridy) alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), mitoxantrone hydrochloride, natalizumab (Tysabri), ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) There are several types of that work to help change the course of MS. The length of treatment with these medications can range from a few months to years, depending on how effective the medications are for you. Your may recommend switching between these drugs throughout the course of your treatment. This will depend on how effectively each drug manages your disease and how you tolerate the side effects. If you switch to a different DMT, your doctor will take note of whether you develop new . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 12 MS medications that are administered by injection or infusion. They help modify relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. They also treat clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a one-off episode of neurological symptoms. CIS can progress to MS and is sometimes categorized as a type of MS. These drugs are made up of proteins that keep certain from entering your brain and spinal cord. These WBCs are thought to that forms a protective coating over your nerve fibers. Therefore, preventing these WBCs from moving into your brain and spinal cord can help slow their damage and reduce the number of relapses you have. You inject these drugs yourself. Your healthcare provider will show you how to do this. The number of injections depends on the drug: Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is a manufactured substance that resembles a basic protein of natural myelin. It’s thought to work by prompting the WBCs to attack the substance instead of the myelin cells. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. You inject this drug yourself once per day or three times per week, depending on your dosage. Your healthcare provider will show you how. People who receive injections three times per week should ensure that at least 48 hours elapses between their injections. The FDA has also approved Glatopa, a generic form of Copaxone. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is an antibody that may block damaged T lymphocytes from moving into your brain and spinal cord. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The infusion takes about an hour, and you’ll get it every 4 weeks. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride was originally used to treat cancer. Now it’s also prescribed to treat people with MS. It suppresses the immune system cells that are thought to attack myelin cells. This medication is only available as a generic drug. It’s used to treat SPMS or worsening RRMS in instances where other drugs haven’t worked. It has a high risk of serious side effects, so it’s only appropriate for people with these more severe forms of MS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as a short IV infusion once every 3 months. The infusion should only take 5 to 15 minutes. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) is approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least two other MS medications but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It works by reducing the number of specific B and T lymphocytes in your body. This action may decrease the inflammation of and damage to nerve cells. Alemtuzumab is given as a 4-hour IV infusion. To start, you receive this drug once per day for 5 days. Then 12 months after your first treatment course, you receive it once per day for 3 more days. Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the newest infusion treatment for MS. It was approved by the FDA in 2017. It’s the first drug used to treat primary progressive MS (PPMS). It’s also used to treat CIS and relapsing forms of MS. Ocrelizumab appears to work by targeting and ultimately reducing the number of B lymphocytes. B lymphocytes are responsible for damage and repair of the myelin sheath. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion. To begin, you’ll receive it in two 300-milligram (mg) infusions, separated by 2 weeks. After that, you’ll receive it in 600-mg infusions every 6 months. You’ll also receive a corticosteroid and an on the day of each infusion to reduce the risk of reaction to the medication. Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) was approved by the FDA in August 2020 and is the newest treatment for MS. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), it also works by targeting harmful B lymphocytes and reducing their overall number. Ofatumumab is given as an injection once per week for the first 3 weeks. After a 1-week break, the drug is given as a monthly injection. The FDA has approved eight oral medications for the treatment of MS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) comes as an oral capsule that you take once per day. It was the first oral medication approved by the FDA to treat RRMS. It’s also used to treat CIS and active SPMS. Fingolimod causes the damaging WBCs to remain within your lymph nodes. This reduces the chance that they’ll enter your brain or spinal cord and cause damage. Teriflunomide (Aubagio) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Teriflunomide works by blocking an enzyme that’s needed by the damaging WBCs. As a result, teriflunomide helps decrease the number of these cells, which reduces the damage they can inflict. Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals to reduce the risk of MS relapse. It may also have antioxidant properties that help protect against brain and spinal cord damage. Monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s the newest oral drug on the market, having been approved by the FDA in April 2020. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Monomethyl fumarate is a bioequivalent of dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). Like dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl fumarate may have antioxidant properties and appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Cladribine (Mavenclad) is a pill that you take for a total of 16 or 20 days over the course of 2 years. You’ll have treatment for 2 weeks per year, with each one lasting 4 or 5 days. There’s a 1-month break in between the 2 weeks of treatment. It’s approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least one other MS medication but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It may work by reducing the number of harmful B and T lymphocytes that you have. Siponimod (Mayzent) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking certain inflammatory cells from leaving your lymph nodes. This action limits the amount of nerve damage that they can inflict. Diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Diroximel fumarate has the same active ingredient as dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), and it works the same way. This means that it may also have antioxidant properties and interfere with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Ozanimod (Zeposia) is an oral capsule that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking immune cells from leaving your lymph nodes and entering your CNS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) is currently the only DMT that’s approved by the FDA for use in children. It’s safe for use in people ages 10 years old and up. However, doctors may prescribe other DMTs off label. Off-label drug is when a medication approved by the FDA for one purpose is used for a different purpose that hasn’t been approved. However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs, but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So, your doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care. While many relapses go away on their own, more severe relapses require treatment. Inflammation causes MS relapses, and it’s typically treated with . These drugs can reduce inflammation and help make MS attacks less severe. Corticosteroids used to treat MS include: If corticosteroids don’t work, your doctor may prescribe corticotropin (H.P. Acthar Gel). Corticotropin is an injection, and it’s also known as ACTH gel. It works by prompting the adrenal cortex to secrete the hormones cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone. The secretion of these hormones helps to reduce inflammation. Medications to treat MS symptoms and complications Other drugs can be used to treat specific or from MS-related damage. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is an oral tablet taken twice per day to help improve walking. Dalfampridine works by blocking potassium channels, which form tiny pores in your nerve cells. This action may help damaged nerve cells to better send messages. Improved nerve impulse conduction aids in leg muscle control and strength. A doctor will often give to people with MS who have painful muscle stiffness or muscle spasms. Drugs commonly used to treat these symptoms include: is a common problem for people with MS. For this symptom, your doctor may prescribe a drug such as modafinil (Provigil). They may also prescribe an off-label drug, such as amantadine (Gocovri) and fluoxetine (Prozac). means “bad sensation.” It’s a type of pain that can feel like ongoing burning or itching. It may also feel like wetness, electric shock, or pins and needles. According to a published in Nature Reviews Neurology, some research has shown that people with MS are more likely to be clinically depressed than the general population. Drugs used to treat depression in people with MS include: Constipation is another common complication of MS. Your doctor may recommend with one of the following : Bladder dysfunction is also a common complication of MS. Symptoms may include frequent urination, , or hesitancy in starting urination. You may also experience frequent (nighttime urination). Both men and women with MS tend to have higher rates of sexual dysfunction than the general population, according to an from 2016. that may be prescribed to help treat include: Older drugs that must be injected directly into the penis are also available. These drugs aren’t used as much now that oral drugs are available. They include alprostadil (Caverject). A drug that may be used off label for this purpose is the blood pressure medication papaverine. People with a vagina or clitoris may experience problems such as reduced feeling or . There are no drugs currently available to treat these problems. However, for vaginal dryness, you can use water-soluble personal lubricants available over the counter. Many different types of drugs are available to help you manage MS. The type of drugs that may be best for you depend on the type of MS you have and the symptoms you experience. You may not be able to access all of these medications. Ask your doctor to confirm which drugs are currently on the market in your area and which ones might be most appropriate for you. Speaking with your doctor is especially important if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Work with your doctor to to manage your MS symptoms and help prevent further damage from the disease. Sticking to your treatment plan can help you feel better and slow the progression of your condition. — — MS Treatment Chart: Comparing Disease-Modifying Therapies Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

e9836ba1-706d-4ffc-8d16-869453ef6784,"search close PETER A. CALABRESI, M.D., Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland Abstract Abstract Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome). Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue. Five disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These treatments are partially effective in reducing exacerbations and may slow progression of disability. Multiple sclerosis (MS) typically presents in adults who are 20 to 45 years of age. Occasionally, the disease presents in childhood or late middle age. Twice as many women are affected as men, and persons of Northern European descent appear to be at highest risk for the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed or repeated three months after a clinically suspicious episode to facilitate early diagnosis of MS. Corticosteroid therapy should be used to shorten the duration of MS relapses and accelerate recovery. Disease-modifying treatment should be started early in the course of MS to minimize irreversible axonal damage. Glatiramer and the beta interferons have different mechanisms of action. Patients with MS who have an unsatisfactory response to beta interferons should be considered for glatiramer therapy. Patients with worsening forms of MS may be referred for mitoxantrone therapy; however, this agent has acute short-term adverse effects, as well as serious long-term adverse effects that include cardiotoxicity. A = consistent, good quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or limited quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, opinion, or case series.

See page 1845 for more information. The onset of MS may be insidious or sudden. Common presenting symptoms include monocular visual impairment with pain (optic neuritis), paresthesias, weakness, and impaired coordination . Frequent accompanying signs and symptoms include bladder urgency or retention, constipation, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression, diplopia, gait and limb ataxia, and Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion). Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements MS frequently is overlooked because initial symptoms resolve spontaneously in most patients. Relapses occur within months or years. In some patients, however, MS has a primary progressive course from onset. Abstract The diagnosis of MS is based on the presence of central nervous system (CNS) lesions that are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the CNS at least three months apart), with no better explanation for the disease process. Because no single test is totally reliable in identifying MS, and a variety of conditions can mimic the disease , diagnosis depends on clinical features supplemented by the findings of certain studies. CNS infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I) CNS inflammatory condition (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome) CNS microvascular disease (e.g., disease caused by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, CADASIL) Genetic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy, hereditary myelopathy, mitochondrial disease) Structural or compressive condition of the brain and spinal cord (e.g., cervical spondylosis, tumor, herniated disc, Chiari’s malformation) Vitamin B deficiency CNS = central nervous system; CADASIL = cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. CNS infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I) CNS inflammatory condition (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome) CNS microvascular disease (e.g., disease caused by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, CADASIL) Genetic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy, hereditary myelopathy, mitochondrial disease) Structural or compressive condition of the brain and spinal cord (e.g., cervical spondylosis, tumor, herniated disc, Chiari’s malformation) Vitamin B deficiency CNS = central nervous system; CADASIL = cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be highly sensitive in detecting clinically silent MS plaques. Consequently, findings of this imaging modality are included in diagnostic criteria that have been proposed by one set of investigators.  The major advantage of the proposed criteria is that an early diagnosis of MS can be made if an MRI scan performed three months after a clinically isolated attack demonstrates formation of a new lesion. The proposed diagnostic criteria also define MRI lesion characteristics that increase the likelihood of MS, including number of lesions (nine or more), location of lesions (position abutting the ventricles; juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal position), and lesion enhancement with the use of contrast medium .

A brain MRI scan is the most useful test for confirming the diagnosis of MS. MS lesions appear as areas of high signal, predominantly in the cerebral white matter or spinal cord, on T-weighted images . MRI scanning is useful for detecting structural pathology in regions that can be difficult to image by computed tomography, such as the posterior fossa, craniocervical junction, and cervical cord. A brain MRI scan performed with a high-field magnet (1.5 tesla or greater) is abnormal in almost all patients who have clinically definite MS.

This image shows multiple high-signal periventricular and white-matter lesions.

Sagittal images using the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) protocol reveal multiple high-signal lesions within the spinal cord, consistent with demyelination. These lesions, which also can be seen on the transverse cuts, often are situated dorsolaterally, and are usually less than one vertebral body in length. The lesions rarely cause cord swelling.

Sagittal images using the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) protocol reveal multiple high-signal lesions within the spinal cord, consistent with demyelination. These lesions, which also can be seen on the transverse cuts, often are situated dorsolaterally, and are usually less than one vertebral body in length. The lesions rarely cause cord swelling. Evoked potentials (visual, brainstem auditory, and somatosensory) may be useful in demonstrating the presence of subclinical lesions in sensory pathways or in providing objective evidence of lesions suspected on the basis of subjective complaints. Of the sensory evoked potential tests, the visual evoked potential is the most useful because it can provide objective evidence of an optic nerve lesion that may not be evident on an MRI scan. In approximately 90 percent of patients with definite MS, the CSF IgG concentration is increased relative to other CSF proteins (e.g., albumin), and CSF gel electrophoresis reveals oligoclonal bands that are not present in a matched serum sample. However, an increased CSF IgG index and the presence of oligoclonal bands are not specific for MS and therefore are not diagnostic of the disease. CSF analysis probably is most useful for ruling out infectious or neoplastic conditions that mimic MS. Peripheral blood tests may be helpful in excluding other disease processes. Testing frequently includes determination of the vitamin B level, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and anti-nuclear antibody titers, as well as a test for Lyme disease, and a test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin test). In unusual cases, a more extensive evaluation may include tests for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, Sjögren’s syndrome A and B, angiotensin-converting enzyme, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I, and very long chain fatty acids (for adrenoleukodystrophy). Rarely, human immunodeficiency virus infection and opportunistic infections can mimic MS. Certain clinical or laboratory red flags should alert physicians to a possible diagnostic error. These flags include symptoms that could be explained by localized disease; the presence of steadily progressive disease; the absence of clinical remission; the absence of oculomotor, optic nerve, sensory, or bladder involvement; and normal CSF findings. However, none of these findings excludes the diagnosis of MS. Abstract Mild spasticity may be managed by stretching and exercise programs such as water therapy, yoga, and physical therapy. Medication is indicated when stiffness, spasms, or clonus interferes with function or sleep. Baclofen (Lioresal), tizanidine (Zanaflex), gabapentin (Neurontin), and benzodiazepines are effective antispastic agents . Intrathecal baclofen therapy has a major impact on medically intractable spasticity and has largely supplanted chemical rhizotomy or myelotomy. Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations In most instances, dystonic spasms respond well to carbamazepine (Tegretol) can be treated effectively with anticonvulsants or amitriptyline (Elavil). In patients with new bladder symptoms, urinalysis and culture should be performed to rule out infection, with appropriate treatment provided if needed. The first step in medical management of the neurogenic bladder is to determine whether the problem is a failure to empty urine or a failure to store urine. The history may or may not be helpful. A postvoid residual urinary volume is the best means of determining urinary retention. The anticholinergic drugs oxybutynin (Ditropan) and tolterodine (Detrol) are effective for symptoms of failure to store urine (in the absence of infection or overflow incontinence). Drug treatment of urinary retention usually is ineffective, although some patients benefit from attempts to decrease bladder neck tone using an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist such as terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), or tamsulosin (Flomax). Bethanechol (Urecholine) may be helpful in patients with a flaccid bladder. Definitive treatment of urinary retention involves teaching the patient to perform intermittent self-catheterization, if possible. In some patients, inhaled desmopressin (DDAVP) can be used to suppress nocturnal urinary production. Constipation is common in patients with MS. It should be managed aggressively to avoid long-term complications. Fecal incontinence is rare; when it occurs, the addition of fiber can provide enough bulk to the stool to allow a partially incompetent sphincter to hold in the bowel movement long enough for the patient to reach a bathroom. Short-term use of anticholinergics or antidiarrheal agents may be effective in combating incontinence associated with diarrhea. A careful sexual history may reveal problems such as feelings of sexual inadequacy, impaired libido, or direct sexual dysfunction resulting from erectile dysfunction, impaired lubrication, spasticity, or heat-related sensory dysesthesias. Counseling, a review of the sexual side effects of medications, and medical therapy may be appropriate. In some patients with MS, erectile dysfunction can be managed effectively with sildenafil (Viagra). Depression occurs in more than one half of patients with MS. Patients with mild, transient depression can be cared for with supportive measures. Those with more severe depression should be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are less sedating than other antidepressants. Bedtime administration of amitriptyline can be useful in depressed patients who also are having difficulty sleeping or have headaches or other pain syndromes. This symptom often responds to rest or medication. Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily, may be effective. Modafinil (Provigil), a narcolepsy drug that acts as a CNS stimulant, has been found to be effective in patients with MS; the drug is given in a dosage of 200 mg once daily in the morning. Occasionally, SSRIs can relieve fatigue in patients with MS. Amantadine has the added advantage of having anti–influenza-A properties and may be given from October to March. In a patient with an apparent relapse of MS, it is important to rule out a treatable infection such as sinusitis, bronchitis, or urinary tract infection. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of symptomatic relief for an acute relapse of MS. These agents work through immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, restoration of the blood-brain barrier, and reduction of edema. They also may improve axonal conduction. Corticosteroid therapy shortens the duration of acute relapses and accelerates recovery. However, corticosteroids have not been shown to improve the overall degree of recovery or to alter the long-term course of MS. If a patient is having acute disability from an attack, the physician should consider treatment with a three- to five-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (or equivalent corticosteroid) in a dosage of 1 g administered intravenously in 100 mL of normal saline over 60 minutes once daily in the morning. In patients with MS, physical therapy always should be considered because it improves function and quality of life independent of drug therapy. Supportive care in the form of counseling, occupational therapy, advice from social workers, input from nurses, and participation in patient support groups are all part of a united health care team approach to the management of MS. Some patients require temporary disability status. Patients with MS often are tempted to try alternative therapies such as special diets, vitamins, bee stings, a compound “off-label” transdermal medication (i.e., Prokarin), or acupuncture. Although definitive proof of the effectiveness of these treatments in MS is lacking, patients sometimes use them in a complementary fashion. Sole reliance on alternative therapies should be discouraged because patients then may be deprived of therapies that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of MS. Four disease-modifying therapies for the initial management of MS are available in the United States: intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex), subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). A fifth agent, mitoxantrone (Novantrone), has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of worsening forms of relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS .

Montvale, N.J.: Medical Economics Data, 2004. Cost to the patient will be higher, depending on prescription filling fee. The beta interferons are naturally occurring cytokines with a variety of immunomodulating and antiviral activities that may account for their therapeutic effects. The three FDA-approved beta interferons that are used for MS have been shown to reduce relapses by about one third and are recommended as first-line therapy or for use in glatiramer-intolerant patients who have relapsing-remitting MS. In randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials, use of beta interferons resulted in a 50 to 80 percent reduction in inflammatory lesions visualized on brain MRI scans. There also is evidence that these drugs improve quality of life and cognitive function. The major difference in the beta interferon drugs is that intramuscular interferon beta-1a is given once a week and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b are given three times a week, or every other day, respectively. The adequacy of weekly dosing has been questioned. There appears to be a modest dose-response effect with the beta interferons. One study of double-dose (60-mcg) intramuscular interferon beta-1a administered once a week found no benefit over the single-dose regimen. Whether the benefit of more frequent dosing is sustained remains unclear. An increased incidence of neutralizing antibodies with the more frequent subcutaneous dosing also must be considered. Influenza-like symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, muscle aches, and fatigue, occur in approximately 60 percent of patients treated with interferon beta-1a or interferon beta-1b. These symptoms usually dissipate with continued therapy and premedication with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Dose titration at the initiation of beta interferon therapy also is a useful strategy. Other side effects of the beta interferons include injection-site reactions, worsening of pre-existing spasticity, depression, mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminase levels. These side effects usually are not severe and rarely lead to discontinuation of treatment. Treatment with any beta interferon can result in the development of neutralizing antibodies. Although study results are variable, once-weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy has been reported to have the lowest incidence of neutralizing antibody development. The effect of neutralizing antibodies on the long-term efficacy of beta interferon therapy remains to be fully defined because titers and durations of antibody positivity (some neutralizing antibodies resolve with time) are variable. This drug is a polypeptide mixture that was originally designed to mimic and compete with myelin basic protein. Its mechanism of action is distinct from that of the beta interferons; therefore, patients may respond differently to the drug. Glatiramer in a dosage of 20 mg administered subcutaneously once daily has been shown to reduce the frequency of MS relapses by approximately one third. The drug also is recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and in the treatment of patients who cannot tolerate beta interferon therapy. Glatiramer therapy results in a one-third reduction in the inflammatory activity seen on MRI scans. Glatiramer generally is well tolerated and is not associated with influenza-like symptoms. Immediate postinjection reactions include local inflammation and an uncommon idiosyncratic reaction consisting of flushing, chest tightness with palpitations, anxiety, or dyspnea, which resolves spontaneously without sequelae. Routine laboratory monitoring is not considered necessary in patients treated with glatiramer, and the development of binding antibodies does not interfere with therapeutic efficacy. A phase-III, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial found that mitoxantrone, an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent, reduced the number of treated MS relapses by 67 percent and slowed progression on the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Ambulation Index, and MRI measures of disease activity. Mitoxantrone is recommended for use in patients with worsening forms of MS. Acute side effects of mitoxantrone include nausea and alopecia. Because of cumulative cardiotoxicity, the drug can be used for only two to three years (or for a cumulative dose of 120 to 140 mg per m). There also is some concern about treatment-related leukemia. Mitoxantrone is a chemotherapeutic agent that should be prescribed and administered only by experienced health care professionals. Natalizumab (Antegren) is in the final stages of phase-III clinical trails and is under accelerated review by the FDA. In a phase-II clinical trial, this drug appeared promising in that it reduced active MRI lesions by 90 percent and decreased MS relapses by more than 50 percent. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is directed against an adhesion molecule called VLA-4. The drug is administered intravenously once a month. Despite lack of FDA approval and definitive evidence of efficacy, several other drugs commonly are used in patients with MS. A number of small clinical trials support the modest effect of intravenous IgG, azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide, either alone or in combination with standard therapy. Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates that the best time to initiate disease-modifying treatment is early in the course of MS. Data indicate that irreversible axonal damage may occur early in relapsing-remitting MS, and that drug therapies appear to be more effective in preventing new lesion formation than in repairing old lesions. With disease progression, the autoimmune response of the disease may become more difficult to suppress. Both intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a therapy have been shown to reduce the cumulative probability of the development of clinically definite MS in patients who present with a first clinical demyelinating episode and have two or more brain lesions on an MRI scan. Based on these data, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society supports the initiation of immunomodulating therapy at the time of diagnosis. The physician must weigh evidence and recommendations against the practical concerns of young patients for whom the prospect of starting therapy that requires self-injection may be frightening and burdensome. Furthermore, few long-term data (more than 10 years) are available on the safety and sustained efficacy of disease-modifying drugs. A patient may opt to defer therapy, hoping to be among the minority of persons with benign MS; however, certain MRI and clinical features should prompt the physician and patient to reconsider this approach. An MRI scan with contrast-enhancing lesions, a large burden of white matter disease, or any T low-signal lesions (black holes) suggests a relatively poor prognosis. It may be useful to repeat brain MRI scanning in six months or one year to determine how quickly the disease process is evolving. The presence of spinal cord lesions or atrophy also suggests a poor prognosis. Clinical features may be less useful for assessing prognosis. Once definite disability develops, it may be too late to treat that component of the disease. The ability to diagnose and treat MS has improved considerably in the past 10 years because of the availability of MRI and partially effective immunomodulating therapies. The limited efficacy of immunomodulating drugs in the later, noninflammatory stages of MS highlights the importance of developing remyelinating and neuroprotective strategies for the disease.

575eedc1-3529-4a9f-b0fe-e2e440e01741,"New Brain Stimulation Technique May Help Treat MS Fatigue — Researchers use a process called transcranial direct current stimulation to reduce symptoms of fatigue in people living with multiple sclerosis. Fatigue is the most common symptom of multiple sclerosis. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, an estimated of people living with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience fatigue. Fatigue is also one of the most debilitating symptoms of MS, making it difficult for those people to maintain quality of life. “MS fatigue can independently contribute to the disability that people with MS may experience,” Kathy Costello, associate vice president of healthcare access at the National MS Society, told Healthline. “MS fatigue stops people in their tracks. It is a feeling of mental or physical (or both) exhaustion that often comes on at the same time every day, is worsened by heat, is not related to physical activity or sleep, and prevents people from participating fully in their lives.” Costello is also a nurse practitioner who sees MS patients at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center. “[Fatigue] can be immobilizing by interfering with relationships, work responsibilities, and social connections,” Costello said. A variety of ways to help manage fatigue are available, but there is no effective treatment for it yet. Ways to manage fatigue include occupational therapy, physical therapy, sleep regulation, heat management, psychotherapy, relaxation training, and stress management, as well as dopaminergic drugs and psychostimulants such as amantadine (Symmetrel) and modafinil (Provigil). But a out of New York University is shedding light on the potential of a new form of help via electrical stimulation to the brain. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive way to deliver low direct current via electrodes on the head. The research team developed a telerehabilitation protocol that delivers tDCS to participants at home using specially designed equipment and real-time supervision. The tDCS device is portable and fits onto a person’s head. This pilot study looked specifically at the feasibility of tDCS as a treatment for fatigue in people with MS. The study followed 27 MS patients with varying levels of fatigue and wasn’t based on any specific symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned in either a treatment or control group. While it wasn’t a large trial, the results were significant. Participants using tDCS experienced a significant reduction in fatigue levels. “We are excited to see this benefit for fatigue that has no treatment,” , PhD, a lead study author and an associate professor of neurology and director of MS research at NYU Langone Health, told Healthline. Participants evaluated themselves using a measurement scale known as the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) that grades fatigue on a score of up to 32, with the higher numbers meaning more fatigue. After 20 sessions, all participants of fatigue to be lower. But the group that underwent tDCS reported an average 5.6-point drop in fatigue while the placebo group only saw an increase of 0.9 points. “The study affected me in a way I didn’t expect,” Diana Frustaci, a participant, told Healthline. Frustaci didn’t know until the trial ended that she was in the control group, but she tried really hard at the games. “I tried to improve my scores, which wasn’t even the point of the study, but that’s what I did anyway,” she said. Frustaci explained how she experienced more fatigue after playing the games because she had to focus for 20 minutes straight but found that “it still improved my days, like I had done something positive, for myself and the study. Worked out my brain, and then my body, and it was like I was winning at life, even though I felt like a loser so often with MS.” “The exact mechanism behind tDCS is unclear and requires more research,” added Charvet. “It is thought to stimulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, allowing people to feel more alive and awake.” In earlier studies, this part of the brain, when stimulated, to be more effective in fighting fatigue, helping Charvet and her team to focus their efforts on one location. This pilot study was funded by the National MS Society and The Lourie Foundation Inc. The findings further show that “an increased number of treatments work better. We just don’t know how much more,” Charvet said. She added that she and the study’s co-authors will look at this and more in their next study. Charvet plans to conduct larger clinical trials on tDCS for MS-related fatigue as well as motor skills and cognitive symptoms. “We are hopeful to find funding for a large trial, which will create guidelines for clinical use. We know it can be a powerful therapy but [we’re] not sure how best to use it,” she said. Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

Gromisch, Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the internal reliability and construct validity of the Multiple Sclerosis Resiliency Scale (MSRS) in comparison with a common measure of global resilience. Methods: Participants were 216 community-dwelling adults with MS (mean age: 48.8 ± 12.5 years; 77% female; median disease duration: 8 years) recruited through a university-affiliated MS Center. Participants completed the MSRS, 10-item Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and depressive and anxious symptom items from the SymptoMScreen. Results: The MSRS exhibited fair to excellent internal consistency (αs 0.74 to 0.91) and divergent validity with disability severity (r = −0.19), MS duration (r = 0.07), and MS subtype (r = −0.01). The MSRS total and Emotional and Cognitive Strategies subscale scores were moderately correlated with the CDRS (rs = 0.50 and 0.62), PSS (rs = −0.56 and − 0.62), depressive symptoms (rs = −0.49 and − 0.54), and anxious symptoms (rs = −0.38 and − 0.047). The MSRS total and Emotional and Cognitive Strategies subscale scores exhibited fair to good accuracy (AUCs = 0.73 to 0.83) for identifying participants in the highest and lowest CDRS quartiles; however, cutoff scores yielded only fair sensitivity and specificity, and the measures differed significantly in classification of participants into highest and lowest quartiles. Conclusion: Although the MSRS may be useful in assessing resilience to MS-specific challenges, use of a global resilience measure may still be indicated depending on the clinical and research context.

d39ffb39-0ce7-4f81-a9f3-ab9e7563a8d9,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice What influences quality of life with MS and how can we improve it? Seven principles for quality of life based on the insights and experience of people affected by MS Many factors can influence a person’s quality of life, both inside and outside their direct control. These factors vary from person to person, from place to place and change over time. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can have an impact on these factors at any time. In 2005, we published a set of principles – a kind of “gold standard” –  setting out what any person with MS should expect in order for them to have a good quality of life. In 2016, we reviewed the principles and carried out an extensive consultation with people from over 30 countries, learning more about what influences quality of life for people with MS, their caregivers, family members and friends closest to them. From this consultation, we have produced a refreshed set of principles identifying the main areas in which every bit of progress can make a real difference to individuals. There is no priority amongst the principles – it is for individuals and organisations to decide what is most important to them at any time. No country can claim to have achieved them all. They are our call to action for continuous improvement in every country. “This valuable tool builds on the WHO’s quality of life framework and reflects real life experience from those affected by MS around the world.  It illustrates the interplay between physical and mental health, social and other impacts of living with a variable, life-long condition. I encourage everyone –  people affected by MS, MS organisations, health care providers and government agencies – to use this resource to understand and take action to improve quality of life with MS.” Dr Shekhar Saxena, Director, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, World Health Organization Empowerment, independence and a central role for people affected by MS in decisions that affect their lives. This principle affects every aspect of quality of life. It includes freedom of thought; personal beliefs and values; the rights of every individual to self-determination. Its influence is broad, including social, professional and intimate relationships and opportunities to participate in society. It draws on insights from numerous health, welfare and political settings showing that quality of life is enhanced when people can participate fully in decisions that affect their lives and take responsibility for themselves. This means having the right information, skills, opportunities and a supportive context that recognises diversity in all its forms. Whilst independence and empowerment can mean different things to different people, they are often the first thing a person affected by MS talks about when considering quality of life. People affected by MS realise their full potential in all the aspects of life that are important to them People affected by MS participate in decisions about their treatment, care and lifestyle in line with their personal beliefs and values Services take into account the needs and priorities of the individual and are designed to be user-friendly Information about MS is trustworthy, up to date and directly accessible by people affected by MS People affected by MS shape and fulfil their roles and responsibilities within the family, community and wider world People affected by MS have leadership roles throughout the MS movement Personal wellbeing (including diet, exercise, sleep) and resilience-building are directed by the person affected by MS Spiritual support is accessible in line with individuals’ beliefs and practices Access to comprehensive and effective treatments and care for changing physical and mental health needs of life with MS. There are complex and numerous direct impacts of MS on physical and mental health. These impacts can be visible and invisible, and they can in turn affect other aspects of quality of life. The impacts and symptoms of MS vary from person to person both in nature and in severity, and they change over time. They can interact with a person’s other health conditions. Treatments themselves can have side effects. For many people affected by MS, the mental and emotional health impacts are as important as the physical impacts. Managing all MS symptoms effectively and promoting good general health through a personalised package of care can help people affected by MS to minimise the overall impact. Multidisciplinary, integrated care planning with services provided close to where people live Age-appropriate and gender-sensitive information about MS and what to expect, including the specific needs associated with MS in childhood and adolescence Choice of effective, accessible and affordable treatments to meet the varying needs, preferences and priorities of individuals with MS Service providers who listen to individuals’ needs and respect the expertise that comes from lived experience Research for more effective treatments that have fewer side effects and are easier to use as well as research to find ways to prevent, slow, stop or reverse the accumulation of damage and disability associated with MS Research on the barriers and facilitators to access including financial, cultural, administrative, and geographic barriers Accessible general healthcare, screening and preventive services including mental, sexual and reproductive health Psychological and emotional support as required including around diagnosis and decisions about the future Rehabilitation and palliative care services appropriate to the stage of life Individuals’ personal privacy, confidentiality and sensitivities are respected Support for the network of family, friends, loved ones and unpaid caregivers This principle recognises that the quality of life of a person with MS is closely linked to that of their families and other loved ones. When one is affected, so is the other. People affected by MS – spouses, partners, family members, close friends and unpaid caregivers – experience health, emotional, social and financial impacts of their own, which are usually under-recognised and poorly addressed in public policy and services. People with MS and people affected by MS can both become vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, discrimination and stigma. The principle also acknowledges that people with MS often have caregiving roles themselves. Family members are recognised as individuals with their own quality of life needs People have access to support with personal and sexual relationships and their changing dynamics The care-giving role is understood, acknowledged, valued and financially supported Child and adolescent caregivers get special attention to protect their education, health, social and personal development Care and respite services are designed in ways that respect the personal time of family members Individuals’ personal privacy, confidentiality and sensitivities are respected Funding is available for professional assistance with personal care People with MS and people affected by MS each have opportunities to expand their own social networks Health policy research addresses the composition of the support network and strategies to enhance it Work, volunteering, education and leisure opportunities that are accessible and flexible. This principle focuses on some of the links between aspects of the external environment and elements of quality of life that contribute to a person’s sense of self-worth, independence and belonging. Rights to education, work and leisure are recognised human rights. Participating in these activities as equals empowers and enables people with MS to contribute as valued members of the family and wider society. Participation also enhances visibility and public understanding of MS, which in turn contributes to removing stigma and discrimination. Educated and informed employers; accessible workplaces and flexible working practices Access to career advice, training and professional development opportunities Educational institutions are accessible and have flexible approaches to learning and assessment processes Leisure, sport and social facilities are accessible and welcoming (encouraging, promoting participation) Accessible public and private spaces, technology and transport This principle enables participating in many of the other principles – getting around easily at home and outside is important for participating in society, relationships, education, work and leisure activities. Physical barriers or complex systems for accessing buildings and transport are common, even in health facilities, and having to rely on other people for assistance compromises independence. Online or virtual public spaces are increasingly important and require similar attention to accessibility. Rights to choose where to live and to decide when to move to accessible accommodation Housing that is designed or adapted and equipped to suit changing needs and preferences Transport that is accessible for a range of needs – not just for wheelchairs: seating, support rails, trained operators Public buildings – civic, commercial, healthcare, leisure, places of worship – that are designed or adapted and managed to be accessible for a range of needs – not just for wheelchairs: toilets, rest spaces, door design, trained staff Digital and mobile technology and services that provide increased opportunities for people affected by MS, and are accessible and usable by people with a range of impairments Financial resources to meet the changing needs and costs of living with MS This principle is relevant to almost every aspect of quality of life. People affected by MS experience substantial financial costs – for medicines, care, adaptations (such as walking aids, assistive computer software, adaptations around the home) and transport. Many household budgets cannot cope with these impacts and other expenditure suffers. In many countries, households that rely on government benefits often remain on the poverty line. These financial strains can impact on family relationships and increase isolation. The full financial impact of MS is researched and understood, including underlying factors and implications for policy and practice People with MS can earn their own living and manage their own finances Financial services (banking, investment planning and borrowing advice) are available for people affected by MS Government assistance and insurance programmes are designed to meet the variable financial needs of those with and affected by MS MS is recognised as a qualifying condition for government assistance and other relevant benefits such as subsidised public transport Positive, supportive attitudes, policies and practices that promote equality and challenge stigma and discrimination This principle focuses on the role of the external environment in affecting quality of life, emphasising the importance of explicit attention to equality issues. MS is relatively uncommon, poorly understood by policy makers and service providers and often has invisible symptoms, increasing the likelihood that needs will be overlooked. Many countries lack even basic data on MS prevalence. Lack of societal understanding of MS increases vulnerability especially for people already facing risk related to gender, sexuality, poverty, race or social status. Health professionals, support workers, employers, educators and the general public are aware of MS and understand their role in promoting the Principles Legislation and policy that promotes dignity for all Investment of public resources in reducing inequalities associated with MS Inclusion on electoral registers and accessible voting systems Inclusive approaches to innovation in communications, infrastructure and other technology development Attention to vulnerability and exclusion issues in research and policy-making What influences quality of life with MS and how can we improve it?

Multidisciplinary, integrated care planning with services provided close to where people live Age-appropriate and gender-sensitive information about MS and what to expect, including the specific needs associated with MS in childhood and adolescence Choice of effective, accessible and affordable treatments to meet the varying needs, preferences and priorities of individuals with MS Service providers who listen to individuals’ needs and respect the expertise that comes from lived experience Research for more effective treatments that have fewer side effects and are easier to use as well as research to find ways to prevent, slow, stop or reverse the accumulation of damage and disability associated with MS Research on the barriers and facilitators to access including financial, cultural, administrative, and geographic barriers Accessible general healthcare, screening and preventive services including mental, sexual and reproductive health Psychological and emotional support as required including around diagnosis and decisions about the future Rehabilitation and palliative care services appropriate to the stage of life Individuals’ personal privacy, confidentiality and sensitivities are respected Support for the network of family, friends, loved ones and unpaid caregivers This principle recognises that the quality of life of a person with MS is closely linked to that of their families and other loved ones. When one is affected, so is the other. People affected by MS – spouses, partners, family members, close friends and unpaid caregivers – experience health, emotional, social and financial impacts of their own, which are usually under-recognised and poorly addressed in public policy and services. People with MS and people affected by MS can both become vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, discrimination and stigma. The principle also acknowledges that people with MS often have caregiving roles themselves. Family members are recognised as individuals with their own quality of life needs People have access to support with personal and sexual relationships and their changing dynamics The care-giving role is understood, acknowledged, valued and financially supported Child and adolescent caregivers get special attention to protect their education, health, social and personal development Care and respite services are designed in ways that respect the personal time of family members Individuals’ personal privacy, confidentiality and sensitivities are respected Funding is available for professional assistance with personal care People with MS and people affected by MS each have opportunities to expand their own social networks Health policy research addresses the composition of the support network and strategies to enhance it Work, volunteering, education and leisure opportunities that are accessible and flexible. This principle focuses on some of the links between aspects of the external environment and elements of quality of life that contribute to a person’s sense of self-worth, independence and belonging. Rights to education, work and leisure are recognised human rights. Participating in these activities as equals empowers and enables people with MS to contribute as valued members of the family and wider society. Participation also enhances visibility and public understanding of MS, which in turn contributes to removing stigma and discrimination. Educated and informed employers; accessible workplaces and flexible working practices Access to career advice, training and professional development opportunities Educational institutions are accessible and have flexible approaches to learning and assessment processes Leisure, sport and social facilities are accessible and welcoming (encouraging, promoting participation) Accessible public and private spaces, technology and transport This principle enables participating in many of the other principles – getting around easily at home and outside is important for participating in society, relationships, education, work and leisure activities. Physical barriers or complex systems for accessing buildings and transport are common, even in health facilities, and having to rely on other people for assistance compromises independence. Online or virtual public spaces are increasingly important and require similar attention to accessibility. Rights to choose where to live and to decide when to move to accessible accommodation Housing that is designed or adapted and equipped to suit changing needs and preferences Transport that is accessible for a range of needs – not just for wheelchairs: seating, support rails, trained operators Public buildings – civic, commercial, healthcare, leisure, places of worship – that are designed or adapted and managed to be accessible for a range of needs – not just for wheelchairs: toilets, rest spaces, door design, trained staff Digital and mobile technology and services that provide increased opportunities for people affected by MS, and are accessible and usable by people with a range of impairments Financial resources to meet the changing needs and costs of living with MS This principle is relevant to almost every aspect of quality of life. People affected by MS experience substantial financial costs – for medicines, care, adaptations (such as walking aids, assistive computer software, adaptations around the home) and transport. Many household budgets cannot cope with these impacts and other expenditure suffers. In many countries, households that rely on government benefits often remain on the poverty line. These financial strains can impact on family relationships and increase isolation. The full financial impact of MS is researched and understood, including underlying factors and implications for policy and practice People with MS can earn their own living and manage their own finances Financial services (banking, investment planning and borrowing advice) are available for people affected by MS Government assistance and insurance programmes are designed to meet the variable financial needs of those with and affected by MS MS is recognised as a qualifying condition for government assistance and other relevant benefits such as subsidised public transport Positive, supportive attitudes, policies and practices that promote equality and challenge stigma and discrimination This principle focuses on the role of the external environment in affecting quality of life, emphasising the importance of explicit attention to equality issues. MS is relatively uncommon, poorly understood by policy makers and service providers and often has invisible symptoms, increasing the likelihood that needs will be overlooked. Many countries lack even basic data on MS prevalence. Lack of societal understanding of MS increases vulnerability especially for people already facing risk related to gender, sexuality, poverty, race or social status. Health professionals, support workers, employers, educators and the general public are aware of MS and understand their role in promoting the Principles Legislation and policy that promotes dignity for all Investment of public resources in reducing inequalities associated with MS Inclusion on electoral registers and accessible voting systems Inclusive approaches to innovation in communications, infrastructure and other technology development Attention to vulnerability and exclusion issues in research and policy-making What influences quality of life with MS and how can we improve it?

7955d069-c232-4692-8787-2c845eded969,"Doctors and patients don't agree: cross sectional study of patients' and doctors' perceptions and assessments of disability in multiple sclerosis Doctors and patients don't agree: cross sectional study of patients' and doctors' perceptions and assessments of disability in multiple sclerosis ; Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh EH4 2XU Correspondence to: Dr P M Rothwell Department of Clinical Neurology, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford OX2 6HE. To compare the judgments of clinicians on which domains of health in the short form questionnaire (SF-36) would be most important to patients with multiple sclerosis with the opinions of patients themselves; to compare assessment of physical disability in multiple sclerosis by a clinician using Kurtzke's expanded disability status scale and a non-clinically qualified assistant using the Office of Population Census and Surveys' (OPCS) disability scale with self assessment of disability and other domains of health related quality of life by patients using the SF-36 and the EuroQol questionnaire; and to compare the scores of patients for each domain of the SF-36 with control data matched for age and sex. Clinical department of neurology, Edinburgh. 42 consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis attending a neurology outpatient clinic for review or a neurology ward for rehabilitation. Scores on the SF-36; EuroQol; Kurtzke's expanded disability status scale; the OPCS disability scale. Patients and clinicians disagreed on which domains of health status were most important (χ=21, df=7, P=0.003). Patients' assessment of their physical disability using the physical functioning domain of the SF-36 was highly correlated with the clinicians' assessment (=-0.87, P<0.001) and the non-clinical assessment (=-0.90, P<0.001). However, none of the measures of physical disability correlated with overall health related quality of life measured with EuroQol. Quality of life correlated with vitality, general health, and mental health in the SF-36, each of which patients rated as more important than clinicians and for each of which patients scored lower than the controls. Patients with multiple sclerosis, and possibly those with other chronic diseases, are less concerned than their clinicians about physical disability in their illness. Clinical trials in multiple sclerosis should assess the effect of treatment on the other elements of health status that patients consider important, which are also affected by the disease process, are more closely related to overall health related quality of life, and may well be adversely affected by side effects of treatment. Patients can accurately assess their own physical disability Physical disability may not always be the main determinant of overall health related quality of life Patients and clinicians differ in their assessments of the relative importance of different elements of health related quality of life The opinions of patients should be taken into account in the selection of outcome measures for clinical trials Optimal assessment of the efficacy of a clinical intervention depends on the natural course of the disease under study. Sometimes it may be reasonable simply to measure the effect of treatment on case fatality or the risk of major sequelae, such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Many conditions, however, are neither fatal nor characterised by acute sequelae. In these circumstances assessment of outcome usually entails either direct measurement of the extent and severity of the disease or assessment by a physician of the physical impairment or disability caused by the disease. However, both these approaches tend to be expensive, time consuming, and prone to bias if blinding of assessors to treatment allocation is imperfect, and neither takes account of the potential adverse effects of treatment on other aspects of health. Self assessment by patients avoids bias by an external assessor, allows measurement of the effect of treatment on overall health related quality of life, and may not necessarily be less informative than clinical assessment with regard to physical disability. Recent trials of interferon beta have highlighted the uncertainty about how best to measure outcome in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis. Treatment reduces the frequency of new lesions on magnetic resonance brain scans and perhaps the number of relapses in patients, and it may reduce neurological impairment and the rate of progression of disability as measured by neurologists. However, the effect of treatment on other domains of health, which may be as or more important to patients, has not been measured. Indeed, little information exists on which aspects of health are considered important by patients with multiple sclerosis or other disabling conditions and, consequently, whether it is necessary to measure the effect of treatment on more than just the physical manifestations of the disease. Moreover, it is unclear whether assessment of physical disability requires a neurologist or whether self assessment by patients is adequate. We therefore compared the perceptions of patients with multiple sclerosis and clinicians as to the relative importance of the eight different domains of health related quality of life measured by the short form 36 (SF-36), and for each domain we compared the observed quality of life of patients with that expected for general population controls matched for age, sex, and locality. We further assessed the correlation between patients' self assessment of physical disability using the physical function domain of the SF-36 and physical disability measured by a neurologist and a non-medically qualified assistant (using different scales), and we examined the correlation between each measure of physical disability and the overall health related quality of life estimated by patients. Over eight weeks we studied all patients with multiple sclerosis, either admitted to the neurology ward for rehabilitation or attending the neurology outpatient clinics at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh. Patients were eligible if they gave informed consent and fulfilled the following criteria: had a clinically definite or laboratory supported clinically probable diagnosis of multiple sclerosis according to Poser 's criteria; had had no acute neurological relapse during the previous month; were resident in Lothian region; and knew that they had multiple sclerosis. A neurologist measured neurological impairment by using Kurtzke's expanded disability status scale. An independent non-clinically qualified assistant administered the disability questionnaire of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS), and patients completed the SF-36 and the EuroQol health related quality of life questionnaire. The order of clinical assessment and questionnaire administration was not specified, and both investigators were blind to each other's findings. After completion of the questionnaires, patients were given a standard written description of each of the eight elements of health related quality of life assessed in the SF-36 and were asked which three elements were the most important determinants of their overall quality of life. Using the same descriptions, clinicians working in the department of clinical neurosciences (senior and junior neurologists or neurosurgeons) were asked which three domains of the SF-36 they thought were the most important determinants of health related quality of life for patients with multiple sclerosis. Age and sex stratified tabular control data for each of the domains of the SF-36 were obtained from a survey of health related quality of life in over 6000 people resident in Lothian in 1993. The data were in the form of mean scores for men and women in five year age bands. The expected score for each case was taken as the corresponding age and sex matched mean control value. Kurtzke's scale was treated as an ordinal scale, and scores on this scale were correlated with other scores by using the Spearman rank method with a two tailed test of significance. The OPCS scale and the SF-36 were treated as interval scales. All analyses were performed with the statistical software package SPSS for Windows (version 3.0). Of the 47 eligible patients who attended the department during the study period, 42 (89%) agreed to participate. Median age was 41 (range 28-68) years; 28 patients were women, and 33 were outpatients. The median score on Kurtzke's scale was 5.5 (range 1-8). The frequency distribution of domains of the SF-36 reported to be important by patients and clinicians (fig ) differed from those expected by chance alone (patients: χ=16.2, df=7, P=0.02; clinicians: χ=44.7, df=7, P<0.0001) and from each other (χ= 21.4, df=7, P=0.003). The clinicians were significantly more likely than the patients to rate physical functioning and physical role limitations as important and significantly less likely to be concerned with mental health and emotional role limitations. The mean score among the patients was less than that expected on the basis of the age and sex matched control data from the general population for physical functioning, physical role limitations, general health, mental health, and vitality in the SF-36 (table ). Frequency with which each of eight domains of health related quality of life in SF-36 were said to be among the three most important determinants of overall quality of life by 42 patients with multiple sclerosis compared with frequency expected by 25 clinicians working in clinical neurosciences department Median scores of 42 patients with multiple sclerosis for each domain of SF-36 compared with expected scores derived from general population controls matched for age and sex Physical disability measured by the non-medically qualified assistant using the OPCS disability scale was correlated with the score on Kurtzke's scale obtained by the neurologist (=0.84, P<0.0001). Physical disability measured by the patients using the physical functioning domain of the SF-36 was highly correlated with both the score on Kurtzke's scale and the overall OPCS disability score (fig ). However, none of the scores of the other domains of the SF-36 were correlated with the score on Kurtzke's scale, and only the score for vitality was correlated with the OPCS disability score (table ). Neither the score on Kurtzke's scale nor the OPCS score was correlated with overall health related quality of life estimated by the patients using the visual analogue scale in the EuroQol questionnaire (fig ). Overall health related quality of life was, however, correlated significantly with vitality, general health, mental health, and physical role limitation in the SF-36 (table ).

The number beside some dots shows the number of points overlying each other Correlation between each of eight domains of SF-36 and scores on Kurtzke's expanded disability status scale, OPCS disability scale, and patients' estimate of their overall health related quality of life using EuroQol questionnaire Doctors are not good at estimating the overall quality of life of their patients. O'Boyle and colleagues argued that a valid measure of quality of life should quantify the level of functioning of each individual in those areas of life that he or she believes to be most important. We have shown, at least in multiple sclerosis, that doctors' assessments of the relative importance of the domains of health related quality of life differ from those of patients. The pattern of domains reported to be important by the patients and that reported by the clinicians both differed significantly from the distribution expected by chance alone. In other words, there was a degree of agreement within the patient group and within the medical group as to which domains were most important. However, there was significant disagreement between the two groups. Generally the clinicians were more concerned than the patients about the physical manifestations of disease; the patients were more concerned with less tangible quantities such as mental health and vitality. Although we did not study the reliability of these assessments, we have produced some evidence of their importance. Firstly, the patients with multiple sclerosis had significantly lower scores than the general population controls for three of the four domains of the SF-36 (mental health, vitality, and general health) that they rated higher than the clinicians did. Secondly, these domains were highly correlated with their estimates of overall health related quality of life. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the patient's viewpoint is more important than that of the doctor. Doctors will usually have a better understanding of the natural course and possible clinical manifestations of a particular disease, and their opinions may be based on experience of treating many patients. Nevertheless, doctors should at least bear in mind that their concerns may not coincide with those of their patients when considering whether to prescribe treatment, and, as has been suggested recently, trialists should consider taking patients' views into account when designing trials. Irrespective of which domains of health related quality of life are important to patients with multiple sclerosis, physical disability should clearly still be measured in trials of treatments that potentially modify disease. Although Kurtzke's scale is the most commonly used measure of disability in multiple sclerosis, it is expensive and time consuming to perform as it requires a full clinical examination by a neurologist. Questionnaire based disability scales, such as the OPCS scale, have the advantage that they can be administered by non-clinical assistants, although this will still be relatively costly in a large multicentre trial. Moreover, both options require blinding of assessors to treatment allocation. Non-blinded assessment can significantly bias the results of multiple sclerosis trials in favour of treatment, and blinding is difficult to maintain in practice without going to considerable lengths. Self assessment by patients has the advantage of eliminating the potential for bias by an external assessor, although it does not avoid bias resulting from placebo effects experienced by patients. Postal or telephone follow up with the SF-36, or a similar instrument, would be easily standardised and relatively inexpensive. Assessment of physical disability by a non-clinically qualified assistant using the OPCS disability scale was correlated with that obtained by a neurologist using Kurtzke's scale. The functional limitations profile has also been shown to be highly correlated with Kurtzke's scale. We have shown that self assessment of disability by patients, using the physical functioning domain of the SF-36, can provide closely similar information to that obtained with Kurtzke's scale or the OPCS disability scale. Patients could provide their self assessment by post or telephone, and, at least on a cross sectional basis, this would provide about 80% of the information obtained with Kurtzke's scale or the OPCS scale (=0.76 and=0.81 respectively). However, none of the measurements of physical disability was correlated with the patients' assessments of their overall health related quality of life based on the EuroQol questionnaire. Overall health related quality of life was correlated most significantly with vitality, general health, and mental health in the SF-36. Given that these domains were all thought to be important by patients and that the scores obtained from patients for each of the domains were lower than those expected on the basis of control data–that is, the scores had been affected by the disease process–the assessment of overall health related quality of life seems to have some validity. Other studies have shown that measurement of health related quality of life in multiple sclerosis can be reproducible. The finding that patients rate variables such as vitality, general health, and mental health as important determinants of their overall health related quality of life is important when considering how best to incorporate the side effects of treatments into the results of clinical trials. Side effects are rarely incorporated into the overall trial result and are usually simply listed separately. Whether the benefits of treatment justify the side effects is therefore left for doctors to decide for themselves. However, as the concerns of doctors and patients may not coincide this may be inappropriate. Treatments given to patients with multiple sclerosis frequently cause side effects that are sufficiently severe to influence patients' quality of life. For example, interferon beta may cause reactions at the injection site, flu-like symptoms, nausea, myalgia, fever, depression, and malaise, each of which is likely to have an adverse effect on the very domains of health related quality of life that patients consider more important than doctors. Measuring outcome with an overall measure of health related quality of life would at least record the patients' perspective on whether the treatment was worse than the disease itself.

MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Reviewed By: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In MS, the immune system attacks and damages or destroys myelin, a substance that surrounds and insulates the nerves. The myelin destruction causes a distortion or interruption in nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain. This can result in a wide variety of symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is estimated to affect 2.8 million people worldwide. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, though it can also occur in young children and the elderly. Multiple sclerosis is three times more common in women than in men. In addition, nearly all women afflicted with MS get the condition before menopause. This could mean that hormones play an important role in the disease’s development. Usually, MS in men is more severe than it is in women. They typically get MS in their 30s and 40s, just as their testosterone levels begin to decline. Although MS is more common in women than men overall, one form of the disease contradicts this pattern. People with primary progressive (PP) MS are about as likely to be male as female. (The four main types of MS are described later). People who smoke are more likely to develop MS, and to develop it more severely and with a faster progression. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other ethnicities. MS is believed to have a genetic component as people with a first-degree relative with the disease have a higher incidence than the general population. We don't know exactly what causes multiple sclerosis, but it is believed to be some combination of immunologic, environmental, infectious, and/or genetic factors. Some theories have been proposed, though there is not enough evidence to establish any one cause. Theories as to what causes MS include: Exposure to chemical solvents such as amines, esters, ethers, and ketones Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly perceives its own myelin (the protective sheath around the nerves) as an intruder and attacks it, as it would a virus or other foreign infectious agent. To understand how this harms the body, it helps to understand how nerves work. A nerve can be seen by the naked eye, but it is made up of hundreds or even thousands of microscopic nerve fibers wrapped by connective tissue. Nerves conduct messages to and from the brain by way of electrical impulses. Often the nerve fibers that make up a nerve are all individually wrapped in myelin, a protective sheath that causes electric impulses to conduct down the nerve much faster than fibers that lack myelin. (The same principle is used to improve electric wires by covering them with a plastic outer layer.) In multiple sclerosis, the immune system's T cells attack the myelin sheath. By attacking myelin, the immune system in a person with MS causes inflammation and degeneration of the myelin that can lead to demyelination, or stripping of the myelin covering of the nerves. It can also cause scarring (the ""sclerosis"" in the name “multiple sclerosis”). This causes electrical impulses to travel more slowly along the nerves resulting in deterioration of function in body processes such as vision, speech, walking, writing, and memory. While multiple sclerosis is not hereditary, genetics are believed to play a role. In the U.S., the chances of developing MS are one in 750. Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling) increases the risk to up to 5%. An identical twin of someone with MS has a 25% chance of being diagnosed with the disorder. It is thought there is an outside trigger, as genetics only makes certain people susceptible to getting MS, which is why the disease is not considered hereditary. Genes may make a person more likely to develop the disease, but it is believed that there still is an additional outside trigger that makes it happen. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis that have been identified and each type can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and a patient's response to treatment. The four types of MS are discussed on the next four slides. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS, RRMS or RMS) is the most common type of MS, affecting about 85% of MS sufferers. RR-MS is defined by inflammatory attacks on the myelin and nerve fibers causing a worsening of neurologic function. Symptoms vary from patient to patient, and symptoms can flare up (called relapses or exacerbations) unexpectedly, and then disappear (remission). Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS, PPMS) is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any relapses or remissions. There may be occasional plateaus, but overall, the progression of the disability is continuous. This form of MS occurs equally in men and women, and the age of onset is about 10 years later than in relapsing-remitting MS. Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS, SPMS) is a form of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS. Most people diagnosed with RR-MS will eventually transition to having SP-MS. After a period of relapses (also called attacks, or exacerbations) and remissions the disease will start to progress steadily. People with SP-MS may or may not experience remissions. Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PR-MS, PRMS) is the least common form of MS, occurring in about 5% of MS patients. People with PR-MS experience steady disease progression and worsening neurological function as seen in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS), along with occasional relapses like people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS). Symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be single or multiple. They may range from mild to severe in intensity. They may also be long-term or short-term in duration. Multiple sclerosis is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms are so varied and can resemble other diseases. It is often diagnosed by a process of exclusion – that is, by ruling out other neurological diseases – so the diagnosis of MS may take months to years. A physician will do a complete history and neurological exam, along with tests to evaluate mental, emotional and language functions, strength, coordination, balance, reflexes, gait, and vision. Tests to Help Confirm a Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Cerebrospinal fluid exam (spinal tap, lumbar puncture) One of the main ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. Characteristic areas of demyelination will show up as lesions on an MRI scan. On the left is a brain MRI scan of a 35-year-old man with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that reveals multiple lesions with high T2 signal intensity and one large white matter lesion. The right image shows the cervical spinal cord of a 27-year-old woman representing a multiple sclerosis demyelination and plaque (see arrow). There are several aspects to treating multiple sclerosis. Modifying the disease – there are several drugs that can reduce the severity and frequency of relapses Treating exacerbations (or attacks) with high dose corticosteroids Rehabilitation both for fitness and to manage energy levels Treatment for multiple sclerosis may include drugs to manage attacks, symptoms, or both. Many medications carry the risk of some side effects, so patients need to manage their treatment with their doctors. Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation in the body and affect the function of the immune system. They are often used to manage MS attacks, but can have numerous side effects. There are several medications approved for disease modification, including the following: Many medications are used to treat and manage symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol): Solu-Medrol is given intravenously during the acute attack, sometimes followed up with an oral corticosteroid. Continued from the last slide, here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. : Anti-convulsants like carbamazepine (Tegretol) or gabapentin (Neurontin) are used for face or limb pain. : Anti-depressants or electrical stimulation are used for pricking pain, intense tingling, and burning. : Antibiotics are used to manage infections : Vitamin C and cranberry juice are used to prevent infections : Used for bladder dysfunction This is usually treated by increasing fluids and fiber to the diet. Often resistant to treatment. Sometimes drugs or surgery are used if tremors are severe. There has been a lot of progress over the years in managing multiple sclerosis, and research is ongoing into new therapies. There are several new avenues of current research. Scientists hope to find further associations between lifestyle and illness progression. They want to learn ways to repair and reverse the damage MS causes. And they hope to learn the ultimate cause of this disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that progressively damages the nerves of the brain and spinal cord. Any sensory or motor (muscular) function in the body may be affected by the nerves damaged from MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, immunological, infectious, and/or environmental factors. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis and symptoms range from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and, to some degree, the patient's response to treatment. What Is Multiple Sclerosis?

Exploring the link between pediatric MS and a family history of autoimmune disorders The “economic complications” of MS: unemployment and underemployment Assessing the extent and impact of “stem cell tourism” The opening months of 2019 saw significant research advances on many fronts in multiple sclerosis (MS). A sophisticated analysis of data using healthcare claims found that the number of people in the United States living with MS is more than twice as high as previously estimated. Dietary studies sounded a cautionary note for people with MS drinking soda and many other sweetened beverages, and a hopeful note on the potential for flavonoid-rich cocoa to reduce MS-associated fatigue. A promising stem-cell therapy is moving forward in the clinical-trials process, while the FDA is considering whether to approve a new disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Additionally, genetic analysis, population-based studies, and other investigations are steadily expanding scientists’ understanding of MS risk factors and physiologic processes, laying the groundwork for new treatments and other interventions. This edition of “What’s New in MS Research” covers all of those developments and more. Beyond perusing the items that follow, please check the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America’s periodically for updates on other research advances and comprehensive information on all aspects of living with MS. Analysis shows the number of people with MS to be much higher than previously estimated As many as 913,925 people living in the United States had multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2017, according to estimates derived from an extensive analysis of healthcare claims. That number is more than double the previous estimate of 400,000 affected people in the United States. [Wallin 2019] Researchers arrived at the higher figure by using a sophisticated algorithm (a step-by-step problem-solving process) to analyze the data found in claims from private, public, and military healthcare systems covering more than 125 million people. Drawing on the claims data, the investigators first calculated that 727,344 people in the United States were affected by MS in 2010. They then extrapolated their findings to come up with a low and a high estimate of the number of people living with MS in 2017. Those 2017 estimates ranged from 851,749 people to 913,925 people, or from 337.9 cases per 100,000 population to 362.6 cases per 100,000. The figures represent the MS prevalence, which is the cumulative number of cases diagnosed over several years among people who are still living. [Wallin 2019] The analysis also confirmed the long-standing finding that MS is more common in women than men. For 2010, investigators found that MS prevalence was 450.1 cases per 100,000 women versus 159.7 cases per 100,000 men, for a female:male ratio of 2.8-1. Further, the 2010 data showed that MS prevalence was highest in people aged 55 to 64 years, and that MS is more common in the north than in the south, differing from a high of 377.4 cases per 100,000 in the northeast to 272.6 cases per 100,000 in the south. [Wallin 2019] Our findings suggest that there has been a steady rise in the prevalence of MS over the past five decades, the researchers noted. [Wallin 2019] Correcting lower, inaccurate estimates of how many people are affected by MS is critical as the government, payers, and healthcare systems determine how to allocate resources – including research funds and patient-care staff – to address various conditions and diseases. Drinking roughly two cans per day of non-diet soda or other beverages sweetened with sugar may be tied to more severe multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms and greater disability relative to not drinking or seldom consuming such beverages. This conclusion is according to a study involving 135 people with MS. [AAN Feb. 26] The study focused on how participants’ diets compared to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. The DASH diet recommends whole grains, fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, lean meats, poultry and fish, and nuts and legumes. It also limits foods that are high in saturated fat and sugar. [AAN Feb. 26] Researchers divided the participants into five groups based on those study subject’s self-reported consumption of soda and sugar-sweetened beverages. The people in the top group drank an average of 290 calories of sugar-sweetened beverages – the rough equivalent of two cans of non-diet soda – per day. The lowest group seldom drank sugar-sweetened beverages. The study found that people with MS who drank the largest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages were five-times more likely to have severe disability than those in the lowest-consumption group. The top group had an average score of 4.1 points on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), while the bottom group had an average score of 3.4 points. [AAN Feb. 26] MS patients often want to know how diet and specific foods can affect the progression of their disease, noted study author Elisa Meier-Gerdingh, MD, of St. Josef Hospital in Bochum, Germany. While we did not find a link with overall diet, interestingly, we did find a link with those who drank sodas, flavored juices and sweetened teas and coffees. Dr. Meier-Gerdingh added that while the results of the research need to be confirmed by larger, longer studies, We do know that sodas have no nutritional value, and people with MS may want to consider reducing or eliminating them from their diet. [AAN Feb. 26] The researcher also noted that the study assessed participants diets and sugar-sweetened beverages at the same time as disability, precluding investigators from determining whether sugar-sweetened beverages contribute to higher disability or whether more severe disease affects a person’s ability to follow a healthy diet. [AAN Feb. 26] Further information on the study will be presented at the 71st annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, which will take place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in early May 2019. Meanwhile, a sweet remedy for MS-related fatigue shows early promise A cup of flavonoid-rich cocoa may someday be just what the doctor orders to help with the fatigue frequently experienced by people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Flavonoids are a group of more than 5,000 plant chemicals found in fruits and vegetables, and are especially abundant in cocoa and dark chocolate. Flavonoids, which are associated with anti-inflammatory properties, have been previously studied in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. [BMJ March 4] Researchers in the United Kingdom recently assessed the impact of flavonoids on MS-related fatigue in a randomized, double-blind study that involved 30 women and 10 men with RRMS. Those study participants were randomized to drink either high-flavonoid or low-flavonoid cocoa each day for six weeks. [Coe 2019] At the end of the study period, the people drinking the high-flavonoid cocoa showed a 45% improvement in subjectively assessed fatigue and an 80% improvement in walking speed. Overall, 11 of the 19 people in the high-flavonoid group and eight of the 21 people in the low-flavonoid group reported improvement in their fatigue. [Coe 2019] The researchers noted that the mental and physical fatigue experienced by people with MS arise from complex causes, likely involving neural, inflammatory, metabolic, and psychological factors. Flavonoids potentially could be used in conjunction with exercise, medication, and physical therapy to provide a comprehensive approach to managing fatigue in MS, they added. The use of dietary approaches to reduce fatigue and associated factors in people with MS may be an easy, safe, and cost-effective way to have an impact on quality of life and independence, allowing people to feel more in control of their condition, the investigators said in calling for more-extensive research into the potential for flavonoids to reduce MS-related fatigue. [BMJ March 4] Clinical trial to evaluate stem-cell therapy for progressive MS A therapy that would use a patient s own stem cells to treat progressive MS is moving toward the clinical trial stage. In December 2018, the FDA approved an application from BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics to begin a Phase II clinical trial of NurOwn mesenchymal stem cell-neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF) cells. [BrainStorm] The trial is scheduled to get under way early this year, with an estimated primary completion date of February 2020 and full completion date of September 2020. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] The Phase II trial will involve 20 people with progressive MS, and will be conducted at multiple locations. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] Participants mesenchymal stem cells will first be removed from their bone marrow via insertion of a hollow needle. Those cells then will be converted into MSC-NTF cells by growing them under patented conditions that cause the cells to secrete high levels of neurotrophic factors, which are molecules that support the development and differentiation of neurons. [BrainStorm] The MSC-NTF cells will be re-introduced into the patients bodies through three intrathecal cell transplantations over the course of 16 weeks. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] Autologous (meaning from the patient’s own body) MSC-NTF cells can deliver neurotrophic factors and other immune-modulating molecules directly to the site of damage to elicit a desired biological effect and ultimately slow or stabilize disease, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics explained in outlining the rationale for the treatment. [BrainStorm] Participants will be followed for 28 weeks after the start of treatment, with researchers monitoring for adverse events. The study will also measure the change from baseline to 28 weeks post-treatment in the participants 25-foot walking speed. Sixteen weeks after treatment, researchers will analyze the participants cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to determine how many individuals had changes in neurotrophic factors in their CSF. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] In announcing the FDA’s acceptance of its application to conduct a Phase II study, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics noted, There are currently no FDA-approved autologous cellular therapies addressing MS or other neurological diseases. The company is also conducting a Phase III clinical trial of autologous MSC-NTF cells for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. [BrainStorm] Late 2019 target date for FDA action on potential new treatment for relapsing-remitting MS The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set a fourth quarter 2019 target date to act on an application to approve the oral agent diroximel fumarate to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). [Alkermes Feb. 25] In late February, the pharmaceutical companies Alkermes plc and Biogen Inc. announced that the FDA had accepted a new drug application (NDA) for diroximel fumarate. [Alkermes Feb. 25] Biogen currently markets the oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) dimethyl fumarate in the United States as Tecfidera. Biogen and Alkermes note that diroximel fumarate may have the potential to offer differentiated GI [gastrointestinal] tolerability due to its chemical structure as compared to dimethyl fumarate. [Alkermes Feb. 25] The prescribing information for Tecfidera notes that in clinical trials of the agent, 18% of patients reported abdominal pain, 14% reported diarrhea, 12% said they experienced nausea, and 9% reported vomiting. [Tecfidera PI] The application for FDA approval of diroximel fumarate is based on the results of the Phase III, open-label, two-year safety study EVOLVE-MS-1, along with studies comparing the pharmacologic profiles of diroximel fumarate and dimethyl fumarate. Alkermes is also conducting the EVOLVE-MS-2 study in people with RRMS. That five-week study will compare the GI tolerability of diroximel fumarate with that of dimethyl fumarate. [Alkermes Feb. 25] If the FDA approves diroximel fumarate, Biogen intends to market the oral DMT under the brand name VUMERITY, subject to approval by the FDA, which has conditionally accepted the name. [Alkermes Feb. 25] Biogen studying an extended dosing interval for Tysabri Can stretching out the time between doses of Tysabri (natalizumab) enable people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to continue to derive health benefits from the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), while reducing the risk for a rare but serious brain infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? It is a question that MS researchers have been asking since evidence emerged a few years ago that Tysabri was associated with an elevated risk for the viral infection. Since then, individual MS centers and neurologists have adapted extended-dosing intervals and reported their results to Biogen, the company that markets Tysabri. They in turn have used this information to conduct a retrospective analysis of patients receiving extended-interval dosing (EID) vs. those on the FDA-approved standard-interval dose (SID) of 300 mg every four weeks. [Biogen January 3] Now, however, Biogen will be comparing the safety and efficacy of six-week dosing to that of the standard four-week dose in a prospective, randomized study that will enroll approximately 480 people with RRMS. In early January, the company announced that it had enrolled the first patient in the two-year, Phase IIIB study, known as NOVA. The global study will evaluate people who switch to the six-week EID after one year on the four-week SID regimen to those who remain on SID. The primary endpoint will be the number of new or newly enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions seen on MRI at 48 weeks of treatment. [Biogen January 3] Biogen initiated the NOVA study after its retrospective analyses showed that EID was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of PML, the company noted. More than 190,000 people worldwide have been treated with Tysabri. [Biogen January 3] An analysis of pooled data from more than 37,000 patients participating in four large clinical trials found that fewer than 1% overall had developed PML. [Ho] However, among those who had an antibody known as the anti-John Cunningham virus (anti-JCV) antibody, the estimated cumulative probability of having PML over the course of six years of Tysabri treatment was 2.7% in those who had used an immunosuppressant agent before Tysabri and 1.7% in those who had not received an immunosuppressant previously. [Ho] The NOVA study may generate valuable data that we hope will answer questions for the scientific community about the efficacy of nataliuzumab when its dosing schedule is extended to every six weeks, and in conjunction with prior safety analyses, may inform on the drug’s benefit-risk profile, noted Alfred Sandrock, MD, PhD, Biogen’s executive vice president and chief medical officer. [Biogen January 3] Use of a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) early in pregnancy does not appear to be associated with a significant risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. That’s the conclusion of a database analysis that evaluated 984,058 pregnancies occurring between 2011 and 2015, including 1,649 pregnancies to women with MS. Thirty-five percent of the women with MS filled a DMT prescription within 90 days before pregnancy. Researchers concluded, Pregnancies with and without early DMT exposure had similar risks of outcomes to one another and to pregnancies in women without MS. [MacDonald 2019] Please note that while these findings are encouraging, women who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant while taking a DMT are advised to consult with their physician. Rituxan and no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) in pediatric-onset MS Rituxan (rituximab) is a monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis, forms of lymphoma and leukemia, and other conditions. Although it is not approved for use in multiple sclerosis (MS), some neurologists use it off-label to treat their adult MS patients. Now, a chart review of pediatric-onset MS (POMS) patients treated with Rituxan at Texas Children’s Hospital suggests that the agent is effective in younger people. The analysis examined data on 17 patients who ranged in age from 13 years to 22 years at the time of the chart review. All had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) six months or longer after starting Rituxan. Their mean age was 18 years, and their mean disease duration was 41 months (close to three and a half years). Four of the study subjects received Rituxan as their first disease-modifying therapy. Nine switched to Rituxan from another DMT because of disease progression, while another four switched to Rituxan after experiencing side effects on an earlier DMT. [Shukla ACTRIMS 2019] The review found that 82% (14 of 17) of those young patients had no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) as measured by absence of new T2 or contrast-enhancing lesions on MRI, absence of relapses, and absence of increased post-treatment disability. [Shukla ACTRIMS 2019] While acknowledging that the retrospective nature of the analysis and the small number of patients involved were study limitations, the authors nonetheless noted that our data supports the use of rituximab in POMS and suggests high rates of NEDA in this population. [Shukla ACTRIMS 2019] Can reducing children’s weight reduce their risk for MS later in life? Clinicians long have noted that many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) were overweight as children, but the complex nature of MS makes establishing a cause-and-effect relationship difficult. Now, however, a team of Canadian and British researchers has found genetic support for childhood obesity playing a role in the development of MS. Those researchers conducted a genome-wide association study involving 14,802 people with MS and 26,703 controls. They identified 22 genetic variants strongly associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) and examined the effect that each variant had on MS. [Harroud 2019] One key finding: a one-standard deviation (SD) increase in childhood BMI increased the risk of developing MS by 29%. [Harroud 2019] The researchers noted, These findings suggest that targeting childhood obesity may be an effective strategy to reduce MS incidence. [Harroud 2019] Exploring the link between pediatric MS and a family history of autoimmune disorders Children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis (MS) are more than twice as likely as other young people to have a close relative with an autoimmune disorder. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] That finding emerged from an ongoing, multi-center study of risk factors for pediatric MS. The study, which began in 2011, compares the medical data, biologic specimens, and family history of children and adolescents with MS with that of their peers unaffected by the condition. After adjusting for variables such as sex, race, age, and ethnicity, the analysis identified family history of autoimmune disease as a factor associated with an increased risk for developing MS before adulthood. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] The odds of a pediatric MS patient having either a first- or second-degree relative with an autoimmune condition were 2.27 times that of a young person without MS, according to researchers. They noted that the differences between young people with MS and healthy controls were most marked when there was a family history of diabetes, thyroid disorders, or rheumatoid arthritis. Conversely, no difference in risk was observed when a family member had eczema or psoriasis. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] Researchers also found that the odds of autoimmune disease among family members was significantly higher on the father’s side of a young person’s family compared to the mother’s side. The investigators noted that this increased prevalence of certain autoimmune disorders in close relatives of pediatric MS patients aligns with prior findings among adult populations. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] As investigators continue to explore how genetics and immunologic function contribute to the development of MS in children and teenagers, this study adds another piece to a complex puzzle. The “economic complications” of MS: unemployment and underemployment Unemployment and underemployment are common among people with multiple sclerosis (MS), with fatigue being a major obstacle to workplace participation and productivity. That’s one of the early insights from ongoing research being conducted by the North American Registry for Care and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (NARCRMS). [Rammohan ACTRIMS 2019] The Registry collects a wide range of information on people with MS, and uses that information to examine issues such as the economic impact of MS. An early analysis of data from 212 NARCRMS patients found that 31% either were unemployed or underemployed. Among those who were employed, almost one-third said that MS affected their work, with fatigue being the leading issue cited. The economic impact of identifying an effective treatment for this disabling symptom of MS cannot be overstated, the study’s authors noted. [Rammohan ACTRIMS 2019] Assessing the extent and impact of “stem cell tourism” “Stem cell tourism” is the latest manifestation of a trend as old as the disease itself offering unproven therapies to desperate patients. The phenomenon is increasingly prevalent in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurologic diseases, according to a team of researchers from Ohio State University. Those investigators recently surveyed academic neurologists across America, and found that 65% had at least one patient who had received unproven cellular preparations. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] It should be noted that patients receiving such preparation without their physician’s knowledge or against their physician’s advice is entirely different from participating in a stem cell clinical trial that has been carefully designed, approved by hospital officials, registered on clinicaltrials.gov, and meets rigorous ethical, safety, and monitoring standards. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] The academic neurologists reported that 33% of their patients had received unproven “stem cell therapies” in the United States, 22% had received their treatment abroad, and 37% had received preparations in both the United States and abroad. Overseas destinations included China, Germany, Mexico, the Bahamas, Russia, and Costa Rica. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] Three-quarters of the survey respondents said their patients did not report complications from receiving these unproven preparations. However, among the 25% whose patients did report adverse effects, complications included stroke, meningoencephalitis, quadriparesis, sepsis, hepatitis C, seizures, and infections. At least three respondents had patients who died following these procedures. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] The authors said that the complications of these unproven approaches and the overall negative impact on people with MS underscore the need for a comprehensive education campaign to prevent the exploitation of individuals with MS.

This instrument provides an assessment of several domains of mental health including anxiety, depression, behavioral control, positive affect, and general distress. The full-length MHI consists of 18 items while the abbreviated version has 5 items. The abbreviated version can be used if time is limited but the full-length version has the advantage of generating subscales. The MHI is one of the components of the . Administration time is approximately 5-10 minutes for the full-length version and 2-3 minutes for the abbreviated version. The MHI is a structured, self-report questionnaire that the patient can generally complete with little or no intervention from an interviewer. However, patients with visual or upper extremity impairments may need to have the MHI administered as an interview. Interviewers should be trained in basic interviewing skills and in the use of this instrument. The scoring system for the MHI is relatively complex and generates a total score as well as subscale scores for anxiety, depression, behavior control, and positive affect. (PDF) The MHI is easy to administer and provides a quick assessment of both positive and negative facets of mental health, not just psychopathology. The availability of the four subscales, anxiety, depression, behavior control, and positive affect may be useful to investigators interested in testing hypotheses concerning these different areas of function. It is important to keep in mind that the MHI cannot be used to generate a formal psychiatric diagnosis and is dependent upon self-report. Investigators interested in studying emotional aspects of MS in depth would probably want to consider more extensive assessment methods. The full-length version of the MHI has a Cronbach's alpha of .93 while the short form has an alpha of .82. The MHI has been studied extensively in large populations and comes with considerable evidence for its validity. In the field testing for the MSQLI the MHI showed good convergent and discriminant validity. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms, Causes, Treatment, Diagnosis, and Life Expectancy Medical Author: Medical Editor: What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? 5 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis?

What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is caused by damage to tissues surrounding nerve fibers. () is a condition that results from damage to myelin, the tissues surrounding nerves of the brain and . Damage to the myelin is a result of an autoimmune disease in which the body produces an immune response against its own tissues. is more common in women than in men. Symptoms and signs of are extremely variable and range from mild to severe, and may include: Some people with MS may have no symptoms to mild symptoms; about 30% of those affected will have significant disability after 20-25 years with the condition. The average age of onset for MS is about 34 years of age; but children and teens also get the condition. There is no cure for MS, but disease-modifying drugs can reduce the symptoms, delay disability, and reduce progression of the condition as seen on . The body's immune system attacks nerve sheaths, causing multiple sclerosis.. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be thought of as an immune-mediated inflammatory process involving different areas of the () at various points in time. As the name suggests, the condition affects many areas of the central or CNS. Normal nerves are surrounded by a myelin sheath to insulate and protect them from damage. This sheath also allows effects how fast nerve signals get from the brain or spinal cord (CNS) to the affected body part. As this sheath is destroyed, the nerve conduction to that body area or part decreases or is interrupted completely. The destruction is caused by the body's immune system attacking the myelin sheath. The reason that the body's immune system attacks the sheath is not understood fully, but it is believed to be related to a combination of a genetic predisposition and acquired or environmental influences. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? The signs and symptoms of MS in adults, children, and teens are similar; however, children and teens with the disease (pediatric MS) also may have and complete that adults with MS do not experience. Moreover, symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis differ from person to person. Visual, sensory, and motor signs and symptoms are all part of MS; however, there is a wide range of symptoms that can appear. Some people have mild cases of MS with little or no disability over the years. Others have more severe types of MS, requiring confinement to a wheelchair or bed. Over 30% of those affected with MS will have a significant disability after 20 to 25 years. Still, others may live their entire lives symptom-free (some individuals without multiple sclerosis symptoms are found incidentally to have multiple sclerosis lesions by MRI or individuals in whom an examination of their brain after death unexpectedly reveals that they were affected by the disease). This variability makes it difficult in some cases to diagnose multiple sclerosis. Often the signs and symptoms are mistaken as being psychiatric in origin. 5 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis The of multiple sclerosis are often . Large number of people with multiple sclerosis develop optic neuritis (inflammation of the , which is an extension of the central nervous system), described as a painful vision loss. If a patient is diagnosed with optic neuritis early, treatment could change the course of the disease. Before the actual loss of vision, the patient may have visual changes described by many people as blurred or hazy vision, flashing lights, or alterations in color. The tissues around the eye and moving the eye may be painful. Most people recover over several months. Others are left with permanent visual defects. Double vision occurs when the eyes move in different directions and is another common symptom of multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis Pictures, Symptoms and Treatment What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis commonly affects the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for balance and fine motor coordination. Consequently, people with multiple sclerosis often have difficulty maintaining their balance when walking and performing delicate tasks with their hands. The unexplained dropping of a cup or other objects, or unusual weakness can occur. Electrical-type pain sensations in the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs There appears to be a relationship between multiple sclerosis, higher temperatures, and the worsening of symptoms. occur in about 5% of people with multiple sclerosis. Those with MS may complain of disturbances, , or may feel that they are experiencing changes in attention span or memory. Many symptoms of multiple sclerosis lead to other complications, such as infections of the bladder (urinary infections), kidney, or blood. Any area of the body can be involved, making this disease difficult to distinguish from other nervous system disorders. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis in Children and Teens (Pediatric MS)? The signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis in children and teens are similar to those experienced by adults; however, they also may have seizures and extreme or lethargy. Children with MS are considered to have the form of MS known as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. They process information from our environment and control voluntary muscle movements to allow the body to do certain things. When you touch something hot, for example, signals are sent from sensory nerve endings in your hand up long nerves in your arm, eventually reaching the spinal cord. From there, the signal is transferred up your spinal cord to your brain, where the information is processed. Your brain then sends a signal back down the spinal cord to the nerves in your arm. These nerves cause the muscles in your arm to contract, pulling your hand away from the heat. This system works efficiently, unless there is a disease process affecting the nerve pathways in the spinal cord and brain. MS is one of the diseases that can affect these pathways. The nerves in the body are covered by a fatty substance called myelin (myelin sheath). The myelin sheath insulates the nerves and allows them to transmit information to and from the brain in a fraction of a second. If the myelin is disrupted in any way, the transmitted information is not only delayed, but it may also be misinterpreted by the brain. This autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath leads to areas of (also known as plaques) in the brain and spinal cord. These plaques disrupt the transmission of information by nerves in the CNS and lead to the symptoms seen in MS. At What Age Can Multiple Sclerosis Start? Who Has MS? MS is more common in individuals of northern European descent. Women are more than twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men. Multiple sclerosis usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and the average age of onset is approximately 34 years. Multiple sclerosis can affect children and teens (pediatric MS). It has been estimated that 2%-5% of people with MS develop symptoms prior to age 18. What Is Multiple Sclerosis? MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Diagnosing multiple sclerosis is difficult. The vague and nonspecific nature of this disease mimics many other diseases. Doctors combine history, physical exam, laboratory work, and sophisticated medical imaging techniques to arrive at a diagnosis. More often than not, a specialist is required to make a diagnosis. Examples of tests and procedures used to diagnose MS include: A (), blood chemistry, , and often spinal fluid evaluation ( or “”) are all routine laboratory tests used to rule out other conditions and help confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. An MRI, which creates an image of the brain or the spinal cord, is used to search for changes within the brain or spinal cord that are unique to multiple sclerosis. What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? There are several treatment options for multiple sclerosis. Listed examples below are US FDA-approved drugs to treat multiple sclerosis. These are known as disease-modifying therapies for MS. Disease-modifying therapies have been found through clinical trials to reduce the number of relapses, delay the progression of disability, and limit new disease activity that is observed on MRI. Examples of drugs used to treat MS include: Beta interferons, for example: (Mavenclad) oral tablets is a drug used to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis; relapsing forms that include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults. Generally, cladribine is used in people with MS who have tried other that were not tolerated well or ineffective. People with clinically isolated syndrome not take cladribine. () is a agent that has been approved by the FDA to treat multiple sclerosis. Treatment with mitoxantrone requires monitoring of cardiac function, and there is a fixed limit to the dose that can be administered to patients. It also carries the long-term risk of . For these reasons, Novantrone is typically reserved for patients with more aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis. New research and treatment methods are currently being investigated and are expected to offer some hope to people with multiple sclerosis. In particular, new research studies have shown that skin patches containing myelin peptides may be a promising therapy. Consult your healthcare team for options. What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? In addition to drugs that target the disease process, other medications used to relieve certain symptoms of MS. Muscle relaxants, for example, () Selective reuptake inhibitor () The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, for example, (), (, Adcirca), and ) (, Staxyn ODT) What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? Most people with the form of MS progress to a stage where relapses become much less frequent, but they continue to accumulate disabling symptoms. This new phase of the disease is termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Symptoms of this type of MS are intermittent and worsen neurologic symptoms, which can last several days or weeks before returning to their original state of health. Some people, however, are left with residual deficits (residual disability) after some attacks. A few people have a form of MS. In this type, people have relapses superimposed on a pattern of continuous progression of disability. Rarely, people with multiple sclerosis have a pure progressive () forms of the disease. Their disability progresses in the absence of attacks over time. Most people with MS usually die from diseases such as or heart attacks, especially in those who are bedridden. Currently, there is no cure for multiple sclerosis. As of yet, no true way of preventing multiple sclerosis has been found. When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? The symptoms of multiple sclerosis are very variable and differ from patient to patient. They can also be confused with symptoms of many other conditions. You should talk with your physician if you or someone you know has any of the signs and symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis or if you have any concerning symptoms. Several of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be severe enough to send the patient to a hospital's emergency department. Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you have any of the following symptoms: Visual changes and painful eye movements. Optic neuritis, one of the most common early signs of multiple sclerosis, causes these symptoms. If you experience personality changes or sudden loss of strength in the arms and legs. These symptoms are common with multiple sclerosis, but they can also be signs of other serious diseases that require urgent treatment such as , infection, or chemical imbalances. Managing Symptoms of MS with Diet, Exercise, and Alternative Treatments Some people with MS explore alternative forms of therapy and treatments, including many who are already taking drugs for the disease. Some people with multiple sclerosis have benefited from: Restorative, maintenance, and preventive rehabilitation Talk to your healthcare team about alternative treatments for MS.

ef41a139-0b84-4e6f-a527-094aa5e947a9,", Vanessa D'Orio, Jessica Spat, Melissa Shuman, Frederick W. Foley Background Few studies have examined the prevalence of alcohol and drug use in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). The current study sought to examine the prevalence and associated demographic, disease-related, and psychological correlates of substance use in an East Coast United States outpatient MS sample. Methods 157 individuals with MS completed questionnaires prior to, during or after their visit with an MS neurologist. These questionnaires included: the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C), CAGE, CAGE - Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGE-AID), Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 item (PHQ-9), Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety (HADS-A). Results On the AUDIT-C, 40% of individuals with MS met or exceeded the cutoff for excessive alcohol use. They were more highly educated and younger than non-drinkers. Utilizing the CAGE, 6% of the sample met criteria for a lifetime history of excessive alcohol use and men endorsed higher rates of alcohol use than women. Only a small portion of the sample endorsed a history of drug use (CAGE-AID, 4%). Drug use was associated with greater disability and depression symptoms, but lower self-reported anxiety. Conclusions Current alcohol use was prevalent in this sample, and excessive use was associated with men, younger age, and more education. Reported drug use was minimal and associated with greater disability, more self-reported depression, but fewer anxiety symptoms.

Multiple sclerosis, often called MS, is a disease that affects the —the brain and spinal cord. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve cells have a protective covering called myelin. Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS gradually destroys myelin in patches throughout the brain and spinal cord, causing muscle weakness and other symptoms. These patches of damage are called lesions. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. Generally, MS follows one of four courses: , where symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressive. ""Progressive"" means it steadily gets worse. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where the symptoms are progressive at first and are relapsing later. The exact cause is unknown, but most experts believe that MS is an autoimmune disease. In this kind of disease, the body's defenses, called the , mistakenly attack normal tissues. In MS, the immune system attacks the central nervous system—the . Experts don't know why MS happens to some people but not others. There may be a link, because the disease seems to run in families. Where you grew up may also play a role. MS is more common in those who grew up in colder regions that are farther away from the equator. Symptoms depend on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are damaged and how bad the damage is. Early symptoms may include: You may feel weak and stiff, and your limbs may feel heavy. You may drag your leg when you walk. Your vision may be blurred or hazy. You may have eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. You may feel tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, or numbness. You may feel a band of tightness around your trunk or limbs. You may feel lightheaded or dizzy or feel like you're spinning. Diagnosing MS isn't always easy. The first symptoms may be vague. And many of the symptoms can be caused by problems other than MS. MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure that you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your central nervous system. The doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An is often used to confirm the diagnosis, because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with this test. During a relapse, to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to keep down the number of attacks and how severe they are and to slow the progression of the disease. (This is called disease-modifying therapy.) You may find it hard to decide when to start taking the drugs that slow the progression of MS. The drugs may not work for everyone, and they often have side effects. You and your doctor will decide together when you should start any of these drugs. There is no cure for MS. Treatment and self-care can help you maintain your quality of life. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help you manage some physical problems caused by MS. You can also help yourself at home by eating balanced meals, getting regular exercise and rest, and learning to use your energy wisely. Dealing with the physical and emotional demands of MS isn't easy. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to your doctor. You may be depressed, which can be treated. And finding a support group where you can talk to other people who have MS can be very helpful. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. Because a person's risk of MS is slightly higher in some families when a relative has MS, there may be a . For more information, see . Some research suggests that where you lived as a child and you have had could be triggers for MS later in life. But these links have not been proved. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) vary from person to person depending on which parts of the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system) are damaged. The and scarring caused by MS can affect any part of the central nervous system. Myelin is the insulating coating around a nerve. Symptoms may come and go or become more or less severe from day to day or, in rare cases, from hour to hour. Symptoms may become worse with increased body temperature or after a viral infection. , such as weakness, leg dragging, stiffness, a tendency to drop things, a feeling of heaviness, clumsiness, or a lack of coordination (). , such as blurred, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. Optic neuritis—sudden loss of vision that is often painful—is a fairly common first symptom. It occurs in up to 25 out of 100 people who have MS. , such as tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, a band of tightness around the trunk or legs, or electrical sensations moving down the back and legs. As MS progresses, symptoms may become more severe and may include: Worse muscle problems, and stiff, mechanical movements () or uncontrollable shaking (). These problems may make walking difficult. A wheelchair may be needed some or all of the time. Bladder symptoms, such as an inability to hold urine () or to completely empty the bladder, or a loss of bladder sensation. (impotence) and . . These are common in people who have had MS for some time. Feeling very tired (fatigue). This can be worse if symptoms such as pain, spasticity, bladder problems, anxiety, or depression make it hard to sleep. In general, multiple sclerosis follows one of four courses: , where symptoms may fade and then recur at random for many years. The disease doesn't advance during the remissions. Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course. In 8 to 9 out of 10 people with this course of MS, the relapsing-remitting phase lasts about 20 years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course. Later on, it becomes steadily progressive. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where steady deterioration of nerve function begins when symptoms first appear. Symptoms appear and disappear, but nerve damage continues. Few people have this course of MS. MS is different for every person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. The duration of the disease varies. Most people who get MS live with it for decades. MS usually progresses with a series of that occur over many years (relapsing-remitting MS). In many people the first MS attack involves just a single symptom. It may be weeks, months, or years before you have a relapse. As time goes by, symptoms may linger after each relapse so you lose the ability to fully recover from the relapse. New symptoms often develop as the disease damages other areas of the . Events that can mean you may have a more severe type of MS include: Frequent relapses during the first few years of the disease. Early, lasting motor problems that affect movement. Many lesions that show up on an early in the disease. Some people have a few mild attacks from which they recover entirely. This is called benign MS. Although rare, a small number of people die within several years of the onset of MS. This is called malignant or fulminant MS. Because MS may affect your ability to move and walk, it can place limits on your daily living, particularly as you age. If you or someone in your family has MS, talk to your doctor about . Knowing what to expect will help you plan for the future. Reduced ability to move and walk. This makes it necessary to use a wheelchair some or all of the time. Your risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) increases with: Geographic location, or where you lived during childhood (up to age 15). People who spend the first 15 years of their lives in colder climates that are farther away from the equator tend to be more likely to get MS than people who lived closer to the equator during those years. Family history of MS. About 15 out of 100 people who have MS have a relative with MS, most often a brother or sister. Certain genetic characteristics associated with the . These appear more frequently in people who have MS. This may mean that there are one or more that may increase the chance of getting MS. Race. People of Western European ancestry are more likely to get MS. Being female. MS is about 3 times as common in women as in men. Some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are similar to those of many other illnesses. See your doctor if over a period of time you have more than one symptom, such as: Blurry, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain, loss of vision, or double vision. A feeling of heaviness or weakness, involuntary leg dragging, stiffness, walking problems, and clumsiness. Tingling or a pins-and-needles sensation; numbness; tightness in a band around the trunk, arms, or legs; or electric shock sensations moving down the back, arms, or legs. Inability to hold urine or to completely empty the bladder. Problems with memory, attention span, finding the right words for what you mean, and daily problem-solving. If you have been diagnosed with MS, see your doctor if: You begin having a symptom that you have not had before or you notice a significant change in symptoms that are already present. Milder MS-type symptoms can be caused by many other conditions or may occur now and then in healthy people. For example, lots of people have minor numbness in their fingers or a mild dizzy spell once in a while. Stiffness and muscle weakness can result from being more active than usual. A wait-and-see approach () is appropriate for these types of everyday aches and pains, so long as they do not continue. If your symptoms occur more often or don't go away, talk to your doctor. Talk to your doctor about what to expect from the disease and from treatment. MS is an unpredictable disease, but you probably can get some idea of what is ""normal"" and what symptoms or problems are reasons for concern. Some people who have MS want active, regular support from their doctors. Others want to manage their condition on their own as much as possible. Wherever you are in this range, find out which signs or symptoms mean that you need to see your doctor. And seek help when you need it. Health professionals who may be involved in evaluating symptoms of MS and treating the condition include: or . Consult your doctor when symptoms first start. He or she will refer you to a neurologist if needed. If you have MS, your family doctor or internist can treat your general health problems even if you see a neurologist for MS treatment. . A neurologist can decide whether your symptoms are caused by MS. He or she can also help you decide what may be the best treatment for your condition. Many university medical centers and large hospitals have MS clinics or centers staffed by neurologists and other health professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating MS. They may be able to provide the most thorough evaluation. If you have been diagnosed with MS, at some point you may need to seek the help of: A , to assist with exercise to maintain body strength and flexibility and deal with movement problems. An , to identify ways of accomplishing daily activities if MS has caused any physical limitations. A , to improve speech, chewing, and breathing if MS has affected the muscles of the face and throat. A , to help with managing pain, maintaining strength, and adapting to physical disability. A or , to evaluate and treat , or other mood disorders, and problems with memory and concentration if these develop. A , to help with any significant chronic pain that MS may cause. A pain specialist, often as part of a pain clinic, can help find ways of reducing pain when possible and dealing with pain that doesn't go away. A , to do surgery for severe or . Diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) isn't always easy and in some cases may take time. Your medical history and can identify possible nervous system problems and are often enough to strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS. Tests may help confirm or rule out the diagnosis when your history and exam do not provide clear evidence of the disease. MRI and neurological exam may help doctors predict which people will develop MS after a first attack of symptoms. of the brain and spinal cord. This test is done to . (sometimes called a spinal tap). This test may be done to evaluate . Most people with MS have abnormal results on this test. . This test can often reveal abnormalities in the and in the that other tests may not detect. MS is diagnosed when it is clear from neurological tests and a neurological exam that lesions (damaged areas) are present in more than one area of the (usually the brain, spinal cord, or the nerves to the eyes). Tests will also clearly show that damage has occurred at more than one point in time. Some people have had only one episode of a neurological symptom such as optic neuritis, but MRI tests suggest they may have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. Urinary tract tests may be needed to help diagnose a problem with bladder control in a person who has MS. may be needed to identify thinking or emotional problems, which may be present without the person being aware of them. Typically, these tests are in a question-and-answer format. A blood test for JC virus antibodies may be done. This test can help you and your doctor understand your risk for getting a rare but serious brain infection called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Treatment can make living with multiple sclerosis (MS) easier. Your type of treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and whether your disease is active or in remission. You may get medicines, physical therapy, and other treatment at home. Medicines are used to treat relapses, control the course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs), or treat symptoms. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and who have active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicines. This group also recommends treatment with medicine after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS. If you decide not to try medicines at this time, meet with your doctor regularly to check whether the disease is progressing. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You and your doctor will set up a schedule of periodic appointments to monitor and treat your symptoms and follow the progress of your MS. Monitoring your condition helps your doctor find out if you may need to try a different treatment. , occupational therapy, and nonmedical treatment done at home may also help you manage symptoms and adjust to living and working situations. To learn more, see . In rare cases, MS is life-threatening. If your condition gets considerably worse, you may want to make a living will, which allows your wishes to be carried out if you are not able to make decisions for yourself. For more information, see the topic . In general, there is no way to prevent multiple sclerosis (MS) or its attacks. For people with , , and , treatment with medicine may reduce the frequency of relapses and delay disability. If you have multiple sclerosis (MS), it is important to find ways of coping with the practical and emotional demands of the disease. These are different for everyone, so home treatment varies from person to person. Home treatment may involve making it easier to get around your home, dealing with , handling specific symptoms, and getting support from your family and friends. to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don't use throw rugs. And try adjusting your daily schedule so that your routine is less stressful or tiring. , either on your own or with the help of a physical therapist. . At some time, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home somewhat cool, and avoid hot swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. Change how and what you eat if you are having problems swallowing. Thicker drinks make swallowing easier. Try milk shakes or juices in gelatin form. Avoid foods such as crackers or cakes that crumble easily. These can cause choking. Soft foods need less chewing. Use a blender to prepare food for easiest chewing. Eat frequent, small meals to avoid fatigue from eating heavy meals. Ask your doctor about and occupational therapy to help you manage at work and home. Make all efforts to preserve your health. Proper diet, rest, wise use of energy, and practical and emotional support from your family, friends, and doctor can all be very helpful. For more advice about coping with MS at home, contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. Medicines for multiple sclerosis (MS) may be used: During a , to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to alter the natural course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs). These medicines can shorten a sudden relapse and help you feel better sooner. They have been shown to affect the long-term course of the disease or to prevent disability. Strong evidence suggests that MS is caused by the causing and attacking nerve cells and myelin, which is the protective coating surrounding the nerve fibers. Medicines that change the way the immune system works can reduce the number and severity of attacks that damage the nerves and myelin. For people who have , disease-modifying therapy can reduce the number and severity of relapses. It may also delay disability in some people. Some of these medicines may also delay disease progression and reduce relapses in some people who have or . The most commonly used disease-modifying therapies are: Interferon beta (such as Betaseron), for clinically isolated syndrome (first MS attack), relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive MS. Glatiramer (Copaxone), for clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. Other disease-modifying medicines may also be used for MS. Your doctor will prescribe a medicine depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms, and how your body responds. They include: Some people have only one episode of a neurological symptom such as . Yet or other tests suggest that these people have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have had a clinically isolated syndrome. These medicines, when taken early or even before you have been diagnosed with MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend your time without disease. Treating specific symptoms can be effective, even if it doesn't stop the progression of the disease. Symptoms that can often be controlled or relieved with medicine include: Medicines can also help with sexual problems, emotional problems, and walking problems. Sildenafil (Viagra) can help with sexual problems in both men and women. Clomipramine may also be given to improve . Dextromethorphan and quinidine (Nuedexta) is a medicine that can be used for uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing at strange or inappropriate times. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medicine that can be used to help with walking problems. Medicine may be used only some of the time or regularly, depending on how severe or constant a certain symptom is. Changes in diet, schedule, exercise, and other habits can also help manage some of these symptoms. See . Cannabinoids are substances found in marijuana. Similar drugs can be created in a lab. Some forms of natural and man-made cannabinoids may help with symptoms such as pain and spasticity. They are not available in all areas. Talk to your doctor if you are considering cannabinoids. A variety of other medicines and biological chemicals have been tried or are being studied as therapy for MS. None of them have been clearly proved as beneficial, and none have been approved for treatment of MS. Several medicines are being tested in clinical trials. People with MS who have not responded to standard therapy sometimes choose to take part in these trials. To learn more about clinical trials, talk to your doctor or contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Despite the recommendation, some people find it hard to decide whether to begin disease-modifying therapy, especially when their symptoms have been fairly mild. Some may not want to bear the risks and side effects of medicine when they are not sure they need it. Some may want to see whether their disease gets worse before they start therapy. A small percentage of people diagnosed with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and may never develop any disability, but the disease is unpredictable. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The need and desire for medicine vary. If your symptoms are mild, you may choose to manage them without any medicine. If you have specific symptoms that are causing problems, certain medicines may help you keep them under control. Or you may want to use medicine only during a relapse. The possible side effects of using steroids or other medicines to treat symptoms or control a relapse. Some people have only minor side effects. But others may have side effects that concern them more than their MS symptoms. The costs of treating symptoms and controlling relapses. In some cases, using medicine to control symptoms and relapses may reduce the need for hospital stays. Other personal issues that you face at work or at home. Also keep in mind that it can be hard to tell if medicine is helping. Multiple sclerosis is a disease with spontaneous remissions. This means that your condition can improve on its own, without any treatment. Just because your symptoms improve after treatment doesn't mean that a treatment is working. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have severe (shakiness) affecting movement may be helped by surgery. People with severe (muscle stiffness) may be helped by insertion of a spinal pump to deliver medicines when oral medicines fail. for tremor. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. Severe and disabling tremor that occurs with the slightest movement of the limbs may be helped by an implanted device that stimulates an area of the brain. A does the surgery to implant the device. Implantation of a drug catheter or pump, for spasticity. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. People who have severe pain or spasticity may benefit from having a catheter or pump placed in the lower spinal area to deliver a constant flow of medicine, such as baclofen. The unpredictability and variety of symptoms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) make it a disease that people have tried to treat in many different ways. Many have been proposed as treatments for MS. None of these treatments have been shown to modify the course of the disease. Some of those most commonly used are: Diets and vitamin, mineral, herbal, or dietary supplements. (often used by ). Although clinical research has not shown all of these complementary therapies to be effective, a person with MS may benefit from safe nontraditional therapies along with conventional medical treatment. Some complementary therapies may help relieve stress, depression, fatigue, and muscle tension. And some may improve your overall well-being and quality of life. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying any of these complementary therapies or to MS treatment. Clinical research also has been unable to show that treatments such as ""liberation"" angioplasty for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), bee venom therapy, Prokarin (a caffeine and histamine combination), removal of mercury fillings (dental amalgams), and have any benefits for people who have MS. Some of these therapies may be harmful as well as expensive and are not recommended by most experts. Experimental treatments for MS involve reducing the activity of the . This may be done with medicines and biological chemicals or through methods such as total lymphoid irradiation, in which the entire lymph node system is exposed to radiation. While these methods have been used with success in the treatment of certain other medical conditions, they have failed to produce significant benefits when tested in controlled clinical trials. They remain experimental treatments for MS. , which uses immature cells from the bone marrow, has been studied. Early results suggest that stem cell transplant may delay disability, especially in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Stem cell transplant may be an option for people who have very aggressive or malignant forms of MS. It remains unproved and isn't recommended for treating relapsing-remitting MS. There is no cure for MS. So far, the only treatments proved to affect the course of the disease are approved disease-modifying therapies. Other types of treatment should replace these medicines if you are a candidate for treatment with them. Some people who have MS report that complementary therapies have worked for them. This may be in part because of the . Some complementary therapies don't treat the disease itself, but they may affect a person's sense of well-being and help the person feel better and healthier. If you are thinking about trying a complementary treatment, get the facts first. Discuss these questions with your doctor: Talk with your doctor about the safety and potential side effects of the treatment. This is especially important if you are on drug therapy for MS. Some complementary treatments in combination with drug therapy can be quite dangerous. A treatment that could be harmful to you and may or may not improve your symptoms isn't worth the risk. Because MS symptoms can come and go, you may find it hard to judge whether a particular treatment is really working. Keep in mind that if you get better after using a certain treatment, the treatment isn't always the reason for the improvement. MS may often improve on its own (spontaneous remission). An expensive, unproven treatment that may or may not help you may not be worth its cost. Beware of therapy providers or products that require a large financial investment at the beginning of a series of treatments. Even if they aren't effective in treating MS, some complementary practices (such as acupuncture, massage, or yoga) may be safe. And they may lead to healthy habits that improve your overall well-being. These might be worth trying. With a hard-to-treat disease like MS, it can be tempting to jump at the promise of an effective treatment. Be cautious about trying unproven treatments.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) literally means “many scars,” which refers to the lesions that accumulate in the brain and spinal cord throughout the course of the disease. These scars, or lesions, consist mostly of dead nerve cells, whose axons have been denuded of the myelin sheaths that normally protect them and permit the conduction of nerve impulses. MS is a chronic, degenerative disease that usually begins in young adulthood and most visibly destroys muscular control, although many other brain functions are affected. Most people will live with MS for decades after their diagnosis. MS reduces life expectancy after onset (as measured by current diagnostic criteria) by only about 10-15 years, and about half of the patients survive 30 years or more from onset. THE CLINICAL PICTURE: SYMPTOMS, DISEASE COURSE, VARIATION, AND DIAGNOSIS MS, as defined by ongoing central nervous system (CNS) lesion formation and increasing cumulative damage, is now recognized as a disease that is active in most patients most of the time. Disease activity has reversible and irreversible sequelae; irreversible sequelae ultimately lead to progressive impairment and disability in most patients. MS takes a variety of forms, distinguished by the clinical pattern of disease activity (, ). Accumulated deficit can produce sustained worsening in both relapsing and progressive MS.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Varieties of MS Autopsy studies indicate there are individuals without any known clinical history who have neuropathologic changes typical of MS. It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of subclinical disease, but one recent review suggested asymptomatic MS might account for up to 25% of all cases. This is the major MS subtype. Approximately 85% of patients with a diagnosis of MS start out with relapsing MS. Overall, this subtype accounts for 55% of MS. Relapsing MS patients show a high rate of inflammatory lesion activity (gadolinium-enhancing lesions). This category represents a subset of relapsing patients who have few attacks and make an excellent recovery. They show minimal impairment and disability, even after 20-30 years. The proportion of MS patients with benign disease is controversial. Reasonable studies suggest 10-20% of people with MS fit into this category. This subtype accounts for 10% of MS. Patients show gradual worsening from onset, without disease attacks. These patients tend to be older and often present with a spinal cord dysfunction without obvious brain involvement. This subtype is the least likely to show inflammatory lesion activity on MRI (gadolinium-enhancing). Unlike the other subtypes of MS, men are as likely as women to develop primary progressive MS. This subtype accounts for 5% of MS. Patients show slow worsening from onset, with superimposed attacks. Recent studies suggest these patients are similar to primary progressive patients. This is the major progressive subtype and accounts for approximately 30% of MS. Relapsing MS patients usually transition to secondary progressive disease. They show gradual worsening, with or without superimposed relapses. Natural history studies of untreated relapsing MS indicate 50% of patients will be secondary progressive at 10 years and almost 90% by 25 years. This form of MS shows a lower rate of inflammatory lesion activity than relapsing MS, yet the total burden of disease continues to increase. This most likely reflects ongoing axonal loss. Also referred to as Marburg variant MS, this is the most severe form of MS. Significant disability develops much more rapidly than usual, over weeks to months. Pathologic changes are widespread and destructive. These cases are rare and generally occur in young people. This refers to patients who present with an isolated CNS syndrome (optic neuritis, incomplete transverse myelitis, brainstem or cerebellar lesion), which is often the first MS attack. Clinical, MRI, and CSF studies indicate that such patients with normal brain MRI and CSF have a low risk of developing MS. In contrast, those with abnormal MRI have a high risk of developing MS. NOTE: CSF = cerebrosinal fluid; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.

In progressive MS, the dominant pattern is a gradual accumulation of neurologic deficits, with slow clinical worsening. Disease activity and progression have both clinical and subclinical components. Clinical disease activity and progression are judged by observation and neurologic examination. Subclinical components refer to pathological changes that are not observable in a clinical examination but are observed using a variety of laboratory tests, predominantly neuroimaging parameters. Relapses are variously referred to as acute attacks, exacerbations, or disease flare-ups. They involve the acute, or sudden onset, of focal neurologi- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Examples of typical MS relapses include blurring of vision in one eye (optic neuritis), persistent numbness or tingling of a body part (sensory system relapse), weakness of a body part (motor system relapse), or loss of coordination (cerebellar system relapse). Early in the MS disease process, relapses are likely to involve sensory, motor, cerebellar, or visual system abnormalities ( , ). Later in the disease process, relapses are likely to involve bladder, bowel, cognitive, and sexual function abnormalities. Acute disease attacks are a characteristic feature of the relapsing-remitting MS subtype. Relapses also occur in patients with progressive relapsing disease and in a number of patients with secondary progressive disease. The only clinical disease subtype in which relapses never occur is primary progressive MS. Areas of the CNS often affected by MS. Reprinted with permission from University of Delaware. Sensory problems (numbness or tingling of a body part) ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapses generally consist of three phases. There is a period of worsening, with onset of new deficits or increasing severity of old deficits. This is followed by a period of stability, with no change in deficits. The final phase is the period of recovery, with variable degrees of improvement in deficits. Most patients recover within six weeks, although for some, improvements can continue over months. Recovery can be complete return to baseline status, partial return, or no improvement. However, some degree of improvement is typical, particularly early in the disease. Relapsing patients then remain clinically stable until the next disease attack. To be considered a relapse, deficits must persist for a minimum of 24 hours. This avoids confusion with deficits lasting only minutes to hours, which are believed to be a consequence of impaired nerve conduction through old lesion areas rather than the formation of a new lesion. Alternatively, new abnormalities that last seconds to minutes, such as Lhermitte's sign (a tingling sensation radiating down the arms, neck, or back on neck flexion), or paroxysmal attacks (stereotypic neurologic deficits occurring multiple times a day that last less than a minute) are also considered relapses if they occur repeatedly over several weeks. Sequential relapses are considered distinct only when they occur at least 30 days apart with a month of clinical stability in between. Although clinical relapses always produce changes in a patient's condition, they are not always associated with changes on neurologic examination. Maximal deficit in an MS relapse typically develops over several days but in some cases can develop much faster, over hours or even minutes, or much more slowly, over a period as long as several weeks. Physiologic factors such as temperature, pH, or electrolyte balance can temporarily disrupt nerve conduction and produce neurologic abnormality. A relapse must be distinguished from a which is a neurologic deterioration associated with a physiologic change such as infection or fever. This condition can last for days, mimicking a true relapse. Pseudoexacerbation deficits disappear once the precipitating factor has been corrected. They reflect a temporary disruption in nerve conduction, rather than the formation of a new lesion. Approximately 85 percent of MS patients begin with relapsing-remitting disease. MS relapses can involve a single neural system, as in optic neuritis, or several anatomically distinct systems at the same time, for example, combined motor and sensory problems. Attacks involving single neural systems are somewhat more common in the first MS relapse. Most patients experience their second attack within two to three years of the first, but 5 percent of patients remain free of relapses for 15 years or more. In most cases, there is substantial recovery from the first relapse; only 4 percent of patients show no improvement. The average relapse rate is one to two attacks a year, but this rate normally declines over time. The longer a person has MS, the less likely it is that relapses will be followed by complete recovery and the more likely it is that relapses will be associated with residual deficits and increasing disability.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapse features have prognostic significance (). In the first few years after disease onset, the number and type of relapses, as well as the degree of recovery, help predict future disease course. Relapses that involve visual, sensory, or brainstem systems have a better prognosis than those that involve cerebellar, motor, or sphincter systems. In the first two years of disease, a low relapse rate with excellent recovery indicates a better prognosis than a high relapse rate with poor recovery. Relapses restricted to single neural systems are prognostically better than those involving multiple systems. The relapse rate also has prognostic significance in the later stages of MS. With a disease duration of five or more years, an increasing relapse rate, polyregional relapses that involved multiple systems, and incomplete recovery from relapses indicate a worse prognosis. The relapsing form of MS is characterized by acute disease exacerbations. In contrast, progressive MS is characterized by slow deterioration and increasing neurological deficits. There are three forms of progressive MS. Approximately 15 percent of MS patients show slow deterioration from onset. In the second form, 10 percent have either primary progressive MS and never experience acute disease attacks or progressive relapsing MS (5 percent), and have occasional subsequent attacks. The third form, secondary progressive MS, is the major progressive subtype. These are relapsing patients who begin to slowly worsen 5 to 15 years after the first relapse. Once relapsing patients enter a progressive phase, they either stop having relapses or continue to experience exacerbations superimposed on slow worsening. Documentation of a progressive course requires at least six months of observation. Observation over a year or two is often necessary to be confident of progression, since deficits can accumulate at a very gradual rate. The major defining feature of progressive MS is slow deterioration that occurs independently of acute disease relapses and does not reflect residual deficits from acute disease attacks. An analysis of the disease course among 1,844 patients indicated that the presence or absence of relapses during the progressive phase does not significantly affect the progression of irreversible disability (4 percent of ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. patients in this study had been treated for up to one year with beta-interferon, but this did not affect the study results). Progressive MS patients can be clinically stable for up to several years at a time and can even show slight improvement for a period of time. Ultimately, however, all progressive MS patients develop disability with limited ability to walk. Progressive MS is a more severe form than benign or relapsing-remitting MS and has a worse prognosis. Clinical parameters such as relapses and progression underestimate the actual damage to tissue that occurs in MS. When macroscopically normal-appearing brain tissue is looked at under the microscope, one can detect inflammation, gliosis (scarring), and myelin damage. Chemical studies of normal-appearing brain tissue often reveal changes in organelles such as lysosomes, in enzymes, and in myelin constituents. In addition, a number of the new research neuro-imaging techniques can detect changes in brain and spinal cord areas that appear free of lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some of these abnormalities are detectable several months to years before they can be seen with conventional MRI. Changes in normal-appearing brain tissue are generally pronounced in MS patients with severe impairment. As a group, secondary progressive MS patients show more abnormalities in normal white matter and brain tissue than relapsing patients. (White matter corresponds to brain regions where axons are ensheathed in myelin; gray matter corresponds to brain regions that are rich in cell bodies.) Primary progressive patients often show subtle but diffuse changes in normal-appearing brain areas. Even conventional MRI indicates that most new lesion formation is clinically silent, meaning that clinical exam does not reveal any corresponding symptoms. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of new brain lesions do not produce identifiable relapses. They might, however, be associated with subtle cognitive changes or other neuropsychological changes that are not detected in clinical examination. The total lesion burden increases in MS patients, on average, 5 to 10 percent per year, reflecting in large part the development of clinically silent lesions. (This does not apply to patients on the disease-modifying therapies discussed later in this section.) Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected even in patients with minimal symptoms. Atrophy can progress without obvious lesion formation, most likely reflecting loss of axons. MS patients show an accelerated rate of age-related brain and spinal cord atrophy that is three- to tenfold higher than the rate in control populations. Spinal cord lesions are generally similar to those in the brain except for the absence of “black holes” (see discussion in of T1-weighted lesions). Spinal MS lesions rarely cover more than half of the cross-sectional area of the cord or exceed two vertebral segments in length. They are found more often in the cervical spinal cord (neck region) than thoracic region (midback) and are most ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

MRI involves application of a magnetic field to the body that causes nuclei with odd numbers of protons, such as hydrogen nuclei, to behave like tiny magnets. These protons align themselves either parallel or antiparallel to the applied external magnetic field. The net magnetization induces an electric current that forms the basic MR signal. An MR image is formed by determining the spatial distribution of the signal and reconstructing the data into detailed images. The signals are picked up by a very sensitive antenna and forwarded to a computer for processing. Two time constants, T1 and T2 relaxation times, are important in determining the appearance of MR images. T1, or the longitudinal relaxation time, is the time constant when 63 percent of the original longitudinal magnetization is regained as the nuclei return to alignment with the external magnetic field. T2 or the transverse relaxation time, is the time constant when the transverse magnetization decreases to 37 percent of its original value as the nuclei lose alignment with each other following the initial application of an external magnetic field (a radio-frequency pulse). By altering the imaging parameters and pulse sequences used, differences between tissues with intrinsically different proton densities and T1 and T2 relaxation times can be highlighted or obscured. Image contrast can be either T1 weighted or T2 weighted in order to emphasize the differences between normal and pathological tissues. For example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images. White matter is bright on T1-weighted images, whereas a matter is dark but not as dark as CSF. common in the midcervical region. Disease activity is much less frequent in the spine than in the brain. In summary, the clinical manifestations of MS possibly represent only the “tip of the iceberg,” with most of the CNS damage occurring much earlier and being detectable only when the accumulated damage overwhelms the ability of the CNS to compensate. The mechanisms through which CNS tissue is damaged or destroyed are discussed in greater detail later in the chapter. At the present time, neuroimaging provides the best assessment of disease activity in MS (, ). A number of neuroimaging techniques can measure distinct pathologic changes and thereby provide markers for different aspects of the MS disease ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Magnetic resonance imaging is a technique that creates cross-sectional images of the brain using a magnetic field and radio waves (). It is a versatile, powerful, and sensitive tool for measuring abnormalities in the brain. This is especially valuable with MS, because so much of the pathological activity of the disease is neurologically asymptomatic. Indeed, until neuroimaging results proved otherwise, the disease appeared to be quiescent during remissions. Neuroimaging has revealed a previously unsuspected level of activity and pathology throughout the course of disease. Contrast agents are used in MRI in cases where contrast between two tissues is poor. The contrasting agent, gadolinium, is normally excluded from the brain by the blood-brain barrier.

Gadolinium-enhancing activity on MRI correlates with clinical relapses and predicts increased risk or further disease activity. However, since most new brain MRI lesions are clinically silent, gadolinium-enhanced lesions are seen more often than clinical relapses. In T2-weighted images, MS lesions appear as very bright white areas against a gray or more neutral background and are the most readily visualized MS lesions by MRI. They reflect lesions with different pathology and of various ages, and reversible as well as irreversible abnormalities. T2-weighted hyperintense lesions can be used to measure the total lesion volume (burden-of-disease). The variable pathology, which is not distinguished in T2 burden-of-disease measures, is probably a determinant of associated disability. Only a modest relationship has been observed between T2 burden of disease and clinical disability in relapsing and secondary progressive MS. However, in patients with clinically isolated syndromes who are in the early stages of MS, T2 burden-of-disease has been correlated with the development of MS, as well as the clinical subtype of MS and disability 10 years later. The magnitude of T2 burden-of-disease changes very early in the disease process and may be valuable for predicting subsequent course. Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected in MS patients, including relapsing patients with minimal neurologic deficits. Both axon and myelin loss contribute to tissue atrophy. Recent studies suggest that CNS atrophy may be the best neuroimaging correlate for clinical disability (reviewed in 1999 by Trapp et al.). A number of different methodologies are used to measure atrophy. Current advances involve measurement of the whole brain and improved automation, but the optimal technique has not been decided. Axonal injury can be measured on proton MR spectroscopy by estimating -acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels in brain tissue. NAA is a molecule that is virtually confined to axons and neurons. Levels of NAA can fluctuate, suggesting that they can be used to measure reversible as well as irreversible damage. Persistent reduction of NAA on MR Spectroscopy correlates with axon loss, damage, or dysfunction. Reduced NAA is found not only within MS lesions but also in the normal-appearing white matter of relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients. The reduction in NAA is more severe in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS. In addition, NAA decrease in cerebellar white matter has been correlated with clinical ataxia. NAA can be measured in a discrete region of interest within the brain. Recently, whole-brain NAA has been measured in MS. This appears to be a more meaningful neuroimaging marker to evaluate axon damage. MR spectroscopy can also be used to measure lipid changes within both lesions and normal- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appearing brain tissue, but these studies are very preliminary and NAA measurements are the major focus of current MR spectroscopy studies in MS. Also referred to as black holes, T1-weighted hypointense lesions have lower signal intensity than the surrounding white matter. T1 hypointense lesions are most common in the supratentorial region (cerebral hemispheres). They are much less common in the infratentorial (brainstem and cerebellum) region and are not reported in the spinal cord. Compared to T2-weighted lesions, they represent more severe tissue pathology, with axon loss, demyelination, and extracellular edema. In postmortem studies of progressive MS, T1-weighted hypointense lesions correlate strongly with axon density measurements. T1-weighted hypointense lesions show a stronger correlation with disability than T2-weighted hyperintense lesions. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) can be used to study global brain function or to measure changes within a local region of interest. Populations of bound and soluble protons produce different signals in response to the external magnetic field. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) is the ratio of the different signals produced by these two populations. It is reduced in MS and is believed to reflect both demyelination and axon loss, thereby producing an index of tissue destruction. MTR measurements are correlated with MS disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS; see ), as well as cognitive measures. MTI shows great promise as a disease marker. Lower MTR values occur with disease worsening in relapsing, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients and even in patients with clinically isolated MS syndromes. In primary progressive patients who have a relatively small T2 burden of disease, MTR is significantly reduced, suggesting that axon damage is significantly greater in this clinical subtype. Differences in MTRs are associated with different lesion pathology. Lesions that are more destructive (as indicated by T1 hypointensity) have reduced MTR values. Lesions that remain hypointense show a persistent reduction in MTR, whereas lesions that become isointense recover in MTR. New lesions in secondary progressive patients have a lower MTR than those in relapsing patients. The decline in MTR over three years is significantly greater in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS, supporting a relationship between MTR changes and disease progression. MTR measures allow more significant lesions to be detected and may provide a better potential correlate with clinical disability. Reduction in MTR can precede the development of new lesions on conventional MRI. Diffusion-weighted MRI is sensitive to the diffusion, or random motion, of water molecules in tissue. It can detect subtle pathological changes that are not seen on conventional MRI. This technique ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. might allow detection of pathological change in white matter tracts, including demyelination and loss of axons, by quantifying anisotropy through a measure of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI can identify significantly altered diffusion properties in normal-appearing white matter. Lesions with the highest diffusion are the more destructive black holes, while the greatest change in anisotropy is seen in acute inflammatory lesions. Coincident with new lesion formation, diffusion-weighted imaging has shown changes in contralateral normal-appearing white matter. High-field-strength magnets, which are 4 tesla (T) or higher, increase the signal-to-noise ratio (conventional imaging machines are 1.5 T). They allow enhanced detection of small (less than 5 mm) MS lesions, particularly those aligned along blood vessels. Both MR spectroscopy and MTI can be conducted on high-field machines with enhanced sensitivity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is a technique for determining which parts of the brain are activated by different types of sensation such as sight or sound, by different types of tasks such as moving one's fingers or legs, or by different mental tasks such as adding sums, reading, or memorizing. This “brain mapping” is achieved by using an MRI scanner to measure changes in blood flow to different areas of the brain. When a particular brain region is activated, blood flow into the region increases. The incoming arterial blood is rich in oxygenated hemoglobin, and there is a corresponding decrease in local deoxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in the MRI signal are derived from regional changes in the concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin, which is a paramagnetic molecule (reviewed in Hirsch et al.). The fMRI signal is, thus, determined by the balance between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. FMRI can provide second-by-second images of changes in response to different stimuli and during performance of mental tasks. It provides a unique tool for assessment of neural circuits involved in loss and recovery of function, as well as for measuring the circuits underlying symptoms that are as difficult to study as cognitive changes, fatigue, pain, and sensory disturbances. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid that circulates around and within the brain and spinal cord. CSF provides a vehicle for removing waste products of cellular metabolism from the nervous system and is believed to be nutritive for both neurons and glial cells and to function as a transport system for biologically active substances such as releasing factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolites. Sampling this fluid thus provides an index to substances active in the CNS and possibly those involved in MS pathology. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. A number of potential CSF disease markers have been reported in MS, including markers that are proposed as distinguishing between different types of MS (). For the most part, these are markers of tissue damage or immune disturbance. None are currently used in routine clinical practice, since they have not proved useful enough to justify serial lumbar punctures. There has been particular interest in the specificity of oligoclonal bands in MS. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular anti-bodies that can be visualized when CSF proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis where they appear as separate bands of protein on a gel matrix. Each of the bands contains a single type of antibody produced by a single clone of B cells. Oligoclonal bands are for the CSF of MS patients, but they are not to MS patients. For example, they are also found in the CSF of patients with other inflammatory status, such as viral brain infections. In MS, however, the particular antigens that elicit each antibody band are unknown. Investigators have recently used molecular approaches such as phage display libraries to probe MS oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands for sequence information related to their antigenic target. These are powerful methods that should allow for the identification of antigenic targets for the oligoclonal IgG. A main question, however, is whether the oligoclonal IgG bands represent an immune response directed against the etiologic agent of MS or merely constitute a by-product of immune system activity. In other words, upregulation of the antibody response and the heterogeneous distribution of antibodies into oligoclonal IgG bands could be a result of B-cell hyperactivity rather than an immune response to a specific etiologic pathogen. A variety of blood, urine, and mucosal fluid disease markers have been studied in MS, but none of them have provided a reliable disease marker. Again they are either markers of tissue damage (such as S-100) or immune activation (such as neopterin). Blood markers have included matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, circulating adhesion molecules, levels of various cytokines and their receptors, different subpopulations of cells, a variety of antibodies including antiviral and autoreactive antibodies, S-100 levels, and neopterin levels. Urine disease markers have included myelin basic protein-like material, free light chains, neopterin, gliotoxin, and neuron-specific enolase. Mucosal fluid cells and immunoglobulins have also been studied. The diagnosis of MS is based on both clinical parameters, such as medical history and neurological examination, and paraclinical parameters such as MRI, CSF oligoclonal banding, and evoked potentials. There is no MS-specific diag- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nostic test, and the intermittent nature of the disease and high variability in presenting symptoms make diagnosis difficult (listed in ). The presentation of MS can be monosymptomatic or have multifocal signs and symptoms, and many neurodegenerative disorders are similar to MS in their presentation. The general diagnostic criteria, established in 1965 by a committee sponsored by the National MS Society (the MS Society), state that a diagnosis of “clinically definite” MS (CDMS) requires clinical evidence of two or more white matter lesions on at least two occasions. In 1983, these criteria were expanded by Poser et al. to include the use of paraclinical parameters, and they have since become the standard MS diagnostic criteria (). In July 2000, an international committee met to further revise these criteria, in particular to make MRI information a more integral component and to incorporate diagnostic criteria for primary progressive MS. The results of that meeting, however, were not available at the time of this writing. The failure of the Poser criteria to incorporate primary progressive MS has recently been addressed by revised criteria that define definite, probable, and possible levels of diagnostic certainty. These criteria are based on clinical findings, CSF abnormalities, brain and spinal cord MRI abnormalities, and evoked potentials. Using these criteria, at least one year of clinical progression must be documented before a diagnosis of primary progressive MS can be made. MRI reveals neuropathological damage in 70 to 95 percent of people with MS and, because of its sensitivity, is the most helpful paraclinical diagnostic test. However, the use of MRI in MS diagnosis has led to concern that its high sensitivity combined with limited MS specificity leads to misdiagnosis, since other conditions including myelopathy and disseminated encephalomyelitis can cause MRI lesions similar to MS lesions. Thus, it is important that imaging be used in combination with clinical data for the diagnosis of MS. Recently, several sets of criteria for the definition of “MRI-definite” MS have been suggested (). Patients with clinically isolated syndromes are particularly difficult to diagnose, and Barkhof et al. and Fazekas have identified criteria that are relevant to such cases. Although assessment of spinal cord damage using MRI remains behind the development of brain methodology, it can be useful in diagnosing patients suspected of MS, particularly in cases with equivocal or negative brain MRI results. Spinal cord imaging increases the diagnostic sensitivity of MRI and might also enable earlier diagnosis. When demyelination or sclerosis (scarring) occurs, the conduction of nerve impulses along axons is slowed or interrupted. Impaired conductance is reflected in an increased latency of evoked potentials or an increase in the amount of time that elapses between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the resulting ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Evoked potentials are measured by placing small electrodes on the head in the region corresponding to the stimuli presented ( ). Abnormal evoked responses to different types of stimuli provide clues to the location of plaques or lesions and are useful in detecting “clinically silent” lesions that do not produce easily observable symptoms. However, abnormal evoked responses are not unique to MS. For example, although abnormal visual IgG antibodies are composed of light and heavy polypeptide chains. Free light chains are found in patients with chronic infections or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, but also in healthy individuals particularly following strenuous exercise. Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. They are involved in various aspects of disease processes, particularly inflammatory responses. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular antibodies. They are of the CSF of MS patients, but not to it. Antiviral antibodies are produced by B cells in direct response to an antigen's presence, and certain antiviral antibodies are increased in the CSF of some patients with MS. Immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells and are integral in adaptive immune responses. Polyclonal increases of IgG occur in chronic infection and inflammation. White blood cells responsible for cell-mediated immune responses to antigens, including viral infections.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. evoked potentials are common in MS, they also occur in compressive lesions of the visual pathway and spinocerebellar degeneration. Evoked potentials can aid in the localization of lesions, confirm clinically ambiguous lesions, and confirm the organic basis of symptoms. In addition, changes in evoked potentials can be used to measure disease progression and the effectiveness of therapeutic treatment, including treatments designed to improve conduction. Continued S-100 protein is an astroglial-specific protein that binds calcium. When a brain lesion occurs, S-100 is released into both the CSF and the blood. As a marker of brain damage, NSE reflects the severity of disease in patients with intracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, head injury, and certain tumors. A major constituent of glial filaments in differentiated CNS astrocytes, GFAP has been used for the diagnosis of astrocytic tumors, the study of astrocytic gliosis, and CNS regeneration and transplantation. Neurofilaments are important for axonal structure, transport, and regeneration. Accumulation of neurofilaments in motor neurons can trigger a neurodegenerative process and may be a key intermediate in the pathway of pathogenesis leading to neuronal loss. A modulator of axon outgrowth and cell adhesion that adapts its structure to requirements during development by alternative splicing and posttranslational modification. CNTF appears to promote remyelination, as well as formation of oligodendroctyes. Highly cytotoxic for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, gliotoxin may represent an initial pathogenic factor leading to the neuropathological features of MS, such as blood-brain barrier involvement and demyelination. A marker of immune activation, neopterin is increased in CSF of relapsing-remitting patients and correlates with a decrease of -tryptophan, reflecting interferon-gamma-mediated activation of macrophages. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that can dissolve the extracellular matrix of the blood-brain barrier. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Combinations of various types of evidence are used to diagnose MS under the Poser criteria. More than one combination of clinical and paraclinical evidence can support a diagnosis within a single category.

Evoked Potentials as a Diagnostic Tool in MS Strobe light flash or reversible checkerboard pattern flash on a computer screen Series of clicking noises or tone bursts played into earphone On the scalp along the vertex and on each earlobe Evaluation of sensory nerve tracts in spinal cord, thalamus, and sensory cortex Mild electrical stimulus via electrodes on wrists or knees On the scalp, each wrist (medial nerve), and the knees (peroneal nerve) The use of evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool has greatly declined since the advent of the MRI, which provides a more comprehensive picture of disease activity. In at least some cases of progressive MS, visual evoked potentials show changes over time where none are detected in MRI scans. In May 2000, the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology concluded that although visual evoked potentials are useful to identify patients at increased risk of developing clinically definite MS, somatosensory evoked responses are only useful for that purpose, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend brainstem auditory evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool. Although MS is postulated to have an underlying immune-mediated pathogenesis, there is as yet no biologic marker that is disease specific and can be used for diagnostic purposes. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to allow detection of any putative disease-related infectious agent as a basis for defining the disease. Thus, MS continues to be defined by sets of criteria that have been ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. developed based on clinical and pathologic observations. MS may well be heterogeneous when viewed from the perspective of genetics, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical phenotypes, and immunopathology. To be considered a truly distinctive variant of MS, any putative distinct disease subtypes defined in one of these categories would have to be correlated with the distinctive features identified in each of the other categories. Cases classified as MS are recognized where disease distribution is mainly in the spinal cord, hind brain (cerebellum or brainstem), or cerebrum. Different animal models have distinct topographic distributions, some of which seem to have distinct immunopathologies. For example, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, the demyelinating disease that afflicts mice, is mainly a spinal cord disease. There is an apparent overrepresentation of specific phenotypes in certain geographic regions. For example, MS that is relatively restricted to the optic nerve and spinal cord is more common in Japan than in other countries. The Devic's pattern of MS features a predominance of spinal cord and optic nerve involvement. The pathology is considered more destructive than classical MS, and the prognosis is worse. At issue is whether these differences reflect different immunopathogenic mechanisms in a given individual, even when the disease trigger, or initiating event, is not distinct among such individuals. Even in identical twins with MS, the disease course can be markedly different. A number of immunomodulatory agents have been shown in double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III trials to benefit patients with relapsing MS ( ; see also 1999 review by Rudick ). These agents help clinical disease features (they decrease the number of attacks, the severity of attacks, and sustained worsening on neurologic examination) as well as MRI disease features (they decrease the formation of new lesions, the number of contrast-enhancing lesions, the total burden of disease, and brain atrophy). Although all of these drugs have side effects, they are manageable in most patients. The benefit of treatment is sustained for at least several years. It is not yet known whether these agents prevent, reduce, or delay transition from relapsing to progressive MS, but preliminary data suggest that this may be the case. Throughout this report, the term “disease-modifying therapy” is used to distinguish these agents from other medications used to relieve the symptoms of MS that do not alter either the frequency of relapses or the rate of progression. Beta-interferon (IFN-Î²) is an anti-inflammatory regulatory cytokine with antiviral, antineoplastic, and immunomodulatory activity. It has a number of effects on the immune system that would be beneficial in MS. For example, it decreases cell migration into the CNS, inhibits T-cell proliferation and expression of cell activation markers, inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (the enzyme that produces nitric oxide, a potentially damaging substance), and enhances ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

There are two types of recombinant (artificially made) beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1a (Avonex, Rebif) is a duplicate of human beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) has three molecular differences from human beta-interferon: it is not glycosylated, there is an amino acid substitution at position 17, and there is no “N-terminal” methionine. The three available beta-interferon therapies are given in different amounts and dosing schedules (). There are well-recognized side effects (most commonly flu-like reactions), which occur maximally during the first weeks or months of therapy. Flu-like reactions can be minimized by initiating therapy with a dose escalation schedule and consistent use of anti-inflammatory premedication during the first few weeks of therapy. *Rebif has been approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS by the European Commission but has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States because of the Orphan Drug Act. If tentative approval is received, Rebif could enter the U.S. market in 2003, when the exclusivity periods for Avonex and Betaseron end. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) consists of random polymers of four amino acids, designed to mimic myelin basic protein, an important component of CNS myelin. Glatiramer acetate is believed to work by activating antiinflammatory regulatory T cells, which then migrate into the CNS to inhibit local immune reactions. Glatiramer acetate has an excellent side effect profile. Patients may experience injection site reactions, but they tend to be quite minor. Some 10 to 15 percent of patients experience at least one immediate postinjection reaction characterized by chest tightness, palpitations, flushing, and anxiety within a few minutes of injection. The reaction lasts only minutes and is not dangerous. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) is a cytotoxic agent that interferes with DNA synthesis and repair, and suppresses a variety of immune system cells. It also enhances suppressor cell activity. It is given as an intravenous infusion over 5 to 15 minutes, every three months. Mitoxantrone is fairly well tolerated at low doses. In the recent Phase III trial, both the low (5 mg/m) and high (12 mg/m) doses showed efficacy, but the high dose gave the best overall results. Mitoxantrone should not be given at a cumulative dose of 140 mg/m or higher because of concerns about cardiotoxicity, which also means that this drug can be used for only a few years. Currently available treatments are highly effective in preventing the type of MS damage that can be visualized using MRI. They are moderately effective in preventing and reducing the severity of relapses, but they are generally disappointing in preventing long-term disability—the most important goal of treatment. This might reflect the timing of treatment, and there has been a recent emphasis on starting therapy at the time MS is first diagnosed. This type of early therapy is likely most effective in delaying or preventing long-term disability, although this effect has not yet been clearly demonstrated through empirical research studies (Richard Rudick, personal communication). Clearly, much remains to be done in the development of therapies for people who suffer from MS. Two recent studies, the interferon beta-1a (Avonex) prevention study (CHAMPS, Controlled High Risk Subjects Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention) and the interferon beta-1a (Rebif) early treatment (ETOMS, Early Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis) trial, have compared the use of disease-modifying therapy with placebo in patients after their first attack who also have an abnormal brain MRI. These are patients at high risk for MS, but who do not meet current criteria for a definite diagnosis. In both studies, early treatment with a disease-modifying agent significantly delayed onset of a second clinical attack over the two-year study period. Patients who received treatment also showed significantly less MRI disease activity over the next two years. These two trials have led to a reassessment of when disease-modifying therapy should be started. The National MS Society consensus statement endorsed treatment of patients as soon as a definite diagnosis of relapsing MS is made. If new diagnostic criteria are formulated for an MRI-based diagnosis at the time of a first attack, it is likely that the use of disease-modifying therapy will expand to include these early patients. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate have been tested mainly in relapsing MS. It is more controversial whether they benefit progressive MS. Several Phase III trials have examined beta-interferon therapy in patients with secondary progressive MS, with conflicting results. The European Secondary Progressive Study on beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) showed a significant effect on slowing progression. In contrast, the North American Secondary Progressive beta-interferon-1b study and the European SPECTRIMS beta-interferon-1a (Rebif) study showed no significant effect on progression. These trials did, however, show positive results on secondary outcomes such as relapse rate and MRI disease parameters. The European study, which showed a treatment effect on progression in contrast to the two negative studies, included secondary progressive patients who had a shorter disease duration, were still experiencing relapses, and had contrast-enhancing brain MRI lesions. Considered as a whole, these studies suggest that in the earlier stages of MS, when there is still a significant inflammatory component (reflected in clinical relapses and gadolinium-enhancing lesion activity), beta-interferon may have a positive effect on clinical progression. In the later, nonrelapsing, progressive stages of MS, where there appears to be ongoing atrophy relatively independent of contrast-enhancing lesion activity, beta-interferon does not seem to slow progression. The European Phase III trial of Mitoxantrone enrolled both relapsing and secondary progressive MS patients. The drug had a positive effect on progression as indicated by a decrease in the EDSS impairment scale at the end of the study (change of -0.13 compared to +0.23 in the placebo group, p = .038) (for EDSS scale, see ). An ongoing trial (IMPACT Study) in secondary progressive MS is testing double-dose interferon beta-1a (Avonex) once a week. There have been no major treatment trials in primary progressive and progressive relapsing MS. There currently is an ongoing three-year Phase III trial of glatiramer acetate in primary progressive MS (the Promise trial). Each of the currently available disease-modifying treatments has shortcomings, including partial efficacy for patients as a group and potential adverse effects. There are four reasons why treatments fail—nonadherence on the patient's part, adverse side effects, production of neutralizing antibodies, and nonresponsive disease (reviewed by Cohen at al., 1999). Patient adherence is a factor in the efficacy of any medication, but particularly so when a patient's hopes exceed the outcome—which is particularly salient for therapies that are preventive, but not restorative. The primary principles to increase adherence are appropriate selection of patients for treatment, availability of adequate medical support throughout treatment, and perhaps most importantly, patient education before and during treatment. MS patients need to be fully informed that the therapy can prevent relapses and the accumulation of disability, ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. but that it will not improve preexisting manifestations. In addition, some patients are averse to self-injection and will not be persuaded to inject themselves with any medication (unless, perhaps, they are convinced of a substantial and certain benefit, which many MS patients are not). Health care financing policies vary widely among different countries and even within countries such as the United States and Canada. This will also influence patient adherence. In countries such as France where the costs of MS therapies are fully covered by the state, cost is unlikely to influence adherence, but in countries where patients must assume the full costs of MS disease-modifying therapies themselves, many of them will decide that they cannot afford to pay more than $10,000 (U.S.) annual expense for the modest health benefit they might gain. Adverse effects are a common reason for discontinuing treatment, but they are generally not serious health threats. The most common side effect of glatiramer acetate is irritation at the injection site, although it is typically mild. The most common side effects of beta-interferon are flu-like symptoms, and these usually resolve after three to six months. (Depression is also a possible side effect and is discussed in greater detail in .) Although only 4 percent of actively treated patients withdrew from beta-interferon clinical trials because of side effects, in clinical practice, 11 percent discontinue within four months of initiating treatment (reviewed in 1999 by Mohr et al.). (The percentage of patients who discontinue treatment because of side effects might, however, decline as physicians become more experienced in managing these side effects.) Defining nonresponsive disease in individual patients is difficult, because unfortunately patients can continue to experience relapses after initiation of disease-modifying therapy with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment relapse rates is fraught with problems, and it is often difficult to identify whether an individual patient is responsive to therapy. At a minimum, a patient's level of neurological impairment and disability should remain stable on therapy. Persistent gadolinium-enhancing or T2 lesion accrual should be considered a worrisome feature, even in the absence of clinical evidence of activity or worsening. Finally, neutralizing antibodies, which can interfere with the effects of interferons, appear in up to 20 percent of patients after two years of beta-interferon treatment. They do not appear to be an issue with glatiramer acetate. Increased neutralizing antibodies appear to be associated with reduced clinical benefit, although there is still some controversy about this point. For example, it is still not known what levels of neutralizing antibodies are clinically significant, how often they persist, and what is the most reliable method of measuring them. More research is needed on testing for neutralizing antibodies in MS patients treated with beta-interferons and how to best use the results to properly manage patient treatment.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Disease-modifying therapies are expensive, costing roughly $8,000 to $10,000 (U.S.) per year. Several studies have indicated that their costs outweigh their benefits, but these analyses have been heavily criticized. Forbes and colleagues argued that it is not cost-effective to treat progressive MS patients with interferon beta-1b in Britain and that the money spent on interferon beta-1b would be better spent on other services, such as supportive care and simple interventions to reduce the burden of patients' symptoms. Analyses of cost-effectiveness of medical treatment often use quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to measure health benefits (see ). The estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY for relapsing-remitting MS range from 809,000 British pounds ($1,140,000 U.S.) to 2,038,400 British pounds ($2,870,000 U.S.). The estimates are considerably lower in Canada (406,000 to 490,000 Canadian dollars, or $270,000-$330,000 U.S.). For secondary progressive MS, the estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY range from 874,600 British pounds ($1,230,000 U.S.) to 1,024,000 British pounds ($1,440,000 U.S.). While disease-related expenditures are relatively easy to calculate, the benefits of these expenditures are not so easy to calculate, particu- Quality-adjusted life-years are a health status measure that includes both quantity and quality of life in a single outcome measure. Multiplying life expectancy by a quality-of-life adjustment fraction, or utility, results in a QALY value. Utilities represent the level of quality or value associated with a particular health state, and range in value from 0, representing death, to 1, representing optimal health. Utilities are determined in two ways: by researchers through literature searches for previously conducted utility studies or by direct measurement of utility values based on the assessment of people's values for different levels of health. The use of QALYs for resource allocation has been widely criticized as discriminatory against the elderly and the disabled by placing less value on extending their lives due to the lower potential for health status improvement. The determination of utility values that accurately reflect the many ways quality of life can be affected is difficult in part because one of the underlying assumptions of QALYs— that the severity of a disease state or disability and the corresponding value represent a fixed quantity—is unlikely to be true. The effect of health status on quality of life depends in large part on an individual's unique perspective. Although the use of QALYs is one of the current standards for such evaluations, it is a crude attempt to express a qualitative, subjective reality in quantitative terms and has been criticized as being of limited value in this respect. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. larly in long-term diseases where treatments might slow the progress of disease, but neither cure it nor restore impaired functions. In addition to the limitations inherent in the use of QALYs, there are other problems with the conclusion that disease-modifying therapies are not cost-effective. The studies done to date have been criticized for using poor economic methodology in interpreting the data. In a year 2000 review of immunomodulatory drugs used to treat MS, the British National Health Service committee on health technology assessment concluded that the cost-effectiveness of these drugs is simply not known. The committee cited a lack of quality clinical trials for each drug, including methodological limitations, poor reporting of data, small sample sizes, short duration, inconsistent treatment regimes and outcome measures, and uncertainty about the clinical significance of reported benefits. The latter criticism might, however, change. New data about these drugs are emerging at such a rapid pace that conclusions about their benefits should be reconsidered as new data from clinical trials become available. In general, cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered skeptically. Cost-effectiveness is a highly politicized issue in which economic principles are often misapplied. Indeed, the United States health care system often favors economically inefficient delivery of some products—for example, liver transplants—in that health care providers are willing to underwrite additional costs to gain market share. Further, cross-national comparisons have little merit because of differences in national health care systems, as well as other economic and social factors. Finally, although economic analysis reveals important financial trade-offs, all societies hold certain social values that outweigh economic considerations. For many people, the health and well-being of their loved ones and themselves is among the deepest of these values. Ultimately, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying MS will have to be better understood to design rational therapies. Physiology of Myelin and Axons: Normal Function, Demyelination, and Repair The integrative activity of the nervous system, which underlies motor, sensory, cognitive, and psychological behavior, depends on electrical signaling between neurons. Each neuron encodes its message in the form of action potentials (small all-or-none electrical impulses) that are carried to other neurons via axons, the cable-like fibers that extend from neuron cell bodies. Many axons within the brain and spinal cord are myelinated. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The myelin sheath provides a high-resistance, low-capacitance insulator that increases the reliability and speed of action potentials conducted along axon fibers. Myelin is what makes the white matter of brain white. It is a multilayered sheath formed by the oligodendroglial cells, or oligodendrocytes, that insulate axons ( ). Each segment of the myelin sheath surrounds the axon in a segmented fashion, with segments (called internodes) periodically interrupted at nodes of Ranvier. The internodal axon is normally surrounded by myelin sheaths whose thicknesses are related to the caliber of the ensheathed axon. In normal Oligodendrocyte making myelin. The processes of a given oligodendrocyte wrap themselves around portions of the surrounding axons. As each process wraps itself around, it forms layers of myelin. Each process thus becomes a segment of the axon's myelin sheath. SOURCE: National Institutes of Health Office of Science Education. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. myelinated fibers, the action potential does not travel in a continuous manner. On the contrary, it jumps from one node of Ranvier to the next, in a manner known as “saltatory” (derived from the Latin word for “jumping”). Saltatory conduction is a rapid process, with the impulse taking only 20 one-thousandths of a second to jump from one node of Ranvier to the next; as a result, myelinated fibers conduct impulses with a high velocity. Significantly, voltage-dependent sodium channels are clustered at the nodes of Ranvier but are relatively more scarce in the internodal axonal membrane. In contrast, potassium channels, which exist in low density at nodes, are more abundant in the internodal and paranodal axonal membrane, under the myelin sheath. Therefore, loss of the myelin sheath exposes relatively inexcitable axonal membranes; the consequence is that nerve impulses are conducted more slowly or not at all. Axonal Conduction Is Impaired in Demyelinated Axons Following damage to the myelin, conduction velocity is reduced, and conduction slows along the demyelinated axon ( ). Studies using evoked potentials to examine human subjects with MS have demonstrated that this slowing of conduction does not, in itself, necessarily produce clinical deficits. In addition, however, conduction failure can occur in demyelinated axons. When conduction failure occurs, the axon potential is not propagated from one end of the fiber to the other, and information is lost. This produces a clinical deficit. Conduction failure in demyelinated axons is now known to result not only from loss of the insulating myelin, but also from the molecular organization of the axon membrane. Following damage to the myelin, internodal parts of the axon membrane (which had previously been covered by myelin) are uncovered. Myelinated Axons Exhibit Complex Molecular Architecture Prior to the last decade, axonal dysfunction in demyelinating diseases was considered to be due entirely to the loss of the myelin insulation. According to this schema, after the myelin is damaged, there is a “short circuit,” and impulse conduction is slowed or fails. It is now known that although the schema described above is partially correct, it is not the whole story. The axon itself exhibits an elegant molecular architecture, and following damage to the myelin, this architecture is disrupted. The molecular architecture of the axon is manifest by the placement of specialized protein molecules, called ion channels, within the membrane of the axon. Sodium channels act as tiny molecular batteries, which produce the depolarization that is necessary for the generation of action potentials. In contrast, potassium channels act as molecular brakes, damping electrical activity. Within myelinated axons, these two types of ion channels have a complementary structure. Sodium channels are clustered in high density in the axon membrane at small gaps in the myelin called nodes of Ranvier, where they support the produc- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Their numbers there are too low to support secure conduction, which contributes to conduction failure. Potassium channels, on the other hand, tend to be located in the internodal parts of the axon membrane, beneath the myelin sheath; as a result of this, they are masked by the Pathogenesis.

The unmasking of potassium channels by demyelination thus introduces another factor that tends to interfere with the conduction of action potentials. Molecular Plasticity in Demyelinated Axons Underlies Restoration of Impulse Conduction Given that impulse conduction fails in demyelinated axons and that this contributes to clinical deficits, how do remissions occur? It is now clear that demyelinated axons possess a remarkable capability to rebuild themselves at the molecular level. In the weeks following demyelination, demyelinated axons acquire, within regions where myelin has been lost, a density of sodium channels that is high enough to support action potential conduction even in the absence of insulating myelin. The demyelinated nerve fibers insert additional amplifiers (sodium channels) in their membranes so that they are able to conduct action potentials reliably even though there is a short circuit. This is a striking example of neuronal plasticity, in this case at the molecular level. Although this molecular plasticity has been clearly demonstrated in laboratory experiments, a number of important questions remain: How do neurons “know” that their axons have been demyelinated and that there is a need to activate the machinery for synthesis of sodium channels? How do neurons control the synthesis and deployment of sodium channels? What turns on the genes for sodium channels and ensures that the correct types of sodium channels (there are nearly a dozen different types, which are like different types of batteries) are produced following demyelination? Also, how are sodium channels transported and inserted into the correct parts of the axon membrane so that they can function normally? These questions have important therapeutic implications and are currently under study. The presence of axonal degeneration in MS was recognized even in the early descriptions of this disease, but its presence has recently been reemphasized (). Axonal transection might be the structural basis for acquisition of permanent (nonremitting) neurological deficits, making it an especially important part of the pathology of MS. A corollary of this proposition would be that neuroprotective interventions that limit axonal injury should prevent, or at least lessen, the acquisition of new, permanent signs and symptoms in MS. As a step toward the development of neuroprotective strategies in MS, it will be important to delineate the mechanisms that underlie axonal injury in this disorder. Is it a consequence of demyelination? Alternatively, is the axonal damage a by-product of the inflammatory or immune processes involved in triggering demyelination?

Understanding the pathogenesis of the process might lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for MS.

MS is defined as a demyelinating disease because the myelin sheaths and their parent cells, the oligodendroglia, are major targets of immune-mediated damage (). The classical lesions are discrete plaques of demyelination, which, depending on disease stage, are associated with varying evidence of inflammation. The clinical signs, which are episodic and are not clinically predictable, are presumably related to the location of the lesions, although clinically “silent” demyelinating lesions also occur. These predominantly white matter lesions occur in multiple brain regions and appear at different times throughout the disease. Common syndromes correlated with lesions in specific areas include visual deficits, weakness and spasticity, eye movement abnormalities, and ataxia (). Lesions are often described as active or chronic, depending on whether there are signs of active inflammation, usually associated with ongoing demyelination, or whether the lesion is stable and does not show signs of inflammatory activity. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier that normally insulates the brain from pathogenic blood-borne substances is an early event in the development of MS lesions (). Antigen-specific T cells enter the nervous system, and when they encounter and recognize their specific antigen, a cascade of cytokine expression begins that contributes to the damage of the blood-brain barrier. This can be detected on contrast-enhanced MRI. Examination of active demyelinating lesions in autopsy cases of MS reveals structural and immunopathological abnormalities related to demyelination and abnormalities of oligodendrocytes. The inflammatory response is dominated by lymphocytes and macrophages, but the data on the relative numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells are still not settled. A plaque is characterized by loss of myelin sheath and infiltration by macrophages (which show myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein immunoreactivities).

Clinical Pathological Correlations in Common Syndromes of MS Often related to the involvement of the optic nerve as occurs in optic neuritis Frequently associated with plaques involving connections between the brainstem nuclei subserving eye movements One of the consequences of lesions involving the spinal cord or descending motor tracts in the white matter of internal capsule or brainstem Usually the result of lesions in cerebellum or its input-output pathways inflammatory responses amplify, macrophages are filled with lipids, myelin damage occurs, and there is apparently some collateral damage to axons. Scattered B cells and plasma cells are also sometimes associated with these lesions. Immunocytochemical analysis has suggested that there may be leakage of immunoglobulins and complement from vessels at the margins of active plaques. There is evidence for upregulation of a variety of cytokines within MS plaques including various interleukins (IL-1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12); beta-interferon; tumor necrosis factor (TNF); and transforming growth factor (TGF). Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. Their involvement in any disease is complex. They can initiate, sustain, or terminate various aspects of disease processes and are particularly involved in inflammatory responses. Specific chemokine receptors are expressed by infiltrating cells in demyelinating MS brain lesions and in CSF. These results imply pathogenic roles for specific chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions in MS and suggest new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Some investigators have emphasized that the pattern of pathology suggests a dying-back oligodendrogliopathy (those parts of the cell, such as the most distal process, farthest from the cell body are the most vulnerable). During the active stages of disease, the number of oligodendrocytes can be reduced near the demyelinating foci. Subsequently, there might be partial recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursors that may, in part, repopulate the margins of the plaque and contribute to remyelination. Trapp and colleagues have emphasized that the relapsing-remitting course is intimately related to the inflammatory demyelination and classical plaques, while more chronic progressive forms of the disease are linked to transection, or severing, of axons at sites of inflammation and demyelination. They have shown that severed axons were a consistent component in the lesions of individuals with MS and suggest that the number of these injured axons is correlated to the magnitude of the inflammation within the lesion. Axonal damage might be a pathological correlate of irreversible neurological deficits that occur in patients with progressive MS. In individuals with chronic MS, plaques are often sharply demarcated with scattered lipid-containing macrophages and little evidence of ongoing myelin destruction. Demyelination can be incomplete. The density of axons may be significantly reduced. There is usually astrogliosis within these lesions. It is not clear exactly how the axonal damage that occurs at later stages plays into this complex evolving pathology, but the extent of axonal damage appears to be a critical determinant of whether a person recovers from an attack or not. Lack of recovery from attacks and disease progression are more likely when axons are more severely damaged and repair mechanisms fail. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

The tight seal of the cells lining the blood vessels forms a blood-brain barrier that keeps many substances out of the brain. Leaky blood vessels in the body allow many molecules to cross through to other tissues, but the tight construction of the vessels in the head guards against entry of most molecules into the brain. Normally, only certain molecules, for example, blood gases such as oxygen and small nutritional molecules, can cross the blood-brain barrier, but this barrier breaks down when the brain is injured or in certain diseases, such as MS.

A correlation between demyelination and axonal degeneration observed at autopsy is supported by imaging studies, including those that compare the concentrations of -acetyl aspartate. For example, one study measured the levels of NAA, an amino acid found only in neurons that serves as a biological marker for integrity of the axon and neuronal cell body. The brains of MS patients showed significantly greater side-to-side differences in levels of NAA, indicating decreased neuronal integrity on the side of the brain with lower NAA levels. There was a correlation between this asymmetry in motor function and the asymmetry of NAA concentrations in the internal capsule. Insights into processes that lead to demyelination and axon damage can be obtained by analyzing T1-weighted image hypointensities, proton spectroscopy, MTI, and DTI and by correlating these measures with clinical and pathological findings. Gliosis is a prominent feature of the MS lesion, but it is best regarded as a secondary phenomenon. Whenever the CNS is damaged, it undergoes an injury response, usually called reactive gliosis or glial scarring. The response is broadly the same whatever the source of injury, although the details vary somewhat with different types of pathology. The glial reaction to injury includes recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, stem cells, microglia, and astrocytes. Formation of the glial scar after CNS injury generally occurs over a period of weeks. Microglia are typically the first cell types to enter the lesion. In the normal brain, they are quiescent with short, branched processes. Following injury, they exhibit various changes, including activation, cell division, and migration to the injury site. During activation, microglia display conspicuous functional plasticity, which involves changes in cell morphology, cell surface receptor expression, and production of growth factors and cytokines, and they become, in general, more macrophage like. Microglia can be either neurotoxic or neurotrophic. The final glial scar is made up mainly of a meshwork of tightly interwoven astrocyte processes, attached to one another by tight junctions and gap junctions and surrounded by extracellular matrix (reviewed in 1999 by Fawcett and Asher). (Astrocytes are irregularly star-shaped, background structural cells of the nervous system.) Gliosis is usually restricted to the area of demyelination, but it sometimes extends beyond that area. There is no specific way to identify the presence and extent of gliosis in MS lesions through MRI, although the T1 signal might be more sensitive to gliosis than the T2 signal. The role of astrocytes in gliosis is not completely known. Since there is evidence that glial scars can inhibit both axon growth and myelination, it is clearly important to know what causes them to form, what cells are involved, why they are inhibitory, and how to manipulate them. Finally, although gliosis is generally considered harmful, there is also evidence that the gliotic ensheathment of demyelinated axons might favor the restoration of nerve conduction.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The relapsing-remitting form of MS appears to be related to the demyelination of axons during relapses, followed by the remodeling and remyelination with consequent restoration of conduction that underlies remission. Remyelination is carried out by surviving oligodendrocytes or by the proliferation of progenitor cells that are then stimulated to become oligodendrocytes. Molecular remodeling of demyelinated axons, in terms of their redistributing their sodium channels along the axon, might act as a form of adaptive plasticity; this process may represent a target for future therapies. In contrast, the progressive form of the disease, which appears clinically as an unremitting accumulation of deficits, might reflect the superimposition of axonal injury or degeneration on multiple chronic foci of demyelinated axons. The finding that axonal damage can occur frequently in MS and the suggestion that these lesions contribute to persistent neurological deficits are important issues in MS research. Thus, it will be important to understand the mechanisms whereby axons are damaged and to define ways of protecting axons, which may be vulnerable to degeneration, in part due to their proximity to inflammatory and demyelinating foci. It will also be important to search for molecules that promote the regrowth of injured axons to their appropriate targets. Some of the lessons from studies of the repair of spinal cord injury are likely to be relevant here. Moreover, because abnormal patterns of ion channels have been found within neurons whose axons are undergoing demyelination, it will be important to understand the factors that influence the regulation of these channels. These lines of research, involving strategies can restore conduction in demyelinated axons represent opportunities to restore that protect axons from degeneration or promote repair, and those agents that functions and could have significant implications for therapy. Similarly, future therapeutic approaches might involve replacement of oligodendroglia with pluripotent stem cells (discussed further in ). Progenitor cells, those either already present in an individual or provided from another source by injection, can produce myelin in demyelinated foci in experimental animals. Future experimental therapeutics will involve approaches directed at restoring oligodendrocytes to ensheath axonal processes and to induce physiological modeling of axons to restore conduction. The most striking pathology in MS is the immune system's attack and destruction of the body's own myelin sheath, which is why it is believed to be an autoimmune disease, although this has not yet been definitively proven (). The pathogenic trigger that first causes the immune system to attack myelin is unknown, but the immunopathology, or pathological activity of the immune system, that ensues after that initial attack is becoming clearer. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The immune system defends the body against foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. It does so by recognizing that foreign invaders have special markers distinguishing them as “non-self,” compared to the body's own tissue (or “self”) (). Normally, the immune system reacts only to non-self invaders, not to its own tissues. Unfortunately, this process is not foolproof. Autoimmunity is an immune response mounted against antigens that are naturally produced within the body, or self-antigens, to cause lasting tissue damage. In the strictest sense, an autoimmune disease must meet several criteria. First, the disease must be reproduced by transfer of autoantibodies or autoreactive T lymphocytes (T cells) from affected to unaffected individuals. Second, the self-antigen that elicits the immune attack must be identified. Third, this antigen (or a closely related one) should cause a similar disease in an animal model. (Scientifically, it would be best to show that the antigen caused the disease in humans, but it would be unethical to intentionally infect humans, hence, the compromise for evidence in animals). It is now feasible to transfer human genes into animals in an attempt to satisfy these criteria. One of the first so-called transgenic studies that introduced certain human genes into an animal without MS led to the development of a disease resembling MS. Among the newly added genes were those for a specific type of histocompatibility antigen and for a particular type of T-cell receptor that binds to a fragment of a myelin protein (myelin basic protein). This type of study begins to confirm the autoimmune nature of MS. Human autoimmune diseases, however, are generally classified as such without meeting these three stringent criteria. Circumstantial evidence often is marshaled for classification. For example, patients are classified as having autoimmune disease if they have high levels of autoantibody or autoreactive T cells, or because there is a correlation between the level of immune activity and disease severity. Some examples of autoimmune diseases are listed in . Why does the immune system have autoreactive lymphocytes? During development, the immune system randomly builds a vast repertoire of cells that respond to a multitude of foreign antigens. At the same time, the immune system must weed out those cells that react to self-antigens. Most self-reactive B cells and T cells are removed early during development. Other regulatory mechanisms exist to keep self-reactive lymphocytes unresponsive later on. These are among the normal regulatory mechanisms resulting in immunological tolerance to most self-antigens. Even though there are usually small numbers of autoreactive lymphocytes in a normal adult, most do not cause disease, and some might even serve a (currently unknown) beneficial purpose. With autoimmune disease, however, there are large numbers of autoreactive immune cells. Autoimmune disease thus can be thought of as a failure of normal regulatory mechanisms that guard against autoimmunity. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The causes of autoimmune response in MS and most other autoimmune diseases are unknown but likely include a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental agents. For most autoimmune diseases, the actual genes and environmental agents are unknown. Gender also plays a role because women are disproportionately affected by autoimmune disease. The reasons for the gender difference are also unknown but appear to relate to distinct immune environments in women and How can genes and environment trigger autoimmune pathology? Genes control many properties of the immune system. Theoretically, autoimmune disease can occur if any of the genes controlling the immune system's ability to distinguish self from non-self are defective. The genes often suspected of predisposing to autoimmune disease encode proteins, such as histocompatibility antigens, that participate in this complex process of self versus non-self recognition. Environmental or infectious agents can stimulate pathological autoimmune reactions through at least two possible mechanisms: molecular mimicry, superantigens, and bystander damage (). Molecular mimicry occurs when a bacterial or viral epitope—the fragment of an antigen that elicits an immune response—is very similar to a self-epitope. This can occur following an infection where an immune cell targeting an epitope on a bacterium subsequently cross-reacts with a self-antigen. Superantigens are proteins from bacteria or retroviruses that lead to widespread activation of T cells. Unlike most antigens, which activate only a specific T cell, superantigens activate approximately one out of every ten T cells. Because of their generic ability to activate so many types of T cells, superantigens may inadvertently activate autoreactive T cells, which then attack self-tissues. In bystander damage, a virus upregulates a nonspecific immune response that then leads to pathology; for example, proinflammatory cytokines might activate Th1 cells or macrophages that contribute to the immunopathology. Once damage occurs, new cellular epitopes become exposed and trigger an immune response in a process called epitope spreading, which can also lead to autoimmune pathology. During an immune response against a particular epitope, the number of lymphocytes that recognize the epitope normally multiplies. Yet, in epitope spreading, the immune response escalates to target other epitopes on the same antigen or on related antigens. In this way, an initially nonpathological autoimmune response expands to produce a pathological response. The underlying basis for epitope spreading in autoimmune diseases is poorly understood. Another way to produce a pathological autoimmune response is for autoreactive lymphocytes to gain access to a target antigen from which they are ordinarily separated. The brain is one example of an anatomical sanctuary site, because it is protected by the blood-brain barrier of the central nervous system. Normally, T cells that might react against myelin do not pass across this barrier into the central nervous system. In MS, however, T cells become activated, which enables them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach their targets—myelin antigens—thereby generating an autoimmune response. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. One of the first pathological processes leading up to MS attacks is thought to be activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes, or T cells, and their migration into the central nervous system. However, T cells and the inflammatory molecules they secrete are not the only players. Many cells and molecules of the immune system—likely unleashed by T-cell activation—participate in demyeli- Interactions between major cell components of the immune system. This simplified outline shows interactions that occur in response to a foreign antigen. The antigen could be an epitope from a virus particle, bacterium, or other foreign agent. The antigen-presenting cell (APC) ingests the antigen (or in the case of an infecting virus, it may already be within the cell) and processes it into peptide fragments. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC, the cell surface structure characteristic of each individual) presents this target to a resting T cell. Binding of the peptide-MHC complex by the T-cell receptor activates the T cell. In the case of a CD8+ cell, it becomes a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), which will destroy any cells that have the same peptide-MHC complex on their surfaces. In the case of a CD4+ cell, the activated cell produces and secretes various cytokines that recruit and activate nonspecific effector cells (such as macrophages) or stimulate antigen-bound B cells to produce antibodies. When T and B lymphocytes are activated by a specific antigen, they undergo proliferation, producing more cells with their same antigen specificity. This serves to amplify the immune response against the foreign antigen. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Although no virus has yet been shown to contribute to the etiology of MS, there are several ways in which this could occur, and one of these is shown in this figure. Activated T cells cross the blood-brain barrier following activation by a microbe with a structural similarity to a component of the myelin sheath. Once inside the brain, these cells attack self-antigens, such as the various myelin proteins that are attacked in MS. NOTE: MBP = myelin basic protein. SOURCE: Steinman and Oldstone, 1997.

The key features of this cascade are not fully understood, including the precise ordering of events, the antigens targeted by T cells, and the contributions of B lymphocytes, or B cells, and other cells of the immune system. Yet, as this section explains, much insight has been gained into the immunopathology of MS. This knowledge has been—and continues to be—fundamental for devising therapies targeted to the immunopathology of MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. As much as a century ago, researchers observed that T cells were particularly abundant in MS lesions. Over time, using modern immunologic techniques, they managed to isolate and characterize a particular type of T cell, the autoreactive T cell, from the blood and CSF of MS patients. These and related findings gave credence to the hypothesis that autoreactive T cells played a dominant role in MS. After all, immunologists have long known that T cells are capable of orchestrating a multifaceted autoimmune attack. However, this was not enough to explain MS pathology. First, elevations in certain types of autoreactive T cells were not unique to MS patients. Second, and more critically, T cells were necessary but not sufficient to cause demyelinating disease in animal models. The transfer of myelin-specific T cells into normal animals initiated only inflammation, not demyelination. This suggested that other immune cells, particularly antibody-producing B cells () and macrophages, might also play key roles, even if autoreactive T cells launched the process.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The prime autoantigen that elicits the autoimmune response in MS is not known. While there are many candidate autoantigens, as yet none is preeminent. Much MS research focused on myelin basic protein (MBP), located at the inner surface of the myelin membrane. Clinical studies were shaped by research on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the classic animal model of demyelinating disease. In many species, MBP acts as a classical encephalitogenic autoantigen (an antigen capable of serving as the focus of an inflammatory attack in the brain). EAE research further established that in some strains of mice and rats, the autoimmune response to MBP displays two unique features. First, in the initial stages of the immune response in EAE, T cells react only to very small regions of the MBP molecule (“epitope dominance”), even though they later react to many more regions of the molecule (“epitope spreading”) (see ). Second, the encephalitogenic T cells in EAE use an unusually narrow repertoire of genes for their antigen receptors. (T cells recognize their target antigen by its capacity to bind to specific receptors on their surface membrane, called T-cell receptors [TCRs]). These two features raised hopes for developing immune-based therapies because a more limited range of therapies might succeed in combating MS in early stages. Unfortunately, these features turned out to be much less prominent in humans with MS. First, human T cells respond to a broader set of MBP epitopes. While there might be a relatively dominant epitope in the central portion of the MBP molecule, there are clearly many other target epitopes along the full sequence of this large polypeptide. Second, MBP-specific T cells use multiple genes for their TCRs, which allows for large variability among individuals. Generally, it appears that the T-cell response against myelin proteins differs greatly between individual patients, a property that suggests the potential need for individually designed immune therapies. Several research teams have attempted to identify MBP-specific T cells in MS patients. Unfortunately, these attempts did not show significant increases in MBP-specific T-cell counts in MS patients compared to healthy blood donors. However, when more definitive assay systems were used, increased frequencies of activated MBP-specific T cells were found in MS patients. These studies relied on complex methods and were influenced by numerous factors that complicate the interpretation of results. More direct assays, such as those that use binding of oligomeric class II-peptide complexes to specific T cells, might resolve the problem. To add a further degree of complexity, MBP does not appear to be the only autoantigen in MS: there are a number of additional myelin and nonmyelin proteins that are potential autoantigens in MS. Earlier hypotheses had implicated MBP on the basis of two lines of research. First, studies of EAE had suggested that MBP was indeed the most important, if not the only, encephalitogenic myelin autoantigen. Second, due to its particularly convenient molecular properties, MBP was the only myelin protein available both at high purity and in large ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. quantities. However, thanks to modern biotechnology, even minor myelin proteins are now available in large quantities and can be studied for their encephalitogenic capacity. Later studies established that many, if not all, myelin proteins are potentially encephalitogenic. Especially interesting among these newly recognized autoantigens is myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). In contrast to MBP, which lies on the inside of the myelin sheath, MOG lies on the surface. As one of the few myelin proteins accessible to humoral autoantibodies, MOG is a target for demyelinating immunoglobulins (see next section). In addition, MOG is a very effective autoantigen in rodents and in primates for encephalitogenic T cells. Some studies even demonstrated increased frequencies of MOG-reactive T cells in MS patients. These findings clearly warrant general confirmation. It is also important to investigate whether different subtypes of MS, which are distinguished by divergent clinical, genetic, and morphological features, are associated with enhanced T-cell responses against different target autoantigens. Thus far, research has spotlighted one class of T cells—those with a TCR termed Î±Î². Î±Î² T cells are the major class of immune cells centrally involved in adaptive immune responses against infections and tumors. Much less attention has been given to other T-cell classes (Î³Î´ T cells and NK1 T cells), which may function both as effector cells in autoimmune attacks and as suppressor cells that dampen autoimmune responses. There are reports linking the presence of Î³Î´ T cells in the brain (presumably) with the induction of heat shock proteins in MS lesions. Certain members of this broad class of proteins are a normal component of the myelin sheath, yet they are also found outside the CNS as well as in pathogens. The role of heat shock proteins in the development of the MS lesion is unknown, but there are various possibilities. Some of these proteins might act as a target autoantigen, as has been shown in autoimmune diabetes. They might also reflect inflammatory stress inflicted on local CNS cells, or they might be determinants of beneficial anti-inflammatory control mechanisms. Even though the precise pathological roles of T cells and their autoantigens are unresolved, this line of research has generated many approved or emerging therapies. These include vaccination strategies, which use either attenuated myelinspecific T cells or peptides representing myelin-specific T-cell receptors as vaccines to strengthen the body's own regulatory responses against pathogenic T cells (reviewed in Zhang et. al., 1998). Also under development are “altered peptide” therapies that use peptide analogues of myelin protein segments to induce autoreactive T cells to produce protective, rather than pathogenic, cytokine mediators. Cytokines, as discussed later, are a functionally diverse set of signaling molecules produced by T cells. *Each (Î± and Î²) refers to a polypeptide chain that forms the T-cell receptor. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. B cells (also known as B lymphocytes) have been detected in MS lesions for many years, although less consistently than T cells. While most MS research naturally focused on T cells, evidence also has accumulated for participation by autoreactive B cells. It now appears that both types of lymphocytes actively contribute to MS immunopathology. Autoreactive T cells are thought to launch inflammation and, through their release of cytokines, to stimulate B cells to secrete antibodies that cause demyelination. This is consistent with animal studies finding that EAE can be produced only by injecting myelin-specific T cells in combination with myelin-specific antibodies. Without injecting the antibodies, demyelination does not occur. In MS patients, levels in cerebrospinal fluid of the type of protein known to consist of antibodies (immunoglobulin) are often higher than in healthy people. The increased immunoglobulin is due to production by only a few different clones of B cells that have been induced to proliferate. B cells from the CSF of MS patients have been reported to contain mutations in the DNA sequences that encode antibodies, which is consistent with the notion of an antigen-driven selection of antibodies with high-affinity antigen-binding sites. Such events are commonly observed in immune responses against foreign antigens such as bacterial infections, as well as in humoral autoimmune responses. However, no foreign antigen or autoantigen responsible for the generation of oligoclonal bands in MS has yet been identified. One recent study using sophisticated immunocytochemistry furnished direct evidence of a pathologic role for autoantibodies. For the first time, MOG-specific antibodies were demonstrated to be bound to myelin debris in active MS lesions. If confirmed and extended to a larger group of patients, this finding would suggest that B-cell-derived autoantibodies might induce myelin destruction. On the other hand, although anti-MOG antibodies are found in the CSF of MS patients, they are also found in CSF of patients with other neurological diseases that are not demyelinating. Thus, despite tantalizing leads, the role of anti-MOG antibodies in MS patients is still unclear. Cytokines are soluble proteins produced and released by T cells, macrophages, and certain other cell types. Interferons (IFN- Î±, Î², and Î³), interleukins (including IL- 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, and 13), TGF-b, and the neuropoietic cytokines (such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor) are all different types of cytokines. They generally act as intercellular signaling molecules that regulate *Neuropoietic cytokines are the family of neural growth factors that act on both the nervous and the hematopoietic or immune systems.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and carry out immune functions, but their repertoire is complex. Some function as pro-inflammatory, others as anti-inflammatory agents. Some even have divergent functions during different phases of disease. Cytokines, including the subset known as chemokines (for ), also alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier or act on neural cells. Thus, particular cytokines can initiate, sustain, or terminate inflammatory disease processes. Proinflammatory cytokines and other secretory products of immune cells are proposed in several neurological diseases—including MS—to be toxic to neurons and oligodendrocytes if they are secreted in sufficiently high concentrations over a sustained period of time. In MS, the initial entry of autoreactive T cells into the CNS is thought to trigger the local production of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn begins the inflammatory process and enhances the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. A more permeable blood-brain barrier allows infiltration into the CNS of more immune cells which in turn contribute to the ongoing inflammation. Thus, understanding the roles of cytokines and their temporal sequence of activation is crucial to modifying the course of MS. Much of our present understanding of cytokine action in demyelinating disease comes from studies of animal models, including EAE. A large body of research is being compiled on the expression and possible function of cytokines as pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in MS. Some studies have used in situ immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization to visualize gene expression in lesions, whereas others have relied on the activation of inflammatory cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages) in vitro. Much of the research is comparing material from MS patients with or without treatment with immunomodulatory agents, especially glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon. Pro-inflammatory cytokines within active MS lesions have been localized to both infiltrating immune cells and glia. Longitudinal studies have linked clinical exacerbation and remission to high and low expression, respectively, of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-Î³. For example, secretion of TNF-Î³ and cell adhesion molecules by inflammatory cells is upregulated immediately prior to relapse. Yet, not all findings could be verified in all patient groups studied. Understanding of cytokines and their diverse roles throughout the course of disease, although still incomplete, has nevertheless spawned new treatments. One explanation for the success of glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon relates to their control over cytokine expression: they can induce T cells to switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (Th1) to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (Th2). T cells that are switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype release a variety of cytokines, such as IL-10, that reduce inflammation. CNS. CNS tissues were traditionally thought to be exempt from active immune reactivity, but it is now known ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. that the brain is subject to immune surveillance and can be the site of immune responses. Only activated and not resting T cells can cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with local CNS cells. Local glial cells can be stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines to express immunologically active molecules, such as the major histocompatability complex (MHC) products, cytokines, and chemokines required for local immune responses. Neurons are capable of suppressing immune responses within the CNS. Thus, immune responses are more likely to occur in areas of neuronal degeneration than in intact CNS tissues. Immune reactivity within the CNS must hence be viewed as the balance between the proinflammatory signals contributed by activated T cells and other inflammatory cells entering the brain and the anti-inflammatory signals from functional neurons. Epidemiologists define what causes a disease and what puts an individual at risk of getting this disease. They look for correlations such as whether Caucasians are more likely to have MS than Asians or whether residents of one county are more likely to get MS than residents of another. These correlations lead to hypotheses or working models as to which factors actually cause MS and which are only associated with it. These hypotheses or models can then be tested experimentally. Epidemiological studies have limitations, but for a complex disease like MS, they can rule out some factors and highlight others. They are the first step toward finding a biological mechanism for MS, or possibly a cure. Most epidemiological studies of MS have been observational and retrospective; researchers collected the information (for example, ethnicity, age of onset) from an individual (or from records) that had been diagnosed with MS. Such studies rely on an individual's ability to accurately recall information from years ago, for example, the infections that she or he had before the age of five. Other sources of data, such as death certificates, can contain incorrect information. Despite these shortcomings, a few factors consistently correlate with MS prevalence. Determining how these factors lead to an increased risk of MS has proven more difficult. The risk of MS increases with increasing distance from the equator. In the United States, this is seen as a gradient of risk, with higher risk in northern regions and a lower risk in the south. In Australia, the prevalence of MS increases similarly from lower, subequatorial latitudes to the more southerly latitudes. Studies on migrating populations, although inconclusive, offer tentative support for the hypothesis that environment influences MS risk. Individuals who have moved from a region with one risk level to a region with a higher or lower risk, in general, adopt the risk level of their new home. This is especially true for individuals moving from a low-risk to a high-risk area. Studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that this geographical effect had a defined susceptibility period before age 15. Although these data still ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appear in the MS literature and have led to several hypotheses about the effects of puberty or early dietary effects on MS risk, the sample numbers are too small to support such a tight cutoff. A later and larger study assayed the effects of migration by comparing location at birth with location at approximately 24 years of age. Although individuals did adopt the risk of their new home, the age values in that study are not precise enough to add to the argument for or against a cutoff. Most recently, a study comparing the prevalence of MS among native-born Australians and Australian immigrants from the United Kingdom (thereby providing a rough control for genetic background) suggests that rather than being established around age 15, environmental risk factors operate over many years and into early adulthood. Although the migrational studies suggest an environmental correlation with MS, the root cause of this latitude effect is unknown. Differences in diet or sunlight have been proposed, but neither has been supported by rigorous studies. Alternatively, the geographical distribution of MS could result from the migration either of a viral agent or of individuals (perhaps originally Scandinavians) who carried a pool of susceptible genes. Ethnicity is another definite risk factor. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other groups. In a study of 5,305 U.S. veterans with MS, Caucasian males had twice the risk of MS as African-American males. Other factors can modulate the effect of ethnicity on risk of MS. MS is almost absent among black Africans. African Americans, however, show a low risk of MS; this might be due to genetic mixing with Caucasian Americans or to an environmental effect. MS occurrence among Asians is also quite low. Again, Asian Americans show an intermediate risk for MS between Asians and Caucasian Americans. A discussion of the role of genetics in MS can be found in the next section. When applied to a complex disorder such as MS, conclusions derived from epidemiologic data of this type must be interpreted cautiously because inapparent explanations may be present. For example, a higher-than-expected incidence of MS observed in South Vietnamese immigrants (a low-risk group) residing in France (a moderate-risk area) superficially suggest a modifying role of the environment on MS. However, this immigrant population was in fact racially mixed and contained substantial numbers of individuals with mixed French and Asian ancestry. Thus, the higher-than-expected MS incidence in these immigrants could have been due to either genetic or environmental factors. Neither factor can be ruled out. A similar argument could explain the incidence of MS in West Indian immigrants residing in Great Britain. On the other hand, the increased incidence of MS observed in Japanese-Americans compared to individuals residing in Japan is not easily explained by racial admixture and does support a role of the environment on MS risk. As in other autoimmune diseases, women are much more likely to get MS than men, suggesting that hormonal or genetic factors are involved. The ratio of women to men with MS is about 2:1. Among both sexes, the age of onset for ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MS ranges between 10 and 59 years, with the highest incidence occurring among individuals in their mid-20s to early 30s, depending on the population examined. Males tend to have a slightly later mean age of onset than females. This results, at least in part, from an increase in the percentage of males with the primary progressive variant. This form of MS has a later onset than other types and affects approximately 15 percent of patients. The ratio of males to females with primary progressive MS is approximately 1:1. Epidemiological studies have provided conflicting data as to whether an infectious agent (viral or bacterial) either causes or triggers MS. The occurrence of MS epidemics has suggested that an infectious agent might be at work. The two MS epidemics cited most often, one in the Faroe Islands and one in Iceland, were directly preceded by the influx of foreign troops during World War II. Both, however, are open to multiple interpretations. Coincident with the stationing of foreign soldiers, the population of the Faroe Islands received increased medical services and changed its diet. The Icelandic epidemic, on the other hand, began shortly after the arrival of that island's first neurologist. In both cases, the increased prevalence of MS might have resulted from an increased level of detection or a combination of other factors, such as nonspecific immune stimulation resulting from the introduction of a variety of infectious agents into previously unexposed populations. No infectious agent has been associated with either of these MS clusters. Another area of investigation has explored whether environmental factors contribute to the onset of MS or the probability of MS attacks. Some studies suggest that MS attacks are more likely to occur in the spring and fall than in the winter or summer. Such a finding, if true, suggests that a relationship exists between some viral infections and the risk of exacerbations. Many patients with MS are also at heightened risk for urinary tract, pulmonary, or skin infections, yet the relationship between these potentially preventable infections and the course of MS has never been adequately studied. Additional research in this area is needed. Perhaps the most clear-cut epidemiologic link to MS attacks is the effect of pregnancy and the postpartum period. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the risk for MS attacks, particularly during the third trimester. The postpartum period is, conversely, associated with a significant increase in risk. An immunosuppressive state in the pregnant mother is created by increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Th2 cells) which, presumably, dampen the autoimmune reaction that produces attacks of MS. The explanation for the increase in attack risk during the postpartum period is less clear but might involve immunostimulation by prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. The absence of supporting evidence does not prove that a virus is connected with the disease. Unrelated individuals (in the case of the adoptee and conjugal studies) may differ in their susceptibilities to infectious agents. Researchers have isolated a variety of viruses from individual MS patients, but to ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. date, no one virus has been isolated from all MS patients examined. It might, however, be the case either that MS is not one single disease or that there are multiple ways to trigger it. Researchers continue to look for causative infectious agents. (See section below on infectious causes of MS for further discussion.) The aggregation of MS in some geographic areas, ethnic populations, or families could be explained by a common environmental exposure, a shared genetic background, or a combination of both environmental and genetic susceptibility. It is likely that in MS, as in other complex disorders, both factors contribute. It is also possible that the relative contributions of environment versus genetics might vary in different situations, depending on the degree to which an individual is genetically susceptible and the specific environmental context. The role of genetic factors in MS is discussed in the next section. MS is not considered a genetic disease in the classic sense because it usually occurs sporadically. However, population and family studies are consistent with a principal pathogenic role for genetic risk factors in MS etiology. This genetic component is indicated primarily by the increased relative risk to siblings of affected individuals compared with the general population. Familial aggregation (Î»s) is measured by estimating the ratio of the prevalence (frequency) in siblings versus the population prevalence of the disease. A Î»s of 1 represents no familial clustering of the trait. For MS, the Î»s is estimated to be between 20 (0.02/0.001) and 40 (0.04/0.001). Half-sibling1 and adoption studies confirm that genetic, and not environmental, factors are responsible for familial aggregation. In addition, twin studies from different populations consistently indicate that a monozygotic twin of an MS patient is at higher risk (25 to 30 percent concordance) for MS than a dizygotic twin (2 to 5 percent), providing additional evidence for a significant but complex genetic etiology. Finally, the frequent occurrence of MS in some ethnic populations (particularly those of northern European origin) compared to others (African and Asian groups), irrespective of geographic location, also provides evidence for a complex genetic etiology. Overall, adoption and family studies suggest that being related to a person with MS is a greater risk factor than living with someone with MS. A simple genetic model for the inheritance of MS is unlikely to be valid. Such a single-gene hypothesis is at odds with concordance data in twin and family studies and with the observed nonlinear decrease in disease risk as the genetic distance from the relative with MS is increased. It is likely that susceptibility is determined by multiple independent genetic loci (polygenic inheritance), each with a relatively modest contribution to overall risk. It is also possible that there are different genetic causes of susceptibility to MS (genetic heterogeneity). Finally, the genes that contribute to MS susceptibility are likely to be normal, common variants (or alleles) of genes rather than obviously defective mutations. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Most individuals who carry such susceptibility genes would have no obvious deleterious consequences. For example, the DR2 gene (described below) is the most important genetic contributor to MS susceptibility identified to date. Approximately half of patients with MS have this gene, but so do 15 to 20 percent of healthy Caucasians. Thus, only approximately 1 in 250 people who have DR2 develop MS. The cumulative action of several susceptibility genes, each with weak effects and limited penetrance, is thought to underlie genetic susceptibility to MS. (Penetrance refers to the likelihood that a person carrying an allele will develop specific manifestations caused by that gene.) The effects of individual susceptibility genes may also be influenced by interactions with other genes and by specific environmental exposures. Locus heterogeneity is also likely, meaning that there are different susceptibility genes in different MS patients. The possibility that MS is a heterogeneous disease with different causes or pathological processes adds an additional level of complexity to the analysis. In addition to MS, similar issues are present in other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus that are genetically complex, and common research tools will be needed to decipher specific disease genes in these different conditions. The genetic region most clearly associated with MS susceptibility is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, or HLA [human leukocyte antigen] in humans) locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21) (). This association has been seen in different population studies that have relied primarily on sporadic patients. Formal genetic linkage to 6p has also been found in several recent whole-genome scans of multiple affected MS families. Many of the MHC genes are extraordinarily variable or polymorphic, reflecting the importance of genetic variation of these critical antigen-presenting molecules in the maintenance of a heterozygous advantage and the need to effectively present a diverse array of antigens if immune homeostasis is to be maintained. Immune homeostasis refers to the capacity of the immune system to respond appropriately to a diverse number of infectious pathogens and tumors without initiating unhealthy responses against self-constituents (auto- The major histocompatibility complex is a chromosomal region that contains more than 100 genes, many of which make proteins involved in the immune system. It is named for the role it plays in rejecting tissue transplants ( means tissue). In humans, this region resides on chromosome 6 and is called the human leukocyte antigen gene complex. The terminology is slightly confusing because ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MHC and HLA also refer to the proteins that some of these genes make. In this report, the term “MHC molecules” is used to indicate the proteins. The role of the immune system is to differentiate between self and non-self. This allows it to tell the difference between, for example, muscle tissue (self) and an invading virus (non-self) and to respond appropriately. To do this, the immune system relies on several different proteins that specifically bind antigens. This process is analogous to a lock and key. The “lock” is an antibody, a T-cell receptor, or an MHC molecule. The “key” is an antigen, which can be a carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, or protein—anything that binds specifically to a component of the immune system. This discussion focuses on T-cell receptors and MHC molecules. T-cell receptors sit on the surface of T cells and bind to antigens outside the cell. (In the case of T-cell receptors and MHC molecules, antigens are small protein fragments.) Binding to an antigen signals the T cell either to die, to do nothing, or to become active. The signal context, such as whether the antigen is self or non-self, determines which of these signals is relayed. However the T cell cannot bind the antigen alone. It needs the help of an MHC molecule. MHC molecules sit on the surface of other cells. The MHC molecule, like two outstretched arms, holds onto an antigen and presents it to a T-cell receptor. There are two major classes of MHC molecules. MHC I molecules, which are expressed on most cell types, present antigens to CD8+ T cells. MHC II molecules, which are expressed on special antigen presenting cells (APCs), present antigens to CD4+ T cells. In humans, there are three main class I molecules, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and three main class II molecules, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR. Each arm of the MHC molecule is made up of a separate protein. In the case of MHC I molecules, there is an Î±-chain (A, B, or C) that pairs with the protein b2microglobulin. An MHC II molecule is made up of an Î±-chain and a Î²-chain (for example, DP-Î± and DP-Î²), but the story becomes more complex. Each MHC molecule can bind many but not all of the thousands of antigens that confront the immune system. The immune system relies on diversity among the MHC proteins to help stack the odds in its favor. The gene for each MHC protein chain comes in different varieties, or alleles. One of the MHC Î²-chains has more than 150 alleles. Each of these alleles produces a slightly different protein. The proteins vary just enough that although they all function as MHC proteins, they can bind different antigens. Any one person will have two alleles, at most, for a particular MHC protein (there are two copies of each gene in human cells), but across a population of individuals, this variety becomes more important. For example, in Gambia, West Africa, 25 percent of HLA-B genes are the HLA-B53 allele, compared to less than 1 percent in Europe. HLA-B53 is very effective at presenting an antigen from the parasite that causes malaria to CD8+ T cells. Researchers hypothesize that because HLA-B53 can protect people from the most severe forms of malaria, it is more prevalent in Gambia. Having a particular MHC allele can also be a disadvantage, as researchers have shown in the case of HLA-DR2 and MS. (HLA-DR2 actually designates both a specific DR-a chain allele and a DR-b chain allele.) Scientists still do not understand how HLA-DR2 predisposes individuals to MS, but this might have to do with the MHC molecule's ability to present specific antigens (for example, a fragment of myelin basic protein) to T cells.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. immune responses). In Caucasian MS populations of northern European descent, the critical MS-associated genetic region is thought to reside near the class II locus and is comprised of a group of genes with specific polymorphisms (alleles) that tend to occur in certain fixed combinations, termed haplotypes. In molecular terms, the “DR2” haplotype is designated as HLA-DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602. DR molecules are comprised of alpha and beta chains (encoded by A and B genes, respectively), and the polymorphisms are predominantly present in the beta chain. Of the more than 100 beta-chain sequence variations identified in humans, only one (1501, also designated as DR2) is associated with MS. How can the DR2 association with MS be explained? The DR2 molecule itself may have a propensity to bind peptide antigens of myelin and stimulate disease-inducing T cells. DR2 is known to bind with high affinity to a region of MBP (spanning amino acids 89-98) thought to be “immunodominant” in humans. X-ray crystallography of the DR2-MBP peptide complex revealed that the DR2 molecule contains a distinctive hydrophobic pocket in its antigen-binding region, created by a unique alanine residue at the B71 position into which glutamic acid at position 93 of MBP is tightly bound, anchoring the MBP-DR2 complex. In a larger sense, the structure of the antigen-binding domain of DR2 molecules likely facilitates binding of many peptides containing certain amino acid residues, specifically aromatic amino acids. Glatiramer acetate (copolymer 1), a currently available disease-modifying therapy for MS, is a random synthetic protein composed of four amino acids, including tyrosine. The tyrosine residues of processed copolymer peptides likely also bind to the hydrophobic pocket of DR2, perhaps interfering with presentation of this key MBP peptide to encephalitogenic T cells. It is surprising that no data exist on the interaction of DR2 and the response to glatiramer acetate in MS. Another possibility is that the DR2 molecule does not itself predispose to MS but that another nearby gene (perhaps another HLA gene such as DQ) is responsible. DR2 is also linked to other diseases. Besides MS, narcolepsy is the disease most strongly linked to DR2. In various studies, the HLA region has been estimated to confer somewhere between 10 percent and half of the inheritability of MS. To date, no other genes of major effect have been identified in genomic screens. Several studies appear to demonstrate that a deletion mutation in the CCR5 chemokine receptor gene (a coreceptor for HIV) on chromosome 3 confers a later age of onset or a more benign course of MS; this mutation is also associated with protection against HIV. This is particularly important because the expression of CCR5, which is increased in MS brain lesions, is thought to attract inflammatory cells into tissue. Another locus on chromosome 19q22 near apolipoprotein C1 has been linked to MS in several genomic screens, but the estimated Î»s is only 1.4. A polymorphism near the gene for myelin basic protein on chromosome 21 was reported to be linked to MS in a family from Finland, but not in other populations. Some studies have suggested linkages or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. associations with the TCR beta-chain locus on chromosome 7, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14, and a region on chromosome 5, but others have not found similar linkages. The inability to confirm some genetic regions as containing MS susceptibility genes might reflect the small genetic contribution of these putative genes or genetic heterogeneity; alternatively, the original claim might have been spurious. As noted above, it is likely that an additive model consisting of multiple independent genes, each with small effects, explains the non-MHC genetic contributions to MS. It should be emphasized, however, that the identification of specific genes that have even very minor genetic effects on MS can have an enormous payoff, both in terms of helping to decipher the underlying biology of MS and in pointing to new potential treatments. For example, the genetic studies discussed earlier that identified a role for the CCR5 chemokine receptor suggest that therapies aimed at this receptor could be investigated in people with MS. Perhaps the strongest indication that MS is a heterogeneous disorder comes from HLA studies showing an absence of DR2 association in particular ethnic groups or perhaps in some clinical variants. In Japanese patients, one form of MS (“Western type”) is characterized by disseminated CNS involvement and is associated with the DR2 haplotype. In contrast, a more restricted form of MS in which optic nerve and/or spinal cord involvement predominate (“Asian MS”) is not associated with DR2. Lesions in the non-DR2-associated condition are frequently more severe and necrotizing than in the disseminated form. In one report, the Asian MS form was genetically associated with an HLA gene named DP (the DPB1*0501 allele). Another area of uncertainty is the strength of the association between primary progressive MS (PPMS) and DR2. A number of (relatively) small studies failed to show any association between PPMS and DR2, although a recent larger study from northern Ireland appeared to show an association; it is possible that PPMS represents more than one underlying disorder. Evidence for genetic heterogeneity is not limited to case-control HLA association studies but is also derived from formal linkage studies. Analysis of the MHC locus in an American multiple affected member MS data set confirmed the significant genetic linkage to this region (lod score of 4.60), and the specific association with the DR2 allele; however 25 percent of the families that were DR2 negative showed no linkage to the HLA region on 6p21. This indicated most likely the presence of locus heterogeneity in familial MS in Caucasians. A related *Lod scores are based on the ogarithm of the ds of linkage between two genes. A score of 3 or more is considered evidence of a genetic linkage between a known gene (or gene marker) and another unknown gene that underlies a trait (such as MS). That information thus indicates that the trait has a genetic basis and localizes the gene to a specific chromosomal region. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. observation in MS-prone Caucasian families is that the phenotypic expression of MS aggregates within families in some cases, suggesting that some clinical manifestations of MS are influenced by an individual's genetic background. The extent to which distinct clinical forms of MS are associated with different susceptibility genes, as may be the case in EAE (see discussion of animal models), is not known. Also unknown is whether specific genes interact with certain causative agents or triggers. Genetic studies have the potential to answer these questions, particularly when the information is analyzed in combination with epidemiologic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. There are several human and animal diseases of known etiology or pathogenesis that resemble either the clinical or the pathological features of MS (). Animal diseases that resemble MS are discussed under animal models. CNS demyelinating diseases include those mediated by immune responses, infection, and toxins, as well as inherited disorders. Infectious agents can induce direct injury of oligodendrocytes and their myelin membranes, as well as indirect injury via the immune system. A variety of toxins, such as diphtheria, lysolecithin, cuprizone, and ethidium bromide, have been associated with demyelinating lesions. Many of these toxins induce lysis of the oligodendrocyte, with demyelination as a secondary effect. In addition, nutritional deprivation can be associated with demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous system. Immune-Mediated and Virus-Induced CNS Demyelinating Diseases Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), also known as post vaccination encephalomyelitis, occurs as a consequence of vaccination with neural antigens. EAE, the most widely used animal model of MS, is the animal counterpart of this human disease. ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. The uniformity of lesions differs from the multi-age lesions found in even the most acute case of MS. Post vaccination immune-mediated damage can also affect the peripheral nervous system. Since there is no standard laboratory-based test to diagnose the human disorder, the most reliable descriptions of the clinical spectrum of the disease are derived from collections of cases in which epidemiologic and statistical studies support the association of a triggering stimulus and disease. Such criteria are best met by cases associated with immunization with CNS tissue containing vaccines, for example, original Pasteur rabies vaccine. This vaccine complication can occur at all ages. A clinical hallmark of the rabies vaccine-associated form of ADEM is its uniphasic course evolving over days to several weeks. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. CNS Demyelinating Diseases That Resemble MS ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. Multifocal CNS lesions can occur as a component of an array of systemic collagen vascular disorders including systemic lupus eryhemtosus and polyarteritis nodosa. The CNS manifestations may be the presenting feature. The peripheral nervous system is also frequently involved. PML is caused by the JC virus, which infects and destroys oligodendrocytes with minimal associated immune response. It typically occurs in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised individuals and is common in AIDS. The disease can feature a subacute progressive or relapsing clinical course. The imaging and pathologic features can be distinguished from classical MS. HTLV-1 (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) infection is sometimes associated with a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy, usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. These inherited disorders are characterized by specific gene defects that result in either inadequate formation or excess breakdown of myelin. There may be a prominent inflammatory response in the region of myelin breakdown, but this is considered to be secondary to tissue breakdown. To date, therapeutic attempts with immunomodulatory agents in the leukodystrophies, specifically, adrenoleukodystrophy, have been ineffective. Toxic optic neuropathy, subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) Outbreaks of toxic optic neuropathy and SMON have been described in Cuba and in Japan.11,12,99 Sporadic cases of toxic optic neuropathy likely account for the disorder tobacco-alcohol amblyopia. Conversely, one need consider whether deficiency syndromes could underlie development of demyelinating syndromes; deficiency of vitamin B12, a cofactor in myelin formation, has also been implicated.

ADEM, or postinfectious encephalomyelitis, has been implicated as a consequence of a wide array of viral infections, although for many, the epidemiologic data are not strong enough to support a causal link. Measles virus epidemics have, however, been convincingly linked to ADEM. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis (PIE) is thought to be autoimmune in nature rather than secondary to a direct virus injury for the following reasons: (1) encephalitis appears after the rash clears; (2) there is generally little or no evidence of infectious virus or viral genome in the CNS at the time of the demyelinating disease; and (3) there is evidence of increased reactivity against myelin antigens during the demyelinating disease. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis is generally uniphasic. Immune system disturbances, which are known to occur following measles virus infection, might underlie the immunopathological response of post-infectious encephalomyelitis. A new direction for studies of PIE involves the possibility of establishing a model for this disease in transgenic mice that express the CD46 measles virus receptor. Molecular cross-reactivity, or molecular mimicry, has been demonstrated between myelin antigens and an array of viruses. Homologous sequences from viruses have been used to induce EAE (for example, hepatitis virus antigens). The extent of T-cell receptor degeneracy (meaning that the same receptor can respond to a wide sequence of peptides) and T-cell receptor heterogeneity in humans suggests that a wide array of exogenous agents could induce such a disease mechanism. As in MS, the putative infectious trigger could be different in individual MS patients depending on their immunogenetic makeup and the status of their immune system at the time of infection. A remaining challenge in MS is to determine whether any infectious agents detected in the CNS of such cases also persist in the CNS without causing harm or whether they are responsible for generating a pathogenic immune response. ADEM cases are usually sporadic, and it is sometimes difficult to identify the initiating factor. Relapsing cases of ADEM have been described, especially in younger-age patients. For some cases, characteristic pathologic material has been available. Similarly, the EAE model can be manipulated to produce a relapsing chronic disorder by selecting animals with specific immunogenetic backgrounds and timing their immunizations so that the underlying systemic immune response is amplified or the blood-brain barrier is altered. Such variables could also determine the nature of the response of humans when they are exposed to potential disease-inducing antigens. JC virus, a member of the papovavirus family, is a common pathogen in humans, although the *JC refers to the initials of the individual from whom the virus was isolated in 1970. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. primary disease caused by this virus is not characterized. Common symptoms include hemiparesis, aphasia, focal seizures, and visual disturbances. JC virus is thought to reactivate in immunosuppressed hosts, especially individuals with AIDS, producing the opportunistic infection PML. The disease involves a progressive CNS syndrome with symptoms and signs that suggest white matter involvement. Demyelination is usually most prominent in the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. The histopathology is characterized by the presence of oligodendrocytes with intranuclear inclusion bodies filled with papovavirus infectious particles, indicating that this disease involves a direct, lytic infection of the oligodendrocyte; that is, the oligodendrocyte is broken apart after being infected with the virus. Enlarged astrocytes are also seen, suggesting that the JC virus can transform these cells. Demyelination is a result of the direct oligodendrocyte infection by JC virus. Thus, in PML the immune response is considered to be protective rather than pathogenic. This retrovirus is common in the tropics as well as Japan, and is usually associated with asymptomatic disease. HTLV-1 infection is infrequently associated with a T-cell leukemia or lymphoma or a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. The CSF generally shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated IgG and oligoclonal IgG bands directed against HTLV-1. Necrotizing lesions with inflammation in the white matter are present in the spinal cord. HAM/TSP can resemble MS clinically. In fact, a case of HAM/TSP might be diagnosed as MS if it were not for the presence of HTLV-1 antibody and the observation that the HTLV-1 genome can be detected in the CNS. The pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. There are numerous CD8+ T cells that recognize the virus, suggesting that this immune response might foster white matter disease. Infected glial cells are a possible source of inflammatory pathogenic cytokines and might also be the target for these cytolytic T cells. In addition, there is some evidence that molecular mimicry plays a role in disease pathogenesis. Host genetic factors, for example, HLA type, might also be important in determining susceptibility to HAM/TSP after infection. It has not been proven that MS is caused by an infectious agent, but various data, including the inflammatory nature of the disease, epidemiological studies, and a heightened immune response against several pathogens, suggest an infectious etiology (reviewed in 1998 by Kastrukoff et al.). Demyelinating diseases that clinically and pathologically resemble MS can be caused by viral agents or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Koch’s Postulate on Causation of Disease by a Pathogen The pathogen is always present in pathologically affected tissue. It would be rare to consistently isolate a pathogen from all cases of the disease that it causes because of shortcomings in isolation procedures. The pathogen is not present in tissues from controls. Pathogens can have a variety of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic disease to varied diseases. Host restriction may prevent experimental transmission. immunopathological responses (). Infectious agents might be able to cause demyelination either directly, as a result of oligodendrocyte lysis, or indirectly, by means of an immunopathological response. Demyelination mediated by an immunopathological response can occur by a number of mechanisms. For example, the infectious agent can induce a pathogenic cross-reactive immune response (molecular mimicry), or the release of myelin antigens can stimulate an immune response that is directed against white matter antigens and becomes more broad over time (epitope spreading). (See for a summary of autoimmunity and disease.) There are clear limitations to using classical criteria to implicate a pathogen isolated in MS as a causal agent for the disease, as shown in . These issues make it especially difficult to establish the significance of a positive isolation from tissues of a patient with MS. However, all cases in which an infectious agent causes a disease will clearly not fit standard criteria, and individualization of the requirements is sometimes necessary. Because of these limitations, it is prudent to consider criteria that may be more appropriate and realistic. One could consider the following additional guidelines in analyzing disease causation by a pathogen: consistent transmission or isolation of the pathogen; cure or effective treatment of the disease following elimination of the pathogen; absence of the disease in geographic regions where the pathogen is not present. It may also be appropriate to consider particular molecular signatures related either to the genes of the pathogen or to the transcription expression profile associated with a particular pathogen. Many pathogens have been implicated over the years as etiological agents in MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Agents Isolated or Implicated in the Etiology of MS Some of these claims have been doubted for the following reasons: contamination (for example, spirochete), artifacts of isolation methods (for example, simian cytomegalovirus), and normal flora (for example, herpes simplex-1 [HSV-1]). Although some of these agents are clearly capable of inducing a CNS demyelinating syndrome that resembles MS, it remains uncertain whether particular cases in which a pathogen is isolated represent a rare MS-like case or whether the pathogen may actually be a common cause of MS. There are various possible explanations of why so many pathogens have been isolated in MS but no single pathogen has been consistently observed. First, there might be a variety of pathogens that can independently cause MS (i.e., the disease is multifactorial), perhaps inducing heterogeneous forms of the disease. Second, MS might not be an infectious disease. The isolations of different pathogens might all be artifactual or related to rare events associated with a particular pathogen. Third, the relationship of the pathogen to MS might be a relatively minor one, possibly through interactions with genetic factors. Finally, the true pathogen might not yet have been identified. Thus far, there is inadequate evidence to either accept or reject suggestions that any particular pathogen is causally related to MS. A variety of members of the herpes group of viruses (for example, simian cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV-1, and human herpesvirus-6 [HHV-6]) have been implicated in the etiology of MS. Members of this group of viruses remain attractive candidates as etiologic agents in MS since they are common pathogens that are known to persist and reactivate from a latent stage (and therefore could trigger the attacks and remissions seen in MS) and in some cases can induce focal demyelination in animals (see discussion of animal models of virus-induced demyelination). The most recent herpesvirus candidate to generate attention is HHV-6. HHV-6, a common pathogen, is the cause of the childhood disease, roseola (exanthem subitem). This virus is associated with febrile seizures in children, can invade the CNS, and can persist in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the spinal fluid. In some cases, HHV-6 induces an MS-like disease, which raises the issue ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. of its broader involvement in MS. Some recent studies of HHV-6 have found no or rare evidence of HHV-6 genome in MS CSF (as well as little, if any, evidence of genome from several other members of the herpesvirus group). One recent study reported that there was an increased incidence of HHV-6 (as well as HSV and varicella-zoster virus) genome in CNS tissue from MS cases compared to tissues from controls; however, the differences were not statistically significant (see Sanders). Some investigators have argued that the cell type that is infected by HHV-6 differs in MS CNS compared to controls and, therefore, that the virus plays a role in the pathogenesis of MS. The interpretation of HHV-6 studies may be complicated because HHV-6 infection and the localization of the virus may be altered secondary to inflammation associated with MS or to immunosuppressive treatment of MS patients; therefore, a change in localization of HHV-6 in MS CNS compared to control CNS may be unrelated to any pathogenic role of HHV-6 in MS. Although HHV-6 may not induce the white matter lesions of MS, it remains a possibility that HHV-6 contributes to the demyelination seen in some cases of MS. The recent identification of CD46 as a cellular receptor for HHV-6 and the availability of transgenic mice that carry CD46 provide an opportunity to develop an experimental model of HHV-6-induced CNS disease pathogenesis. A recent study found that CSF from MS patients was culture-positive for and PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-positive for this agent more commonly than CSF from patients with other neurological disease. In addition, there was evidence of increased antibody against chlamydia in MS CSF, as well as evidence that MS CSF oligoclonal IgG bands were absorbed by chlamydia antigens. This work clearly needs confirmation. Members of the public awaiting cures for specific diseases often express impatience with the fact that most research on the biological basis of disease is based on animal studies, complaining that the time and money spent on animal studies would be better invested in clinical trials. However, animal studies are not simply interchangeable with clinical studies. Ultimately, every biologically active substance exerts its effects at the cellular and molecular levels, and the evidence has shown that this is remarkably consistent among mammals, even those as different in body and mind as rats and humans. Thus, animals can serve as models for basic biological processes in humans and can provide information about how drugs work that would not be obtainable in clinical studies. Animal models in which both spontaneous and induced disease occur have contributed greatly to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases, and in the future, they will be increasingly used to aid in the assessment of various treatment modalities. A variety of animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis and experimental treatment of diseases that share features with MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Immunization of mice, rats, or primates with myelin proteins (MBP, MOG, PLP) or other autoantigens (PLP). CREAE is a chronic, relapsing type of EAE In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis Genetic engineering is used to produce animals that express particular human genes hypothesized to be involved in MS A variety of viruses can induce CNS demyelination, including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and herpes simplex virus Most of our present knowledge of myelin-specific autoimmunity and, more generally, of immune reactivity within the CNS emanates from experimental animal models. It should, however, be noted that there is a diversity of distinct models, defined by the animal species, the target autoantigen, and the mode of induction. Three basic types of animal models have been developed to understand the disease mechanisms underlying MS: EAE, virus-induced demyelination, and genetically modified animals. EAE models have served, in many respects, as the prototype for current thinking on the pathogenesis of MS. This paralytic disease is characterized by the presence of inflammation and demyelination in the CNS. It is an autoimmune syndrome induced in different susceptible strains and species, generally by intradermal immunization with myelin antigens (natural or synthetic) or by adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes reactive against myelin proteins. The antigens capable of inducing EAE vary depending upon the strain and species of animal, the adjuvants employed, and perhaps also the history of environmental exposures experienced by the animal. EAE should be considered not as a single model but rather as a heterogeneous family of related disorders. Each of the EAE variants reflects different aspects of human MS, and conversely, there is no one EAE model that represents the entire complexity of MS (). As is the case in MS, susceptibilities to EAE are determined as complex genetic traits. In both disorders, the most evident susceptibility locus resides within the HLA locus. Also in both disorders, locus heterogeneity is extensive (i.e., different loci and genes). Different genes can act at specific stages of the ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Comparison Between Multiple Sclerosis and EAE SOURCE: Larry Steinman, presentation to the committee, November 17, 1999. EAE or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) disease process, influencing severity, recovery, susceptibility to relapse, remyelination, and other elements of the phenotype. Knowledge of the extensive heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and modifier genes in these MS models should provide targets for study in human MS. Even within genetically identical littermates, the immune response following immunization with whole myelin is heterogeneous, with different antigenic targets dominating in different individuals. When groups of genetically identical animals are housed in different facilities, the resulting clinical syndromes can be markedly different, presumably reflecting the effects of different individual microenvironments. Studies of EAE established that the pathogenic agents of the disease are CD4+ T cells, which produce cytokines of the proinflammatory Th1 pattern (IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±, but no IL-4) upon stimulation. The precursors of these T cells are contained within the normal immune repertoire, but they unfold their pathogenic potential only on activation, by either specific antigens, microbial superantigens, or mitogens. In EAE induced in the Lewis rat strain (and H-2 mice) by immunization ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. with MBP, the encephalitogenic T cells recognize almost exclusively single, circumscript epitope segments of the MBP in the molecular context of MHC class II (clonal dominance). This dominance can be gradually lost over time, a phenomenon referred to as determinant spreading. Furthermore, in these models, the T-cell receptor for most autoreactive T cells is based on a highly simplified repertoire of structural genes, such as the VÎ²8.2 gene for the TCR Î²-chain. These unusual features of antigen recognition have raised hopes with regard to immunospecific therapies. Unfortunately, however, they seem to be limited to only a few experimental models. Most EAE models, as well as the human myelin-specific T cells, do not show either striking epitope dominance or T-cell receptor biases. To date, attempts to identify possible functions of CNS-specific T-cell classes distinct from CD4+ T cells have not led to consistent pictures. Evidence from T-cell transfer models and TCR transgenic mice suggests that CD8+ T cells might help control and limit an ongoing CD4+ dependent EAE process. Most acute EAE models show profuse inflammatory CNS reactions with a conspicuous absence of large-scale demyelination, implying that MS-like demyelination is not caused directly by myelin-specific T cells but must be brought about by other mechanisms. B cells are the best-characterized effectors of this function. Large, confluent inflammatory demyelinated lesions can be produced in rats by transferring encephalitogenic T cells along with a monoclonal antibody against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. The T cells cause inflammation, thereby opening the blood-brain barrier to the autoantibodies, which enter the CNS where they bind to myelin and destroy it via complement- or phagocyte-dependent mechanisms. “Simple” immunization of rodents with MOG can also produce the same result. In addition to producing humoral autoantibodies, brain-specific B cells target and present myelin antigens to specific T cells. During this presentation process, the B cells may stimulate the activation of specific T cells, with a possible tendency to shift them from Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 cytokine (anti-inflammatory) profiles. The roles of autoreactive B cells in the pathogenesis of EAE are incompletely understood, mostly because of technical shortcomings. In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen-specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis. The germline repertoire of immunoglobulin genes in these mice has been replaced by the mature, rearranged gene encoding a MOG-specific autoantibody. Most, if not all, of the B cells in these mice express immunoglobulin receptors that are autoreactive to MOG. The mice spontaneously produce high titers of anti-MOG autoantibodies in their blood. There is no natural, spontaneous animal model resembling MS. The immunological conditions leading to relapses ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and remissions of inflammatory demyelinating disease over time are most commonly examined in chronic relapsing versions of EAE. These episodic courses depend on the modes of immunization as well as on genetic factors innate to the host animals. Although the conditions that trigger relapses in CREAE models are not yet well understood, models are expected to provide clues to these essential aspects of MS, especially when refined by the use of suitable transgenic animals. It has recently been shown that a chronic relapsing EAE in a primate, the common marmoset, is more like MS than other EAE models. This form of EAE, induced in marmosets by immunization with MOG, produces lesions that are almost indistinguishable from fresh, acute human MS plaques. In both the human disease and this animal model, a zone of myelin destruction is seen at the margins of lesions; within the lesions, myelin sheaths are replaced by vesiculated membranous elements. MOG-specific antibodies, thought to be related to the deposition of antigen-specific antibody, are present over the vesiculated myelin. In both settings, oligodendrocytes were spared, and there was some evidence of myelin repair. Axonal pathology, however, was more conspicuous in MS cases than in this animal model. It has been suggested that processes mediated by T-cells initiate the demyelinating lesions and that other effector mechanisms are the principal offenders in damaging the myelin sheath. Mechanisms that initiate the lesion might be immunologically distinct from those that propagate disease. Antibodies might play an important role in these processes. The marmoset EAE model has also confirmed the encephalitogenic potential of autoreactive T-cell clones, whose precursors are preformed in the healthy immune repertoire. At the same time, however, these experiments also show that all T-cell clones are not equally autoaggressive. Experimental animal models of MS are based almost exclusively on the use of rodents, mostly rats and mice. Unfortunately, rodent and human immune systems differ to such a large degree that not all observations made in rodent EAE can be directly translated to human MS. An important disadvantage of animal models is that they do not necessarily mirror the cellular or molecular pathology of MS. Some types of EAE, for example, produce brisk demyelination, whereas others produce little demyelination. Which is the best model? Since these features of MS are not yet fully understood, it is dificult to know how faithfully any given animal model of MS illustrates the human disease. In addition, these models are not very tractable for studies on the electrophysiology and biophysics of neuronal function, a serious limitation in a disease such as MS in which symptoms and signs arise from impaired nerve function. Powerful research methods are now available for studying the physiology and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. biophysics of normal or injured nerve cells. These methods permit neuroscientists to study electrical signaling in both normal and injured neurons, but they require that these nerve cells, with reproducible abnormalities, be reproducibly located, within fractions of a millimeter, in specific parts of the nervous system so that they can be studied. In MS and in most currently available animal models, the pathology is patchy, and the location of demyelinated and injured neurons varies from case to case. For the electrophysiologist who studies neuronal signaling by precisely placing tiny microelectrodes within neurons, studying the physiology of demyelinated or otherwise injured neurons when their location varies from animal to animal is, indeed, a challenge. A model in which focal demyelination, or axonal injury, can be produced at specific locations that are consistent from animal to animal would be a great improvement. Viruses can cause demyelination in several ways, the most straightforward of which is for viruses to lyse, or break open, oligodendrocytes, the myelinproducing cells. In some cases, however, the immune system is also involved. The mechanism by which virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination is carried out is not clear, but roles for molecular mimicry, bystander damage, and superantigen activation of T cells have all been proposed (see ). The best developed models of virus-induced demyelination are those caused by certain strains of TMEV and the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (reviewed in Kastrukoff et al.). Probably the most fruitful of the remaining models are those of semliki forest virus (SFV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (). The advantages of SFV are its small, simple genome and ease of mutagenesis. Although the HSV genome is large and complex, the wealth of molecular information related to this virus and the ability to manipulate the viral genome make it an attractive model system, as well. The DA strain of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that as in MS, the immune system fosters demyelination. The inflammatory, demyelinating, and multifocal lesions of TMEV infection are mediated at least in part by T cells directed against viral antigens. The inflammatory response directly contributes to tissue damage in this MS-like model, since susceptibility is determined in part by immune response genes and immunosuppression abrogates demyelination. One to two weeks after inoculation with the DA virus, there is a brisk inflammatory response in the brain with high levels of virus. This is generally a subclinical process since the mouse usually appears normal. After three weeks, the brain pathology virtually disappears, but mice develop a progressive spastic para- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Animal Viruses That Induce Demyelination The TO subgroup strains of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that the immune system fosters the white matter disease. The many different strains of MHV lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis, as well respiratory CNS disorders. The presence and extent of demyelination depend on the viral genotype, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as the strain, age, and immune status of the infected mouse. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. Experimental infection of mice and rats with specific strains of SFV leads to demyelination; other strains induce an encephalomyelitis. Demyelination depends on the specific strain of virus, the mouse strain, and the immune status of the host. Virus persists in the central nervous system. The role of the immune system in the demyelinating disease remains unclear. Many strains of HSV produce a diffuse encephalitis in mice, but certain virus strains induce an inflammatory demyelinating disease in particular strains. Other strains of mice have multifocal demyelination that can relapse or persist in varied areas of the brain. The role of the immune system in this model is unclear but appears to contribute to the destruction of CNS tissue. Maedi visna is found only in sheep. There is no experimental rodent model of maedi visna infection, and therefore one needs to investigate sheep. The absence of markers for the sheep's immune system and of genetically modified sheep with knockouts of different arms of the immune system are clear limitations of the maedi visna model. The pathology of disease varies from an encephalomyelitis to a pure inflammatory demyelination that resembles MS.37 Virus persists during the disease with a restricted expression in microglial cells. It remains unclear whether demyelination is a result of direct viral lysis or is mediated by the immune response. CDV produces a variety of CNS diseases in dogs, including acute and chronic encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Virus persists in the chronic disease and appears to be present in oligodendrocytes in some cases. Work with this model has been limited since dogs are required as the host. The pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease remains unclear. paresis associated with an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord. Although the titers of DA virus decrease over the first few weeks, virus persists in the central nervous system for the life of the mouse. The persistent virus is said to have a restricted, or incomplete, expression. In other words, viral genome is present, but the levels of infectious virus are low, with relatively little viral capsid ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. protein produced. (The capsid is the protein shell surrounding the viral DNA or RNA and is generally required for viral infectivity.) Advantages of the TMEV model include the simplicity of its genome, the detailed structural information about the virus, the ease with which it can be genetically manipulated, and finally, the extensive knowledge about the genes and immune system of mice, the natural host of TMEV (see .). Despite all that is known about TMEV and despite the ease in manipulating this simple virus, the pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease is not yet fully understood. It is clear that viral persistence in the oligodendrocytes and microglia is critical to the development of TMEV-induced demyelination; that is, an ongoing virus infection is always associated with the white matter disease. It is also clear that the immune system contributes to the late demyelinating disease, but exactly how remains poorly understood. Part of the difficulty in dissecting the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of TMEV (as well as some of the other animal models of virus-induced demyelination) is that it changes over time. Early after infection, the immune system controls the virus infection, but later in Advantages of the TMEV Model of Virus-Induced Demyelination The following features of TMEV make it an attractive model for studies of virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination: with only four structural proteins in the infectious particle. The genome is only approximately 8,100 nucleotides in length. Three strains are completely sequenced. The crystallographic structure of three strains of the virus has been solved, so that the location of every amino acid in the infectious particle is known. The B-cell epitopes that are the targets for neutralizing antibody have been identified and located on the infectious particle. Some of the epitopes on the virus that trigger proliferation of immune CD4+ T cells and some that act as targets for an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response are also known. Some components of the receptor for the virus have been identified. Infectious clones of the virus are available so mutations can be quickly engineered into any region of the genome. There is extensive knowledge about mouse genetics and immunology. The mouse, which is the natural and experimental host of TMEV, provides a special benefit in studies of the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease because so much is known about mouse genetics and the immune system. In addition, many genetically engineered mice are available, including those in which specific genes for different components of the immune system have been “knocked out.” ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. the disease, it contributes to the demyelination. In addition, during the disease there appears to be a critical “balance” of the immune response that is necessary for the induction of demyelination: an inadequate immune response early in the disease can lead to the death of the mouse within the first couple of weeks and before the appearance of demyelination, while a very forceful immune response early can lead to clearance of the virus so that no virus persists and white matter disease fails to develop. In other words, viral persistence and demyelination occur only in association with a certain level of the antiviral immune response. CD4+, as well as CD8+, T cells might be mediators of the late demyelinating disease. DA virus infection induces demyelination in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell knockout mice, suggesting that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediate the late demyelinating disease. The targets for these immunopathogenic CD4+ and the CD8+ T cells are unknown. There is some evidence for epitope spreading, in which an increasing number of myelin antigenic epitopes become the target for a CD4+ T-cell response. However, epitope spreading appears to begin after demyelination has become established, so it is unclear how important this mechanism of immunopathology is to DA-induced demyelination, especially early in the white matter disease. Mouse strains that are resistant to DA-induced demyelinating disease mount an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response and clear the virus. Mouse strains that are susceptible to the late disease do not mount this response, presumably allowing for virus persistence. L*, a small protein synthesized by demyelinating strains of TMEV via alternative translation, is critical for TMEV persistence and demyelination. L* inhibits the antivirus cytolytic T-cell response in susceptible mouse strains through an, as yet, unknown mechanism. Certain cells, for example, oligodendrocytes, may have cell-specific RNA-binding proteins that bind to the viral genome (as well as some nonviral messenger RNAs) and regulate whether L* or the viral capsid proteins are synthesized. The more L* that is synthesized, the more the expression of the virus is restricted. TMEV induces apoptosis in certain cells, including neurons and macrophages. The relationship between apoptosis and DA-induced demyelination remains an open question. There are many different strains of mouse hepatitis virus that lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis as well as respiratory and CNS disorders. JHM, S, and A59 strains of MHV induce demyelination. The extent of demyelination depends on the virus, including its geno-type, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as on the condition of the infected mouse, including its strain, age, and immune status. Intracerebral inoculation of the JHM strain into weanling mice leads to demyelination in the mice that survive encephalitis. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. At present, there are some notable limitations to MHV pathogenesis studies. MHV has a remarkably large viral genome (32 kb), making this a complex ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. pathogen. A system for efficient and rapid mutagenesis has not yet been perfected, and therefore manipulation of the viral genome is not straightforward. Investigators initially thought that demyelination occurred as a result of viral lysis of oligodendrocytes independently of the immune system. More recent studies, however, suggested that it does contribute to the demyelination (reviewed in 1996 by Houtman et al.). For example, investigators found that C57BL/6 mice that are immunosuppressed by gamma irradiation before being exposed to the JHM virus develop less severe demyelination. Adoptive transfer of JHM virus-infected splenic T cells to the infected irradiated mice leads to the development of significant demyelination. Other studies in rats showed that transfer of T cells from rats that have JHM virus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis leads to the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-like lesions. Studies in CD4+ and CD8+ knockout mice demonstrated that both T-cell types are needed for clearance of the virus; however, CD4+ T cells contribute to central nervous system inflammation and demyelination. A suggestion of the latter study was that the CD4+ T cells influenced the expression of cytokines, specifically the RANTES cytokine, and led to macrophage entry into the CNS; treatment of the infected mice with anti-RANTES antibody resulted in a decrease in macrophage infiltration and demyelination. These studies and conclusions require confirmation. The committee notes that the following animal models of virus-induced demyelinating disease are particularly likely to yield clues to the pathogenesis of MS: The HAM/TSP syndrome resembles MS. Because the principles relevant to this human disease might be similar to those in MS, investigating the pathogenesis of this disease could reveal insights into MS pathogenesis. The development of a widely available animal model for HAM/TSP is a high priority. PIE is of special interest since recurrences following this acute inflammatory white matter disease are so similar to MS attacks that the two diseases are indistinguishable, indicating a close relationship between PIE and MS. The availability of transgenic mice that carry a receptor for measles virus might provide an experimental model for the study of PIE. The pathological lesions of TMEV are similar to MS plaques; therefore, continuing delineation of the mechanism by which the immune system contributes to the virus-induced demyelination might lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Research on the MHV-induced demyelination model is presently limited by difficulties with site-directed mutagenesis methods. A high priority for research with this virus should be the generation of an infectious MHV cDNA clone and a refinement of mutagenesis techniques. Molecular genetic manipulation has become one of the most important tools for evaluating gene function in living organisms. These tools of molecular biology have extended the reach of researchers to a new level of understanding of neurodegeneration mechanisms. The development of animal models for neurodegenerative disorders by means of genetic engineering has revolutionized experimental neurology. The identification and cloning of genes involved in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotropic lateral sclerosis provided the keys to develop mice that overexpress the human genes involved in these diseases (reviewed in 1999 by Brusa). The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is genetically susceptible to diabetes, and transgenic NOD mice have been developed to allow examination of the role of possible autoantigens in the development of diabetes, which like MS involves an inflammatory autoimmune pathology. The NOD mouse has also identified candidate molecules and processes that have influenced research in EAE and MS. Mutant mice have provided insights into all aspects of biology for generations, but only in the last two decades has it been possible to modify the expression of selected genes, an essential breakthrough for analyzing the role of specific genes in complex processes and diseases such as MS. In addition, identification of the genes that are activated or inactivated in both pathological and repair processes in the CNS will likely reveal new and unexpected targets for uniquely selective disease-modifying therapies in MS. “Reverse genetics” and “forward genetics” offer contrasting approaches to the analysis of gene function. Forward genetics is an approach to identify genes that are not already implicated in a particular disease or process. Reverse genetics is an approach to identify the role of genes whose involvement in the disease or process being studied is already implicated. In forward genetics, large numbers of mice are mutagenized (using techniques that mutagenize genes at random); their resulting phenotypes are analyzed to select mutants that exhibit spontaneous MS. The mutated genes in the selected mutants are then positionally cloned and identified. The homologous human clones can also be identified, a task that is becoming vastly simpler as the human genome project nears completion. The advantage of this approach is that the screen is not biased in any way and can reveal genes beyond those already known to be involved in MS. Another advantage of forward genetics is that once a gene is identified in a disease process, one can quickly do a screen for suppressors and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. enhancers of the phenotype. This will yield the entire biochemical pathway (as opposed to just one step) involved in disease pathogenesis. One limitation to the forward genetics approach is that only a small percentage of the mutated genes will result in a phenotype relevant to MS. Consequently, large numbers of mutants have to be screened, which is generally expensive, time-consuming, and labor intensive. Yet the rewards—especially for complex diseases and processes that have resisted traditional approaches—are unparalleled. In reverse genetics, mutant strains of mice that either overexpress or lack specific genes are generated through a variety of techniques. The classic approach to creating transgenic mice is to inject a foreign gene (“transgene”) into a fertilized egg, thereby inducing overexpression of the transgene. The egg bearing the transgene is implanted into a host mother. Progeny bearing DNA encoding the transgene are screened, as are the corresponding levels of RNA and protein. This transgene is randomly incorporated into a mouse chromosome and ultimately leads to production of the protein of interest. This approach has been used to transfer human genes (such as those for T-cell receptor, HLA DR2, and CD4) into mice to see if they develop spontaneous MS. One limitation of “knockin” mice is that genes can be inserted in uneven copy numbers in “replicate” animals or might be integrated into disparate sites in the genome. Gene expression can also be altered through knockout experiments. Knockout mice, or null mutants, are created using embryonic stem cells and homologous recombination to produce a cell line in which a certain gene has been removed, or ablated. When transferred into an early mouse embryo, these cells can participate in the generation of all cell lineages including germ cells, thereby transmitting their genotype to the next generation. Alternatively, embryonic stem cells can be used to create so-called knock-in mice by inserting a gene into a particular locus. The transgenic gene-targeting approaches described above all rely on irreversible changes to the genome that are present from the onset of development throughout an animal's life. The function of the gene must be deduced from the phenotype of animals that have been deficient for the product of the disrupted gene throughout development. Yet, many genes play different roles at different stages of development and in different tissues. This presents serious drawbacks (reviewed in 1998 by Gingrich and Roder and in 1999 by Muller). First, an animal with a gene alteration that lethally disrupts development obviously cannot be studied as an adult—even though the gene might play another critical role, for example, in neural repair. This is particularly relevant to MS because many of the genes that regulate embryonic neural development also regulate neural repair in adults. Another limitation of transgenic models is that changes in the regulation of other genes could yield misleading phenotypes, in part because of differences between effects of the gene at different developmental stages, gene redundancy (other genes might also play the role of the missing gene), or adaptive mecha- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nisms that compensate for the missing gene. Even apparently unaltered phenotypes would thus not prove that the gene was not involved in the disease or process being studied. Another limitation of this approach is that in physiological responses, gene products tend to be produced in waves, whereas in transgenics, expression is usually “on” from the time of development. Alternative approaches in which one gene, or parts of it, can be inactivated or activated in specific tissues or at specific times (“conditional” and “inducible” mutants) have recently been developed in this rapidly expanding array of genealtering techniques (reviewed in Brusa, 1999; Gingrich and Roder, 1998; and van der Neut, 1997). This second generation of transgenic technology derives from the possibility of modulating the suppression of a transgene with external stimuli, by using a “biological switch” that can turn the foreign gene on and off. Gene expression patterns in the nervous system are highly regionalized. For example, the enzymes involved in producing neurotransmitters and their receptors differ from one subpopulation of neurons to another. Other proteins are more widespread, such as the intermediate filament proteins NF (neurofilament) or GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), or are ubiquitous, such as N-CAMs (neural cell adhesion molecules) and integrins. Thus, it would be particularly advantageous to develop tissue-specific mutants for MS research. The development of inducible systems will become an important tool in the many diverse aspects of research on the disease mechanisms and possibilities for repair in MS, including the potential administration of gene therapy. Transgenic overexpression of cytokines or gene targets of cytokines in the CNS offers a relatively non-intrusive mechanism to assess the role of individual cytokines in CNS development, function, and response to insult. A common technique for assessing the effects of a particular cytokine in EAE is to induce its expression directly in the CNS. This allows researchers to ask whether expression of the cytokine induces CNS pathology similar to that seen in MS. Directed expression of transgenes in the CNS relies on promoters that normally control the expression of CNS-specific genes. This includes the GFAP gene promoter, which drives expression in astrocytes, as well as the neurofilament promoter (neurons), and the myelin basic protein promoter (oligodendrocytes). To date, no one has isolated a microglial-specific promoter. Only MBP promoters have been used to overexpress gamma-interferon in the CNS. Phenotypes of transgenic mice range from a lethal, “jimpy”-like hypomyelinating mouse, through progressive demyelinating disease, to mice with no outward phenotype that nevertheless showed progression from EAE to a *A point mutation in the gene coding for myelin proteolipid protein causes male offspring of jimpy mice to have little or no myelination. Affected mice develop severe tremors and die prematurely at approximately 30 days. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. chronic demyelinating disease in contrast to control mice that recovered from EAE-induced demyelination. It is of interest that the same laboratory observed both extremes using the same constructs. This might be because the transgenes were unevenly integrated at different loci, since levels of expression did not obviously correlate with phenotype in one case. Asymptomatic transgenic mice did, however, show enhanced glial responses to CNS injury, and exacerbated ischemic infarction (Lambertsen et al., unpublished). These asymptomatic mice presumably reflect sub-threshold levels of cytokine. Nevertheless, crossing an asymptomatic MBP promoter-driven gamma-interferon transgenic mouse with MBP or MHC class I mice produced a more extreme jimpy phenotype. This might provide a clue to cytotoxic effects of beta-interferon-Î³ on oligodendrocytes, being perhaps dependent on local interferon-Î³ titers becoming sufficiently high to stimulate MHC I induction. It is not known whether similar mechanisms account for oligodendrocyte pathology in TNF-Î± and interferon-Î± transgenic mice. The IL-3 and IL-12 transgenic mice provide a useful counterpart, there being no obvious suggestion of a direct effect on oligodendrocytes., These mice illustrate the potential for direct macrophage and microglial attack on oligodendrocytes, which might occur in TNF-Î± transgenic mice. It is not clear from any of these experiments whether activation of immune cells took place within the CNS or following cytokine exit to the periphery. A systemic effect must account for the fact that overexpression of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 protected animals from EAE in two separate preparations. The fact that IL-4 transgenic mice did not show similar resistance might reflect insufficient expression within the CNS or strain background differences, given that IL-4 knockout exacerbated disease in another study. Most recently, a transgenic mouse has been “constructed” that expresses T-cell receptor genes from a human MBP-specific T-cell clone, along with relevant human MHC class II determinants and MBP. Under certain conditions, this “humanized” mouse developed spontaneous EAE that indeed showed inflammation with some demyelination. In recent years, there have been many advances in the use of transgenes (including gene knockouts), as well as even more sophisticated models that make use of tissue-specific and time-dependent regulators. These models should facilitate the development of rational therapies and the transfer of knowledge from animal models to the prevention and treatment of human disease. However, although temporally regulated targeting controlled by the administration of an environmental inducer has become feasible with high efficiency for some organs, it remains to be further improved for other tissues, particularly the brain. New generations of inducible promoters will more faithfully mimic the in vivo kinetics and dynamics of cytokine production. Knock-in mice, in which ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling disease of the nervous system, affecting about 1 million people worldwide. Even though it has been known for over a hundred years, no cause or cure has yet been discovered—but now there is hope. New therapies have been shown to slow the disease progress in some patients, and the pace of discoveries about the cellular machinery of the brain and spinal cord has accelerated. This book presents a comprehensive overview of multiple sclerosis today, as researchers seek to understand its processes, develop therapies that will slow or halt the disease and perhaps repair damage, offer relief for specific symptoms, and improve the abilities of MS patients to function in their daily lives. The panel reviews existing knowledge and identifies key research questions, focusing on: Research strategies that have the greatest potential to understand the biological mechanisms of recovery and to translate findings into specific strategies for therapy.

Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? Take medicines after your first attack of multiple sclerosis or as soon as you are diagnosed. Don't take medicines now. Wait to see how the disease progresses. Your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when multiple sclerosis (MS) is first diagnosed. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start taking MS medicines. Instead of medicines, you can try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and shots to help you manage your symptoms. It's hard to know the course that your MS will take. Doctors can't know for sure if your MS will get worse. A small number of people with MS have only mild disease and do well without treatment. But many get worse over time. Medicines can reduce the severity of attacks of and how often you have them. They may also reduce or delay disability. But they don't work for everyone. And there is no way to predict if they will work for you. These medicines have side effects that can range from flu-like symptoms to headaches, chest pain, flushing, infections, and allergic reactions to the injection. Some of these medicines can damage your liver or heart. These medicines are costly. Your cost will depend on your health plan coverage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It is also called MS. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve fibers have a protective covering called . Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS slowly destroys myelin and nerve cells in the central nervous system. This causes muscle weakness and other symptoms. Most of the time, MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your . Your doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An MRI scan is often used to confirm the diagnosis. That's because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with MRI. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. In general, MS follows one of four courses: Clinically isolated syndrome. The symptoms last for 24 hours or longer and go away. Relapsing-remitting. This means symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. Secondary progressive, which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressively worse. ""Progressive"" means it gets worse over time. Primary progressive. This means the disease is progressive from the start. Disease-modifying therapy means treatment to delay, change, or interrupt the natural course of the disease. For MS, this means taking medicine over a long period of time to reduce not only the number of attacks but also how bad they are. To slow down the spread of MS, your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when you are first diagnosed with MS. People treated soon after being diagnosed with MS may have better results than those who delay treatment. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Medicines for MS can be costly. They don't work for everyone. And it's hard to know who will benefit. Making a decision about starting disease-modifying therapy can be hard, especially if your symptoms have been mild. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start therapy. A small number of people with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and never have any disability. But there is no way to know who will fall into this group. Medicines can't cure MS. They don't stop disease activity or reverse nervous system damage that has already happened. But drugs may reduce relapses and delay disability in many people with relapsing forms of MS. If you decide not to try disease-modifying therapy at this time, work with your doctor to monitor your health through regular checkups and periodic MRI scans to evaluate whether the disease is progressing. If new lesions are developing or existing lesions are growing, you may want to reconsider your decision and begin treatment. If you decide not to take MS medicines, there are some other things you can do. Take other medicine, such as , to relieve symptoms during attacks or relapses. Try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment you can do at home to help you manage your symptoms and adjust to living and working with MS. Do what you can to stay well. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and try to reduce stress. Some people try alternative therapy to reduce their symptoms. Before you try any type of alternative treatment for MS, talk with your doctor about your treatment options. You can also get advice from an MS treatment center or the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. What do numbers tell us about benefits and risks of MS medicines? This section focuses on glatiramer and interferon beta, the most commonly used MS medicines. Progression from early symptoms to diagnosis of MS *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) Flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath (glatiramer) *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) The evidence suggests a slight positive effect for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. But the quality of the evidence isn't good. It is . If you have had some early symptoms of MS but don't have a clear diagnosis yet, medicine may reduce the chance that your symptoms will progress to full-blown MS. Take a group of 100 people who have had an MS-like episode but do not yet have an MS diagnosis: Without medicines, 45 to 58 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 42 to 55 may not. With MS medicines, 34 to 35 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 65 to 66 may not. Your risk of needing a hospital stay over the next 2 years may be lower if you take medicines than if you don't. : Without MS medicines, 20 people out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 80 out of 100 may not. With MS medicines, 12 out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 88 out of 100 may not. Many people who take MS medicines have uncomfortable side effects. : With interferon beta, 48 out of 100 may have flu-like symptoms. This means that 52 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . With glatiramer, 24 out of 100 may have symptoms such as flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. This means that 76 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . Some evidence is better than other evidence. Evidence comes from studies that look at how well treatments and tests work and how safe they are. For many reasons, some studies are more reliable than others. The better the evidence is—the higher its quality—the more we can trust it. The information shown here is based on the best available evidence. The evidence is rated using four quality levels: . Another thing to understand is that the evidence can't predict what's going to happen in your case. When evidence tells us that 2 out of 100 people who have a certain test or treatment may have a certain result and that 98 out of 100 may not, there's no way to know if you will be one of the 2 or one of the 98. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicine as soon as possible after receiving a diagnosis. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Your doctor may suggest that you take MS medicines because: You have had symptoms that are most likely caused by multiple sclerosis, tests show you most likely have MS, and your doctor is confident that you have MS. You have just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and early treatment may delay damage to your central nervous system. These medicines are the only ones proved to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and delay disability. You take the type of medicine prescribed (pills, injections, or shots). You visit your doctor regularly for blood tests and to check your progress. These drugs can make relapses less severe and reduce how often they occur. Medicines can slow the spread of the disease by limiting new areas of damage in the brain. These drugs don't work for everyone. It is hard to predict who will benefit. The long-term risks of some of these drugs are not known. Side effects of these medicines can include flu-like symptoms, headaches, diarrhea, nausea, hair thinning, depression, chest pain, anxiety, flushing, and redness and swelling at the injection site (for shots or injections). You visit your doctor regularly to check your progress. You try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment at home to adjust to living with MS. You avoid the risks and cost of medicines that you might not need or that may not work for you. You avoid taking medicine for multiple sclerosis if you end up being diagnosed with a different condition. You may have a higher chance of becoming disabled. Long-term use of steroid medicine may lead to other problems such as stomach ulcers, problems sleeping, and high blood pressure. Personal stories about treatment for multiple sclerosis These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions. The MS episodes I've had were fairly mild, but I'm worried that next time the symptoms will be more severe. I don't think I'm being pessimistic by deciding to take interferon. I think I'm giving myself the best chance to live a long and healthy life. I have never been much of a risk-taker, and my health is definitely not something I want to risk. My doctor recommends that I take the medicine. Even if it turns out that I might not have needed treatment for MS, I would rather err on the side of caution by starting therapy now. I know I would really regret not doing the treatment if I had a relapse a year from now or even a few years from now. I generally try to avoid medicine when I can. My doctor really thinks it would be a good idea for me to take the medicine, but I don't want to deal with the side effects, and I'm not sure I like the idea of giving myself shots on a regular basis. I don't want to take medicine ""just in case"" I have problems with MS later. Besides, I can always reconsider if and when I have another episode. Your personal feelings are just as important as the medical facts. Think about what matters most to you in this decision, and show how you feel about the following statements. I want to try the medicine now, even though it might not work. I don't want to take the medicine if it might not work. I worry that if I don't start treatment now, I may be sorry later. I'm willing to live with the side effects of medicine. I don't know if I can handle the side effects of medicine. I want to do whatever I can to make my attacks happen less often. I want to try to handle my attacks without medicine. Now that you've thought about the facts and your feelings, you may have a general idea of where you stand on this decision. Show which way you are leaning right now. Can medicines help prevent some nervous system damage from MS? If you decide not to start medicines now, are there other things you can try? Are you clear about which benefits and side effects matter most to you? Do you have enough support and advice from others to make a choice? How sure do you feel right now about your decision? Check what you need to do before you make this decision. Here's a record of your answers. You can use it to talk with your doctor or loved ones about your decision. LaMantia L, et al. (2010).

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS is the most common type, and typical symptoms include sensory disturbances, Lhermitte sign, motor weakness, optic neuritis, impaired coordination, and fatigue. The course of disease is highly variable. The diagnosis is clinical and involves two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Symptom exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for patients with acute, significant symptoms. Disease-modifying agents should be initiated early in the treatment of MS to forestall disease and preserve function. Two immunomodulatory agents (interferon beta and glatiramer) and five immunosuppressive agents (fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, and mitoxantrone) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MS, each with demonstrated effectiveness and unique adverse effect profiles. Symptom management constitutes a large part of care; neurogenic bladder and bowel, sexual dysfunction, pain, spasticity, and fatigue are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach to improve quality of life. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in young adults. The prevalence varies by geographic region, ranging from 110 cases per 100,000 persons in the northern United States to 47 per 100,000 in the southern United States. Women, smokers, and persons residing at higher latitudes or with a family history of MS are at increased risk of disease. Those with increased exposure to sunlight and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are at decreased risk. Total costs associated with MS may exceed $50,000 per person annually.  Enlarge     Print Multiple sclerosis is a clinical diagnosis requiring two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space. If clinical criteria are not met, magnetic resonance imaging can be used to make the diagnosis. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for patients with multiple sclerosis and significant, acute symptoms. No significant difference has been found between parenteral and oral formulations. The disease-modifying agents interferon beta, glatiramer (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), and dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) have been shown to decrease the frequency of exacerbations and progression of disease in patients with multiple sclerosis. Each agent has a unique adverse effect profile making it more or less suitable for individual patients.

For information about the SORT evidence rating system, go to Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The most common type of MS is relapsing remitting MS . In the acute attack, T cells, B cells, and macrophages interact with adhesion molecules on blood vessel surfaces to traverse a blood-brain barrier weakened by matrix metalloproteinases. Once through, T cells and B cells release inflammatory mediators and immunoglobulins targeting the myelin sheath, while macrophages expose axonal surfaces and release harmful nitrous oxygen and oxygen free radicals. This cascade of events leads to demyelination and axonal injury.  Enlarge     Print Discrete attacks that evolve over days to weeks, followed by some degree of recovery over weeks to months; the patient has no worsening of neurologic function between attacks Initial relapsing remitting disease, followed by gradual neurologic deterioration not associated with acute attacks Primary progressive and progressive relapsing (10% of cases) Characterized by steady functional decline from disease onset; these types cannot be distinguished during early stages until attacks occur (progressive relapsing) or fail to occur (primary progressive); progressive relapsing is rarer than primary progressive *—Develops in about 50% of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.

CNS pathologies to consider include other inflammatory, demyelinating, or degenerative diseases; infections; neoplasms; and migraines. Genetic diseases, nutritional deficiencies, and psychiatric diseases may also present in a manner similar to MS. The diagnosis of MS should be questioned in the presence of abrupt/transient symptoms, prominent cortical features (seizures, aphasia), peripheral neuropathy, and other organ (cardiac, hematologic) involvement, because these are not typical of MS.  Enlarge     Print Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care MS is a clinical diagnosis.

In addition to MRI, evoked potentials (visual, auditory, and somatosensory) may provide objective evidence of deficits consistent with MS. Visual evoked potentials are especially helpful for persons with vision-related symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid may be obtained, although this is not routinely recommended; analysis typically demonstrates oligoclonal bands and an increased immunoglobulin G concentration. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is more useful in ruling out MS mimics and in diagnosing primary progressive MS than in diagnosing relapsing remitting MS.  Serologic testing is performed to exclude other diseases .  Enlarge     Print Serologic Tests to Rule Out Conditions That Mimic Multiple Sclerosis Rheumatologic disease, systemic lupus erythematosus Performed when appropriate to the clinical situation Autoantibody assays* (e.g., antineutrophil cytoplasmic, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, anti–SS-A, and anti–SS-B antibodies) Behçet syndrome, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis *—These tests are commonly ordered by neurologists on initial consultation.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS; infections and stress may play a role. For those with significant, acute symptoms, corticosteroids are the treatment of choice and have strong evidence of benefit. Although parenteral steroids build up to peak concentrations faster than oral preparations, a Cochrane review indicates no difference in effectiveness (as measured by clinical or radiologic markers) or safety between oral and parenteral preparations. If the disease is unresponsive to steroids, plasmapheresis may be performed. Plasma exchanges are relatively well tolerated and are usually performed every other day for 14 days. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The goal of disease-modifying therapy is to forestall disease, preserve function, and sustain healthy immune function while suppressing the T-cell autoimmune cascade thought to be responsible for demyelination and axonal damage. Early treatment at or before the diagnosis of clinically confirmed MS may delay damage to the CNS.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved seven agents for the treatment of MS: interferon beta, glatiramer (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), natalizumab (Tysabri), and mitoxantrone . Because of the chronic nature and evolving treatment of MS, disease-modifying treatment is typically managed by a neurologist with expertise in prescribing these potentially toxic agents.  Enlarge     Print Disease-Modifying Agents for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Injection site reactions (e.g., edema, inflammation, pain); influenza-like symptoms; leukopenia; elevated liver enzyme levels; depression and suicidal thoughts (increased with preexisting depression, neutralizing antibodies) Decrease in progression: RR = 0.69; (0.55 to 0.87) Injection site reactions, facial flushing, chest tightness, palpitations Decrease in disability at two years: MD = 0.33; (0.08 to 0.58) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.18 vs. 0.40 Bradycardia (contraindicated in recent heart disease or arrhythmia); elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression at two years: HR = 0.70; (0.55 to 0.87) Melanoma, macular edema, herpes encephalitis (only occurs at higher doses) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.37 vs. 0.54 Alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, decreased white blood cell count, elevated liver enzyme levels, peripheral neuropathy Decrease in progression: HR = 0.76; (0.51 to 0.97) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.17 vs. 0.36 Flushing, abdominal pain, lymphocytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression: HR = 0.62; (0.44 to 0.87) Infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Decrease in progression at two years: RR = 0.74; (0.62 to 0.89) Myelosuppression, elevated liver enzyme levels, decreased cardiac function, leukemia Decrease in progression: OR = 0.30; (0.09 to 0.99) HR = hazard ratio; MD = mean difference; OR = odds ratio; RR = relative risk. *—Estimated retail price of treatment for one year based on information obtained at .

Interferon beta, an immunomodulatory agent with more than 20 years of safety data, is effective in decreasing exacerbations and the progression of relapsing remitting MS. Interferon beta is available in three injectable formulations. Common adverse effects include local reactions and influenza-like symptoms. Interferon treatment may be associated with suicidal thoughts, so other agents should be considered in patients with depression. Glatiramer is an alternative immunomodulatory daily injection for relapsing remitting MS with a good safety record. Glatiramer decreases relapse and progression of disability at two years. Common adverse effects include local and systemic injection reactions (e.g., chest tightness, palpitations). Glatiramer should be avoided in persons with known hypersensitivity to this agent. Fingolimod is the first oral agent that is FDA approved for disease modification in relapsing remitting MS. A study of 1,272 patients between 18 and 55 years of age with relapsing remitting MS compared fingolimod with placebo, and demonstrated a decrease in annual exacerbations and progression of disease at two years. Bradycardia is a known adverse effect; patients should be observed for six hours after taking their first dose, and the medication is contraindicated in those with recent heart disease or arrhythmia. The FDA has approved two additional oral agents. Teriflunomide, approved in September 2012, has been shown to decrease relapse rates compared with placebo. Adverse effects include elevated transaminase levels, alopecia, and diarrhea. Teriflunomide carries an FDA warning for hepatic toxicity. Dimethyl fumarate, approved in March 2013, has been shown to decrease relapses and disease progression. Adverse effects include flushing, abdominal pain, decreased lymphocyte counts, and elevated transaminase levels. All of these oral agents suppress the immune system and put patients at risk of opportunistic infections. Because of this, these agents are typically used when the disease does not respond to, or the patient is unable to tolerate, an immunomodulatory agent. Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are immunosuppressive agents reserved for disease that does not respond to first-line agents. Although both are effective, natalizumab carries an FDA warning for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and mitoxantrone carries a warning for cardiotoxicity. Ongoing trials are evaluating the effectiveness and safety of additional agents in the treatment of MS to include the injectable daclizumab and oral cladribine and siponimod. Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multidisciplinary treatment of primary and associated symptoms is essential in enhancing the quality of life in younger and older patients with MS. More than 70% of patients with MS have urinary tract dysfunction, with 10% demonstrating urinary symptoms at initial diagnosis. Urinary dysfunction can be classified as failure to store or empty, and can be differentiated with postvoid residual testing. Failure-to-store symptoms are typically treated with anticholinergic medications, although patients should be cautioned about adverse effects, such as dry mouth and confusion. Nocturia may respond to limited evening fluid intake or intranasal desmopressin; if desmopressin is prescribed, patients should be cautioned about the potential for hyponatremia. Injectable onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) may be used if symptoms do not respond to these agents. Failure-to-empty symptoms are treated with clean intermittent catheterization, although some may respond to an alpha adrenergic blocker. Up to 75% of patients with MS experience constipation, incontinence, or both. Treatment should include dietary fiber, bulk-forming agents, and adequate hydration. Rectal stimulants, stool softeners, and enemas may be used if needed. Colostomy is an option for patients with intolerable symptoms. About 50% to 90% of men and 40% to 85% of women with MS have some type of sexual dysfunction. Although sexual dysfunction may have a considerable negative impact on quality of life, it is often unaddressed. Men are primarily treated with peripherally acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. There is no established pharmacologic agent for women. Collaboration with a sex therapist or couples counselor may be beneficial. Approximately 85% of patients with MS report pain during the course of their illness. Those with pain report poorer health and poorer psychological functioning. Trigeminal neuralgia and dysesthetic (neuropathic) limb pain are common. Trigeminal neuralgia is initially treated with carbamazepine (Tegretol) and baclofen (Lioresal), as it is in persons without MS. Neuropathic pain in MS may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Hydrotherapy has also been shown to be helpful in pain management, and is beneficial for the spasticity associated with MS. Cannabinoid therapy may be helpful for pain symptoms. It is estimated that 70% to 80% of patients with MS experience muscle spasticity. These symptoms are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating modalities such as physical, occupational, and electromagnetic therapy. Baclofen is a first-line agent and works by decreasing alpha motor neuron activity. Oral baclofen has a short half-life and is associated with daytime sedation and muscle weakness. Intrathecal baclofen can be used to avoid daytime sedation, although muscle weakness may still occur. Diazepam (Valium) and gabapentin (Neurontin) may be used alone or in conjunction with baclofen. OnabotulinumtoxinA, with or without concomitant physical therapy, may also be helpful. Although cannabinoid therapy has been used for spasticity, the evidence for its effectiveness is mixed. The American Academy of Neurology states that patients should be counseled that these agents are probably ineffective for objective spasticity. More than 90% of patients with MS report fatigue; one-third report it to be their most troubling symptom, and many present with it. Although fatigue may occur as a result of comorbid depression, it also may appear independently. Fatigue has profound impacts on quality of life and is a leading cause of disability claims. Treatment for fatigue is multifocal. After evaluating for comorbid causes of fatigue (e.g., sleep disorders, thyroid disease, vitamin B deficiency, anemia), environmental manipulation, such as controlling heat and humidity levels, may help prevent flare-ups. Energy conservation measures such as napping and the use of assistive devices for mobility may be recommended based on the individual patient. Amantadine has been used off label in a limited number of trials and has been found to be beneficial for fatigue, although it is associated with insomnia and confusion. Other medications, such as modafinil (Provigil), have been tried with mixed results, and are not FDA approved for patients with MS. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and other vascular comorbidities in patients with MS is similar to that in the general population. The presence of these conditions may worsen the course of MS. In addition to using targeted MS and symptom-modifying therapies, physicians should also manage these comorbidities. Surveys show that more than 50% of patients with MS seek treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic manipulations, massage, yoga, and herbal therapies.  Physicians should ask patients if they are using integrative treatments, and should be prepared to help them find quality information on the risks and benefits of the treatments they choose. provides information and resources on traditional and integrative treatments for MS.  Enlarge     Print Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines : A PubMed search was completed using the keyword and medical subject heading multiple sclerosis.

ccceb3f7-5a57-4e67-973a-89269a1f9651,"In very simple terms, cognition is the process of certain mental functions. These functions include identifying knowledge, processing and understanding, learning and planning, problem-solving, concentration, and memory. In MS this process can become difficult. This is known as cognitive dysfunction, or cognitive challenges and often referred to as ‘cog-fog’. Around 50 per cent of people diagnosed with MS will experience cognitive dysfunction to some degree (1). We asked the MS community to describe how cognition affects them, they said... Can be embarrassing, but luckily when I’m with friends and family they help and I can laugh about it I’m slow to think and speak to express my thoughts and feelings I cannot think quickly. If I were a computer, I feel like it’s my RAM that is slow  It takes longer to apply myself to dealing with life’s issues I get easily distracted, lose my train of thought, brain fog, memory holes Forgetting the start of a book by the time I’ve reached the end Signs can initially be so subtle that they are not even really noticeable. They are easily attributable to feeling tired, or perhaps getting older. It can also have much more impact as the condition progresses and can interfere with work, personal life, how a person feels about themselves, or other situations that require more complex thinking. Social situations can become difficult which can cause an increase in anxiety as a result. ‘I think most of my difficulty with cognition is due to fatigue so later in the day it is worse. I have to plan carefully and tackle complicated tasks when I am not fatigued. If I am struggling I will leave a task until I feel more able to tackle it’ Jeffrey Gingold, author of ‘Facing the cognitive challenges of multiple sclerosis’ states in his book how in some cases, cognitive issues have the potential to be just as disabling as the physical difficulties of MS (2). As cognitive dysfunction is an invisible symptom it can often be overlooked, hard to recognise and understand by family, friends, co-workers and even health professionals. The difficulties people can face can be misunderstood. Equally, cognitive dysfunction can be a difficult symptom to talk about and it can be hard to admit you are having problems. ‘Cognitive dysfunction profoundly affects one’s sense of self. You feel as though your brain is failing you (which, with MS, it is!) and when you can’t rely on your own mind, where do you go?’ Healthcare professionals need to have a flexible approach and be creative when providing new information to a person with MS-related cognitive difficulties. It is important for anyone, whether they are a health professional or a personal assistant working directly with people with MS, to understand the cognitive challenges that many people face. MS is an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system attacks its own nerve cells. This means that it can affect any part of the brain therefore any cognitive function can be affected. Along with lesions, MS can cause brain atrophy (loss of brain cells) and shrinkage in certain areas (1). In MS, the protective coating that surrounds the brain and spinal cord cells – myelin - becomes damaged, causing messages to not be transmitted through the nerves effectively. The parts of the brain that control cognitive ability can be exposed and that’s when problems can start to appear. People with lesions in the cerebrum and the cerebellum parts of the brain will more often have problems with cognitive function compared to those who have lesions in the cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord (3). The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, contributing to nearly 80 per cent of the total weight of the brain. The cerebellum makes up the remaining part. Symptoms can vary from person to person and the level can fluctuate greatly. Symptoms can come and go and be dependent on other factors such as heat intolerance, fatigue, infections, emotional stress, relapses and medication. Whereas for others, cognitive difficulties can be very persistent and debilitating. Difficulty learning and remembering new things – memory can be less reliable, issues with short-term memory (long-term is often unaffected) Processing lots of information at once or multitasking can be tricky and slow Having poor concentration and being easily distracted (for example difficulty holding a conversation if there is background noise such as from a television) Inability to get the right words out – the word may be on the ‘tip of the tongue’ but you just cannot think of it Planning and problem solving can be more challenging. Often you know what you want to do but cannot figure out how to do it Slowed information processing – it can take much longer to process what you are reading, hearing and experiencing through senses. This can lead to getting lost as you are less able to process spatial information Less able to comprehend social cues in conversation or meetings A number of these symptoms are not just specific to MS. They can be caused by other conditions such as depression and anxiety. Even some medications can interfere with cognition. Therefore, it can be difficult to assess and diagnose that cognitive issues are definitely MS related (4). When cognitive issues are undiagnosed and unrecognised it can be an emotional and distressing experience. It can also have an impact on relationships and employment, and a person can lose their sense of self and feel vulnerable. In some cases a person may compare their cognitive issues to that of a form of dementia, although the use of this term in MS isn’t necessarily supported in a health care setting (5). It is important to talk through these thoughts and fears with a health professional, counsellor, MS-UK Helpline or a friend. It may be that coping strategies can be created together and in turn, this will help reduce further stresses and anxiety.  There is no one test that can diagnose cognitive dysfunction, or even necessarily confirm it. However, there is ongoing research into finding better tools to acknowledge and assess the symptom and therefore allowing for better management (6). The NICE guidelines state that cognition should be discussed fully by MS clinic staff and referrals should be considered to both an occupational therapist (OT) and a neuropsychologist to fully assess and manage the symptom (7). A full assessment is required to determine the level of cognitive problems that a person is experiencing. However, there are tools that other health professionals (such as MS nurses) can use too, as access to neuropsychology in some areas can be quite limited. An assessment will likely include a number of different tasks that will test your ability to remember, concentrate and do things that would ordinarily be easy.  The assessment will take into consideration whether a person is having a relapse, may be experiencing depression or high levels of stress, as all will have an impact on cognitive ability. After the assessment the health professional and patient will work together to set individual goals and find ways in which to make improvements where needed. This might include things like creating new strategies and techniques, referring on for cognitive rehabilitation, counselling, finding alternative approaches to perform tasks, and so on. There are various ways in which a person can manage their cognitive difficulties but sometimes guidance is needed by a professional. Unfortunately, there are no prescribable drugs that can help with MS-related cognition although some disease-modifying therapies (DMT) have shown some improvements in clinical trials. However, a DMT wouldn’t be prescribed solely for cognition, they all have eligibility criteria that need to be met. GPs or MS nurses can refer you to a neuropsychologist but if there isn’t one in your area then an occupational therapist (OT) can help too. An OT can work with a person to help design some strategies to help manage specific issues. ‘The neuropsychologist was very helpful in giving me strategies to get through and not panic, and to be open about how it affects me so people understand, most importantly not to be ashamed of it’ An OT may suggest certain pieces of equipment and aids or even some apps to use on your mobile phone or tablet. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy can be offered by an OT or psychologist either individually or in a group setting. This type of therapy works by learning new cognitive strategies aimed at compensating for cognitive problems. It can have a positive impact on memory and problem solving and also help to improve attention and a person’s mood (8). MBCT is mindfulness training combined with elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. Studies have shown that mindfulness-based interventions can have a positive effect on cognitive function. More studies are required to evidence this further (8). Professor Dawn Langdon, neuropsychologist, says there are a number of things people with MS can do to help protect their cognition. Positive lifestyle choices, some of which may be hard to action but are important to consider include Other factors that may or may not be available to you are to take disease-modifying medication and to also be prescribed optimum treatment for all other diseases, especially cardiovascular and diabetes. Professor Langdon also says that regular challenging mental activities can help to maintain clear and fast thinking (5). ‘Having time to take in information and to respond to questions is very important’ Moderate and severe depression can have a significant impact on cognitive function and is a symptom experienced by up to 50 per cent of people diagnosed with MS (9). Depression can slow down a person’s thinking. The decline of cognitive function is interlinked with both depression and fatigue. Depression can increase fatigue, which can lead to cognitive decline. Fatigue is associated with increasing levels of depression, which can also lead to a decline in cognition. Each symptom impacts negatively on the others. It is important that depression is recognised and treated to prevent any potential impact on a person’s cognitive ability. Accessing counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, and taking anti-depressant medication can all help. Speaking to a GP and/or MS nurse about any low mood can open up the conversation in finding the best form of treatment. Treating just one of those symptoms has a significant improvement on the others (9). A 2016 study looking at brain training versus ordinary computer games showed that both improved overall cognitive function. Training consisted of one hour a day, five days a week for 12 weeks (10). The brain training group used a cognitive remediation training program where patients were instructed to play a series of games and tasks, compared to a placebo program of ordinary computer games. The brain training group showed nearly three times the improvement than the computer games group. Both groups were able to take part from their own homes rather than attend a clinic, which was beneficial to all. Cognitive remediation therapy is a form of rehabilitation offering exercises that aim to improve attention, memory, language and/or executive functions. It can also teach specific strategies to help find the best ways of working with cognitive impairments. StayingSmart is a website designed by the MS Trust for people affected by MS who want to know more about how MS can affect thinking. The main aims of the resource is to support learning about cognition in MS, to help build confidence in managing cognition and to encourage the sharing of knowledge about, and experiences of cognition. It looks at everyday problems and provides guides, videos and tips and tricks, full of a variety of ways to manage cognition. They also include videos from people sharing their own personal experiences. ‘I have learnt to manage my issues through planning, recording, scheduling, giving myself time and finding a job more suited to my ability’ StayingSmart has some useful suggestions when dealing with memory issues, they include (11) Paper diaries and electronic organisers are unobtrusive and very useful For important appointments and dates (such as hospital appointments or birthdays), a reminder in advance can be helpful. For example, a reminder to book leave from work or transport a week before an appointment. A reminder to buy a card or present a week before a birthday Writing small prompts or cues on sticky notes, for example just writing ‘dry cleaning’ will probably be enough to remind you to stop to pick up the cleaning Check in with family members and friends to see if they have noticed any problems with your memory. It helps to be open and honest as they will then feel more able to be honest with you too ‘I avoid meetings at work. I tend to catch up and email thoughts and ideas later as I find thinking on the spot too hard, especially when lots of ideas and comments are being thrown around’ There are other daily reminders that can really improve quality of life and are simple to implement. These include Dosette boxes are such a simple piece of equipment that help people to remember to take medication at the right time of the day. Sometimes they can even be arranged via the pharmacy to come prefilled with prescribed medications too Use a family calendar or organiser to track everyone’s activities each day of the week. This can really help to alleviate confusion and keep on top of where everyone is Assign a specific place for storing important frequently used things such as car keys, encouraging family members to make sure they put things back where they belong Plan your most challenging cognitive tasks for your best time of day. If you experience fatigue around 3pm each day, make sure you have completed more taxing tasks in the morning Smart phones are great tools for alarms and reminders, and using the notes app to keep track of to-do lists is helpful. They are also good for brain training if you use certain game apps such as sudoku ‘My iPad is my ‘bible’. It goes with me everywhere, so that I can diarise events or make lists as necessary’ In Jeffrey Gingold’s book ‘Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis’ he talks about tips for living (2). Maintaining clear thinking spaces in your life means saying ‘no’ to some requests which can often be difficult If a situation appears confusing, don’t be afraid to ask for clarification, reminders and direction When faced with a moment of ‘befuddlement’, don’t force it. Give yourself permission to pause and breathe calmly, relax and patiently gather your thinking focus. Allow yourself the time and mental space to ride out your temporary lapses in thinking Limit visual distractions and live an uncluttered life. Clear floors and tabletops; organise shelves and drawers Keep lists for daily responsibilities and activities. Also, keep a long term and a short term list for projects ‘I need to try and schedule “concentration” times to earlier in the day, when less tired’ Find ways to relax and soothe your mind to prevent or ease stress Remember to have fun and make it part of your daily routine Be patient with yourself by taking breaks and extra time to complete projects if necessary ‘I was advised to start writing things in a notebook. I like to do crosswords to challenge my vocabulary skills’ These are all important points to remember to begin to take control and manage your own cognitive function. Keeping your brain active with hobbies you enjoy such as reading, crafts, painting to name a few can really help to keep your brain healthy. Crosswords and jigsaw puzzles are a great tool to exercise your brain. It is important that these activities stretch your mind somewhat though. Reading is great, talking about the subject with others is better, writing about it is best. According to MS Brain Health, it is important to stop smoking when affected by cognitive issues. Cigarette smoking in people with MS is associated with decreased brain volume as well as higher relapse rates, increased disability progression, more cognitive problems and reduced survival compared with not smoking (12). In a recent study presented at ECTRIMS 2019, it was found that smokers have reduced Processing Speed Test (PST) scores (which are used to assess cognitive functioning), compared to non-smokers. They also have more brain atrophy (13). The study looked at ex-smokers as well as current smokers. It was found that ex-smokers had significantly greater brain atrophy than those who had never smoked. This was an effect that was much greater in current smokers. The doctor behind the study said how important it is for clinicians to discuss smoking management at every appointment and provide patients with the data to encourage them to stop smoking to reduce the risks and the negative impact on disease progression. If cognitive issues are becoming a problem in terms of managing your finances there are a few things you can do to help plan for the future. Third Party Access is when a trusted person is given access to your accounts to help you sort out your day-to-day banking. They can make sure your bills are paid on time by arranging direct debits for example; access to mobile or online banking can be helpful so you can go through it together. Another option would be for a standing order to be set up where a fixed amount is paid regularly to your third party so they can withdraw money and pay bills for you whilst keeping a record of what they spend on your behalf. Third Party Access can be set up at your bank and can be cancelled at any time. In some cases where cognitive issues have a significant impact on quality of life and can be a very disabling symptom, things can become more difficult. Life can become confusing, overwhelming and very isolating. In this instance, it may be a good idea to have a LPA. A LPA is a legal document that allows you to appoint one or more people, (or ‘attorneys’) to have the authority to help you make decisions or to make decisions on your behalf. The person/people appointed do not have to have any legal experience. They can be a family member, friend or people you trust who will always consider your preferences and to help you make your own decisions as much as you can. They should always make decisions in your best interests.  If there are high levels of cognitive issues meaning you cannot make your own decisions easily, you may be seen to ‘lack mental capacity’. Health professionals and social workers would be able to assess whether or not an individual lacks mental capacity. Therefore an LPA will be important in having control over what happens to you and your future. You can choose to just have one LPA, or both. You can arrange LPAs via a solicitor or for people living in England, Wales and Scotland the forms are available online from the Office of Public Guardian. For people living in Northern Ireland you can contact the Office for Care and Protection. Forms can be completed online and there is a fee to register each LPA made. Reductions and exemptions are available to those in receipt of certain benefits.

09728f8a-3e8f-4778-a278-2271c23d1573,"Reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration is associated with physical disability in progressive multiple sclerosis Niamh Cawley, Bhavana S. Solanky, Nils Muhlert, Carmen Tur, , Claudia A.M. Wheeler-Kingshott, David H. Miller, Alan J. Thompson, Olga Ciccarelli Neurodegeneration is thought to be the major cause of ongoing, irreversible disability in progressive stages of multiple sclerosis. Gamma-aminobutyric acid is the principle inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. The aims of this study were to investigate if gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (i) are abnormal in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis compared with healthy controls; and (ii) correlate with physical and cognitive performance in this patient population. Thirty patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and 17 healthy control subjects underwent single-voxel MEGA-PRESS (MEscher-GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy) magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T, to quantify gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the prefrontal cortex, right hippocampus and left sensorimotor cortex. All subjects were assessed clinically and underwent a cognitive assessment. Multiple linear regression models were used to compare differences in gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations between patients and controls adjusting for age, gender and tissue fractions within each spectroscopic voxel. Regression was used to examine the relationships between the cognitive function and physical disability scores specific for these regions with gamma-aminobuytric acid levels, adjusting for age, gender, and total N-acetyl-aspartate and glutamine-glutamate complex levels. When compared with controls, patients performed significantly worse on all motor and sensory tests, and were cognitively impaired in processing speed and verbal memory. Patients had significantly lower gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the hippocampus (adjusted difference = -0.403 mM, 95% confidence intervals -0.792, -0.014, P = 0.043) and sensorimotor cortex (adjusted difference = -0.385 mM, 95% confidence intervals -0.667, -0.104, P = 0.009) compared with controls. In patients, reduced motor function in the right upper and lower limb was associated with lower gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration in the sensorimotor cortex. Specifically for each unit decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (in mM), there was a predicted -10.86 (95% confidence intervals -16.786 to -4.482) decrease in grip strength (kg force) (P < 0.001) and -8.74 (95% confidence intervals -13.943 to -3.015) decrease in muscle strength (P < 0.006). This study suggests that reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid levels reflect pathological abnormalities that may play a role in determining physical disability. These abnormalities may include decreases in the pre- and postsynaptic components of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission and in the density of inhibitory neurons. Additionally, the reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration may contribute to the neurodegenerative process, resulting in increased firing of axons, with consequent increased energy demands, which may lead to neuroaxonal degeneration and loss of the compensatory mechanisms that maintain motor function.

(Sherbourne and Stewart, 1991) This instrument provides an assessment of several domains of social support including tangible support, emotional support, affective support, and positive support. The full-length MSSS consists of 18 items while the abbreviated version has 5 items. The abbreviated version can be used if time is limited but the full-length version has the advantage of generating subscales. The MSSS is one of the components of the and was modified slightly for use with MS patients following field-testing and psychometric analysis. Administration time is approximately 5-10 minutes for the full-length version and 2-3 minutes for the abbreviated version. The MSSS is a structured, self-report questionnaire that the patient can generally complete with little or no intervention from an interviewer. However, patients with visual or upper extremity impairments may need to have the MSSS administered as an interview. Interviewers should be trained in basic interviewing skills and in the use of this instrument. The scoring system for the MSSS is relatively complex and generates a total score as well as subscale scores for tangible support, emotional/informational support, affectionate support, and positive social interaction. (PDF) The MSSS is easy to administer and provides a multifaceted assessment of perceived social support. The availability of the four subscales, tangible support, emotional/informational support, affectionate support, and positive social interaction, may be useful to investigators interested in testing hypotheses concerning these different sub-domains. However, the four subscales are highly correlated with one another, limiting their usefulness to some degree. The full-length version of the MSSS has a Cronbach's alpha of .97 while the short form has an alpha of .88. In the field testing for the MSQLI the MSSS showed good convergent and discriminant validity, correlating highly with a measure of loneliness/companionship but poorly with measures such as bladder control and visual impairment. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

98d2e8a2-fe82-40b2-9841-cc6d74f51ebe,"Scientists Trying to Reduce Liver Damage Caused by MS Drugs — Researchers say they may be able to identify people with multiple sclerosis who are more likely to develop liver diseases after taking interferon-based medications. Serious liver damage is a risk for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are treating their illness with medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But has found a way to identify people who could experience increased liver enzyme activity if taking an interferon beta. In the 1990s, there were three disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for people with MS called the ABC shots: two interferon betas, Avonex and Betaseron, and one glatiramer acetate, Copaxone. Today, there are 17 DMTs approved by the FDA to treat MS. Five of them are interferon-based drugs delivered via injections. The other options are delivered orally or intravenously (IV). They all come with side effects. DMTs are designed to slow down progression, reduce the number of relapses, lessen the intensity of relapses, and limit brain lesions. They also may prevent a second clinical attack after an initial episode. DMTs vary in strength and results. The stronger the medicine, the worse the side effects and risks. Biotechnology company Biogen voluntarily took MS drug Zinbryta off the market after were raised about liver damage. People taking are monitored for heart disease. Lemtrada, taken through an IV, can produce . It’s usually only prescribed after two other interventions were tried but didn’t work. The clinical trials for Tysabri found patients could progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often fatal viral infection of the brain. can cause swelling behind the eyes, liver problems and PML, but it recently became the first disease-modifying treatment approved by the FDA for pediatric MS. Aubagio, an oral treatment, has that include hair thinning, headaches, and the potential for severe liver injury. Advances are making these treatments safer for people with MS. Experts can measure a biomarker for the presence of JC virus antibodies to prevent PML. In addition, researchers have found a genetic variant, close to a gene called interferon regulatory factor 6 () that may help predict liver injury in people using interferon-beta therapies. Interferons are a commonly prescribed DMTs for people with MS. They have shown a success rate of up to in preventing and shortening relapses as well as reducing new brain lesions. They have also been shown to slow disease progression and cognitive loss. However, they don’t slow the advance of disabilities. Current FDA-approved interferon betas include Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, Extavia, and most recently, , a peginterferon. These drugs are designed to encourage the body’s natural response of activating interferons (proteins) to fight viral infection and inflammation. Interferons are used to treat cancer, viral infection, and MS. “It is known that interferon betas can increase liver enzyme activity,” said Kathy Costello, a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center and the associate vice president of healthcare access for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “This is not terribly uncommon. What is uncommon are severe effects. “This new research suggests that there are people with genomic characteristics that would make them more likely to have the liver enzymes when given interferons,” explained Costello. “A patient could be inclined toward liver damage if taking an interferon but not a different type of DMT, even if the alternative may be known to cause an increase in liver enzyme activity. “This is an important study,” Costello told Healthline. “I’m not aware of others that have corroborated these important results. It is useful information.” People with MS have options when it comes to DMTs if they show a tendency toward liver damage while taking interferons. There are other DMTs that may not cause such problems. Some treatments may result in an increase in liver enzyme activity but not cause liver damage or disease. “This is important for the doctor/patient strategy. Knowing this could inform shared decision-making about risk and fuel the conversation around other options for DMTs,” said Costello. “It may be able to prevent drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in at-risk patients. Maybe they’re monitored more closely.” Healthline caught up with Dr. Jaime Imitola, the director of the Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Multidisciplinary Clinic and Translational Research Program at the Wexner Medical Center at The Ohio State University. He noted the Nature Genetics Journal, which published this study, represents high-quality research. “It is clear that not every patient will respond in the same way [to interferons]” said Imitola. “Some patients will have the propensity to have better outcomes than others. “The effectiveness of these DMTs lie in the drug’s ability to create a response to the interferons,” he explained. Researchers are looking at ways to help protect people with MS from interferon-related liver enzyme activity. One recently looked at the consumption of fish and olive oils and their effect on liver enzyme activity. Experts found that liver enzyme activity changed after six months of consuming fish oil and nine months of consuming olive oil. Those who consumed the oils showed a decrease in mitochondrial ATPase activity and an increase in membrane fluidity, countering the effects of the interferons. The results showed a noticeable difference in participants who consuming the oil compared to the control group. One , recently published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine, presented findings that Chinese herbal medicine may help counter the effects of interferon-based liver damage. The report stated that interferons negatively affect a person’s qi, throwing off a person’s yin-yang balance. In Chinese medicine, this condition is called kidney yin deficiency. Typically, symptoms of this type of qi deficiency include fatigue, dizziness, poor appetite, distended abdomen after meals, diarrhea, and muscle weakness. These symptoms also can be found in people taking interferons. The patient in this case study saw results after two weeks and experienced a 50 percent improvement in their health. The research suggests that Chinese medicine doesn’t cure MS but may offer a possible complementary treatment to Western medicine. “Interferons have been used longer than any other DMTs and are still considered safe,” concluded Imitola, “but some people will have susceptibility because of this gene.” Imitola suggests patients be regularly evaluated, especially those on interferons who are at risk.

28a543a7-d394-4d26-aa31-7b48e097cffb,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice At present there is no cure for MS but various treatments exist to manage the disease At present there is no cure for MS, but management of the disease includes drug treatments to treat acute inflammatory attacks (or relapses), medications that reduce the risk of further inflammatory relapses (disease modifying therapies) and treatments to slow disease progression. Then there are also therapies that alleviate and improve various symptoms. Successful management of MS also includes a healthy diet, exercise and rehabilitation. The following information should not be relied on to suggest a course of treatment for a particular individual, and it should not be used in place of a visit, call, consultation or the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare provider. MS relapses are caused by inflammation in the central nervous system that damages the myelin coating around nerve fibres. This damage slows or disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses and causes the symptoms of MS. Acute relapses are commonly treated with steroids, which can be given intravenously or orally for only a few days. The steroids work by damping down the inflammation that is causing demyelination. Steroids are not believed to have any long-term benefit on the course of disease, but they can be effective at: Steroids do not affect the outcome of a relapse, such as any difficulty or disability that someone might experience following a relapse Disease modifying treatments are not a cure for MS but aim to prevent or reduce the number of relapses that occur in relapsing-remitting MS. Drugs commonly used to modify the disease course in relapsing MS beta interferon-1a (Avonex): injected into a muscle once a week. beta interferon-1a (Rebif): injected under the skin three times a week. beta interferon-1b (Betaferon): injected under the skin every other day. beta interferon-1b (Extavia): injected under the skin every other day. glatiramer acetate (Copaxone or Brabio): injected under the skin daily, or three times a week at a higher dose. glatiramer acetate (generic): injected under the skin daily. peginterferon beta 1a (Plegridy): injected under the skin once every two weeks. cladribine (Mavenclad): pills taken for up to five consecutive days in the first month and for up to five consecutive days in the second month, with the same course repeated a year later. This may need to be repeated at some point in the future. dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera): taken as a capsule, twice daily. diroximel fumarate (Vumerity): taken as a capsule, twice daily. fingolimod (Gilenya): taken as a capsule, once daily. The first dose is taken under medical supervision to monitor heart rate and blood pressure. siponimod (Mayzent): approved to treat relapsing forms of MS and clinically isolated syndrome. It is taken as a tablet, once a day. So far, it has only been approved for use in the United States of America by the American Food and Drug Administration. teriflunomide (Aubagio): taken as a tablet, once daily. alemtuzumab (Lemtrada): taken as two treatment courses of intravenous infusions (IV or ‘drip’). The first course consists of intravenous infusions on five consecutive days. The second course is taken 12 months later and consists of intravenous infusions on three consecutive days. Some people may need a third or further infusion. ocrelizumab (Ocrevus): taken as an intravenous infusion, with a more intense course to start and then further infusions every six months. natalizumab (Tysabri): taken as an intravenous infusion via a drip once every four weeks. It is generally administered in a hospital infusion clinic by a qualified health professional. Drugs used to modify the disease course in progressive MS So far, only a few drugs have been approved specifically to treat progressive MS. In some countries, people with relapsing forms of MS who are initially treated with one of the above drugs and are subsequently diagnosed with secondary progressive MS, can continue with their existing treatment if they still experience relapses (a phase described as active secondary progressive MS). In other countries, however, being diagnosed with secondary progressive MS can act as a trigger to stop the individual from being prescribed with drugs approved for relapsing MS. ocrelizumab (Ocrevus): approved to treat .  Ocrelizumab is also an immune suppressing or modifying drug. In primary progressive MS it targets B cells. As above, it is taken as an intravenous infusion, with two half doses in the first month followed by further infusions every six months. In some countries (notably those in Europe) there is a more restrictive license that requires people with primary progressive MS to also have evidence of inflammatory activity. This evidence is collected through MRI scans. siponimod (Mayzent): approved to treat . As with the treatments above, siponimod is also an immune modifying drug, similar to fingolimod, but with further biological effects. It is taken as a tablet, once a day. So far, it has only been approved for use in the United States of America by the Food and Drug Administration. cladribine (Mavenclad): approved to treat relapsing forms of MS including Cladribine is taken as a tablet in two treatment courses, twelve months apart. diroximel fumarate (Vumerity): approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US to treat . It is taken as a capsule, twice daily. Other drugs that have been used to modify the disease course in MS In some countries, a number of other immune suppressing or modifying treatments are still used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis, although in many countries these have been replaced by the treatments above. They can be useful for some people with MS, such as for those with more severe or frequent relapses or for people whose MS is rapidly worsening. Neurologists and people with MS need to work together to balance the positive effects of the drugs against their potential adverse side effects. These drugs include: autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT): This is usually a disease modifying drug treatment  the transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells. It is typically available through clinical trials or as experimental medicine. People with MS experience a wide range of symptoms caused by damage to their central nervous system. A number of treatments have been tested for MS symptoms and there has been some progress for particular symptoms such as spasticity and gait problems. However, testing of treatments for use in other symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment has been unclear to date. Balancing treatment benefits with the risk of side effects is difficult in symptom management. For example, a treatment that improves spasticity and pain but worsens mobility may not be worth pursuing. Neurologists need to work closely with each person with MS to find appropriate treatments for that person’s symptoms. Other symptom management techniques such as rehabilitation, energy conservation and exercise also need to be considered. Aversa, Italy, 03/2012. Like many people with MS, Stefania Salzillo finds it difficult to cope with the daily injections of Interferon-b. Her boyfriend, Ernesto Lodice, helps out providing both practical and emotional support. But access to medication was relatively quick: she received her first prescription within two months of being diagnosed. The cost of DMDs in Italy is 100% covered by the national health plan.

Then there are also therapies that alleviate and improve various symptoms. Successful management of MS also includes a healthy diet, exercise and rehabilitation. The following information should not be relied on to suggest a course of treatment for a particular individual, and it should not be used in place of a visit, call, consultation or the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare provider. MS relapses are caused by inflammation in the central nervous system that damages the myelin coating around nerve fibres. This damage slows or disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses and causes the symptoms of MS. Acute relapses are commonly treated with steroids, which can be given intravenously or orally for only a few days. The steroids work by damping down the inflammation that is causing demyelination. Steroids are not believed to have any long-term benefit on the course of disease, but they can be effective at: Steroids do not affect the outcome of a relapse, such as any difficulty or disability that someone might experience following a relapse Disease modifying treatments are not a cure for MS but aim to prevent or reduce the number of relapses that occur in relapsing-remitting MS. Drugs commonly used to modify the disease course in relapsing MS beta interferon-1a (Avonex): injected into a muscle once a week. beta interferon-1a (Rebif): injected under the skin three times a week. beta interferon-1b (Betaferon): injected under the skin every other day. beta interferon-1b (Extavia): injected under the skin every other day. glatiramer acetate (Copaxone or Brabio): injected under the skin daily, or three times a week at a higher dose. glatiramer acetate (generic): injected under the skin daily. peginterferon beta 1a (Plegridy): injected under the skin once every two weeks. cladribine (Mavenclad): pills taken for up to five consecutive days in the first month and for up to five consecutive days in the second month, with the same course repeated a year later. This may need to be repeated at some point in the future. dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera): taken as a capsule, twice daily. diroximel fumarate (Vumerity): taken as a capsule, twice daily. fingolimod (Gilenya): taken as a capsule, once daily. The first dose is taken under medical supervision to monitor heart rate and blood pressure. siponimod (Mayzent): approved to treat relapsing forms of MS and clinically isolated syndrome. It is taken as a tablet, once a day. So far, it has only been approved for use in the United States of America by the American Food and Drug Administration. teriflunomide (Aubagio): taken as a tablet, once daily. alemtuzumab (Lemtrada): taken as two treatment courses of intravenous infusions (IV or ‘drip’). The first course consists of intravenous infusions on five consecutive days. The second course is taken 12 months later and consists of intravenous infusions on three consecutive days. Some people may need a third or further infusion. ocrelizumab (Ocrevus): taken as an intravenous infusion, with a more intense course to start and then further infusions every six months. natalizumab (Tysabri): taken as an intravenous infusion via a drip once every four weeks. It is generally administered in a hospital infusion clinic by a qualified health professional. Drugs used to modify the disease course in progressive MS So far, only a few drugs have been approved specifically to treat progressive MS. In some countries, people with relapsing forms of MS who are initially treated with one of the above drugs and are subsequently diagnosed with secondary progressive MS, can continue with their existing treatment if they still experience relapses (a phase described as active secondary progressive MS). In other countries, however, being diagnosed with secondary progressive MS can act as a trigger to stop the individual from being prescribed with drugs approved for relapsing MS. ocrelizumab (Ocrevus): approved to treat .  Ocrelizumab is also an immune suppressing or modifying drug. In primary progressive MS it targets B cells. As above, it is taken as an intravenous infusion, with two half doses in the first month followed by further infusions every six months. In some countries (notably those in Europe) there is a more restrictive license that requires people with primary progressive MS to also have evidence of inflammatory activity. This evidence is collected through MRI scans. siponimod (Mayzent): approved to treat . As with the treatments above, siponimod is also an immune modifying drug, similar to fingolimod, but with further biological effects. It is taken as a tablet, once a day. So far, it has only been approved for use in the United States of America by the Food and Drug Administration. cladribine (Mavenclad): approved to treat relapsing forms of MS including Cladribine is taken as a tablet in two treatment courses, twelve months apart. diroximel fumarate (Vumerity): approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US to treat . It is taken as a capsule, twice daily. Other drugs that have been used to modify the disease course in MS In some countries, a number of other immune suppressing or modifying treatments are still used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis, although in many countries these have been replaced by the treatments above. They can be useful for some people with MS, such as for those with more severe or frequent relapses or for people whose MS is rapidly worsening. Neurologists and people with MS need to work together to balance the positive effects of the drugs against their potential adverse side effects. These drugs include: autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT): This is usually a disease modifying drug treatment  the transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells. It is typically available through clinical trials or as experimental medicine. People with MS experience a wide range of symptoms caused by damage to their central nervous system. A number of treatments have been tested for MS symptoms and there has been some progress for particular symptoms such as spasticity and gait problems. However, testing of treatments for use in other symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment has been unclear to date. Balancing treatment benefits with the risk of side effects is difficult in symptom management. For example, a treatment that improves spasticity and pain but worsens mobility may not be worth pursuing.

66afa428-1b2c-4a70-afc7-15f005798fe4,"Research provides new roadmap for repairing damaged brain cells in multiple sclerosis Research published today in the journal provides new understanding about how drugs can repair damaged brain cells that cause disability in patients with multiple sclerosis. Led by researchers at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, the study suggests new drug targets and potent early-stage drug candidates could lead to regenerative medicines for multiple sclerosis and other debilitating neurological diseases. Multiple sclerosis, a chronic and progressive disease affecting millions worldwide, is characterized by damage to the protective sheath that surrounds nerve cells. Without this insulating layer, called myelin, nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord struggle to transmit electrical impulses. As a result, multiple sclerosis patients suffer progressive loss of motor skills, vision and balance. The new study describes how drugs work to replenish myelin destroyed by multiple sclerosis. While the brain is known to have some capacity to regenerate new myelin during the early stages of multiple sclerosis, this innate repair process is overwhelmed as the disease progresses. ""Many labs, including at Case Western Reserve, had identified drug candidates that kickstart the formation of new myelin, but exactly how each of these molecules affected brain cell function wasn't clear,"" said Drew Adams, PhD, the Thomas F. Peterson, Jr. Professor of Novel Therapeutics and assistant professor of genetics and genome sciences at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. ""We were shocked to find that almost all of these previously identified molecules share the ability to inhibit specific enzymes that help to make cholesterol. This insight reorients drug discovery efforts onto these novel, druggable targets."" This study builds on prior work by co-author Paul Tesar, PhD, the Dr. Donald and Ruth Weber Goodman Professor of Innovative Therapeutics and associate professor of genetics and genome sciences at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. In work reported in 2015 in , Tesar identified a drug typically used to treat athlete's foot, called miconazole, as a potent enhancer of new myelin. In the current study, teams led by Adams and Tesar demonstrated that miconazole enhanced myelin formation by inhibiting an enzyme used by brain stem cells to produce cholesterol. Subsequent experiments identified more than 20 new drugs that enhance myelin formation by inhibiting closely-related cholesterol-producing enzymes. Surprisingly, drugs identified previously by labs across the world as enhancing new myelin also inhibited these same enzymes. ""The idea that almost all drug candidates that promote myelin repair inhibit the same enzyme targets represents a bold new paradigm for the field and may redirect the course of ongoing drug discovery efforts,"" said Tesar. New study may help improve walking capacity in people with multiple sclerosis New therapy may help treat or prevent multiple sclerosis Researchers identify a promising method to treat multiple sclerosis Normally, cellular pathways are crisscrossed, complex diagrams. But cholesterol biosynthesis is linear, said Adams, who is also a Mount Sinai Scholar. ""There is only one way in, and one way out. So when you block enzymes in the cholesterol pathway, the metabolites simply accumulate."" In the Adams laboratory, lead authors Zita Hubler and Dharmaraja Allimuthu, PhD, could detect distinct cholesterol intermediaries as they accumulated, allowing them to pinpoint which enzymes were being blocked by which drugs. Notably, several drugs accelerated myelin repair in mouse models of multiple sclerosis. Mouse experiments were performed in collaboration with Robert H. Miller, PhD, the Vivian Gill Distinguished Research Professor and professor of anatomy and cell biology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. To measure the formation of human myelin in the laboratory, the team used a new three-dimensional nerve cell culture model that closely mimics human brain tissue. Here too, the drug candidates promoted human myelin formation by blocking cholesterol pathway enzymes. A study describing this innovative model, developed in Tesar's laboratory, was also published today in . ""Together these studies provide new drug targets, new drug candidates, and new cholesterol pathway biomarkers to propel the development of medicines that can replenish lost myelin in patients with multiple sclerosis and related diseases,"" said Adams. While clinical candidates based on this work are not expected to enter clinical trials until 2019, say the authors, the new understanding of myelin repair provides a promising new path toward novel, regenerative multiple sclerosis treatments.​ Posted in: | | Tags: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Simple sugar in human breast milk can promote myelin repair in multiple sclerosis patients Study reveals new biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Study identifies determinants of unemployment in individuals with multiple sclerosis Study shows how autoimmune diseases may be targeted using Treg-based cellular therapies Novel compound appears to protect myelin and nerve fibers Anti-inflammatory therapy helps slow progression of multiple sclerosis in a preclinical model Study shows how genetic predisposition contributes to the development of multiple sclerosis Gene therapy can effectively treat mice with tuberous sclerosis complex, shows study The opinions expressed here are the views of the writer and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of News Medical.

553c405e-6e0f-4353-a68a-5bcf635893c4,"Cover Story: Cognitive Issues with Multiple Sclerosis: Research, Strategies and Support Cover Story: Cognitive Issues with Multiple Sclerosis: Research, Strategies and Support By Susan Wells Courtney Reviewed by Jack Burks, MD Cognitive changes with multiple sclerosis (MS) are fairly common. Most studies state that approximately 50 percent of individuals with MS may have some type of cognitive dysfunction, although some estimates are as high as 60 or even 70 percent. Individuals with MS who experience cognitive issues may have trouble with functions such as attention, information-processing speed, executive functions (decision making), episodic memory, and visuospatial abilities. These deficits can affect several activities of daily living, including employment, driving, social integration, and adherence to medication regimens. Concentration and attention shifting are other examples of cognition impairments observed with MS. The study of cognitive changes with MS is both extensive and varied, yet still in its early stages. A search of peer-reviewed articles reveals findings from hundreds of recent trials within the past few years, conducted in countries all over the world, and covering a wide range of objectives – from evaluating assessment tools and looking at cognition’s impact on quality of life, to identifying potential causes and determining the effectiveness of certain treatment strategies. Why is the study of cognition in MS so complex? This is because so many variables exist with this symptom and its manifestations. For example, cognitive changes can be a difficult area to measure and to compare with controls. Researchers are looking for the optimal tests to best evaluate the presence, type, and severity of cognitive deficits in different individuals with MS. The variety of tests used in these trials is impressive; for example, these may include questionnaires, dual-task evaluations, measures of eye movements, computerized tests of cognitive function, an array of physical, mental, and emotional scales, several types of neuroimaging, and more. Acclaimed author Jeffrey N. Gingold, writer of Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Second Edition (Demos Health, 2011) and Mental Sharpening Stones (Demos Health, 2008), has been able to put into words exactly what it feels like to experience a sudden lapse in cognition, where familiar surroundings are no longer familiar, and wellversed words cannot be found. In Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Second Edition, Mr. Gingold talks about his work as a successful lawyer who is suddenly faced with a host of cognitive challenges, some of which arise at the most inopportune of times. At right are excerpts from the Preface of this book, touching briefly on his experience with cognitive issues from MS. Another book written by Mr. Gingold, , also provides detailed descriptions of sudden lapses in cognition. It goes on to give valuable direction and tips for managing this symptom. Other books are available on the topic of cognition and MS, including Multiple Sclerosis: Understanding the Cognitive Challenges, which is an excellent resource written by Nicholas LaRocca, PhD and Rosalind Kalb, PhD (Demos Medical Publishing, 2006). All three of these books, as well as others, may be borrowed at no charge from MSAA’s Lending Library.

Would you be able and willing to explain it to your doctor? To your friends and family? Your spouse? When I was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1996, I envisioned being physically disabled, relegated to spending family time and a successful legal career in a permanently seated position. I never anticipated that MS would also include an invisible disability, a ‘mental wheelchair’ that would confound my recollection and distort my rational presence of mind, turning court appearances and the routine moments of life into mental quicksand.” “Without warning, many people with MS are suddenly faced with an inability to process routine thoughts. Their decision making may be stonewalled, befuddling simple conversations into a word-finding struggle. Others may lose their bearings in their own backyard or kitchen, or suddenly the face of a spouse or friend will appear unfamiliar. Then, the shroud over their memory recall lifts, defying explanation, and leaving no trace of the bait and switch. The individual’s cognitive functions have been compromised and often go undiagnosed, creating a deep chasm of unseen disability.” – Jeffrey N. Gingold, Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Second Edition Even with all of these tools, many questions still remain. For instance, when an individual with cognitive issues provides self-reported evaluations, are these answers valid? The findings from a study in France suggest that cognitive dysfunction did not compromise the reliability or validity of one’s responses on quality of life questionnaires, but these types of issues need to be considered when conducting studies on the effects of cognitive problems. Further complicating this issue is the fact that medications used for symptom management may also affect cognition as a side effect, and this too must be included in the equation. Neuroimaging is vital in determining what specific areas of the brain may be affected by MS to cause cognitive problems, as well as parts of the brain that may compensate for areas that are no longer conducting nerve impulses efficiently. Many forms of imaging technology are used for this purpose and can provide important data to researchers, enabling them to theorize the different areas of the brain that may impact cognition. Some of these types of tests are used to observe the activity in parts of the brain while a patient performs a task, and these data may be compared to someone without cognitive issues performing the same task. Additionally, the type or stage of MS can exhibit different types and degrees of cognitive changes. Researchers are studying both relapsing and progressive forms of MS, as well as individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and pediatric MS. Studies are also being conducted to determine if other symptoms may impact cognition, such as depression and other changes in mood, fatigue, poor sleep, and more. And perhaps the biggest variable in evaluating cognitive issues in MS is the day-to-day variations in symptoms as well as during times of exacerbations or pseudo-exacerbations. Demographics are another area of interest, and in this category, gender may even play a role. A Spanish study found that gender may have an impact on cognitive performance, and in this instance, found that males with MS exhibited poorer cognitive performance, largely in terms of verbal auditory memory. However, a study in Finland found that male patients with severe attentional deficits benefited more from neuropsychological intervention, as compared to females in the study. Much remains to be learned about this challenging symptom, and as illustrated in this example, a variety of outcomes may be derived from this research. As researchers delve further into the effects of cognitive issues in MS and look to find the causes, another important area of study is that which evaluates the effectiveness of potential treatments. Different forms of exercise as well as various types of cognitive training/ neuro–psychological rehabilitation are two areas of potential treatments that are being studied closely. Many trials are also underway to look at the effectiveness of the different approved and experimental disease-modifying therapies in delaying, improving, or preventing cognitive symptoms. Other treatments, such as fampridine, statins, and vitamin A, are now including changes in cognition among their study endpoints. The many variables mentioned above are just examples of the great complexity involved with learning about and treating cognitive dysfunction in MS. In the pages to follow, this article will provide excerpts from published studies from around the world, aimed at evaluating this challenging symptom and its potential causes, along with various treatment strategies. Readers may also learn about current studies and hear from two professionals who work closely with individuals experiencing cognitive issues from MS. Changes in the Brain That May Lead to Cognitive Problems What leads to cognitive problems in MS? Changes in the brain caused by damage to the myelin and axons (nerves in the brain) are the primary cause of cognitive dysfunction in MS. Research is ongoing to identify the exact locations of damage that cause cognition issues in individuals with MS. Additionally, damage to different locations of the brain affect different types of cognitive function, such as attention, information-processing speed, executive function, and memory, to name a few. The hope is that through such studies, treatments may eventually be designed to target these areas and minimize or prevent any effects that MS may have on cognition. The term “cognition” refers to a group of mental processes such as information processing, language, memory, visual perception/spatial skills, calculation skills, and executive functions (LaRocca, Sorenson and Fischer, 2000). These may be described as follows: Information-processing skills affect our ability to focus, maintain, and shift our attention from one thing to another without losing track of what we were doing, as well as managing incoming information quickly. Language refers to the ability to understand and use language appropriately in daily situations. Memory is a complex set of skills that involve learning, storage of information, and the ability to retrieve that information on demand. Visual perceptual/spatial skills allow us to do things such as recognize objects, draw, assemble things, and find our way around. Performing simple and complex math skills are involved in calculation abilities. Executive-functioning abilities enable us to get through our day by overseeing and coordinating tasks such as organization, planning, sequencing, problem solving, judgment, reasoning, monitoring our own behavior, etc. The most commonly affected cognitive processes in MS are speed-of-information processing, memory, and executive functions. Other domains of cognition can also be affected depending on where lesions are located. However, rarely are all domains of cognition impacted by MS. These are structures at the base of the brain composed of nerve cells; they are responsible for body movements and coordination. They also function as a relay center for sensory impulses to the cerebral cortex. Damage in this area may cause cognitive problems. A wasting or decrease in size of part of the brain because of disease, such as MS. Brain structure connecting the cerebrum pathways to the spinal cord, which leads to nerves in the arms and legs. It also controls vital functions, movement, sensation, and nerves supplying the head and neck. The cerebellum is at the base and the back of the brain. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance. This is the outer gray matter of the cerebrum, where many of the higher functions, such as volition, consciousness, conceptualization, motor activity, speech, and sensation, are carried out. This gray matter is mainly composed of nerve cells. This is the large, top portion of the brain that is divided into four lobes and is joined at the bottom by the corpus callosum. It controls and integrates motor, sensory, and higher mental functions, such as thought, reason, emotion, and memory. The four sections of lobes that make up the cerebrum are: The frontal lobes that are responsible for problem solving, judgment, and motor function. The parietal lobes that manage sensation, handwriting, and body position. The temporal lobes, including the hippocampus and limbic system, are involved with memory and hearing. The occipital lobes that contain the brain’s visual processing system. Part of the cerebrum, this is a plate of nerve fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, except for most of the temporal lobes. Areas of the nervous system composed mostly of myelinated nerve fibers (those having myelin sheaths) that conduct nerve impulses. Please note that portions of the information appearing in this article are described in “Cognition, Cognitive Dysfunction, and Cognitive Rehabilitation in Multiple Sclerosis,” written by Pepping M, et al, Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am 24 (2013) 663-672. Both acute inflammatory demyelination and axonal degeneration are thought to be the primary causes of MS-related disability. Although MS is often considered to be a disorder affecting only subcortical white matter, considerable evidence has shown that cortical demyelination can also occur, even at early stages of disease. Since both subcortical and cortical brain regions appear to be affected, this indicates that the nature of MS is diffuse (spread over a wide area), and may explain why a widespread set of cognitive issues are possible. What is notable about this data is the fact that MS damage leading to disability was at one time thought to be limited to white matter. The axons (nerves in the brain) found in white matter are insulated by myelin, which is the primary target of MS damage. However, when MS damage extends to the gray matter – consisting of dense nerve cells and myelin that is less apparent – additional disability, including cognition, can be affected. Gray matter damage is usually more widespread than the more well-defined white-matter lesions. This is why damage going beyond the white matter and extending into the gray matter is often referred to as “diffuse.” According to the authors of this article, despite the potential for diffuse brain involvement, MS lesions tend to locate in white matter, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. White-matter lesion load (or burden), the location of the lesions, and the amount of global or regional brain atrophy – which is the shrinking or reduction in brain volume – are of greatest interest in the study of cognitive dysfunction in MS. To follow are some examples of MS damage and the type of cognitive functions that they affect: Lesion load in areas near the cortex may cause problems with memory MS damage in the frontal lobe can affect executive function (which includes judgement and problem solving) Global and regional brain atrophy is particularly associated with cognitive dysfunction Additionally, in some studies, brain atrophy (reduction in tissue) was found to contribute more to cognitive impairment than the degree of lesion load. Other examples of damage that appear to affect cognitive function include: The width of the third ventricle, which was more highly associated with cognitive dysfunction than whole-brain (overall) atrophy A central role of the thalamus is to act as a relay station for the transmission of information between different areas of the brain; this could explain why atrophy in these areas has significant effects on key frontal-subcortical functions, which include thought and memory In some studies, cognitive impairment and atrophy of the thalamus were particularly linked to men – although the reason for this is not known To follow are a few brief findings from recent studies, which suggest that different areas of the brain may to play a role in cognitive symptoms with MS. As readers can see, researchers have differing opinions as to what areas or factors have the greatest impact on cognitive functioning. These reports are just a sampling of the many studies that have been published within the past few years. A study from Buffalo, New York states that there is a well-established correlation between and cognitive dysfunction in MS. The study’s findings also suggest that may play a role in MS cognitive decline. An international study reports that changes in the , are related to mobility and cognitive impairment. A study from Cleveland, Ohio indicates that in patients with MS, hippocampal volume (the is part of the temperal lobe in the cerebral cortex) was related to reduced memory and information-processing speed. These results highlight the role of the hippocampus in cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS and suggest that measures of hippocampal atrophy could be used to capture aspects of disease progression. A study in Switzerland indicates that can contribute to disability, including cognitive impairment in MS. Researchers in the United Kingdom linked , an excitatory neurotransmitter, with memory problems. Researchers in Canada report that they investigated the association between cognitive impairment and dysfunction in secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis. Other Factors that May Play a Role in Cognitive Problems in MS Other factors may be involved with the cognitive symptoms of MS. To follow is a listing of some of these factors that have been hypothesized or implicated in recent studies. From a study conducted in several countries, “While cognition can be affected during sensorimotor multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses, the relevance of isolated cognitive relapses (ICRs, i.e., those occurring in absence of new sensorimotor symptoms) remain poorly characterized. Here, we decided to explore the relationship between ICR, subjective evaluation of cognitive performance and long-term cognitive decline in a group of subjects with relapsing-remitting MS… Subjects who presented with an ICR [at six months into the study] presented with a significantly reduced cognitive performance at the follow-up evaluations compared with patients without ICR.” Researchers in Kansas City reported that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly use a variety of medications to slow disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and treat comorbid conditions. The use of multiple medications (polypharmacy) can be associated with additional fatigue and memory problems. The investigators recommend that patients and healthcare professionals weigh the risks and the benefits of using multiple medications at one time, given the potential for a possible increase in fatigue and cognitive issues. Investigators in Istanbul, Turkey explain, “According to the results of our study, heavy smokers had increased cognitive impairment when compared to nonsmokers. Extensive studies are necessary to further elucidate the relationship between smoking and cognitive impairment in MS patients.” Italian researchers suggest that the potential relationship with bacteria in the GI tracts and their potential influence on the immune system in neurological disease (such as MS), with an impact on pain and cognition. Mutual impact of gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) and central nervous system (CNS) functions has been recognized since the mid-twentieth century. They studied how the commensal gut microbiota influences systemic immune response in some neurological disorders, highlighting its impact on pain and cognition in multiple sclerosis. To follow are some recently reported study findings, helping to provide a broader understanding of the impact and variables in cognitive dysfunction as a symptom of MS, as well as help to identify the most useful methods of assessment. To follow are some recently reported study findings, helping to provide a broader understanding of the impact and variables in cognitive dysfunction as a symptom of MS, as well as help to identify the most useful methods of assessment. A German study explains, “Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and age-and gender-matched healthy individuals were tested with common neuropsychological tests and a , whereby a target stimulus has to be detected amongst distracting stimuli on a touch screen… [The researchers concluded that] visual search is a promising instrument for the assessment of cognitive functions and potentially cognitive changes in patients with multiple sclerosis thanks to its good discriminatory power and insusceptibility to practice effects.” Cognitive rehabilitation (discussed later) encourages people with cognitive issues to stay active and employ helpful strategies. These strategies include planning ahead and using written notes – both for memory prompts and for increased organization. In Kansas City, Missouri, researchers explain, “Eye movement difficulties in multiple sclerosis (MS) are common and may influence performance on cognitive tests… [Two] studies examined associations between a new measure of and visual/nonvisual cognitive tests. In both studies, slower eye movements were significantly associated with poorer performance on cognitive tests… Pending further research, the Speedy Eyes Test [SET], a brief, inexpensive, and nontechnical measure of speedy eye movement, may serve as a visual/oculomotor indicator of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.” The University of Illinois report that performing a cognitive task, while walking, results in a reduction of walking performance among persons with MS. Any loss in function that occurs because of doing two tasks at one time is referred to as dual-task cost, or DTC. Study investigators examined walking performance, cognitive processing speed, and symptoms of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain as correlates of DTC of walking in MS. There were significant and large declines in gait performance with the addition of a cognitive task for velocity, cadence, and step length. Walking performance might be a target of interventions for reducing the DTC of walking in MS. As noted earlier in this article, at least 50 percent of individuals with MS experience changes in cognition. This is often a challenging symptom that can impact one’s life in many ways. For instance, some individuals with cognitive issues may reduce or discontinue their participation in outside activities, they may become less socially active, and employment is often affected. At home, problems with cognition can also affect one’s ability to perform everyday activities, as routine duties may take longer to complete, things may be forgotten, and stress may arise over these changes. Other symptoms of MS, such as fatigue and depression, may have a negative impact on cognition as well. Treatment options and studies into potential new treatments are of constant interest and concern to the MS community. In this section, the possible benefits of exercise, medications, and cognitive rehabilitation are discussed. Common Questions and Answers Regarding Cognitive Issues In MS is one of MSAA’s Client Services Specialists. When asked about cognition as a symptom of MS, she talked about the experiences she has had with callers to MSAA’s Helpline. First, Mrs. Blair provided examples of client calls and inquiries that she often receives in regards to this symptom. Common questions include: Clients may report forgetfulness, not thinking as clearly or quickly as they once did, feelings of being overwhelmed, and not knowing if this is a symptom caused by their MS. Clients ask what they can do about these symptoms and who they can see for it. They want to know if this is something that will occur in the future. Next, Mrs. Blair provided the types of information that she and other Client Services Specialists provide in response to these inquiries, as follows: – thinking, memory, decision making, and judgment – especially in relation to where the disease is causing damage and inflammation in the brain. Other MS-symptom issues can also affect one’s cognition, and these might include fatigue, problems in sleep management, and depression. The side effects of medication can also have an impact on cognition. Other factors that affect cognition include anemia, infection, and thyroid problems. This does not necessarily mean that every individual with MS will experience this symptom, as everyone’s experience and symptom presentation with MS differs, but it is something that can occur as a challenge in the disease process. Evaluating and considering all factors that could be involved in the appearance and/or worsening of this symptom is important, as other health conditions can occur in conjunction with MS and may be a contributing factor to difficulties in thinking or processing information. Talking to one’s doctor can help to distinguish the cause of these changes. In regard to symptom management and evaluations for cognitive issues, the first step would be to work with his or her neurologist in discussing what these symptoms are, what’s been noticed, what types of changes have occurred, and any other concerns one may have. A neurologist may want to recommend baseline cognitive evaluations and testing, perhaps with the support of a neuropsychologist, who is a specialist focusing on mental processes, behavior, and thinking as they relate to the structure of the brain. This type of doctor can perform different types of testing in regards to one’s current rate of processing thoughts and tasks. This testing can include a series of different tests to evaluate language, memory, organization, and similar types of functions. After an evaluation, the specialist may then recommend and work with a client to create some type of cognitive rehabilitation treatment plan. This would include identifying problem areas and working on strategies for improvement in processing. Among other methods, this can include specific tasks and activities, games, exercise, and those types of things, all tailored to meet the client’s specific needs. Mrs. Blair also notes the possible impact that cognitive issues may have on daily life: Cognitive challenges can interfere with daily tasks, such as household duties and responsibilities. For instance, memory issues and forgetfulness can cause problems when trying to complete chores or errands, making and keeping appointments, staying organized, and performing other daily activities. Cognitive issues can impact one’s employment and job responsibilities, if memory and forgetfulness start to interfere with the completion of tasks. Decision making on the job can also be affected if one’s judgment and executive function are at all compromised. Management strategies may be developed to help someone who is having trouble at work as a result of cognitive problems caused by MS. Asking for accommodations in the workplace, if needed, can be very helpful. Another option is to take advantage of vocational rehabilitation services. These are specific counseling and employment-related services for those with disabilities – to identify areas of need and ways to manage and improve upon this issue. Making lists, using files, or employing other organizational methods that help to keep things in order, both at work and a home, can assist individuals in accomplishing tasks and minimizing the effects of forgetfulness and other cognitive issues. If appropriate and as needed, asking for help to delegate tasks to others can be very helpful as well. This includes having conversations with one’s healthcare team and his or her family or support network to discuss cognitive issues, ways they can be managed, recommendations for treatment, and obstacles that may be modified to accommodate for these changes. Cognitive difficulties can be a very sensitive and complicated issue to discuss with others, but it’s important for individuals with MS and their families to know that they are not alone and there are supports in place to help people cope with this symptom. With or without MS, the positive effects of exercise on cognition are frequently mentioned in the news. The following data provide interesting information on different types of exercise when studied in individuals with MS and their effects on cognitive function. Researchers from an Illinois study explain, “The current study compared the acute effects of moderate-intensity treadmill walking, moderate-intensity cycle ergometry, and guided yoga with those of quiet rest on executive control in 24 persons with relapsing-remitting MS without impaired cognitive processing speed… The present results support treadmill walking as the modality of exercise that might exert the largest beneficial effects on executive control in persons with relapsing-remitting MS without impaired cognitive processing speed. This represents an exciting starting point for delineating the appropriate exercise stimulus (i.e., modality and intensity) for inclusion in a subsequent longitudinal exercise training intervention for improving cognitive performance in this population.” Investigators from Seattle report, “The present study adopted a randomized controlled trial design and examined the effect of a physical activity behavioral intervention on cognitive and walking performance among persons with MS who have mild or moderate disability status… The current study supports physical activity as a promising tool for managing cognitive impairment and impaired walking performance in persons with MS, and suggests that physical activity might have specific effects on cognition and non-specific effects on walking performance in this population.” Research in Seattle has also set out “to determine whether there is an association between improvements in objective measures of physical fitness and performance on cognitive tests in people with multiple sclerosis (MS)… Participants in the physically improved group demonstrated improved performance on measures of executive functioning after 12 weeks of exercise. The results of this study lend support to the hypothesis that change in fitness is associated with improved executive functioning in people with MS.” Canadian researchers have found, “Exercise may have beneficial effects on both well-being and walking ability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise is shown to be neuroprotective in rodents and may also enhance cognitive function in humans. It may, therefore, be particularly useful for MS patients with pronounced neurodegeneration… “Patients with progressive MS and moderate disability were randomized to one of three exercise interventions (arm ergometry, rowing, bicycle ergometry) for 8-10 weeks or a waitlist control group… Significant improvements were seen in aerobic fitness. In addition, exercise improved walking ability, depressive symptoms, fatigue and several domains of cognitive function. This study indicated that aerobic training is feasible and could be beneficial for patients with progressive MS. Larger exercise studies are needed to confirm the effect on cognition.” As discussed in MSAA’s Winter/Spring 2013 issue of , one of the best ways to maintain cognition is to do your best to avoid new lesions by taking a disease-modifying therapy (if you have a relapsing form of MS). A number of studies with these drugs have shown some benefit on protecting cognition. Twelve disease-modifying therapies are now approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsing forms of MS. Please visit MSAA’s website at for specific information on these approved therapies. People with MS and MS clinicians have hoped that medications such as those that help people with Alzheimer’s disease might also benefit people with MS. Some of the Alzheimer’s disease medications work to block the enzyme that breaks down the nerve signal messenger acetylcholine. Although early reports suggested that the medication Aricept® (donepezil) might help cognition in MS, more thorough research has not proven this drug to be of benefit. Additional studies of the Alzheimer’s medications Exelon® (rivastigmine) and Namenda® (memantine HCl) also did not demonstrate a clear benefit. Some side effects may include stomach or bowel problems, mood changes, and urinary difficulty. Others had hoped that the herbal extract ginkgo biloba would be of benefit, however, preliminary studies have not demonstrated a benefit. Many other supplements are often promoted to help memory in the general population, but hard data is very limited even for people without MS. Be sure to discuss any drugs or supplements you may be taking with your healthcare team. Treating fatigue may reduce its effects, but does it help memory? This is a difficult area to study due to the difficulties in measuring and documenting cognitive changes, as well as the subjective nature of fatigue management. Small trials of amantadine (previously Symmetrel®) used for fatigue have not been convincing for cognitive improvement. The medication Provigil® (modafinil) and Nuvigil® (armodafinil) are commonly used “off label” for MS fatigue and have also been used by some with attention disorders. Ampyra® (dalfampridine), studied in the 4-aminopyridine form also did not demonstrate improvement. Management of fatigue by both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic means may be tried by some, and may include occupational therapy for energy-conservation techniques.” Several medications are currently being evaluated for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MS. Many of the approved DMTs have ongoing studies to determine their effectiveness in reducing cognitive challenges. Other medications and supplements are in study phases as well. To view current studies in this area of research and possibly look into participating in a clinical trial, readers may visit and search for “cognition and MS” for a full listing of related studies. This area of work is showing much potential for improvement in cognitive symptoms. Investigators and clinicians are able to address each type of dysfunction with various approaches to help people improve or compensate for any cognitive challenges they may experience. Cognition covers several different areas or patterns of function. In general, these categories include: attention, memory, acquisition and retrieval, information-processing speed, and executive function. The type and severity of cognitive dysfunction that an individual with MS experiences is largely dependent upon lesions occurring in certain regions of the brain, as well as areas of brain atrophy. Both the number of lesions (referred to as lesion load or burden) and atrophy (the shrinking of tissue or decrease in activity) are identified through neuroimaging techniques, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As mentioned earlier, a great deal of research continues to identify the specific areas of the brain that are affected by MS and lead to cognitive problems. Some studies have shown that brain atrophy, both regionally and globally, may contribute more to cognitive issues than the number of lesions. Noting that several areas of the brain may be affected, the effects of MS are thought to be widespread, and as a result, cognitive symptoms may be varied. For this reason, cognitive rehabilitation specialists must conduct an extensive evaluation of their patients prior to and throughout the time they are in cognitive therapy. This enables the specialists to design the most appropriate treatment plans for their clients, and to revise these plans as needed throughout the rehabilitation period. An assessment or evaluation of the individual seeking treatment will include many important details, such as which types of neurocognitive symptoms (such as memory-retrieval problems) and neurobehavioral symptoms (such as reduced awareness and problem-solving issues) he or she is experiencing. Additional details include test data, background information from the patient’s neurologist or other treating physician, and historical information providing details about the individual prior to diagnosis. The cognitive rehabilitation specialist will also note the patient’s reactivity to emotional concerns, as well as other symptoms that may have an impact on cognition (such as fatigue and pain). Identifying one’s abilities and preferences, along with learning about how he or she performs at school or at work, and in social situations, are also important while creating a customized treatment plan. Some of this information may be obtained through the family members and other individuals who are close with the patient. These people can also provide updates, letting the therapist know how the individual is doing in terms of applying the strategies and if any additional issues have been noted. Additional testing may be required to help with the treatment plan. An occupational therapist may assess an individual’s ability to perform activities of daily living. A speech-language pathologist may look for any deficits in areas of communication. Learning what the person with MS is able to do and what problems he or she may have is critical to the initial assessment. Many of the techniques used for cognitive rehabilitation and retraining in MS originated with those used to assist individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). While the two conditions differ in many ways and the severity of symptoms can vary greatly within either disorder, the same theories may be applied to the similar challenges of cognitive dysfunction. Whether the goals are to provide prompts that help with memory, to clear away distractions to increase attention, or to create more structure to improve executive function – or all three, along with many other strategies – these types of treatment plans are vital to improving one’s cognitive performance and ultimately increasing one’s quality of life. Senior Research Scientist, Center for Assistive Technology and Environmental Access at Georgia Tech Member, MSAA Healthcare Advisory Council What type of therapist(s) can assist with the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive issues with MS? “When an individual with MS is experiencing some type of cognitive dysfunction, he or she would most often contact a clinical psychologist, neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, and/or speech-language pathologist.” In general, how often might someone need to see a therapist, and does insurance usually pay for such appointments? “It really depends on the focus of treatment, but most often cognitive rehabilitation works best when people participate on a frequent basis. The challenge in providing services is that it mostly results in few options for insurance coverage. Most insurance companies do not cover cognitive rehab services for people who experience deficits as a result of a non-acute neurological condition, including chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (and others such as congestive heart failure, autism, cerebral palsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post chemotherapy). The research on the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for MS that is used for coverage determination with most of the insurance companies reflects that it is experimental or that it does not have enough evidence to demonstrate medical necessity.” Do you have any personal thoughts or guidance that you would want to give anyone with MS who may be experiencing cognitive issues? “I would recommend for the individual to have a discussion with his or her medical provider first to review the list of medications to determine the impacts these may have on cognitive function. The medical provider can also discuss other potential sources of cognitive issues, such as nutritional deficits, poor sleep habits or sleep disorders, stress, etc. Individuals should be sure to talk with their medical provider before trying any alternative supplement that promises improvement in memory or other cognitive function. People experiencing cognitive issues should still try to maintain social connections and outlets that keep them mentally active and challenge their memory, attention, language, and problem-solving abilities.” Although occasional forgetfulness, difficulties recalling specific names, or losing things is fairly common, real problems with memory and learning can become a huge hurdle in accomplishing tasks, succeeding at school or work, and even accomplishing activities of daily living. For some people with MS, the ability to sift through several ideas and identify the most important ones becomes significantly affected. These individuals may then be greatly challenged to recognize what needs to be remembered and then be able to store this information so it is easily retrievable when details need to be recalled. One of the best methods for improving memory is to take notes; the value of doing so can’t be overstated. Notes should be taken wherever and whenever information needs to be remembered – and this can include doctor appointments, school and work, at home, and while performing various activities such as shopping or attending meetings. The notes should be well-structured and kept in the same location, so they can always be immediately accessed. Developing a system is important to make note-taking a part of the routine, and prompts should be included for both taking and reviewing notes regularly. Using a Day Planner-type of booklet or smartphone is ideal for keeping things organized. Dividing the information into smaller sections and practicing by re-reading and/or reading aloud helps to better store the information and enable one to retrieve the information when needed. When information cannot be processed quickly, many functions such as social interactions and day-to-day activities are affected. Having a conversation can become labored and uncomfortable; trying to follow directions can at times be almost impossible; and having to think of more than one or two concepts at the same time can lead to frustration and confusion. Fortunately, people who experience reduced information-processing speed may take steps to help minimize the effects of this type of dysfunction. Consciously increasing one’s attention on the task, on the person speaking, or on whatever the event may be, while reducing any distractions, are good first steps (strategies for improving attention are noted in the next section). Another helpful tip is to take notes and ask questions – when appropriate – to assist with comprehension and understanding. Additionally, using different forms of communication to reinforce the same information can also assist with speedier comprehension and retrieval. This might include seeing things visually (through attending an event, as well as viewing videos, charts, outlines, etc.), hearing the information presented either in person or on a recording, and written information, which includes asking people to email main points as a follow-up to a lecture or reviewing notes from the event. Without the ability to focus and provide uninterrupted attention, one’s ability to listen, learn, and retain information is immediately compromised. Perhaps the most important strategy for improving attention is to reduce or eliminate any distractions. This may be accomplished by looking at the area where attention is needed and evaluating potential distractions. Whether they consist of sight or sound – necessary steps should be taken to reduce or eliminate these diversions. Examples include cleaning away extra clutter from a room, reducing the number of people present during a gathering, and/or turning off the TV and other electronic devices. Earplugs or headphones may also be used if needed to reduce noise or other competing distractions. Sometimes people have thoughts that interfere with attention to the matter at hand. With this type of distraction, a good plan is to write down any ideas that might be monopolizing one’s thoughts and try to set them aside to focus on at a later time. Attention may also be improved through identifying, organizing, and scheduling tasks and activities. This type of cognitive rehabilitation enables someone to perform daily functions efficiently and minimize how often he or she needs to shift attention to switch directions or return to repeat an action. Instruction on how to become better organized and step-by-step plans on how to start and complete projects are key strategies for improving one’s ability to employ good judgement and be able to solve problems efficiently. Structuring one’s schedule with reasonable timing to complete different projects can help to avoid becoming overwhelmed with everything that needs to be done. To reduce the pressure of working under a tight deadline, individuals may want to double or triple their estimate of time required, just to avoid any extra stress. This is partly due to the fact that people with MS sometimes feel that their sense of time is diminished, and duties might be more time-consuming due to fatigue and other factors. Scheduling time to work when interruptions are at a minimum is also important. Individuals with MS who experience problems with executive function need to be flexible with their schedule. While staying on track is worthwhile, people with MS need to be prepared for changes in symptoms that may disrupt their plans for the day, week, or potentially longer. Even when not experiencing any type of changes in symptoms, schedules should be regularly re-evaluated and revised as needed. Individuals should also be aware of their own physical limits as well as the fact that they may be more easily distracted now than prior to their diagnosis. Individuals with MS who are experiencing cognitive difficulties may benefit greatly by staying aware of their limitations and continually learning new ways to counter the effects of this challenging symptom. Through the knowledge that cognitive issues could be slowing them down, causing frustration and forgetfulness, as well as other implications, individuals may be empowered by regularly learning and employing new techniques. Doing so can lead to a better quality of life and even greater success with their endeavors. Furthermore, relationships may become more positive as plans are put into place to counter any problem areas. Other urgent responsibilities, such as taking one’s medications at the correct times and dosages, may be more closely followed through planning, organization, and the added attention the individual knows is necessary. When asked about cognitive problems experienced by people with MS, MSAA Chief Medical Officer Jack Burks, MD, reflects on the many challenges that some individuals with MS may face while coping with this often unexpected symptom. At the same time, he is pleased to explain that several proven strategies, as well as new and emerging therapies, are becoming available, all of which may provide the help needed to counter these types of symptoms. Dr. Burks explains, “Many people with MS tend to focus on their physical challenges and minimize or deny their cognitive issues, although they may realize some difficulties at work, at home, or with social interactions. Their adherence to MS medications may also suffer. “When finally evaluated by neuropsycho-logical testing, they are often surprised by the degree of difficulties they experience during the tests. They often believe that if they look and feel ‘pretty good,’ drive safely, get satisfactory job performance evaluations, and can handle their checkbook, they must not be cognitively impaired. Once the problem is identified, they are initially upset. However, after they learn how to deal with the issues, they are relieved by the ability to accomplish even more. “The bottom line is that cognitive problems may exist… but so do many opportunities and strategies that are available to help people perform their cognitive tasks. This article provided insights into the enormous research efforts related to MS cognition and ideas to improve one’s daily living skills. Additionally, we are learning that MS disease-modifying therapies may also help MS cognition, which is good news of course for individuals with relapsing forms of MS. However, some medi-cations are now being studied for cognition in individuals with progressive forms of MS, which is certainly good news for individuals with this type of MS as well.” Cognitive rehabilitation and retraining offers many valuable strategies for achieving goals and attaining optimum quality of life. With this in mind, anyone who believes that he or she may be experiencing changes in cognitive function is encouraged to consult his or her neurologist about the potential benefits that this type of therapy may provide.

8754112c-7541-4f3d-826e-d1e32b9ffbb5,"— More than half of the multiple sclerosis patients in a closely watched study had narrowing of some of the neck veins leading from the brain, researchers said. by More than half of the multiple sclerosis patients in a closely watched study had narrowing of some neck veins leading from the brain, researchers said. On the other hand, so did 22.4% of healthy controls in the first large study to test a new theory about the disease: that it's caused by such abnormally narrow veins, a condition dubbed ""chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency."" Nevertheless, Robert Zivadinov, MD, PhD, of the University of Buffalo, said in a university news release that he is ""cautiously optimistic and excited"" about the results, which were originally scheduled to be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April. ""The data encourage us to continue on the same course,"" he said in the statement. ""They show that narrowing of the extracranial veins, at the very least, is an important association in multiple sclerosis."" Zivadinov was traveling and not immediately available for further comment. The study drew intense interest when it began enrolling patients last year, because the theory that abnormal veins play a role in multiple sclerosis -- as yet unproved -- is the first major shift in thinking about the disease in decades. () But experts cautioned that the press release doesn't contain enough details to allow scientists to judge the validity of the results, which in any case are partial and preliminary. ""From the press release, it's very difficult to analyze this in any way,"" said John Richert, MD, executive vice president for research and clinical programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. ""It makes you want to see more,"" he told . The release, which has not been subject to the usual scientific peer review, contained data on 441 volunteers, including 280 with multiple sclerosis, most of them adults. However, that's a small fraction of the more than 1,700 volunteers, including 1,000 adults and 50 children with the disease, who are expected to be enrolled. It also was limited to data on ultrasound scans of the volunteers. The results of magnetic resonance imaging, to test other aspects of the theory, were not given. Blocked veins in the volunteers were studied according to five criteria, other experts noted, but what they were wasn't reported, so that it was impossible to tell if they differed from earlier studies. The release also said the researchers saw a correlation between venous insufficiency and the progression of the disease, ""but even that statement is difficult to interpret exactly,"" Richert said. The Buffalo study is a follow-up to research conducted by Paolo Zamboni, MD, of the University of Ferrara in Italy, which showed chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency to be strongly associated with multiple sclerosis. Zamboni also conducted a small surgical intervention trial that appeared to show a benefit to patients from opening up the veins. The Buffalo report was a surprise mainly because its results were ""less impressive"" than Zamboni's findings, according to Salvatore Sclafani, MD, of SUNY Downstate College of Medicine in Brooklyn. Sclafani said in an e-mail that the difference may be a function of a ""steep learning curve"" in reading and interpreting the results of the ultrasound scans of volunteers' veins. ""My own personal experience with the ultrasound examinations is that they are quite difficult to perform,"" he said ""I have now studied many patients with MS and all have had abnormalities of the veins,"" said Sclafani, who has recently begun studying the issue. The Buffalo results vary slightly, depending on how some ""borderline"" volunteers are counted, the release said. If the 10.2% of volunteers whose results were classed as borderline were included in the normal category, the incidence of venous insufficiency was 56.4% in the multiple sclerosis patients and 22.4% in the controls. On the other hand, if the borderline results were excluded, the proportion of affected patients rose to 62.5%, compared with 25.9% percent of healthy controls. But the finding that a proportion of healthy controls had venous insufficiency needs further investigation, Zivadinov said in the release. This article was developed in collaboration with ABC News.

0dca2b8d-fb18-4f31-89ac-206ba885d9f7,"Rehabilitation interventions in multiple sclerosis: an overview , –() Multiple sclerosis is a complex, heterogeneous disease associated with long-term disability. Despite the availability of advanced disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies that may decrease activity and progression of disease and alleviate complaints to a certain extent, there is still a need for comprehensive rehabilitation interventions in order to reduce sequels and symptoms of the disease on personal activities and social participation to achieve the highest possible independence and the best quality of life. Timing and setting of rehabilitation interventions should be selected individually depending on disease phase, functional deficits, personal requirements, as well as specific goals. In addition, limitations and disease-specific characteristics that may influence rehabilitation outcome should be noted. Rehabilitation interventions should be considered early for maintaining functional capacity and reducing risk for losing important abilities or independence. Due to gradual failure of adaptive compensatory mechanisms along the course of disease, benefits of rehabilitation interventions are generally higher in earlier phases of MS. Inpatient and outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial in improving disability, participation and quality of life despite progression of the disease. Good evidence exists for different specific interventions improving physical and cognitive performance. Other important issues responsible for beneficial effects of comprehensive rehabilitation in MS include education, instruction, and information of patients and caregivers. Comprehensive assessment of health domains in MS patients using standardized framework and common language for describing the impact of disease at different levels, using International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) core sets may increase the knowledge of needs of these patients for more efficient and adapted rehabilitation interventions meeting these individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS. ICF core sets may increase the knowledge of more efficient and adapted rehabilitation measures meeting more properly individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS.

The team (J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues) report their findings in (). Although this type of observational study cannot provide the same level of evidence as a well-designed, controlled clinical trial, Ari Green, MD (University of California, San Francisco) suggests in an that, based on this and other studies, “The signs are strongly pointing to the benefits of early and aggressive treatment to forestall damage.” He cautions that the study did not show that disease modifying therapies can stop MS completely since a significant number of people studied did develop secondary progressive MS.  UPDATE 2/22/19: A second study has reported that people with MS prescribed early, high efficacy therapies tended to have less progression of disability than those who started with traditional disease-modifying treatments. The team (Katharine Harding, PhD, Neil Robertson, MD, and colleagues at Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK) reported their results in (). DETAILS Many people who are diagnosed with eventually transition to a course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. There has been some evidence that early and ongoing treatment with MS is the best way to reduce current and future disease activity, but specific information is needed about the timing and best types of therapies to achieve the optimal impacts against the disease. A team of researchers including J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues sought to determine the association between the use, the type of, and the timing of disease-modifying therapies with the risk of conversion to the secondary progressive phase of MS.   Investigators looked at records of 1,555 people with relapsing-remitting MS who began treatment with disease-modifying therapies from 1988-2012, or who remained untreated, and who had been followed for at least four years. Treated individuals were identified in MSBase, an international online registry that currently includes records of more than 60,000 people with MS from hundreds of clinics worldwide. Untreated individuals for the study were selected from the database of the University Hospital of Wales.   People who took fingolimod, alemtuzumab, and natalizumab (“higher-efficacy therapy” therapies with greater effectiveness but possibly more risk of side effects) were compared with those initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (traditional, first generation disease-modifying therapies). Those initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta within five years of MS onset were compared with those initially treated after five years. Investigators also looked at whether treatment was escalated from traditional to higher-efficacy within five years or later.   The outcome being measured in all these comparisons was conversion to secondary progressive MS, which was defined as an increase of 1 point on the EDSS scale of disability progression (if the EDSS score was 5.5 or less) or .5 point (if the EDSS score was more than 5.5). This EDSS increase had to occur without a relapse and be confirmed after 3 months or more.   The investigators report that people who were treated with any type of disease-modifying therapy were significantly less likely to later develop secondary progressive MS than those who remained untreated. In addition, they reported that initial treatment with the higher-efficacy therapies was associated with a significantly decreased risk of conversion to secondary progressive MS compared with treatment with initial treatment with traditional therapies. They also found that the risk of developing secondary progressive MS was significantly lower when treatment was started within five years of MS onset compared to after five years, and when treatment was escalated from traditional therapy to a higher-efficacy therapy in the first five years compared to later.   The team (J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues) report their findings in ().   Although this type of observational study cannot provide the same level of evidence as a well-designed, controlled clinical trial, Ari Green, MD (University of California, San Francisco) suggests in an that, based on this and other studies, “The signs are strongly pointing to the benefits of early and aggressive treatment to forestall damage.” He cautions that the study did not show that disease modifying therapies can stop MS completely since a significant number of people studied did develop secondary progressive MS.    Further studies are underway in this area. The is one of two studies funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute that will help inform treatment decisions around whether, and which, people with MS would most benefit from early, possibly more risky aggressive therapy. The other study is Determining the Effectiveness of Early Intensive versus Escalation Approaches for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DELIVER-MS). UPDATE 2/22/19: Further Results on Early, Aggressive Treatment A second study has reported that, among 592 people with MS, 104 who were prescribed early high efficacy therapies had more favorable outcomes as measured by the EDSS, compared with 488 people who started with traditional disease-modifying treatments.

The new paper was online on October 22, 2019 and its full content may be read by anyone free of charge. DETAILS The international (MSOAC) was launched after a National MS Society-supported task force met in late 2011 to determine how to address the need for better measures of MS-related disability in clinical trials. It became clear that collaborating with the (C-Path) would create a clearer path forward. C-Path is a nonprofit partnership with the FDA, whose aim is to accelerate the pace and reduce the costs of medical product development by creating new standards for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of therapies.   Participants in MSOAC include representatives from academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the National Institutes of Health, and people living with MS. Over the multi-year, $3 million project, MSOAC conducted literature reviews and gained perspectives of people with MS, along with data from clinical trials, to assess measures that could be used to detect and evaluate the disability status of individuals with MS in terms of walking, vision, cognition and manual dexterity. have been published that review published evidence for the validity of the four measures and the extent to which they can detect changes that are “clinically meaningful” (reflecting functions that may impact an individual’s activities of daily living).   : Another key activity has been to collect data from MS clinical trials, then standardize and analyze the data to identify the optimal measures for inclusion in a proposed outcome measures tool. This effort involved one of the largest pooled evaluations of clinical trial data in MS to date, involving 14 MS drug trials with 12,776 participants with MS. Based on this combined trial data, the MSOAC team has published a paper in () that validates the four measures, used alone or in combination, as sensitive clinical outcome measures for MS clinical trials. The paper and its full content may be read by anyone free of charge.   The four clinical measurement tools validated in the paper detect changes in walking (timed 25-foot walk), vision (low-contrast letter acuity), cognition (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) and manual dexterity (Nine-Hole Peg Test).    MSOAC has submitted applications to the FDA and EMA for regulatory approval of the measures. Upon qualification of the tool set for use as a primary outcome measure in clinical trials, it will be made freely available to investigators.        Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

2098dd21-a88a-4c70-a492-b8d41dc0ac32,"What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting For more than three decades, multiple sclerosis (MS) experts from around the world have gathered in a European city each fall to share the results of their research at the annual meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). This year’s gathering was held in Berlin, Germany, October 10-12, where the findings were presented from hundreds of studies on topics ranging from the safety and effectiveness of investigational medications to the role of diet in controlling symptoms of MS. Along with the annual meetings of organizations such as the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), the ECTRIMS meeting is an important forum for researchers and clinicians to compare notes, generate hypotheses, make plans for future research, and discuss how best to translate study findings into improved patient care. This ECTRIMS 2018 research update article highlights more than 30 studies with important implications for people with MS. While these studies represent only a small sampling of the research presented at ECTRIMS, they were selected for their relevance to the current and potential near-term management of MS, and with a view toward addressing a variety of topics. Accordingly, the study findings reported below are organized into eight categories: We hope this information will be of interest and value. For additional information about MS, symptoms, and symptom management, as well as MSAA’s programs and services, please visit or call . Questions for MSAA’s Client Services department may be emailed to . And as always, please note that your healthcare provider remains your best source of information on the medical and overall management of your MS, and should be consulted with any questions you may have or before making any changes to a treatment regimen or other aspects of your approach to living with MS. For readers who are not familiar with study protocol, to follow is a helpful listing that provides a brief explanation of the different clinical trial phases. Phase I studies are primarily concerned with assessing the drug’s safety. This initial phase of testing in humans is done in a small number of healthy volunteers, and is designed to determine what happens to the drug in the human body – how it is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. Once a drug has been shown to be safe, it must be tested for efficacy. This second phase of testing may last from several months to two years, and involve up to several hundred patients. Phase II studies are often “double-blinded,” meaning that the participants, medical staff, and investigators are not told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo. In a Phase III study, a drug is usually tested in several hundred to several thousand patients, usually in multiple medical facilities around the world. Phase III studies typically last two or more years. Only after a Phase III study is successfully completed can a pharmaceutical company request FDA approval for marketing the drug. Phase IV clinical trials are conducted after a drug has been approved. Participants are enrolled to further monitor safety and side effects, while evaluating long-term efficacy. Ongoing decline in relapse rate seen in long-term study of Gilenya People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who took Gilenya (fingolimod) for five years or more had low rates of disease activity during that period, with gradually decreasing relapse rates, researchers reported. The investigators drew on data from LONGTERMS, an open-label, single-arm, extension study assessing the ongoing safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 0.5 mg of Gilenya in RRMS patients who had participated in earlier clinical trials of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT). The LONGTERMS study evaluated 754 patients. Sixty-seven percent of study subjects were women, and the mean time since MS diagnosis was 4.8 years. The annualized relapse rate in the population declined from 0.26 at one year to 0.16 at five years and to 0.14 for those patients for whom data were available at the 10-year mark. Of the 697 patients for whom five-year data was available, 78 percent were free from confirmed disability progression in the six months prior to assessment. The most common adverse events reported were viral upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and hypertension. The most common serious adverse events were MS relapse, basal cell carcinoma, and pneumonia.  Charting rise in treatment-satisfaction scores with switch to Aubagio Patients switching to Aubagio (teriflunomide) from other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) showed improvements in treatment satisfaction up to 96 weeks after switching, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Phase III TENERE study extension and the non-interventional TAURUS-MS I study. Both studies employed the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), which was administered at baseline and every 24 weeks thereafter in the TENERE extension study, and at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 in TAURUS-MS I. More than 650 patients from the two studies switched to 14 mg/day of Aubagio after having been on other DMTs. From baseline (initiation of Aubagio) to week 96, Global Satisfaction scores increased for patients from both studies. The average change from baseline was 9.1 in TENERE and 15.3 in TAURUS-MS I, with both changes being statistically significant. Tecfidera altered composition of gut microbiome in 12-week study  Tecfidera (delayed-release dimethyl fumarate) altered the gut microbiome in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who took the oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) over 12 weeks. The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other microbes found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system. Recent research suggests that the composition of the microbiome, as defined by the presence and number of various microbes, may affect the course of MS. In a study involving 36 patients with RRMS, 17 types of microbes were significantly altered in MS patients compared with 165 healthy controls. In particular, people with MS had lower levels of compared to the healthy controls. Twenty-seven of the study participants received Tecfidera, while nine received an injectable DMT. At two weeks, subjects receiving Tecfidera reported a worsening of GI symptoms compared to baseline, but this impact on symptoms was not seen at 12 weeks. Meanwhile, at 12 weeks, the Tecfidera patients had an increased abundance of . Similar alterations were not seen in the participants receiving an injectable DMT. Researchers continue to investigate not only the role of the gut microbiome in MS, but also the impact that individual microbes may have on disease course. As those investigations continue, this study adds to the understanding of the interplay between MS medications and the composition of the microbiome. As the investigators note, “It could therefore be speculated that direct effects on the gut microbiome are part of the therapeutic actions” of Tecfidera. Exploring treatment outcomes in African Americans relative to Caucasian Americans Do treatment outcomes on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) differ between African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CA)? A team of researchers posed that question in the context of the widely held view that African Americans often have a more aggressive form of MS than Caucasian Americans, and therefore may require more efficacious therapies.   To find answers, those investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of the CombiRx study, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated combined use of interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate in relapsing-remitting MS. The CombiRx study followed patients for three years. Eighty-eight percent of the study’s 1,008 patients identified as Caucasian Americans, and 7 percent identified as African Americans. At the start of the study, the AA participants had worse disability and a higher total burden of brain/spine lesions than CA participants. Once on treatment, however, there was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. While that finding is welcome news, the researchers noted that there is a need to study larger numbers of African-American patients to further explore the relative efficacy of DMTs in the AA and CA populations. They added that research into the causes of disparity in disease burden prior to treatment also is warranted. Support for early initiation of Betaseron in clinically isolated syndrome Starting Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) sooner rather than later in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) yields benefits up to 15 years after initiation of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), researchers report. Investigators in the BENEFIT 15 study monitored long-term outcomes in people who had CIS and at least two lesions on MRI that were suggestive of MS. In an earlier, related study, those individuals were randomly assigned to receive Betaseron (early-treatment group) or placebo. After either two years or conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS), patients in the placebo group were offered Betaseron (delayed-treatment group). Of the 468 participants who had been randomized in the initial study, 261 enrolled in a follow-up study 15 years later. One hundred and sixty one were in the early-treatment group and 100 were in the delayed-treatment group. In the delayed-treatment group, Betaseron had been initiated an average 1.5 years after randomization. The annualized relapse rate in the full analysis set was 0.18 over 15 years. Notably, however, the risk of relapse in the early-treatment group was 19-percent lower than in the delayed-treatment group, and the risk for conversion to clinically definite MS by Year 15 was 31-percent lower. The researchers concluded that their results “support a sustained benefit of early intervention in reducing the risk of relapse and conversion to CDMS.” Tracking the efficacy of interferon beta-1a for up to 10 years With many people with MS now on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for several years, there is an increasing focus on the long-term safety and effectiveness of those medications. Researchers recently evaluated the ongoing efficacy of one of the first DMTs, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, in 1,240 individuals receiving care at four MS centers throughout Italy. (In the United States, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a is available as Rebif.) The primary endpoint of their study was the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) as measured by clinical relapse, confirmed disability progression, and MRI for brain/spine lesions. Seventy-one percent of the study participants were women, and the participants’ mean age at the start of treatment was 34.6 years. The patients were followed for an average of approximately 7.5 years. Seventy-four percent of patients remained on treatment at two-year follow-up, just under half were still on therapy at the 5-year mark, and 28 percent were on the medication after 10 years of follow-up. At two years, 44 percent of patients did not have evidence of disease activity, while 25 percent were free of disease activity at five years and 19 percent were at 10 years. The researchers concluded that those percentages constitute “further evidence of sustained interferon beta-1a efficacy in modifying the natural course of MS.” Plegridy use in real-world setting consistent with clinical trial findings A post-approval, real-world analysis of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) in 963 patients with relapsing-remitting MS yielded safety and efficacy findings consistent with those from the pre-approval clinical trials of the DMT. The interim analysis from the Plegridy Observational Program included data on 242 newly diagnosed individuals and 721 people who had been diagnosed one year or longer before study entry. The newly diagnosed (ND) patients generally were younger than their non-newly diagnosed (NND) counterparts (mean age 37.7 years versus 46.0 years) and had less disability, but had experienced more relapses in the prior year. Treatment discontinuation rates were similar for the two groups (31 percent for ND patients versus 32 percent for NND patients). The most commonly cited reasons for treatment discontinuation in both groups were adverse effects and lack of efficacy. The most frequently reported adverse effects were redness at the injection site and influenza-like illness. Eighty-two percent of newly diagnosed individuals and 85 percent of those who were non-newly diagnosed were relapse-free up to two years after starting Plegridy.   Glatiramer acetate slows disability progression for up to 10 years Glatiramer acetate, which is marketed as Copaxone and in generic formulations, including Glatopa, showed enduring benefit over the course of 10 years of therapy, making it a cost-effective option for long-term treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, according to British investigators. The researchers drew on clinical data and cost-effectiveness models to assess the impact of glatiramer acetate (GA) on patient health and health-system economics. The analysis included 752 people treated with GA and another 898 people with MS who were not treated. The investigators found that, relative to no treatment, GA use led to a 17-percent reduction in disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Further, among people treated with GA, there was only a 1.2-percent difference in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores in six-year and 10-year data. The study’s authors concluded that the 10-year analysis “continues to support the long-term efficacy of GA in terms of disability, based on EDSS, and utility with no apparent evidence of a waning in treatment effect” making it highly cost-effective based on prevailing prices in the United Kingdom.   Reductions in relapse rate, MRI disease activity after three-to-five years of Ocrevus Two studies of people with relapsing-remitting MS show that use of the disease modifying therapy (DMT) Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) for three-to-five years is associated with reductions in annualized relapse rate (ARR) and several MRI measures of disease activity, according to researchers. The studies followed patients who had participated in the Phase III OPERA I and OPERA II trials that led to FDA approval of Ocrevus. In those 96-week studies, patients were randomized to receive either Ocrevus or interferon beta-1a. Upon completion of the Phase III trials, patients were able to enter an open-label extension study in which they would either continue on Ocrevus, if they had been assigned to receive that medication initially, or switch from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus if they had been in the comparator group. Among those who received Ocrevus during the initial two-year trial and for three years afterwards in the open-label extension, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) declined from 0.13 in the year before the open-label extension to 0.07 at Year 3 of the extension (or five years, in total, from starting Ocrevus). For individuals who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the ARR decreased from 0.20 in the year before switching to 0.07 at three years post-switch. At five-year follow-up, the proportion of people with clinically defined disability progression was lower in those who had been on Ocrevus for five years than for those who had taken the medication for three years. Meanwhile, in people who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the adjusted number of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI was 0.48 lesions/scan prior to switching medications, and decreased to rates of 0.007, 0.004, and 0.004 after one, two, and three years, respectively, on Ocrevus. Individuals on Ocrevus for the full five-year period maintained low numbers of lesions on MRI. Compared to patients who started Ocrevus after two years on interferon beta-1a, those treated with Ocrevus from the outset had less brain atrophy as measured by whole brain volume, grey matter volume, and white matter volume on MRI. No MRI disease activity in most study subjects after six years on Lemtrada Most people with relapsing-remitting MS who began therapy with Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) after having received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in a clinical trial were free of MRI indications of disease activity six years after switching medications, researchers reported. The TOPAZ trial followed 143 patients who initially had received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in the Phase III CARE-MS study. These individuals entered an initial extension study in which they switched to Lemtrada, which was given in doses of 12 mg/day for five days at baseline, and then 12 mg/day for three days 12 months or more later. The participants were then eligible to enter TOPAZ, an additional five-year extension study. In TOPAZ, investigators had the option of giving these patients additional courses of alemtuzumab or another disease-modifying therapy as they thought necessary. Eighty-two percent of the participating patients completed Year 2 of TOPAZ (Year 6 after starting Lemtrada). Fifty-seven percent did not receive an additional dose of Lemtrada or another DMT during those six years. The annualized relapse rate at Year 6 after Lemtrada initiation was 0.19 percent. Further, 69 percent of patients were free of MRI disease activity, and 89 percent did not have new gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Meanwhile, safety results were consistent with those seen in Lemtrada-treated patients in the initial CARE-2 study and its two-year extension. Overall, researchers noted, Lemtrada improved clinical and imaging outcomes in patients who switched to the medication after receiving subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, and those improvements were sustained over six years in the absence of further treatment. Assessing the long-term safety and effectiveness of Tysabri An analysis of more than 6,100 people with relapsing-remitting MS who have taken Tysabri (natalizumab) for several years shows the long-term effectiveness of the medication and indicates that its safety profile remains consistent with ongoing use, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to characterize the Tysabri patient population and assess the medication’s impact on relapses and other measures of MS activity. At the time of the analysis, the program included 6,149 participants. Their median exposure to Tysabri was 38 doses, and median follow-up time was slightly over five years. Fifty-two percent of patients had discontinued the medication. The patients’ annualized relapse rate declined by 89 percent while on Tysabri, from 1.99 prior to starting the medication to 0.21. The greatest reduction was seen in the approximately 10 percent of patients who had not taken another disease-modifying therapy (DMT), but those who had taken one or two prior DMTs saw ARR reductions of 93 percent and 87 percent, respectively. Fourteen percent of these individuals experienced at least one serious adverse effect, with infections/infestations being the most commonly reported issues.   Evobrutinib shows favorable impact on lesion count, relapse rates Evobrutinib, or M2951, is an orally administered compound being investigated as a potential treatment for immune-mediated diseases including MS, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Evobrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the development and function of immune cells, including B lymphocytes and macrophages. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers announced 24-week results of a double-blind, randomized, 48-week, Phase II study of evobrutinib in patients aged 18 to 65 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) with relapses. In the study, 267 participants were randomized to receive evobrutinib 25 mg daily, 75 mg daily, 75 mg twice daily, placebo, or open-label Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate 240 mg twice-daily. (The Tecfidera group served as a reference arm in the study, and no formal comparisons were made between people in that group and those receiving evobrutinib or placebo.) The study’s primary endpoint was the sum of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 24 weeks was a key secondary endpoint, as were safety assessments. The primary analysis comparing the evobrutinib groups to the placebo group was planned to occur when all randomized patients either reached 24 weeks of treatment or had discontinued the study before that point. Ninety-one percent of patients completed 24 weeks of therapy. The study met its primary endpoint, with patients in the evobrutinib 75-mg once-daily and 75-mg twice-daily groups having significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions than placebo patients at each time point studied. For weeks 12-24, the mean total of such lesions was 3.85 in the placebo group, 4.06 in the evobrutinib 25 mg once-daily group, 1.69 in the evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily group, and 1.15 in the evobrutinib 75 mg twice-daily group. The evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily and 75 mg twice-daily groups also had greater reductions in the ARR than placebo. No treatment-associated infections or significant reductions in lymphocyte counts were observed in those receiving evobrutinib. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in more than 5 percent of patients, included increased liver-enzyme levels in patients receiving 75 mg of evobrutinib twice daily, but these changes were reversible and did not cause symptoms. French study details impact of biotin on disability measure, walking speed   Biotin is a vitamin involved in energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, including the activation of an enzyme in myelin synthesis. In the MS-SPI study, a high-dose, pharmaceutical-grade biotin known as MD1003 reversed MS-related disease disability in 13 percent of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). To assess the efficacy and safety of MD1003 in a real-world setting, as opposed to in a clinical trial such as MS-SPI, researchers monitored outcomes in primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients at a clinic in France. From January 2016 through May 2018, 220 individuals with progressive MS who were receiving care at the clinic in Toulouse, France, received 300 mg/day of the oral medication. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented data on the first 91 patients to complete one year of follow-up. Those patients’ mean age at baseline was 59.5 years. Sixty-two percent were females, and 70 percent had SPMS. The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline was 5.9, and their mean timed 25-foot walk time was 50.7 seconds. At the end of one year of treatment with MD1003, 23 percent of the participants had an improvement in their EDSS score and 23 percent had a 20 percent or greater improvement in the time it took them to walk 25 feet. During the one-year period, 11 percent of patients had active disease, such as a clinically defined relapse, a gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesion on MRI, or both. Researchers said, “This real-world study supports the growing body of evidence that MD1003 is an effective and safe treatment for PMS.”  Gauging the impact of ozanimod on early and advanced relapsing-remitting MS Ozanimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulator that targets two cell-surface receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5, suspected of playing a role in multiple sclerosis. The agent was evaluated in two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. In SUNBEAM, individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) received ozanimod on a daily basis (either ozanimod HCl 1 mg or 0.5 mg) or a weekly injection of interferon beta-1a for 12 months or longer. In RADIANCE, the participants were randomized to the same treatments, but for 24 months. More than 2,600 people participated in the trials. A post hoc analysis presented at the 2018 ECTRIMS meeting examined how outcomes in SUNBEAM and RADIANCE differed between patients with early RRMS and advanced RRMS. The designation of early MS was based on a composite baseline profile that included three years or less from diagnosis, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤3.5, and use of one or no disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The early MS group consisted of 1,392 patients, while there were 1,267 people in the advanced MS group. Thirteen hundred and ninety-two patients were included in the early MS group. Key differences between the two groups at baseline included median years since diagnosis (0.5 years for the early group and 5.7 for the advanced group), median EDSS (2.0 versus 3.5), mean relapses within the last year (1.4 versus 1.2), and mean count of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (1.77 versus 1.67). In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) was lower in those who received ozanimod than in patients who received interferon. In the early group, the ARR was 0.149 for those on 1 mg of ozanimod HCI, 0.200 for the ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg patients, and 0.285 for the interferon group. The annualized relapse rates in the advanced RRMS group were 0.217 for ozanimod HCI 1 mg, 0.277 for ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg, and 0.363 for interferon. MRI measures of disease activity also favored ozanimod over interferon. In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, individuals receiving either dose of ozanimod had lower mean numbers of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and new/enlarging T2 lesions at 12 months than patients receiving interferon. Surveying real-world experience with treating MS with rituximab Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and several forms of cancer. Because it depletes B cells, which are key components of the immune system, some neurologists prescribe rituximab to treat MS, although it currently does not have FDA approval specifically for use in MS. Investigators at the University of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain MS Center examined the safety and effectiveness of rituximab in 125 people with MS. The participants had an average age of 44 years and had an MS disease duration of slightly more than 10 years. Seventy-two percent were female; 62 percent had relapsing-remitting MS. With an average follow-up of 40.6 months, most individuals had six or seven rituximab infusions. While on rituximab, 16 percent of participants had infections requiring an emergency department visit, and 11 percent had infections necessitating hospitalization. Thirty-seven percent of patients had an infusion reaction on their first infusion that required interrupting the infusion, but that percentage fell to 14 percent on the second infusion. None experienced an infusion reaction that required hospitalization. Two individuals (1.6 percent of the total) were diagnosed with cancer after starting rituximab. While on rituximab treatment, 5 percent of patients had a clinical relapse, 2 percent had an enhancing lesion on MRI, and – based on detailed analysis – 8 percent of those with available MRI data had a new lesion on T2 imaging. Those findings prompted the researcher to conclude that rituximab appears to be a safe and effective option for long-term MS treatment. Two trials to examine the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS Two Phase III trials will assess the safety and efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody ofatumumab relative to Aubagio (teriflunamide) in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Like Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), ofatumumab targets the CD20 marker on the surface of B cells. The identically designed ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II trials have enrolled a combined total of 1,884 patients in 37 countries. Study participants will be randomized to receive either 20 mg subcutaneous injections of ofatumumab every four weeks (following an initial regimen of three 20-mg subcutaneous doses per week in the first 14 days) or 14 mg of Aubagio taken orally once daily. Annualized rate of confirmed relapses is the primary endpoint for both trials. Secondary outcomes include confirmed disability worsening and MRI-related measures. Enrollment for both studies has been completed. Both employ an adaptive design in which study duration is not fixed over a specified period of time but rather is dependent on reaching a pre-specified number of events. Phase II study to explore impact of opicinumab in targeted population Early-phase research into investigational agents often identifies patient groups that have a better response to treatment than other patient types. That was the case in the Phase II SYNERGY study of opicinumab. Opicinumab is a human monoclonal antibody active against LINGO-1, a protein that exercises an effect on the differentiation and regeneration of central nervous system cells. SYNERGY investigated the infused medication’s safety and efficacy as an add-on therapy to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS. The study found that a patient subpopulation (defined by disease duration and baseline MRI findings) was associated with an enhanced response to treatment. The Phase II AFFINITY trial is following up on those findings by taking a closer look at the impact of opicinumab in that patient population. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers provided an overview of the AFFINITY study’s design and demographics. AFFINITY is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 750 mg of opicinumab administered intravenously every four weeks compared to placebo as an add-on to DMTs. The trial will last for 72 weeks. The population being studied encompasses people aged 18-58 years with relapsing-remitting or secondary-progressive MS who have had MS for 20 years or less and who have Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 2.0 and 6.0. Further, the study’s inclusion criteria specify a clinical relapse in the last four to 24 months or brain MRI evidence of disease activity in the past two years. Because opicinumab is being studied as an add-on therapy, patients must be stable on interferon beta, dimethyl fumarate, or natalizumab for at least six months. Further, the patients must have brain imaging findings indicative of lower myelin content and more preserved tissue integrity in brain T2 lesions. The study’s main endpoint is Overall Response Score, an integrated assessment of disability improvement and worsening based on the EDSS and other measures. The study began in September 2017, and remains open to enrollment. Study investigators noted that AFFINITY is expected to enroll approximately 240 participants at roughly 150 sites in about 25 countries. Cladribine is an oral medication approved for use in several countries for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). It is not approved for that use in the United States. The medication has an unusual dosing pattern in that it is taken for up to 20 days over the course of two years. It also has an unusual mechanism of action: it targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to a reduction in the total count of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented an update on the safety profile of Cladribine Tablets in people with RRMS who took the medication as a monotherapy (without use of other MS agents at the same time). The study assessed data from three clinical trials and a patient registry, and reported information collected through May 2017. The analysis included data on 923 patients who received cladribine at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg and 641 patients who received placebo. It focused on the incidence of adverse events per 100 patient-years. The cladribine group had an average age of 36.5 years at study enrollment; two-thirds of the cladribine patients were women. The rate of serious treatment-emergent adverse events per 100 patient years through May 2017 was 3.88 for the cladribine group and 2.24 for the placebo group. Adverse events occurring at a higher rate in the cladribine group than in the placebo group included abnormally low levels of lymphocytes (a white blood cell) and serious infections, including serious herpes zoster. Study authors concluded that the updated safety profile “was generally consistent with that from two years prior,” adding, “No new major safety findings were identified in the updated dataset, where patients were followed for up to 10 years.”  Elezanumab: Phase I trial supports the need for larger studies A small, early-stage study of a monoclonal antibody directed at a new target in MS showed the medication to be well-tolerated, but did not demonstrate a clear-cut impact on symptoms, highlighting the need for further testing in a larger population, the study’s authors said. Elezanumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa), which has been shown to inhibit key processes in neurologic regeneration and functional recovery following inflammation or trauma. A Phase I placebo-controlled, 29-week study randomized 20 people with MS to one of three treatment groups or to a placebo group. Elezanumab was administered intravenously every four weeks for a total of four doses. Patients in the three active treatment groups received an initial “loading” dose followed by maintenance doses of either 150 mg, 600 mg, or 1800 mg of elezanumab. Twenty-five percent of all participants reported headaches. Most individuals receiving elazanumab did not report a clinically significant improvement in, or worsening of, MS symptoms. However, testing showed that as levels of elezanumab in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased, levels of free soluble RGMA decreased, while total RGMA (both free and antibody-bound) increased in step with CSF elezanumab exposure. Investigators concluded that, “Additional long-term studies are required to elucidate elezanumab efficacy in a more robust patient population.” Survey results reveal people with multiple sclerosis want more information on preventing brain atrophy Cognitive changes are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting more than half of those living with the condition. A new survey examines the topic of brain volume loss, known as brain atrophy, in people with multiple sclerosis. The survey, conducted by the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) and sponsored by Celgene, included more than 1,300 people with multiple sclerosis or someone responding on their behalf. Based on the survey findings that were presented at ECTRIMS 2018, maintaining cognitive function is the second most common concern for respondents. Only the prevention of physical disability progression was reported more often (45 percent). The survey findings also suggest that there is a high level of interest in better understanding how brain atrophy may impact disease progression. Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that they have not talked to any member of their medical team about brain atrophy, and only 20 percent reported being moderately or very satisfied with the amount of information available on potential ways to prevent brain atrophy. These study results indicate that additional education on the topic of brain atrophy is an area of interest to the MS community. Global initiative seeks to improve shared decision-making and communication between healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners Navigating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a global initiative that aims to improve outcomes for people with MS through the global adoption of strategies that optimize therapeutic decision-making. This initiative also aims to improve the way that healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners communicate around benefit and risk in the management and treatment of their disease. In order to better understand the potential barriers to effective communications and shared-decision making, the Navigating MS Steering Committee developed and distributed a survey to MS healthcare professionals and people with MS to identify potential and perceived barriers to successful shared-decision making in MS practice. A total of 73 neurologists, 104 nurses, and 1,184 individuals with MS have responded to the survey. Differences in the perception of neurologists, nurses, and people with MS regarding the adequacy of resources required for successful shared-decision making was demonstrated in the data received. Four main areas of contention were identified: lack of education, resources, time, and variable involvement of the interdisciplinary (healthcare) team. Nurse respondents indicated a perceived proficiency with shared-decision making and adequacy of education and training to fulfil this role. However, 73 percent of people with MS who responded indicated a strong preference for engagement with the neurologist in discussing the benefits and risks of treatment options. There was no clear consensus regarding the degree to which decision-making is accurately a collaborative process within the interdisciplinary team. Half of the nurses stated that the decisions were shared, although people with MS reported a lot of ambiguity and variation in how actively involved they were in the decision-making process. Despite neurologists stating the main barrier to shared-decision making was lack of time, 49 percent of people with MS strongly disagreed that time was a barrier to shared-decision making, with 60 percent of nurses reporting clinic timeframes as adequate. The disagreement in perceptions among clinicians and people with MS demonstrates an ongoing need to educate both healthcare professionals and patients on best practices in adopting a shared-decision making approach to discussions around treatment decisions. The Navigation MS initiative has received funding from Biogen, Celgene, EMD Serono, Genentech, Novartis, and Sanofi Genzyme.  It might seem paradoxical that people who experience fatigue should exert themselves in order to have more energy, but that is exactly what researchers found when conducting a study of 60 individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and fatigue. The 47 females and 13 males participating in the study had an average age of 30 years and a baseline mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score of 56.7. They were divided into two groups, balanced by age, gender and FSS score. People in the first group walked on a treadmill three times a week for six weeks, with the pace increasing from easy to brisk during each session and the duration of exercise increasing from 10-15 minutes initially to 25-32 minutes by the end of the study. People in the second group did not exercise but instead received amantadine, a medication used to treat movement disorders. While the people who did not exercise had no meaningful change in their FSS scores over the 12-week course of the study, those assigned to the exercise group saw their mean FSS score improve to 35.67 (versus 56.7 for all at the start of the study) at six weeks and to further improve to 29.11 at 12 weeks. The researchers concluded, “A specially designed walking exercise program with gradual increments in time and speed for 12 weeks can improve fatigue in RRMS patients. A long-term follow-up is recommended to verify the maintained effect on such improvement.”  Securing the long-term benefits of activity in MS: “Keep going!” Is the improvement in quality of life typically seen in exercise and activity programs for people with MS sustained after those programs end? That is the question a team of investigators posed in a study of 56 women with MS. Their answer: Yes, over the short term; and no, over the long term. The women, who had an average age of 34.5 years, were divided into groups, with some assigned to exercise and others to engaging in leisure-time activities such as making crafts. The women completed surveys to measure their sleep quality, fatigue, and depression, if any, at the start of the study and at several points afterward. Women in both groups showed improvement in sleep, fatigue, and depression at the end of the study and four weeks after its conclusion. By the 20-week mark after the study, however, MS symptoms had begun to increase, leading the researchers to comment that “continuous exercising appears to be of utmost importance for keeping symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances stably low.” There is growing evidence that diet plays a role in the MS disease course, but researchers continue to debate how best to study the issue in a scientifically rigorous manner. One practical concern is whether sufficient numbers of people with MS will be able to adhere to restrictive diets long enough for studies to yield valid results. A six-month pilot study involving 36 women with MS provides encouraging news in this regard. The study assigned 18 of the women to the intervention group – and to following a restrictive, modified Mediterranean diet for six months. The women in this group participated in training sessions with a nutritionist and attended monthly meetings to assess and encourage their adherence to the diet. The other 18 participants acted as a control group; they participated in educational seminars. All 18 women in the intervention group completed the study, with a 90.3-percent mean self-reported rate of adhering to the study diet. At the time of the ECTRIMS meeting in early October, 14 of the 18 women in the control group had completed the six-month study, three more were on track to finish in the weeks just ahead, and there was only one anticipated drop out. Sixteen of the 18 women in the intervention group reported that their overall health had benefited from following the study diet, with 14 women reporting benefit in terms of specific MS symptoms. The intervention group subjects also showed greater improvement than the women in the control group on measures of fatigue and MS impact. The researchers concluded, “It is feasible to enroll MS patients into a rigorous dietary intervention study requiring significant commitment and randomization and reasonable to expect high adherence to this type of dietary program utilizing educational methods to promote adherence.” They added, “Larger-scale clinical trials to assess the role of diet for symptom management and even as a disease modifier in MS are feasible and warranted.” Exploring the impact of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet on MS The benefits of a ketogenic diet – a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan – have long been promoted by some people with MS and their physicians, while others have said that there has not been adequate research to support the approach. A recent pilot study sought to add to the knowledge base on the subject by assessing how following a ketogenic diet for six months affected 20 people with relapsing-remitting MS. Researchers reported that no subjects experienced worsening diseases – as assessed by clinical symptoms and brain MRI – while on the diet. Further, fatigue and depression scores improved from baseline, and body-mass index and insulin levels declined. While additional data is being collected, those findings prompted the investigators to conclude that ketogenic diets appear to be “safe, feasible, and well-tolerated” in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Despite the old saying, misery doesn’t actually appear to love company  The more social support a person with MS enjoys, the less pain is likely to interfere with his or her life – even as the intensity of pain increases. That is the bottom-line finding of a study involving 196 people with MS who reported experiencing pain. Study participants had an average age of almost 54 years; 82 percent were women and 18 percent were men. Researchers assessed the participants’ degree of social support, pain intensity, and pain interference at the start of the study and again after an average of roughly 3.5 years. As would be expected, as the intensity of pain changed, so did the extent to which pain caused interference in a person’s life. However, the study also found that “higher levels of perceived social support [are] associated with subsequent improvements over time in pain interference in individuals with MS and pain, even when controlling for changes in pain intensity.” In simpler language, the more friends, family members, and other meaningful relationships a person has in his or her life, the less he or she will experience interference from pain, even when the pain is intensified. Conversely, the investigators found that “lower levels of social support prospectively predict increases in pain interference.” Commenting that their findings “are consistent with other research indicating multiple health benefits from the presence of social support,” the study’s authors noted the importance of investigating means to enhance such support for people with MS who are experiencing pain. Pain and sleep issues are top reasons for cannabis-based product use in people with MS Roughly one in five people with MS surveyed by researchers at a Canadian hospital reported using cannabis-based products (CBP) on a regular basis, with pain and sleep problems as the most commonly cited reasons for use. Investigators at the University of British Columbia MS clinic distributed surveys on CBP use to 600 patients attending the clinic from January to March 2018. Two hundred and fifty-nine participants completed and returned the survey. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were female, and the most common age range of respondents was 45 to 55 years. Sixty-one percent of respondents reported never using CBP, and another 16 percent said they rarely did so. Of the remainder, 15 percent reported daily use, 4 percent said they used CBP weekly, and 3 percent said they used CBP on a monthly basis. Researchers noted that responder bias might cause overestimation of CBP use. Seventy-one percent of regular CBP users said they sought relief from pain with a cannabis-based product. Help with sleep also was cited by 71 percent of respondents. Other reported reasons for use included mood (44 percent), spasticity (40 percent), tremor (11 percent), and bladder dysfunction (9 percent). Ninety-five percent of regular users said they had obtained relief of symptoms from CBP. More than half (52 percent) had discussed their CBP use with a neurologist; 35 percent had not tried other symptomatic medications. With the increasing liberalization of state laws regarding use of cannabis-based products for both medical and recreational purposes, CBP is likely to be an increasingly accessible option for more and more people with MS. Reassurance on use of DMTs in women pursuing pregnancy “How will this medication affect my ability to conceive, and to deliver a healthy baby?” It’s a question MS clinicians hear frequently when talking with women of child-bearing age about starting a disease-modifying therapy (DMT). A recent retrospective analysis by Israeli researchers provides reassuring news with regard to this important concern. The investigators examined data on 125 women with relapsing-remitting MS who had a total of 219 live births between 2002 and 2017. They divided the women into three groups: those who were not treated with a DMT in the three months prior to becoming pregnant; those who were treated in the three months prior to pregnancy; and those who were treated during pregnancy. After adjusting for factors including age, disease severity, and known fertility problems, the researchers found that use of DMTs shortly before and during pregnancy did not affect fertility or pregnancy outcomes. They found no significant differences between women in the three groups in terms of the need for fertility treatment and time to pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, complications during pregnancy, or incidence of relapses during pregnancy or in the first year following delivery. The investigators concluded, “The decision regarding DMTs treatment in RRMS patients during child-bearing years should not be influenced by the question of pregnancy in the near future.” However, treatment discussions along with pregnancy planning should always be discussed with one’s healthcare team in advance. Additionally, none of the DMTs have been approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy and certain DMTs may present more of a risk than others. Sexual dysfunction common in women with clinically isolated syndrome   More than one-half of women with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a common precursor to MS, experience sexual dysfunction. That is the main finding of a small study in which Egyptian researchers gathered data from August 2011 to June 2017. Noting that sexual dysfunction has been reported in between 40 percent and 80 percent of women with multiple sclerosis, the investigators sought to determine the frequency of the condition in CIS. They had 43 women with CIS complete the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire (MSIQ-19), as well as instruments assessing fatigue, cognitive function, anxiety, and depression. Fifty-six percent of the women reported at least one manifestation of sexual dysfunction. Eight cited a lack of sexual interest or desire, five reported less intense orgasms, and four said they experienced inadequate vaginal lubrication. Beyond those primary aspects of sexual dysfunction, women also reported that symptoms of CIS – such as urinary and bowel problems and difficulty with concentration – interfered with their sexual function. Lack of confidence about sexuality and fear of rejection also was reported to contribute to sexual difficulties. Fatigue and depression were significant predictors of sexual dysfunction. Further, women who reported sexual dysfunction were older than those who did not report such difficulties (27.5 years versus 23.1 years), but the two groups did not differ in terms of occupation, educational level, or location of brain/spine lesions on MRI. The investigators noted that four patients reported experiencing sexual dysfunction before the emergence of neurological symptoms of MS. As researchers continue to “fill in the gaps” on the many facets of CIS, this study points to the importance of patients talking frankly with clinicians about the full range of issues they may be experiencing. Is menopause a turning point for MS disease course? Relapse rates declined but disability increased in the years following menopause among 148 women with relapsing forms of MS, suggesting that “natural menopause could be a turning point to a less inflammatory, progressive phase of disease,” according to researchers. Those findings and conclusions are from an observational study conducted at 16 MS centers across Italy. Women were followed for a period of roughly 3.5 years before and after natural menopause, meaning menopause not brought about by surgical removal of the ovaries. Ninety-three percent of the women received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during that period. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the women declined from 0.22 before menopause to 0.13 following menopause. However, their scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) increased from a median of 2.0 at menopause to 2.27 two years later and to 2.46 four years after menopause. On the EDSS, an increasing score reflects increased disability. The investigators noted that the findings are in keeping with the results of earlier research they have conducted with a smaller group of women. The impact of endocrine (or hormonal) factors on MS is a focus of considerable research, and studies such as this one suggest avenues for further investigation, while also helping clinicians and patients better anticipate changes that may await across one’s lifespan.  Promising results for stem cell therapy in “aggressive MS”  Clinicians long have faced a challenge in treating “aggressive MS” – a term used when one’s MS is marked by frequent relapses and rapid progression of disability. An international study presented at the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting offers hope that removing, treating, and re-infusing a patient’s own hematopoietic (blood-tissue forming) stem cells may be a safe and effective first-line therapy for this uncommon but extremely debilitating type of MS. The study involved 20 patients treated in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, Italy, and the United States. None had received more than three months of standard DMT treatment before undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or AHSCT (with autologous signifying that the cells came from the patient, rather than from a donor). The patients, who ranged in age from 19 to 52 years, had a median EDSS score of 6.5 prior to treatment. They were followed for a median time of 30 months after transplantation. The median improvement in their EDSS score from pre-treatment to last follow-up was 2.5, which was a statistically significant difference. None had a clinical relapse following transplant. Three patients had new lesions on MRI at their first follow-up visit, but no other new or gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen on later scans. The investigators reported that, “There were routine toxicities, but no treatment-related mortality.” The researchers added that the study results demonstrate the potential role of AHSCT as a first-line treatment for aggressive MS. Additional studies will continue to provide answers on the potential benefits and risks of this intriguing experimental treatment. Low immunization rates against respiratory disease in people with MS Pneumonia and influenza pose serious threats in the setting of MS, but more than 70 percent of people with MS in an Argentine study had not been vaccinated against either illness, researchers reported. The investigators noted that age, smoking, severe disability, and use of immunosuppressive medications all increase the risk of respiratory infections, adding that people with MS have a risk three-times higher than that of the general population for contracting community-acquired pneumonia. Against that backdrop, the researchers conducted an online survey of 220 people with MS and 62 healthy controls. The proportion of people not receiving either the pneumococcal pneumonia or influenza vaccine was high in both groups – 71.4 percent of people with MS and 79 percent of the healthy controls. Among the unvaccinated patients with MS, 80 percent were on a DMT medication, 31 percent smoked or had only recently stopped smoking, 22 percent were aged 50 years or older, and 11 percent had severe disability. The investigators concluded that the low vaccination rates combined with the high prevalence of risk factors among MS patients underscores the need to develop consensus policies on immunization in people who have MS. Impact of magnetic stimulation on balance in people with MS Using a coil held over a person’s head to direct magnetic stimulation to the brain improved balance and walking ability in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and a related movement disorder, according to a group of Egyptian researchers. The investigators studied 43 people with RRMS and truncal ataxia, a condition that can diminish balance and the ability to walk. In the first phase of their study, half of the participants received actual magnetic stimulation while the other half received a sham treatment. In the study’s second phase, all subjects received 12 sessions of magnetic stimulation over four weeks every third month, for a total of 48 sessions. Each session lasted several minutes. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and 10-Minute Walk Test (10MWT) were used to measure the impact of treatment, with patients assessed before, during, and at the completion of treatment. The researchers reported that from the pre-treatment baseline to the last session, participants saw a 36-percent improvement in the 10MWT and a 46-percent improvement in BBS score. These individuals also saw improvement on an imaging assessment of white matter in the brain. The investigators said that the adverse effects of treatment were mild and transitory, with two people reporting nausea, two experiencing dizziness, and three having headaches. Based on these findings, the researchers said that non-invasive, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a long-term beneficial effect on improving balance in people with MS and ataxia.

The experimental study began about 13 years ago as a last resort for patients who fail to improve on drug therapy and who suffer severe symptoms of MS. Snippets of the results have been published “here and there,” said, neurologist Dr. Mark Freedman, one of the leads of the program at The Ottawa Hospital, but its never been published in its entirety. Try refreshing your browser, or. Ottawa doctors behind breakthrough multiple sclerosis study No specific date has been set for its release, but the team’s findings are far from secret. With MS not returning in any of the 24 participants, patient success stories appear in news media across the country. Since the original study’s completion, about another dozen patients have been treated with all of them showing the same results. Eliminating MS completely and watching patients improve surprised both Freedman and Dr. Harold Atkins, a bone-marrow transplant expert, who started the study. The two originally set out to monitor the development of the disease and find a way to treat it. Their theory was this: Wipe out the entire immune system, reboot it with a transplant of the patient’s own bone marrow and wait for MS to regenerate. This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. “We thought we might be able to intercept one of the signals that initiates the disease and that would then give us a clue on how to treat it,” Freedman said. He jokes that they “had, in effect, failed because the disease never came back. No one expected to see zero disease activity after the transplant.” Patients from Vancouver to Newfoundland, who had given up hope, became part of the original 24, including third-year medical student Alex Normandin from Montreal. The aspiring doctor noticed alarming symptoms of fatigue, numbness and problems with balance and co-ordination. Researchers at the Montreal Neurological Institute confirmed he has a particularly aggressive form of MS, an unpredictable and degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system. Most patients do not become severely disabled because the illness moves slowly. But in Normandin’s case, the destruction was so fast that doctors expected him to need a wheelchair within months. Normandin, however, learned of the cutting-edge treatment run by Freedman and Atkins. He became patient No. 19 in the experiment and had his transplant in Ottawa in December 2008. The procedure has its risks. One patient died in an earlier phase of the trial. It was in 2001 or 2002, Freedman recalled, saying the death was due to the pill form of the drug Busulphan. Used early on in the experiment, the drug attacks the liver twice, both when it enters the body and again when it leaves. But within a year, the team had found that a new intravenous version of the drug improved patient safety tremendously. This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Freedman had the task of trying to scare patients by telling them the risks. “My job was to talk everybody out of it,” he said. “It really is the hardest thing they’ll have to do in their lives. It is a bit of a gamble, but with the fantastic team we have in Ottawa, it’s less of a gamble.” All participants showed dramatic improvement, and none reported relapses, according to a study on the Freedman-Atkins treatment by a team of MS researchers at the Neuro and the Université de Montréal. Plus, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no new lesions in the brain, “no new MS disease activity,” according to findings published in the latest issue of Annals of Neurology. For Normandin, he’s now a family physician in private practice on the West Island and no longer takes medication for the illness. His fatigue and balance problems continue to diminish daily. But despite such dramatic results, none of the MS researchers in this study is calling the procedure a cure. For one thing, it is not known whether the treatment is good at stopping other kinds of MS, explained neurologist Amit Bar-Or of the Montreal Neurological Institute and McGill University and the study’s principal investigator. Also, bone-marrow stem-cell transplants to treat MS are not approved outside of clinical trials because while the disease itself is not deadly, the procedure is fatal in as much as five per cent of patients. But Freedman questions the risk rate. He says the five-per-cent figure was from data collected in the 1990s as the team prepared for the experiment. That number has since dropped to about one per cent, he said. This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. In addition to medical advancements, by comparing the immune responses in patients before and after the treatment, researchers discovered a key biological target for new therapies that might be able to provide similar benefits without the risks associated with knocking out someone’s immune system to facilitate a bone-marrow transplant. Several studies have already noted that in MS patients, the body’s immune system attacks its own cells. Overactive T cells (a type of white blood cells called lymphocytes) — that are responsible for defending the body against bacteria, viruses and other parasites — can also damage myelin, the protective insulation covering nerves. The concept is straightforward, Bar-Or explained. To fight an infection, different types of T cells mount a quick response, then other T cells quickly ratchet back that response, he said. But in auto-immune conditions, including MS, this regulation goes awry and the body attacks itself. Researchers have zeroed in on a particular subset of T cells, called TH17 cells, that have a substantially diminished function following the experimental transplant. The discovery could help researchers target treatment in MS patients generally. “We are cautious in not claiming we have figured out all cells responsible for all relapses in all MS patients,” Bar-Or noted. “Keep in mind these patients have very aggressive MS, so maybe TH17 are particularly important in these patients.” This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Emerging treatments, however, are already attempting to target TH17 cells, but the story is even more complicated, Bar-Or said. “We don’t know everything about them (TH17 cells) even in terms of basic immunology. It’s likely that within the TH17 subset there may be particular bad guys ... It would be nice to know which because we need to have these cells some of the time. Getting rid of all of them all of the time, may not be completely safe.” Both the clinical study at the Ottawa Hospital Multiple Sclerosis Research Unit and biological study in Montreal were funded by the Research Foundation of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada. Canada has one of the highest rates of MS in the world — affecting about 55,000 to 75,000 people. Normandin says his illness has been a blessing in disguise, giving him a unique perspective not found in medical text books. “It changed my whole outlook on life. It definitely affects the way I see patients. I’m more sensitive in how to talk to them and more empathetic dealing with chronic diseases.” He was once on a career track where the focus was work, but now “life balance” is everything and he is grateful for the treatment that gave him his life back and allowed him to work in a clinic where he can spend as much time as necessary talking to patients.

People with MS, like everyone else, should seek optimal health and wellness. The pursuit of wellness is a continuous process throughout life. MS presents special challenges to this, however, and the means to achieve this goal will differ for each MS patient. Q. Why do MS patients need a Primary Care physician? Multiple Sclerosis patients need MS monitoring and treatment by a neurologist with experience in MS. In addition to this we now know that age appropriate health screens, vascular risk management, immunizations and management of other health conditions are equally important needs not routinely addressed by the neurologist. There is increasing evidence that other medical conditions such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia may influence the level of disability from MS. Therefore, another health provider is needed. These services can be provided by a primary care physician. There are various special barriers to primary care faced by people with MS. First, it may be difficult for MS patients to go to certain types of facilities because of physical limitations. Second, some MS patients require frequent visits to deal with MS problems, so adding additional health care visits for preventive services may seem burdensome for practical and financial reasons. Third, many primary care physicians defer to the Neurologist to manage medical problems and are less proactive or aggressive in dealing with general health issues, simply because the person has MS which can be viewed as the major health issue. Despite these potential barriers, wellness and preventive medical care are extremely important for people with MS, and strong efforts should be made to ensure they are provided for. Q. Are there primary care issues that are more common in MS patients? Osteoporosis is common in MS patients and may be related to use of steroids and or limited ambulation. Vitamin D deficiency is common in MS patients and common in this latitude of the globe. There is some evidence that Vitamin D deficiency may play some role in triggering MS, or even in disease activity once a person has MS. This is not certain at the present time, but is another important reason to maintain normal Vitamin D levels (see subsequent section here on Vitamin D deficiency and The Mellen Center Approach for Vitamin D Management). Managing vascular risk factors (such as hypertension, cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and smoking) is not only important for cardiovascular health, but recent data shows that risk factor modification may be important in limiting MS disease severity as well (Marrie et al). Depression, fatigue and sleep disorders are very common in MS patients. Q. Why would health promotion be relevant to MS patients? Health promotion: Setting goals and establishing health promoting behaviors, like exercise and stress management, helps MS patients maintain employment, improves conditioning, improve the quality of life, and could even lessen the severity of MS. There is good evidence that regular exercise is important in MS, so we encourage specific planning for exercise programming in the MS population. Q. Is Vitamin D Important in MS patients? (Please also refer to Mellen Center Approach for Vitamin D Management) There are various findings that point to a possible role of Vitamin D in MS patients: Sunlight and UV radiation exposure are inversely correlated with MS and relapse risk Calcium and Vitamin D pretreatment in animal models results in inability to induce EAE(animal model of MS) Timing of MS relapses frequently are in the fall and spring with falling Vitamin D levels Children with CIS and low Vitamin D have an increased risk of relapses Prevalence of MS is lower than expected in high latitudes with high fish intake There is some research pointing to the fact that Vitamin D may be immunomodulatory Lowered Vitamin D levels have been associated with greater disease activity on the Brain MRI The recommended dose of Calcium and Vitamin D for the adult population is 1200mg a day of Calcium and at least 600 mg a day of Vitamin D. Doses of Vitamin D3 in the 2-4000IU ranges, or higher, may be needed depending on the level of Vitamin D, target is near 50. One should also encourage regular sun exposure, 10 minutes daily or 30 minutes a few times a week then put on sunscreen for extended periods in the sun Patients with MS have multiple risk factors for osteoporosis: impaired gait, sedentary lifestyle, use of steroids to name a few. Daily long term steroid use has been associated with increased risk of osteoporosis yet pulse steroids given every few months has not been associated with bone degradation. In general we avoid daily oral steroids in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown that MS patients have a high risk of osteoporosis even with a normal gait. Bone loss can be prevented by: proper nutrition, weight bearing exercise as able and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. MS patients should be on Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation if they have had a fracture, use frequent steroids or have gait impairment. Patients can be referred to their Primary Care MD for management of bone health as there are multiple prescription medications and various approaches available to promote bone health. Note that recent publications have shown that patients with MS have more of a tendency to osteopenia or osteoporosis than normal controls which is not related to steroid use. Also studies have shown that pulse steroids do not seem to alter bone health to a significant degree. Q. Are Over the Counter Supplements helpful in MS? MS patients should avoid immune stimulants such as: Echinacea, oral garlic tabs, high dose Zinc as the goal of supplementations is to promote a healthy immune system. Patients may want to take a multivitamin to supplement their nutritional intake. Fish oils, Evening primrose or Flax seed oil will increase their daily intake of Omega 3 Fatty Oils which may be immune modulators. B complex and CoQ 10 tablets may help improve MS fatigue. Q. Are there any special nutritional issues related to MS? At this time there is no direct evidence of a nutritional etiology related to the development of MS. That being said there are studies linking high intake of saturated fats, high calorie and intake of animal products with increased risk of MS. There are other studies showing a potential protective effect of a plant based diet that is rich in omega 3 oils and anti-oxidant vitamins. We can educate the patient in ways to reduce the saturated fats and optimize the diet such as: limits meats, add fish a few times a week, increase whole grains, fruits and vegetables. MS patients have high rates of constipation, patients should be educated to the need to eat 3 regular meals, eat high fiber meals, have adequate water intake and again eat fruits and vegetables regularly. General recommendations include: Each day eat at least 5 servings of fresh or cooked vegetables and fruits and at least 2 servings of whole grain products. The recommended goal for daily fiber intake is 25-35 grams. The recommended daily fluid intake is 8, 8oz glasses of water or noncarbonated noncaffeinated fluids a day. The daily fluid intake recommendations may need to be adjusted according to the daily Caffeine intake, medical conditions and activity level. If the patients would like detailed information they can be referred to a Nutritionist. There have been multiple studies looking at isolated nutritional supplement to help the MS, no particular positive finding occurred when patients added an isolated supplement of: Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Fish oils, evening primrose oil or Vitamin A. The VA series showed that Veterans with MS are more likely to be obese than non MS patients. Higher BMI (Body mass index) was found in patients that were married, male, employed and had diabetes or arthritis. Dr. Marrie found 60% of MS patients to be overweight and this was associated with physical disability, even mild level of disability had higher risk of being overweight. Importantly, obesity is associated with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes, and these conditions are associated with increased risk of physical disability from the MS. Obesity has been found commonly in pediatric MS population. Yes, exercise is helpful and safe for a MS patient. MS patients, with all level of abilities, can work with PT and OT to help improve physical functioning and to maintain a home exercise program for conditioning. Exercise has been shown to improve the MS patients’ quality of life including improvement both physical and emotional health. MS patients typically report a sedentary lifestyle; this is not always related to the level of disability. MS patients have reported less exercise during times of worsening MS symptoms. Fatigue of MS can improve with regular aerobic exercise, even at low levels therefore regular aerobic activity should be encouraged prior to starting a medication for MS fatigue. There have been studies showing an increase in brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and insulin like growth factor (IGF) with aerobic activity suggesting the potential for Brain repair functions from exercise. A safe regular exercise program should be encouraged in MS patients. Many patients find a combination of aerobic activity and stretching to help many MS symptoms and improve stamina, Yoga and Pilates can help to this end. Q. Are there lifestyle issues that predict the level of disability in MS patients? Some factors that have been shown to be possible predictors of physical disability of MS include: social support, health behaviors, smoking, obesity and vascular co morbidities (Hypertension, Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease and obesity). It has been found that if an MS patient has one vascular comorbidity it was associated with an increase risk of ambulatory disability, and this risk increased with each vascular co-morbidity. This is another reason that the MS patients should have a PCP to help manage the various vascular risk factors. The level of smoking in MS patients is similar to the general population. There have been articles defining the increased risk of smokers with autoimmune conditions. There are a few studies showing smokers with MS have higher levels of disability and smokers get MS more often. Yes, MS patients should quit smoking for health promotion. Cleveland Clinic offers a Smoking Cessation program; they can be contacted at 216 444 8111. Q. Should we be concerned about excess alcohol use in MS patients? The level of alcoholism is similar in the MS population to the general population. Excess alcohol should be avoided, and if there is alcohol dependency or abuse, it should be aggressively addressed. Alcohol intake should be limited with various medications including interferons; patients should discuss this in detail with their treatment team. Q. What can be done to help MS patients with their fatigue and sleep? Fatigue is a common symptom of MS. Patient should be educated to the importance of healthy sleep hygiene, regular exercise, healthy nutrition, limiting caffeine intake and avoiding cigarettes and alcohol close to bed time. There are medications for MS fatigue but generally working on the factors listed above that help the sleep efficacy can remarkably help the patient’s energy levels. Q. Does Complementary Alternative Medicine help MS patients? MS patients use Complementary Alternative medicine (CAM) as often as the general public. They have reported that they have tried to have more control over their symptoms, to improve general well being and due to perceived inefficacy of conventional medicine. There are studies of music therapy, meditation, various supplements and Yoga in MS patients reported in the medical literature. Meditation, Yoga and music therapy helped improve MS patients’ quality of life in small studies. Q. What Wellness Opportunities does the Mellen Center and CCF have for our MS patients? We offer a Wellness consultation to have more time to discuss the various Wellness issues and formulate a plan. This is a 30-60 minute one time visit. There are studies being performed at the Mellen Center of various forms of CAM: Music Therapy and Biofeedback. There are Integrative Medicine consultations with Internal Medicine Doctors and various practitioners (Reiki, Acupuncture and in Nutrition) at various sites in the Cleveland Clinic.

Get the latest public health information from CDC: Get the latest research information from NIH: Study finds multiple sclerosis drug slows brain shrinkage Study finds multiple sclerosis drug slows brain shrinkage NIH-funded trial offers hope for disease with limited treatment options    Results from a clinical trial of more than 250 participants with progressive (MS) revealed that ibudilast was better than a placebo in slowing down brain shrinkage. The study also showed that the main side effects of ibudilast were gastrointestinal and headaches.  The study was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. “These findings provide a glimmer of hope for people with a form of multiple sclerosis that causes long-term disability but does not have many treatment options,” said Walter J. Koroshetz, M.D., director of the NINDS. Robert J. Fox, M.D., a neurologist at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, led a team of researchers across 28 clinical sites in a brain imaging study to investigate whether ibudilast was better than placebo in reducing the progression of brain atrophy, or shrinkage, in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis. In the study, 255 patients were randomized to take up to 10 capsules of ibudilast or placebo per day for 96 weeks. Every six months, the participants underwent MRI brain scans. Dr. Fox’s team applied a variety of analysis techniques on the MRI images to assess differences in brain changes between the two groups. The study showed that ibudilast slowed down the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo. Dr. Fox and his colleagues discovered that there was a difference in brain shrinkage of 0.0009 units of atrophy per year between the two groups, which translates to approximately 2.5 milliliters of brain tissue. In other words, although both groups experienced atrophy, the brains of the patients in the placebo group shrank on average 2.5 milliliters more over two years compared to the ibudilast group. The whole adult human brain has a volume of approximately 1,350 milliliters. However, it is unknown whether that difference had an effect on symptoms or loss of function. There was no significant difference between the groups in the number of patients who reported adverse effects. The most common side effects associated with ibudilast were gastrointestinal, including nausea and diarrhea, as well as headaches and depression.   “The trial’s results are very encouraging and point towards a potential new therapy to help people with progressive MS,” said Dr. Fox. “It also increased our understanding of advanced imaging techniques, so that future studies may require a smaller number of patients followed over a shorter period of time. This leads to increased efficiency of clinical research. These imaging methods may also be relevant to a host of other neurological disorders.” MS occurs when there is a breakdown of myelin, a fatty white substance wrapped around axons, which are long strands that carry messages from and between brain cells. When myelin starts to break down, communication between brain cells slows down, leading to muscle weakness and problems with movement, balance, sensation and vision. MS can be relapsing-remitting, in which symptoms occur then disappear for weeks or months and then may reappear, or progressive, which is marked by a gradual decline in function. The current study was supported by the   an innovative approach to neurological clinical trials that attempts to streamline Phase 2 studies and make them more efficient. MediciNova donated the active drug and placebo and provided under 10 percent of the funding for the trial in a cooperative agreement with NINDS. MediciNova also had a representative on the protocol steering committee. There was no confidentiality agreement between the manuscript authors. Future research will test whether reducing brain shrinkage affects thinking, walking, and other problems in people with MS. In addition, future studies will examine whether ibudilast slows the progression of disability in MS patients.   This work was supported by the NINDS (NS082329, NS077179, NS077352). Fox R et al.

This instrument provides an assessment of the effects of fatigue in terms of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. The full-length MFIS consists of 21 items while the abbreviated version has 5 items. The abbreviated version can be used if time is limited but the full-length version has the advantage of generating subscales. The MFIS is one of the components of the . Administration time is approximately 5-10 minutes for the full-length version and 2-3 minutes for the abbreviated version. The MFIS is a structured, self-report questionnaire that the patient can generally complete with little or no intervention from an interviewer. However, patients with visual or upper extremity impairments may need to have the MFIS administered as an interview. Interviewers should be trained in basic interviewing skills and in the use of this instrument. The total score for the MFIS is the sum of the scores for the 21 items. Individual subscale scores for physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning can also be generated by calculating the sum of specific sets of items. (PDF) The MFIS is easy to administer and focuses on the ways in which MS-related fatigue affects everyday life. As such it has high face validity for patients. The availability of the three subscales, physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning, may be useful to investigators interested in testing hypotheses concerning these different areas of function. However, the three subscales tend to correlate highly with one another, which limits their usefulness to some extent. The full-length version of the MFIS has a Cronbach's alpha of .81 while the short form has an alpha of .80. The original version, the Fatigue Impact Scale, was sensitive in discriminating the effects of fatigue among MS from those of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and essential hypertension.

bd644499-7ac5-4bcc-92b1-f89aa44ad600,"Researchers Focusing on Diet as a Major MS Treatment — A pair of clinical trials funded by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society are looking at the effects that healthy eating has on MS symptoms. Can diet help people with multiple sclerosis (MS) manage their disease and their symptoms? The National Multiple Sclerosis Society thinks so. In fact, it is funding two new studies that look at the effects of diet on MS. One , out of the University of Iowa, looks specifically at the effects of diet on MS-related fatigue. A second, out of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, is a looking at the feasibility of studying the effects of diet on people with MS. Both studies are a result of a wellness task force put together in 2014 by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline that the task force was a result of both patient and donor requests for research on more than just pharmaceuticals and mice. The task force brought together experts to chart out a course to follow in lifestyle and wellness. “We began to better understand where the knowledge is, and where gaps are, and how we can make the best investments for the patients and the society,” he said. Bebo explained how studies on diet are not easy. It is difficult to “blind” the participants to the treatments when they are planning and preparing the food. Considered a modifiable risk factor, diet for the most part can be controlled by people with MS or their caregivers. An increasing number of studies are looking at diet and MS. A published in Neurology found that in addition to weight control, people with MS may find both neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory benefits from certain calorie-controlled diets. Another looked at 175,000 women and found that ingesting polyunsaturated fats may modify risk factors for MS. Diet also has the potential to in people with MS. A paleo diet was recently found to help with mood, depression, anxiety, and cognitive function, more than exercise and stress management. The National MS Society just committed to find out. The trial led by will look at two different popular MS diets and their effects on MS-related fatigue. To date there are no FDA approved drugs for fatigue, which is currently one of the top five causes of MS disability, and a factor in reducing quality of life. Wahls, who has MS, found a way to help people with the condition manage their symptoms and disease by using a modified paleo diet called the Wahls’ Protocol. After years of research she learned of the task force and submitted a proposal to test her theories. Her study looks at diet and MS-related fatigue, specifically while following either a modified Swank Diet or modified Wahls’ Protocol diet. The Swank diet is named after , who has treated many MS patients. Through these experiences, he determined a diet to help manage the disease. Wahls emphasized the importance of the study to Healthline. “Do either of these diets reduce fatigue and improve quality of life? This is the main question,” she said. Wahls added that while it will be interesting to see how the diets compare, what matters most is how effective these diets are when compared with the baseline. This study is currently recruiting participants. To apply, you can go to the and use the code JMJPYEJHP. For questions, you can email MSDietStudy@healthcare.uiowa.edu or call 319-384-5053. As part of their response to the task force, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society is also funding a study out of New York. The goal of this research is to establish the feasibility of dietary research in people with MS, as well as to provide preliminary data to support future clinical trials of diet. Lead investigator, Dr. Ilana Katz Sand, lead study investigator, and associate medical director of The Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for MS, said this trial does not use a specific diet but a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, adjusted to match the study’s protocol. And that while this study will look at the effects of diet on MS-related fatigue, it is designed to look at the role diet has in managing symptoms of the disease and building baselines for future studies. This trial is also currently . Katz Sand told Healthline that at first researchers were concerned about finding enough participants to fill the 30 slots in the pilot study, but now “we are preparing a waiting list and already working on our next, larger study.” “It wasn’t always like this,” Nicholas LaRocca, PhD, vice president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline. The medical industry has changed. As the program officer overseeing the progression of the Wahls study, LaRocca emphasized that people do not need to wait for the findings of these trials. A healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce other health issues and should have benefits for people with MS. “Eating a healthy diet is good for all patients,” added Bebo. “I feel incredibly optimistic,” Wahls said. “Because of social media, it’s easier to keep the interests growing. It’s easier to advocate.” And the National Multiple Sclerosis Society is listening. “We are poised to make additional investments in diet research,” Bebo said.

3d9d2276-72e3-460a-a3d4-c368d980ebb3,"Spanish version of modified Story Memory Technique effective for Mexicans with MS A team of researchers reported preliminary findings for efficacy of the Spanish version of the modified Story Memory Technique, a cognitive intervention developed at Kessler Foundation (KF-mSMT™). Their study, conducted in Mexicans with multiple sclerosis, is an important step toward addressing the void in evidence-based rehabilitative interventions for treating the cognitive effects of multiple sclerosis across diverse cultural populations. The article, ""Efficacy of the Spanish modified Story Memory Technique in Mexicans with multiple sclerosis: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"" (doi: 10.3233/NRE-192808) was epublished on November 28, 2019 by NeuroRehabilitation. The authors are Denise Krch, PhD, Anthony Lequerica, PhD, and Nancy Chiaravalloti, PhD, of Kessler Foundation, Adriana Aguayo Arelis, MSc, and Brenda V. Rabago Barajas, MS, of Universidad Enrique D´ıaz de Leon and the Mexican MS Foundation, Guadalajara, Mexico, and Juan Carlos Arango-Lasprilla, MD, of Cruces University Hospital, Bizkaia, Spain, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain, and University of the Basque Country, Leoia, Spain. Link to article: DOI: https://content.iospress.com/articles/neurorehabilitation/nre192808 While problems with learning and memory occur across populations with multiple sclerosis around the world, the availability of evidence-based cognitive interventions in different languages is limited. The lack of interventions in Spanish presents a barrier to the rehabilitation of many individuals in the Hispanic community who have cognitive deficits caused by multiple sclerosis. An international team of researchers has adapted the English language KF-mSMT into Spanish, for use in the cognitive rehabilitation of Mexicans with multiple sclerosis.     In this pilot study, 20 participants with multiple sclerosis, relapsing-remitting type, were randomized to either treatment (n = 10) or placebo control (n = 10) groups. The treatment group received the Spanish adaptation of the KF-mSMT, a 10-session intervention that teaches imagery and context to facilitate learning. The control group participated in 10 sessions based on similar content and presentation. All participants underwent baseline and follow-up neuropsychological assessments. Individuals in the treatment group showed significant improvements in learning and life satisfaction relative to the control group, suggesting that that this adaptation of the KF-mSMT may be an effective rehabilitative tool in Spanish-speaking populations with MS, according to Dr. Krch, senior research scientist in the Center for Traumatic Brain Injury Research. This is an example of how cultural adaptation can be an effective way to extend evidence-based interventions to non-English speaking populations. The positive outcomes seen in this pilot study of urban-based Mexicans have important implications. While further testing is needed, we anticipate that this adaptation of the modified Story Memory Technique will be applicable to the diverse Spanish-speaking population in the U.S., in addition to those with Mexican heritage.” Dr. Denise Krch, senior research scientist in the Center for Traumatic Brain Injury Research Kessler Foundation researchers have documented this tool in the U.S. for English-speaking populations with traumatic brain injury as well as multiple sclerosis. “Based on our prior research,” noted Dr. Krch, “the modified Story Memory Technique may also prove useful in the rehabilitation of Spanish-speakers with cognitive deficits caused by traumatic brain injury.”   The KF-mSMT is available from Kessler Foundation in English and Spanish for use by rehabilitation professionals.

51df9306-12b4-4b5b-806a-4834066a323d,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS       With the growing number of immunosuppressive and immunomodulating (ISIM) agents to treat MS there are more concerns around infection prevention and timing of vaccinations for people with MS. Many of these ISIM agents have specific vaccination recommendations within their prescribing information. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) published “Update: Vaccine-preventable Infections and Immunization in Multiple Sclerosis,” which provides recommendations for clinicians. The and are available online.  COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS​ The National MS Society convened a an group of MS and immunology experts to develop COVID-19 vaccine guidance for people living with MS, which has been published at the link above and will be progressively elaborated over time. Guidance for healthcare providers specific to the timing of the vaccine in coordination with disease modifying therapies and high-dose steroids is currently being developed by this same expert group. This information will be disseminated to healthcare providers by  through webinars (time/date TBD) and through our healthcare provider Twitter account   The composition of US influenza vaccine is reviewed annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and updated to match circulating influenza viruses. Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended by the CDC for everyone over 6 months of age with . The following recommendation is from the AAN  specific to the influenza vaccine Clinicians should recommend that patients with MS receive the influenza vaccination annually, unless there is a specific contraindication (e.g., prior severe reaction). Clinicians should recommend against using live attenuated vaccines in people with MS who currently receive ISIM therapies or have recently discontinued these therapies. Some of these therapies also have restrictions from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the timing of a live vaccine after discontinuing an ISIM therapy. Refer to the ISIM therapy’s prescribing information for specific requirements. Clinicians should delay vaccination of people with MS who are experiencing a relapse until clinical resolution or until the relapse is no longer active (e.g., the relapse is no longer progressive but may be associated with residual disability). To learn more about the 2020-2021 seasonal flu vaccine, please visit the . The hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all infants, unvaccinated children under the age of 19 and of contracting this potentially life-threatening disease. In 2002, the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine (IOM) determined that there is no association between hepatitis B vaccination and the onset of MS.  ®) This vaccine is indicated in girls and women ages 9 to 26 and is designed to prevent the HPV 6, 11, 16 and/or 18-related cervical cancer, cervical dysplasias, vulvar and vaginal dysplasias later in life. One case report (Waldemann et al., 2009) described the onset of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following the second immunization with Gardasil, and Sutton et al. (2009) reported five patients who presented with multifocal or atypical demyelination syndromes within 21 days of the second or third immunization (three of whom had previously experienced clinical isolated episodes of neurological dysfunction). However, a recent large-scale study of patient registries in Denmark and Sweden (see below) found no increased risk of developing MS among nearly 800,000 who received this vaccine. Use of Gardasil should be preceded by a discussion between patient and physician regarding benefits and risks. (Pneumovax® 23 - PPSV23 and Prevnar® 13-PCV13) PCV13 protects against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria; PPSV23 protects against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. One dose of PPSV23 is recommended for all adults 65 years or older. Both pneumococcal vaccines are inactivated and safe for people with MS. According to the AAN recommendations on immunizations for people with MS, pneumococcal vaccine should be considered for individuals with compromised pulmonary function, including those who use a wheelchair on a full-time basis or are bed-bound. The CDC recommends Shingrix, a non-live vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and related complications. The vaccine is recommended over Zostavax® (the previously approved vaccine for shingles) and is approved in adults 50 years of age and older. No studies of Shingrix have been done in people with MS. However, in two clinical studies with Shingrix, there was no increase in immune-mediated conditions. The CDC indicates that a person who is taking a low-dose immunosuppressive therapy or is going to begin taking an immunosuppressive medication can take Shingrix. It is very important to discuss this vaccine with the healthcare provider who is treating your MS to ensure that it is appropriate for you. Zostavax, is a live-virus vaccine to prevent shingles. MS healthcare providers do not recommend live-virus vaccines for people with MS because these vaccines can lead to an increase in disease activity. However, Zostavax is an exception because most people have had chicken pox earlier in their lives and therefore already have the virus in their bodies. Each person needs to discuss the potential benefits and risks of this vaccine with her or his healthcare provider. As of July 1, 2020, Zostavax is no longer being produced, but may still be used until the supply expires on November 18, 2020. While this vaccine has not been studied in people with MS, it should be made available to any person with MS directly exposed to smallpox as the risks associated with not getting vaccinated would be too great. This vaccine should be considered by people with MS who have never had chicken pox, lack evidence of prior immunity, and are considering starting a disease modifying therapy (DMT) that has the potential to suppress cell mediated immunity. Refer to the prescribing information for each DMT and the varicella vaccine. A person should not receive a live-virus vaccine following a course of Lemtrada®. For patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening, treat by standard medical practice prior to therapy with Aubagio®. No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of live vaccinations in patients taking Aubagio. Vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended. The long half-life of Aubagio should be considered when contemplating administration of a live vaccine after stopping Aubagio. Advise patients that the use of some vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Aubagio and for at least 6 months after discontinuation. Patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of chickenpox or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV) should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating Gilenya®. VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients is recommended prior to commencing treatment with Gilenya, following which initiation of treatment with Gilenya should be postponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur. It is recommended that pediatric patients if possible, complete all immunizations in accordance with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Gilenya therapy. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infections, including papilloma, dysplasia, warts, and HPV-related cancer, have been reported in patients treated with Gilenya in the postmarketing setting. Vaccination against HPV should be considered prior to treatment initiation with Gilenya, taking into account vaccination recommendations. Cancer screening, including Papanicolaou (Pap) test, is recommended as per standard of care for patients using an immunosuppressive therapy. Because vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and after discontinuation until B-cell repletion, administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of Ocrevusor Kesimpta® for live or live-attenuated vaccines and, whenever possible, at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of Ocrevus or Kesimpta for non-live vaccine. Reference the prescribing information for important warnings around vaccination of infants born to mothers treated with these medications during pregnancy. Vaccination of patients who are antibody-negative for varicella zoster virus is recommended prior to initiation of Mavenclad®. Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines prior to starting Mavenclad. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting Mavenclad, because of a risk of active vaccine infection. Avoid vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines during and after Mavenclad treatment while the patient’s white blood cell counts are not within normal limits Patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of chickenpox or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating Mayzent treatment. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with Mayzent, following which initiation of treatment with Mayzent should be postponed for 4 weeks to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided while patients are taking Mayzent and for 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Vaccinations may be less effective if administered during Mayzent treatment. Mayzent treatment discontinuation 1 week prior to and until 4 weeks after a planned vaccination is recommended. Patients without a healthcare professional-confirmed history of chickenpox or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating Zeposia. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with Zeposia, following which initiation of treatment with Zeposia should be postponed for 4 weeks to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur. No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations in patients taking Zeposia. Vaccinations may be less effective if administered during Zeposia treatment. If live attenuated vaccine immunizations are required, administer at least 1 month prior to initiation of Zeposia. Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines during and for 3 months after treatment with Zeposia. MS experts are not in agreement about the risks for a person with MS whose close family member receives a live-virus vaccine. The family should discuss with the healthcare provider how best to handle this situation.  Studies of Vaccines with Specific Disease Modifying Therapies A blinded, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled study, published in , evaluated the effectiveness of the flu vaccine in fingolimod-treated patients. Researchers found that most fingolimod-treated patients with MS were able to mount immune responses with the vaccine, and the majority met criteria indicating seroprotection. However, response rates were reduced compared with placebo-treated patients.  Overall, there was some decrease in vaccination-induced immune responses among the fingolimod treated patients.  A study, published in , investigated the effect of teriflunomide on the efficacy and safety of the influenza vaccine and found that teriflunomide-treated patients generally mounted effective immune responses to seasonal influenza vaccination. Researchers concluded that teriflunomide generally does not adversely impact the ability of MS patients to mount immune responses to influenza vaccination.  A small case-control study, published in , assessed immunocompetence in patients after alemtuzumab treatment by measuring antibody responses to several vaccines before and after treatment.  Researchers concluded that serum antibodies against common viruses remained detectable after treatment, and there was retained ability to mount an immune response against new antigens after treatment with alemtuzumab.  A study published in  compared the immune response in people treated with ocrelizumab to a control group treated with interferon-β or no disease modifying therapy. The study investigators concluded standard non-live vaccines, including the influenza vaccine, can be expected to be protective in people taking ocrelizumab. A study published in assessed influenza and pneumococcal vaccine response in three groups taking siponimod who do not have MS compared to another group without MS taking placebo. The study found no effect on response to the pneumococcal vaccine in those taking siponimod. Stopping siponimod at least 7 days before vaccination and resuming at least 2 weeks after may improve response to the influenza vaccine. The investigators concluded siponimod has limited effect on vaccine efficacy. A study from Neurology investigated vaccine response in individuals taking dimethyl fumarate (DMF) compared to those taking nonpegylated interferon (IFN). The immune response in DMF-treated individuals was comparable those treated with IFN. In a of multiple studies of immune response to vaccines in individuals taking DMTs, the authors concluded those taking natalizumab may mount an inadequate immune response to some vaccines. View the paper to learn more about immune responses in people taking other DMTs. Studies of Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness in People with MS Some, but not all, immunizations have been evaluated for safety and efficacy in people with MS: A study by the Vaccines in Multiple Sclerosis Study Group published in 2001 in the  found that vaccination for tetanus, hepatitis B or influenza  did not appear to increase the short-term risk of relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) in people with MS. A study by the National Immunization Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published in the , found that vaccination against hepatitis B, influenza, tetanus, measles, or rubella did not increase a person’s risk of developing MS or optic neuritis (which is often a first symptom of MS).  A small, unblinded study, published in the , of people with relapsing-remitting MS who received the yellow fever vaccination prior to travel, found a significantly increased risk of MS relapses during the six weeks following the  vaccination when compared to the remainder of the two-year follow-up period. For people with MS who must travel to areas where yellow fever is common, the increased relapse risk needs to be carefully weighed against the likelihood of exposure to yellow fever – which is a potentially fatal illness. A study of nearly four million females aged 10 to 44 years identified in nationwide patient registries in Denmark and Sweden, published in the , found no increased risk of developing MS among nearly 800,000 who received quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil®), designed to prevent cervical cancer.  A review of data from the complete electronic medical health records of Kaiser Permanente Southern California between 2008 and 2011, published in , found no long-term association of vaccines with MS or any other acquired central nervous system demyelinating disease. A meta-analysis and systematic review published in 2021 in found people with MS developed adequate immune response to the influenza vaccine as compared to controls without MS.

2a196702-ab5e-44c9-9928-73acf63ad0bb,"Why Americans with Multiple Sclerosis Are Traveling to Russia for Treatment — An experimental treatment for MS known as HSCT is available in North America, but it’s more accessible and less expensive in Russia. People with in the United States and Canada are traveling to Russia for an experimental treatment that’s a potential cure for the disease. However, there are still a number of risks involved. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a therapy for MS that has, in many cases, been shown to halt progression of the disease with a single treatment. However, in North America, the procedure is still considered experimental and isn’t widely available. It’s also costly. For individuals facing a potential lifetime of MS, the allure of a cure abroad is tantalizing. According to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, HSCT treatment is promising. But he cautions there still aren’t enough rigorous clinical studies on it to weigh the real risks and benefits. is a demyelinating autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system begins to attack the myelin, the protective insulation of the nervous system. These attacks cause scarring (sclerosis) that leads to a host of neurological symptoms from tremors and loss of vision, to difficulty with speech. It’s typically diagnosed in individuals between the ages of 20 and 40. HSCT is a complex procedure that requires a bone marrow transplant similar to that used by oncologists for certain blood cancers. The treatment is an attempt to “reboot” the immune system and stop it from attacking the brain and spinal cord. “One way to think about it is that you are reeducating and creating a new immune system,” Bebo told Healthline. “It appears that in many cases when you do this, that new immune system learns that the central nervous system isn’t dangerous anymore and it doesn’t attack it anymore.” In the first step of HSCT treatment, chemotherapy is used to stimulate the production of bone marrow stem cells and promote their release into the bloodstream. This blood is then drawn and stored. The patient is then given a strong dose of more chemotherapy, most often in a hospital setting, for up to 11 days. During that time, immune cells are either dramatically weakened or killed entirely. Finally, the patient’s stored stem cells are infused back into the body, learning to leave the nervous system intact. Patients must take antibiotics to fight off infections while their immune systems are suppressed. They must also stay in the hospital for weeks at a time while their immune system rebuilds. A recent study said that the average hospital stay after the stem cell infusion lasted . That may be a small price to pay to stop a chronic illness, especially for individuals. There’s also the matter of the real price — as in dollars. “I think [the reason] people are leaving the country has to do with cost,” said Bebo. “I’m aware of many people who although they have to fight tooth and nail to get it, can get their insurance company to cover most or all the costs of this procedure in the U.S. It’s expensive.” The cost is in the six-figure range. that it could be done in the United States for about $125,000. It’s a lot cheaper to go to Mexico or Russia to get HSCT therapy, where “they will perform the therapy for a fraction of the cost,” said Bebo. There are also caveats to the treatment, dependent on the MS diagnosis. Broadly speaking, there are two major types of MS: relapsing and progressive. Relapsing, the more common form, is identified by intermittent “attacks” or exacerbations in which symptoms will worsen for a period and then dissipate. As the disease progresses, the exacerbations get worse and the overall disability of the person increases. Bebo describes progressive MS as a “slow, steady progression of disability.” It’s less common but significantly more difficult to treat. “What little evidence we have at this point suggests that people with progressive MS don’t respond to HSCT,” said Bebo. Typical drug regimens for relapsing MS, called disease modifying therapies (DMTs), also tend to be less effective for progressive MS. This “gap,” as Bebo puts it, in treatment between progressive and relapsing MS may be driving medical tourism abroad. Against doctors’ recommendations, patients may still elect to travel abroad to seek out HSCT for progressive MS. New drugs, such as Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), have been approved more recently by the FDA for the treatment of progressive MS. It’s not a trivial procedure and has been known for its . A study from 2017 concluded that while the procedure showed significant benefit against MS progression, the overall transplant-related mortality rate was about 2 percent. As the procedure has improved, so have mortality rates. An older 2002 study of 85 MS patients treated with HSCT in the group — a mortality rate of about 8 percent. “I think there are still many neurologists who remember the older studies, the high risk of mortality,” said Bebo, “and until there is a rigorous, well-controlled study that documents the effectiveness and mortality risk, then I think some neurologists are going to be hesitant to recommend the therapy.” But Bebo and his colleagues at the MS society are also enthusiastic about the growing interest and research being done on HSCT. “I do see the neurology community being more accepting of this approach than they have in the past.” However, he emphasizes that HSCT isn’t an MS panacea. Depending on the diagnosis, the procedure must find its way into established therapy methods. While HSCT is available in the United States today, it could still be years before it’s easily accessible — and affordable. “We really look forward to the day when we have results from a really well-controlled, rigorous clinical trial to really tell us once and for all what’s the full benefit of this, what are the full risks, and who is the person most likely to benefit from it,” said Bebo. Until then, people living with MS may choose to seek out treatment abroad, where the chance at a permanent cure may already be available. In the race against a chronic illness, the U.S. medical system may just be moving too slowly for the young and the desperate. — Study Looking at High-Dose Biotin as a Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

The improved transmission indicates that nerve-insulating myelin was repaired along the nerve pathways. Clemastine is an over-the-counter allergy medication. Doses in this trial exceeded the maximum recommended for over-the-counter use. Clemastine affects a range of targets in the body, and involves the risk for side effects, particularly at increased dosages. More studies are needed before the full benefits and risks of this approach can be verified. This team is conducting an additional trial in people with optic neuritis to further determine the safety and effectiveness of clemastine, as well as studies to identify compounds that may enhance myelin repair and cause fewer side effects. Clemastine was identified as having possible myelin-repairing properties through innovative preclinical research conducted by National MS Society-funded Jonah Chan, PhD, who went on to become for Innovation in MS Research for this pioneering work. UPDATE: The full results of the study, led by Ari Green, MD (University of California, San Francisco), . (Preliminary results were previously presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April 2016.) In MS, the immune system attacks and destroys myelin, the fatty substance that surrounds and protects the nerve fibers, and the nerve fibers can also be damaged. Current therapies are largely aimed at dampening the immune attacks. However, a therapy that repairs damage to myelin and nerve fibers is also necessary. A team at the University of California, San Francisco led by National MS Society-funded Harry Weaver Neuroscience Scholar Jonah Chan, PhD, invented a new micropillar technology to rapidly identify compounds that stimulate the regrowth of myelin. The team using this technology, testing a library of 1000 drugs already approved by the FDA for other conditions for their ability to promote the development of myelin-making cells and wrapping of myelin around the micropillars. Clemastine, an oral antihistamine used to treat allergy symptoms, was identified through this process. Dr. Chan was the for Innovation in MS Research for this pioneering work.   Ari Green, MD, led the team conducting the clinical trial. They administered oral clemastine or inactive placebo twice daily to 50 people with MS and optic nerve damage for 150 days. For the first three months of the study, people were given either clemastine or a placebo, and for the second two months, those initially given clemastine received the placebo and vice-versa. Tests were performed before and after treatment that measured visual evoked potentials. Visual evoked potentials measure transmission of electric signals along optic nerve pathways in response to stimulation. Delays in this transmission occur when the myelin is damaged and if these delays are reduced, it is an indication that myelin repair is occurring along the nerve pathways. (Participants had significant delays in transmission in at least one eye.)   UPDATE: The full results of the study, led by Ari Green, MD (University of California, San Francisco), . (Preliminary results were previously presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April 2016.) The trial met its primary endpoint, reducing delays in visual evoked potential by 1.7 milliseconds per eye, a statistically significant result. The results hinted at a reduction in vision impairment as well, but it did not reach statistical significance. Fatigue increased mildly in participants taking clemastine.   Clemastine is an over-the-counter allergy medication. Doses in this trial exceeded the maximum recommended for over-the-counter use. Also, clemastine affects a range of targets in the body, and involves the risk for side effects, particularly at increased dosages.   Dr. Green cautions that more research with larger numbers of people is needed before doctors can recommend clemastine as a treatment for people with MS. This team is conducting an additional trial in people with optic neuritis to further determine the safety and effectiveness of clemastine, as well as studies to identify compounds that may enhance myelin repair and cause fewer side effects.   Drs. Green and Chan both received Society funding to launch their early careers as independent researchers focused on MS, including Harry Weaver Neuroscience Scholar Awards.   “This is a significant step forward in one of many different approaches being taken to find a way to repair the nervous system damage caused by MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research at the National MS Society. “Research to restore function to people with MS is a very high priority.” Read more about this study on the University of California, San Francisco Website Read more about research to repair the nervous system Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Those who continued to smoke converted to secondary-progressive MS at a median age of 48, while those who quit smoking within the year after MS diagnosis progressed at a median age of 56. This adds to evidence that smoking may speed progression of MS, and offers new evidence that quitting smoking after MS diagnosis may slow progression. The team (Ryan Ramanujam, PhD, Jan Hillert, MD, PhD, and colleagues at Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden) has published results in JAMA Neurology ( September 8, 2015). The full paper is available free of charge. In most people, MS begins with a course with defined attacks of worsening neurologic function, followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. Most people eventually transition to , where the disease begins to progress or worsen more steadily, with or without relapses. The factors that determine if or when a person may transition to secondary-progressive MS are not fully understood. Some studies have found that smoking is related to disease progression, and that MS disability progresses more quickly in smokers, but the impact of quitting after diagnosis had not been thoroughly determined. Investigators identified 728 people with MS who smoked at the time of MS diagnosis and were enrolled in the large Genes and Environment in MS Study in Sweden. Of these, 332 were classified as “continuers” who smoked at least one cigarette per day continuously from the year after diagnosis and 118 were considered “quitters,” who had stopped smoking within the year after diagnosis. A group of 278 were “intermittent smokers” but were not included in the final evaluation. The main focus of the study was to determine how smoking was related to conversion to secondary-progressive MS, which occurred in 216 people. The researchers found that each year of smoking after diagnosis accelerated the time to conversion to secondary-progressive MS by 4.7%. Continuers progressed to secondary-progressive MS faster (at a median age of 48) compared with quitters (age 56). Results were published in JAMA Neurology ( September 08, 2015). The full paper is available free of charge. Comment: This is an important study that adds to evidence that smoking speeds progression of MS, and offers new evidence that quitting smoking after MS diagnosis may slow progression. In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Myla D. Goldman (University of Virginia, Charlottesville) and Olaf Stüve (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas) comment that this may be the first evidence that quitting smoking can delay conversion to secondary-progressive MS. “Therefore, even after MS diagnosis, smoking is a risk factor worth modifying,” they write.

Chan School of Public Health in Boston and collaborators report on a study that examined blood (serum) samples from 60 military personnel who went on to develop multiple sclerosis years later. Compared to samples from a control group, those who eventually developed MS showed higher than usual levels of a molecule (neurofilament light chain - NfL) that reflects damage to the nervous system.   The levels of NfL were increased as early as six years before the clinical onset of MS. In addition, among those eventually diagnosed with MS, the levels of NfL increased over time while this was not the case for controls. Other studies () have shown that years before they are diagnosed with MS, people can show a distinct pattern of doctor visits for specific problems. Together, these studies suggest that changes in the nervous system related to MS begin well before there are perceptible symptoms, offering hope that there will be a way to predict and prevent MS before it becomes full-blown disease. Studies of NfL in the bloodstream and in spinal fluid have been underway to better define how this biomarker may be employed to help detect and predict disease activity and response to treatments, not only in MS but in other disorders.

Kjetil Bjornevik and Alberto Ascherio, published its findings in the (published early online in September 2019).   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

22384df7-c9b5-493e-bf9d-95efc12f7456,"Are you sure your patient has Multiple Sclerosis? What are the typical findings for this disease? A first attack of neurological symptoms in children with central nervous system (CNS) demyelination may represent a monophasic illness or be the first presentation of a chronic relapsing disorder such as multiple sclerosis (MS), a condition that is increasingly being recognized and diagnosed in childhood. Cranial, and possible spinal imaging, and lumbar puncture are key diagnostic tests. Acute management of demyelination usually involves initiation of corticosteroid therapy with IVIG, with plasma exchange required in severe cases. Once the diagnosis of MS is confirmed, immunomodulatory treatment should be initiated with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. Safety and tolerability data support the use of these MS immunomodulatory therapies in pediatric MS. Neurological symptoms attributable to demyelination commonly include the following: Unilateral or bilateral visual loss (optic neuritis) Motor, sensory or urological deficits localizing to the spinal cord (transverse myelitis) Brainstem deficits (typically internuclear ophthalmoplegia or INO) Other monofocal or polyfocal neurological deficits Polyfocal neurological deficits with encephalopathy (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or ADEM) Optic neuritis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute monocular or binocular visual loss (see Figure 1). Ophthalmological features of optic neuritis typically include: Optic disc edema is sometimes seen, but may be absent in retrobulbar optic neuritis. Neurological abnormalities outside of the optic nerve may also be present. Neuroimaging, usually brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, reveals optic nerve thickening and/or enhancement in approximately 55% of children (see Figure 2) and visual evoked potentials are abnormal in up to 88% of children. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive technique for measuring retinal nerve fiber thickness, may aid in diagnosis. Transverse myelitis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute onset of weakness and sensory deficits localizing to the spinal cord (see Figure 3). Typical symptoms of transverse myelitis include: Bilateral (may be asymmetric) lower extremity weakness Sensory paresthesias or hyperesthesias with a spinal sensory level L’Hermitte’s symptom (pain with forward neck flexion) indicating cervical spinal involvement Bowel or bladder dysfunction (lesions above the sacral cord cause urinary retention and constipation) While many children will experience partial TM, others may have complete cross-sectional cord involvement with clinical features of flaccid paresis with hyporeflexia and later hyperreflexia. Longitudinally-extensive transverse myelitis (spanning > 3 spinal segments) or transverse myelitis with concurrent or rapidly sequential optic neuritis should prompt consideration of neuromyelitis optica (see Figure 2). Of note, approximately 10% of children with MS have longitudinally-extensive spinal cord lesions. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) may be useful to confirm a spinal cord localization. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is defined by the presence of polyfocal neurological symptoms and signs with encephalopathy (either behavioral change or alteration in consciousness). Symptoms of ADEM are often preceded by a febrile illness or viral prodrome. ADEM may be the clinical manifestation of age-dependent demyelination as the majority of individuals with ADEM are under the age of 10 years. While ADEM is most commonly a monophasic illness, relapsing and multiphasic forms have been described. International consensus definitions for monophasic and relapsing forms of ADEM describe the clinical features and time course in detail. Typical brain MRI findings of ADEM are shown in Figure 4. Other presentations of acute demyelination include: Polyfocal neurological deficits without encephalopathy The cornerstone of MS diagnosis is demonstration of demyelination that is disseminated in both space and time. Specific consensus definitions have been proposed for childhood-onset MS requiring either (i) two discrete demyelinating attacks separated by at least 30 days and involving two separate areas of the CNS; (ii) one attack consistent with demyelination and MRI evidence of new lesions meeting criteria for dissemination in time (see below); or (iii) two non-ADEM attacks in a child with an initial ADEM presentation. As in adult-onset MS, MRI may be used as a surrogate marker for dissemination in space and time, facilitating earlier disease diagnosis. Specifically, new criteria proposed by Polman et al (2010) require that dissemination in space on MRI be defined as involvement of greater than or equal to one T2 lesion in at least two of the following four areas: i. periventricular ii. juxtacortical iii. infratentorial and iv. spinal cord with symptomatic brainstem or spinal cord symptoms not contributing towards the total lesion count. Dissemination in time may be fulfilled by demonstration of either: i. new T2 and/or gadolinium-enhancing spinal cord lesion(s) on follow-up MRI (irrespective of timing of baseline MRI) or ii. simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions. More than 95% of children with multiple sclerosis initially experience a relapsing-remitting disease course with reported relapse rates between 0.38 and 1.2 per year. Primary progressive disease (neurological deterioration in the absence of discrete relapses) is rare in the pediatric age group. Children with MS appear to experience more frequent relapses as compared to adult-onset MS patients in the first several years following diagnosis. The time from a first attack to a second neurological event is highly variable and may be greater in younger children. Childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase, defined by disability progression in the absence of clear relapses, between 15 to 20 years following first attack. What other disease/condition shares some of these symptoms? Acutely, it is important to exclude central nervous system infection especially if neurological symptoms are accompanied by fever, encephalopathy, meningismus or other systemic signs. The combination of brain and/or spinal cord white matter abnormalities with multiple cranial neuropathies should raise suspicion of central nervous system Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis), especially if there has been recent travel to an endemic area or if a tick bite is recalled. While rare, malignancy, such as central nervous system lymphoma, should also be considered, particularly if MRI features are atypical for demyelination, or if spinal fluid examination reveals atypical cells. A history of persistent or increasingly frequent headache, seizures, or lumbar puncture evidence of an elevated opening pressure should prompt consideration of isolated CNS vasculitis or CNS vasculitis associated with systemic disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). Children with CNS vaculitis usually respond to steroid therapy and experience an exacerbation of symptoms as steroids are tapered. Distinguishing vasculitis from MS has important therapeutic implications as vasculitis management requires long-term immunosuppression with medications such as cyclophosphamide. Neurological symptoms associated with renal or liver impairment, fever, lymphadenopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation should prompt consideration of macrophage activation syndrome. High serum ferritin and fasting triglycerides, unexpectedly low ESR, and the presence of hemophaocytic cells in a bone marrow aspirate or CSF are diagnostic. Repeated attacks of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis should raise suspicion of the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). The diagnosis of NMO is aided by testing for antibodies directed against Aquaporin 4. NMO is important to consider as the disease often has an aggressive course with rapid disability progression, requiring potent immunosuppressive agents to maintain disease control. See Figure 6. MS is thought to be a disease influenced by both genetic predisposing factors and environmental triggers of aberrant CNS directed autoimmunity. It is increasingly believed that MS predisposition is established during childhood, as evidenced by studies of immigrants to areas of high MS prevalence who acquire the MS risk of their new community only if they immigrated prior to age 15 years. What laboratory studies should you request to help confirm the diagnosis? How should you interpret the results? There is no laboratory test that can confirm MS diagnosis. The majority of laboratory evaluations are performed to exclude other conditions – a requirement prior to considering MS as the etiology of a patient’s clinical symptoms. However, several investigations are helpful in supporting an MS diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is important in confirming the presence of CNS demyelination and for excluding other diagnoses. At first presentation, more that 50% of children with MS will have an elevated CSF leukocyte count, typically below 30 cells/microliter with a lymphocytic predominance. A higher leukocyte count or neutrophilic predominance should prompt consideration of CNS vasculitis, CNS infection, or NMO. CNS vasculitis is also often associated with an elevated opening pressure. CSF oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in CSF, but not detected in serum, may be found in up to 90% of childhood-onset MS patients at first presentation as compared to approximately 10% of children with ADEM or NMO. Isoelectric focusing methods have the highest diagnostic yield. It should be noted that MS patients may initially have undetectable CSF OCBs, but may develop them later in the disease course. Testing of visual, brainstem auditory, and visual evoked potentials is often useful for confirming the clinical demyelinating syndrome and for documenting subclinical disease. Almost 50% of children with MS in one study demonstrated subclinical abnormalities in at least one of these evoked potential pathways, most commonly visual. Visual evoked potentials are abnormal in over 85% of children with clinical optic neuritis. Would imaging studies be helpful? If so, which ones? Neuroimaging, especially brain and/or spinal MRI with contrast, is valuable in confirming the presence of inflammatory CNS lesions and in excluding other possible diagnoses. Lesion characteristics of younger children may differ from older children, with younger MS patients being more likely to have ill-defined brain MRI lesions and grey matter involvement. Large lesions with indistinct borders are typical for ADEM. One recent study suggested that the presence of two of the following MRI features may aid in distinguishing children with MS from those with ADEM with 81% sensitivity and 95% specificity: i. presence of T1 black holes ii. absence of diffuse bilateral pattern iii. presence of two or more periventricular lesions. MRI has now been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for MS in children and adults and allows a diagnosis of MS even at first presentation if there is the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions suggesting disease dissemination in time. Classification of Childhood Demyelinating Syndromes An algorithmic approach to the classification of childhood demyelination has been published (Banwell, Lancet Neurol 2007) and Yeh (Nature Reviews Neurol 2009 ). If you are able to confirm that the patient has Multiple Sclerosis, what treatment should be initiated? The care of children with MS revolves around management of acute relapses and longer-term immunomodulation with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. The acute management of a first attack of demyelination or MS relapse usually relies on initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Doses in the range of 20-30 mg/kg IV per day (maximum 1 g per dose) for 3 to 5 days are typically used. Mild relapses that are not distressing to the patient and do not impair functioning may require supportive management, but not pharmacological therapy. Serum glucose, urine glucose, and blood pressure should be monitored during corticosteroid treatment. If children improve, with this initial course but have an incomplete resolution of symptoms, an oral prednisone taper starting at 1 mg/kg/day for 2-3 weeks could be considered. If children do not significantly improve or clinically worsen during the course of steroid therapy, evidence from published case series suggest that IVIG may be of benefit with a typical dose of 2 g/kg administered over 2 to 5 days. If symptoms of demyelination are severe and potentially life-threatening (for example, severe encephalopathy or respiratory depression), there is class I evidence in adult MS patients for the use of plasma exchange (PLEX), which is typically administered as 5 to 8 exchanges over 10 days. Class I evidence in adult-onset MS exists for the following therapies: interferon beta 1a, interferon beta 1b, and glatiramer acetate. Route of administration, doses, potential adverse effects, and associated laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Figure 5. While there have been no formal randomized-controlled trials of interferons or glatiramer acetate in children with MS, available case-series level evidence suggest that these treatments are safe and well-tolerated in childhood. Children who are receiving interferon treatments should have serum white blood cell counts and liver enzymes monitored monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Thyroid function should be monitored yearly. Sexually active patients should be counselled regarding contraceptive use due to potential teratogenicity of some of these agents. Second-line therapies are offered to families if frequent relapses occur despite treatment with one of the first-line agents, or if treatment with these agents causes intolerable side effects. Cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, azahtioprine all have case-series level evidence to support their use in childhood MS. Case series have also recently been published reporting natalizumab use in pediatric MS patients. Fingolimod (FTY 720) has recently been licensed for use in adult-onset MS patients and increased efficacy and convenience of oral administration may make this an attractive therapeutic option for pediatric MS patients. The safety of this medication in children for whom the immune system is still maturing has not yet been definitively established and fingolimod does not have regulatory approval for use in children. Emerging therapies including cladribine, rituximab, alemtuzumab, dacluzumab, laquinimod and ocrelizumab also have the potential for improved efficacy and tolerabiltiy as compared to interferons or glatiramer acetate but the risks of life-threatening infection and malignancy must be carefully considered, especially for pediatric MS patients. What are the adverse effects associated with each treatment option? Corticosteroid therapy may be associated with the development of hypertension and hyperglycemia. Many children experience gastrointestinal irritation that can be reduced with use of H2 blocking agents. Agitation, mood disturbances, sleep disruption and personality changes are common in patients on high doses of corticosteroids, but typically resolve as doses are reduced. Longer-term use may be associated with osteopenia, weight gain, and adrenal suppression. Given that long-term (ie: more than 3 weeks) of corticosteroid therapy is not recommended and repeated monthly intravenous corticosteroids failed as a model for MS disease modulation, corticosteroids are reserved for acute relapse therapy. IVIG infusion may be associated with headache, nausea, flushing, back pain, and hyptotension. If any of these occurs during an infusion, the infusion rate may be slowed or the medication discontinued. Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids may be useful in preventing these symptoms. Rarely, IVIG may be associated with acute renal failure, cardiac failure, or thrombosis. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been described in patients with IgA deficiency. Aseptic meningitis is a well-described complication of IVIG administration. As in treatment with other blood products, transmission of infectious agents is possible. Treatment with PLEX may be associated with hypotension, pulmonary edema, metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte abnormalities (ex: hypocalcemia or hypokalemia) and therefore requires administration by a trained team of individuals and close monitoring. Anaphalaxis is rare but can occur as can significant hemorrhage (from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and infection. Side effects of commonly used first-line immunomodulatory therapies are summarized in Figure 5. What are the possible outcomes of Multiple Sclerosis? Almost 95% of children with MS experience a relapsing remitting course with attacks consisting of subacute onset of neurological symptoms separated by periods of relative disease quiescence. While recovery after an acute relapse is expected, residual deficits often perist. Persistent neurological deficits may significantly affect daily functioning. After a period of between 15 to 20 years, childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase where there is disability accrual in the absence of discrete relapses. The goal of immunomodulatory treatment is to reduce relapse rate and long-term disabilty. The available first-line therapeutic agents have a similar efficacy in reducing relapse rates by approximately 18-30%. Medications differ in terms of route of administration, frequency of administration, and side effect profiles and therefore treatment choice must be individualized. Fatigue significant enough to limit daily activities and to affect school performance is experienced by up to 40% of children with MS. Non-pharmacological measures such as scheduling key activities for early in the day, and brief daytime napping may be sufficient for some MS patients, but pharmacological therapy is often required. Modafinil prescribed at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily and increased as needed up to 100 mg twice daily is often an effective pharmacological therapy. Childhood MS occurs during key academic years and ongoing CNS inflammation may interfere with learning and memory. Between 50- 70% of children with MS demonstrate evidence of cognitive impairment with formal testing. Cognitive impairment has been associated with younger age at first attack and longer disease duration. Impaired learning and scholastic difficulties have longer-term implications for global functioning and vocational choices. Children with MS may experience bowel and/or bladder dysfunction as well as sexual dysfunction. Mood disorders, most commonly depression, are often identified in pediatric MS patients. Health care practioners should be comfortable discussing these issues with adolescent patients. Childhood MS is being increasingly recognized and diagnosed. While the true incidence of pediatric MS remains to be precisely defined, it is estimated that 3-10% of all MS patients experience their first symptoms prior to the age of 18 years. Multiple sclerosis in both children and adults has been reported in many countries worldwide, but there is marked regional variation in MS prevalence. There is a well-described latitude gradient in MS, with greatest MS prevalence reported in countries further away (in either direction) from the equator. Early life place of residence appears to correlate with MS risk. A study of adult-onset MS patients demonstrated that immigration from areas of low reported MS prevalence (India and Pakistan) prior to the age of 15 years was associated with higher risk of being later diagnosed with MS as compared to immigration after age 15. A single center Canadian study of adult and childhood-onset MS patients showed that the two groups shared the common experience of having spent most of the childhood years in Canada, irrespective of self-reported familial ancestry. One of the factors that may explain regional variations in MS risk and especially the latitude gradient is sunlight exposure and consequent serum vitamin D status. Studies in adults have shown that MS risk is inversely related to daily oral vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. A study of twins discordant for MS diagnosis showed that co-twins who reported higher sunlight exposure were less likely to subsequently develop MS. Risk of adult-onset MS is higher for individuals born in the spring as compared to the fall, suggesting that maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy may be an important determinant of MS risk. Both retrospective and prospective studies in children have shown that low serum 25(OH)D levels at first presentation are correlated with increased risk of MS diagnosis. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been implicated as a contributing factor to MS development in both children and adults. Three case-control studies in children have shown that children with MS more commonly demonstrate remote EBV seropositivity as compared to matched controls. One prospective Canadian study has shown EBV seropositivity at first attack of CNS demyelination to be more common in children later diagnosed with MS as compared to those individuals remaining monophasic. In seropositive individuals, antibody titres are also higher in children with MS as compared to controls. MS is more common in first-degree relatives of MS patients, as compared to the general population, and MS has a higher prevalence in monozygotic as opposed to dizygotic twins, suggesting that there may a genetic contribution to MS risk. The HLA DRB1 allele has been associated with increased risk of adult-onset MS in numerous studies. A recent prospective study in Canadian children with a first attack of central nervous system demyelination demonstrated that the HLA DRB1*15 allele was more common in those children later diagnosed with MS as opposed to children who remained monophasic. Several genome-wide studies have implicated other immune-related genes in MS, but all are felt to have a very low contribution to individual MS risk. What complications might you expect from the disease or treatment of the disease? Fatigue, cognitive impairment, and persistent neurological disability are all possible complications of MS in children (see above). Treatment-related side effects are discussed in the section describing therapies. Are additional laboratory studies available; even some that are not widely available? Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new non-invasive technique that enables measurement of retinal nerve fibre thickness. As significant numbers of axons are found in the retina, OCT is emerging as a potentially valuable tool in measuring the degree of axonal degeneration in MS. Applications of OCT in MS include estimation of visual prognosis after optic neuritis, demonstration of degree of axonal degeneration in MS patients without optic neuritis, and use as a surrogate outcome marker in MS treatment trials. To date, there is no known intervention that will prevent MS development. There is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency at first presentation of neurological symptoms increases risk of subsequent attacks and is associated with relapse rate in individuals with established MS. Future studies exploring the role of vitamin D supplementation are of considerable interest.

Resources:MS Society of Canada: National MS Society: . Ongoing controversies regarding etiology, diagnosis, treatment There is still considerable debate about definitions for many childhood demyelinating syndromes, especially recurrent and multiphasic forms of ADEM. It remains unclear whether these forms of ADEM represent discrete diagnostic entities with a favourable prognosis, or if these forms of ADEM represent an age-related early manifestation of MS. Treatment algorithms for childhood MS are largely derived from randomized controlled trials conducted in adults. There is a paucity of clinical trials that include pediatric participants. Inclusion of children with MS in large scale therapy trials will be increasingly important in the near future with the introduction of new potent immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments for whom the effects on the developing immune system have yet to be defined.

aa6439fb-43d6-41b3-89dd-3e37342b2613,"Published: April 03, 2010. Updated: April 03, 2010 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease, a non-contagious chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system which can present with a variety of neurological symptoms occurring in attacks or slowly progressing over time. The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is approximately 350,000 cases in the United States and more than 2.5 million worldwide. There are at least 10,000 newly diagnosed cases of MS annually. In northern Europe, continental North America, and Australasia, about one of every 1000 citizens suffers from multiple sclerosis, whereas in the Arabian peninsula, Asia, and continental South America, the frequency is much lower. In Sub-Saharan Africa, MS is extremely rare. With important exceptions, there is a North-South gradient in the Northern hemisphere and a South-North gradient in the Southern hemisphere, with very low frequencies near the equator (between latitudes 40 degrees North and 40 degrees South. Climate, diet, geomagnetism, toxins, sunlight, genetic factors, and infectious diseases have been discussed as possible reasons for these regional differences. It has been postulated that an environmental factor during childhood might play an important role for the development of MS later in life. This was based on several studies in migrants demonstrating that if migration occurs before the age of 15, the migrant acquires his new region’s susceptibility to MS. If migration takes place after 15, the migrant keeps the susceptibility of his home country. MS occurs mainly in the Caucasian race. It is 20-fold lower in the Inuits of Canada than in other Canadians living in the same region. It is also rare in the Native American tribes of North America, the Australian Aborigine and the Maoris of New Zealand. These few examples point out that the genetic background plays an important role in the development of MS (see below). As observed in many autoimmune disorders, MS is more common in females than males; the mean sex ratio is about two females for every male. In children, who rarely develop MS, the sex ratio may reach three females for each male, whereas MS occurring in the fifth decade more commonly affects males. Onset of symptoms usually occurs between 20 to 40 years of age, rarely below 15 or above 60, although both is possible. MS is not strictly a hereditary disease. However, MS is a disease influenced by a variety of factors, one of which is the genetic background of an individual. There is no single gene known to be responsible for MS, though a few genes have been demonstrated to increase the risk of development. Although these genes are of scientific interest and continue to play a part in research, they are not enough to diagnose an individual with MS. Overall, an average one of every 25 siblings of an individual with MS will also be afflicted. Up to every second identical twin of a MS-affected person will develop MS, but only one of 20 fraternal twins. If one parent is affected by MS, only about 1 of 40 of his children will develop MS later in life. There also seems to be an association with specific HLA antigens (HLA-DR2). The ultimate cause of MS is unknown. It is hypothesised that a viral infection or other environmental factor in childhood might prime the immune system for an abnormal reaction later in life. On a molecular level, there might be a structural similarity between an unidentified infectious agent and components of the central nervous system, causing confusion in the immune system later in life (a process called “molecular mimicry”). However, so far there is no known “MS virus”. Certainly MS is not an infectious disease and not contagious. The importance of genetic factors has been discussed above. It is widely accepted that a special subset of white blood cells, called T cells, play a key role in the development of MS. Under normal circumstances, these lymphocytes can distinguish between self and non-self. In a person with MS, however, these cells recognize healthy parts of the central nervous system as foreign, and attack them as they would a virus. In MS, the part of the nervous system primarily attacked is myelin. Myelin is a fatty substance that covers the axons of nerve cells, and which is important for proper nerve conduction. Normally, there is a tight barrier between blood and brain, called the blood-brain barrier (BBB), built up of endothelial cells lining the blood vessel walls. Lymphocytes (blue) surrounding blood vessel (center) within MS lesionIn MS, the BBB breaks down; autoreactive T cells cross the BBB and trigger an inflammatory process, also mediated by other immune cells, such as cytokines and antibodies. Due to this abnormal behavior of the immune system, MS is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The inflammatory process finally leads to a destruction of myelin called demyelination. Repair processes, called remyelination, also play an important role. This is one of the reasons why, especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms tend to decrease or disappear temporarily after days to months. Nevertheless, axonal damage and irreversible loss of neurons occur early during the course of the disease. However, due to its plasticity the brain can often compensate for some portion of the damage. MS symptoms develop as a result of multiple lesions in the brain and spinal cord, and can vary greatly between different individuals, depending on where the lesions occur. In general, relapses tend to occur more frequently during spring and summer than during autumn and winter. Infections like the common cold, influenza or unspecific diarrhea increase the risk for a relapse. In contrast, influenza vaccination is safe and does not trigger relapses as demonstrated in several recent studies. It can therefore be recommended for MS patients, especially for those at risk for influenza (e.g. healthcare workers). Tetanus vaccination is considered to be safe as well, although so far it has not been studied in that respect. In general, vaccinations with living, attenuated viruses increase the risk of relapses. Pregnancy can directly effect the susceptibility for relapse. The last three months of pregnancy offers a natural protection against relapses, whereas during the first few months after pregnancy, especially during the first six weeks, the risk for a relapse is increased 20-40%. According to current knowledge, pregnancy doesn’t seem to influence long term disability. MS does not increase the risk of bearing a handicapped child. Statistically, there is no good evidence for triggering of relapses through trauma or operations. In principle, surgical procedures require no special precautions if not dictated by existing disability. Participation in sports is possible, although extremes, such as marathon running, should probably be avoided. Emotional stress may cause a relapse, although study data has been inconsistent. Heat can transiently increase symptoms, in something known as Uhthoff’s phenomenon. This is why some patients avoid saunas or even hot showers. However, heat is not an established trigger of relapses. Extensive exposure to the sun should be avoided, since ultraviolet radiation is a strong stimulus for the immune system. Currently there are no clinically established laboratory investigations available to predict prognosis or therapeutic response, although promising approaches have been undertaken that need further confirmation, such as treatments based on the two antibodies anti-MOG and anti-MBP, and TRAIL, a TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand. In most cases MS starts with an acute flare-up of symptoms within hours to days, called a relapse, exacerbation, bout, episode, or attack. Inflammation of an optic nerve (optic neuritis), causing painfulness of eye movement and visual deterioration frequently is the first symptom. However, not all patients with optic neuritis develop MS. Sensory disturbances such as numbness or tingling sensations are other frequent initial symptoms. In principle, MS can start with any of the symptoms mentioned in the section above. Especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms frequently decrease or resolve spontaneously within days to months. Therefore, this disease course is called relapsing remitting. New relapses can occur within weeks to many years and can include formerly experienced and/or new symptoms. However, MRI studies have shown that nerve damage can continue in relapsing remitting patients even if symptoms subside. It has long been known that “MS never sleeps”. This highlights the importance of preventive treatment if and when it is available. In many cases, the disease course changes after several years and symptoms start to deteriorate slowly with or without superimposed relapses. This course is called secondary chronic-progressive, or just secondary progressive. However, some patients stay in a relapsing remitting course for the rest of their lives. About 10% of all MS-affected individuals experience chronic progression without relapses from onset of symptoms. This course is called primary progressive and frequently comes along with weakness of the legs, gait and bladder disturbances. Degenerative processes and not inflammation are thought to play the most important role in this clinical disease course. Chronic progression from onset of symptoms with superimposed relapses is referred to as relapsing progressive. MS is suspected in a female, between 15 and 60 years old and usually of Northern European, Northern US or Canadian descent. Affected individuals may experience a wide variety of symptoms, such as vision loss, double vision, nystagmus, difficulty with speech, various kinds of tremor, clumsiness of the hands, unsteady gait, weakness, spasticity, numbness, and bladder (urgency, hesitancy), bowel, as well as sexual dysfunction. Various cognitive impairments are also common, such as difficulty performing multiple tasks at once, difficulty following detailed instructions, loss of short term memory, depression, and fatigue. Symptoms and signs may partially disappear after a few days or weeks. MS plaques appear hyperintense on T2 weighted studies. They usually are oval in shape, and appear in the periventricular region or corpus callosum. Detection of gadolinium enhancement can help differentiate active from chronic lesions and could help in establishing the temporal dissemination of the disease on follow up. A lumbar puncture, which is a procedure done to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, is useful for providing evidence of chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, often indicated by oligoclonal banding. Nerve conduction studies of optic, sensory and motor nerves can provide further evidence for MS, as the process of demyelination results in reduced nerve conduction velocities. The diagnostic process is completed by several laboratory tests to exclude other diseases that can mimic MS, such as Sarcoidosis, Vasculitis, and Lyme disease). A definite diagnosis of MS requires evidence for dissemination of lesions within the central nervous system both in space and in time. This means that not only must there exist evidence of at least two distinct lesions, verifiable by clinical symptoms or by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), there must also be evidence of an occurrence of new symptoms or lesions within a time interval of at least 30 days. Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is made using the 2005 revised McDonald diagnostic criteria [1]: Generally speaking, three parameters are used to assess the diagnosis. An attack refers to an episode of neurological disturbance that has lasted for at least 24 hours. This is usually a subjective report by the patient and should be backed by objective findings. A clinical lesion refers to a neurological lesion detected by history and physical examination. A paraclinical lesion refers to a lesion that is detected by MRI, evoked response testing or urodynamic studies. In addition to the assessment of the three parameters discussed above, the criteria require that evidence for dissemination of lesions in both space (spatial dissemination) and time (temporal dissemination). 2005 revised McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + two clinical lesions (spatial dissemination) Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + one clinical lesion + one paraclinical lesion (spatial dissemination). One attack + one clinical lesion + evidence of spatial dissemination by MRI, CSF + evidence of temporal dissemination by MRI or evidence of second clinical attack. One year of disease progression + two of the following There is no known definitive cure for multiple sclerosis. However, several drugs have proven to be effective in its treatment. Intensive research is underway to study a variety of promising new drugs. Treatment is aimed at maintaining a maximum quality of life. Physiotherapy plays an important role. There are three primary forms of medication used to treat the symptoms: During an exacerbation, corticosteroids (such as prednisone or methylprednisolone) used at high dosages (500 mg - 2 g per day intravenously for a course of 3 to 5 days) can accelerate regression of symptoms. Subsequent tapering with pills may be reasonable in certain cases. There is clear evidence that sole treatment with oral steroids at dosages of 100 mg per day or less and subsequent tapering is inferior to intravenous high dose treatment. In principle, steroid treatment during pregnancy is possible. There is no good evidence that corticosteroids influence longterm outcome. Long-term treatment can influence the course of the disease: Interferon-beta1a or beta1b (Avonex; Betaseron [in Europe Betaferon]; Rebif) has been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Interferon-beta is a cytokine that under natural conditions is produced by the body during viral infections; as a drug it is extracted either from special mammalian cells or special bacteria. All preparations must be injected into either muscle or skin every second day to once per week, depending on the preparation. Attempts to develop pills containing Interferon-beta have not been successful so far. Some of the interferons have been proven to be effective not only in relapsing remitting MS, but also in secondary progressive MS, as long as superimposed relapses occur. Main side effects include flu-like symptoms which tend to decrease during ongoing therapy and which can be alleviated, for example, by paracetamol or ibuprofen. Another frequent side effect is inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site if Intereferon-beta is injected into the skin. Regular blood monitoring is required. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) has also been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Concerning its therapeutic effect it is approximately comparable to Interferon-beta. Glatiramer acetate consists of synthetic peptides made of four different amino acids, which are basic modules of all proteins in the human body. Once per day must be injected into the skin. Attempts to develop pills containing glatiramer acetate have also been unsuccessful. Copaxone is effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS. So far, beneficial effects in secondary progressive MS have not been convincingly demonstrated. Main side effects include inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site, and a rare but transient and perturbing “post-injection” reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, breathlessness, and anxiety. A post-injection reaction does not require discontinuation of therapy. In general, Copaxone is considered to cause fewer side effects than Interferon-beta. However, most MS patients injecting Interferon-beta also tolerate their therapy well. Regular blood monitoring is required. Azathioprine is an agent available as a pill approved for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS in some countries. However, its effectiveness has not been proven as stringently as for the interferons and glatiramer acetate, and an effect in secondary progressive MS has not been demonstrated. In general, it is well tolerated. After longtime therapy the risk of cancer increases slightly (after 10 years of therapy about fourfold). Regular blood monitoring is required. There is some evidence that immunoglobulins (antibodies) are effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, a large clinical trial (PRIVIG) is presently continuing. Immunoglobulins have not been proven to be effective in secondary progressive MS. The currently most effective drug in the preventive treatment of MS is Mitoxantrone. It has been proven to be effective in relapsing remitting and in secondary progressive MS. In most cases it is administered every three months intravenously. Therapy with Mitoxantrone is generally well tolerated, however, since with ongoing therapy the risk for damage of the heart muscle increases, at an average Mitoxantrone can only be administered for 3 to 4 years. This is why Mitoxantrone is only used in cases of rapid disease progression. Mitoxantrone treatment requires monitoring of the heart function during therapy. Regular blood monitoring is required. With these precautions Mitoxantrone treatment is safe. A family of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the statins, have shown anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of MS. However, so far there has not been provided sufficient evidence that statins are beneficial in the treatment of human MS patients with normal cholesterol levels. Recently, scientists found women who took vitamin D supplements were 40% less likely to develop multiple sclerosis than women who did not take supplements. However, this study does not allow to conclude that vitamin D has a beneficial influence on ongoing MS. Furthermore it could not distinguish between a beneficial effect of vitamin D and multivitamin drugs including vitamin E and various B vitamins which may also exert a protective effect. Primary progressive MS is very difficult to treat. High dose corticosteroids every three months can show some effect. In principle, there is no efficient preventive treatment for primary progressive MS available. Symptomatic therapy as described in the next paragraph and physiotherapy play an important role. A variety of medications are used to treat symptoms without influencing the inflammatory nature of the disease (symptomatic treatment): Baclofen and tizanidine can be useful against spasticity. There is no convincing evidence that cannabinoids (marijuana) can improve spasticity. The anticonvulsant drugs Gabapentin and Carbamazepine and the antidepressant amitriptyline can improve pain and tingling sensations in certain cases. SSRIs be used for depression, as well as for fatigue. Fatigue can also be influenced by amantadine and modafinil. There is also treatment for bladder disturbances available which is effective in many cases. Examples are oxybutynin and trospium chloride. Treatment with sildenafil (Viagra) or similar substances can improve male erectile dysfunction in many cases. Additional treatment options include plasmapheresis (“washing the blood”, showing similarities to dialysis) for severe, non-steroidresponsive relapses. Because of improved treatment for complications such as lung and bladder infections, the life expectancy of those diagnosed with MS is only slightly reduced. The earlier in life disease onset occurs, the slower disability progresses. This is due to more frequent chronic progressive courses with faster accumulation of disability when onset occurs at a higher age. Disability after 5 years correlates well with disability after 15 years: 2/3 of MS patients with low disability after 5 years will not markedly deteriorate during the next ten years. Further MS cases in the family do not influence disease progression. 1 of 3 patients will still be able to work after 15-20 years. Visual loss as the initial symptom is a marker for a rather good prognosis; gait disturbance, weakness or numbness for a rather poor prognosis. Rapid regression of initial symptoms, age at onset below 35, only a single symptom at onset, rapid development of initial symptoms and short duration of the last relapse indicate a good prognosis. When the initial disease course is relapsing remitting, the statistical duration until a wheelchair is needed, is 20 years. This means that many MS patients will never need a wheelchair. If the disease course is primary progressive then a wheelchair at an average will be needed after 6 to 7 years. It has to be noted that most of this longterm data was acquired before the advent of modern immunomodulatory drugs about 10 years ago, which have been shown to delay disease progression over a period of several years.

2ff79889-eab0-4b19-97b8-7216d3066379,"— Three new drug approvals, vaccination guidelines, and more by Multiple sclerosis (MS) news in 2019 focused largely on drugs -- new drugs, old drugs, drug costs, and treatment strategies -- but new vaccination guidelines and biomarker research also earned headlines. The FDA approved three new MS drugs in 2019, most recently (Vumerity), a new oral fumarate drug to treat relapsing forms of MS. Like dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), which was approved in 2013 for relapsing MS, diroximel fumarate is designed to convert to monomethyl fumarate in the body, but appears to produce fewer gastrointestinal side effects than the older drug. Diroximel fumarate relied in part on dimethyl fumarate's safety and efficacy data and findings from the ongoing, open-label phase III study to win FDA approval. Two other MS drugs earned OKs this year, the first being (Mayzent) for adult patients with relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. The drug was the first oral agent for secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with active disease and the first treatment specifically approved for patients with active SPMS in over 15 years. The FDA based its decision on the phase III trial results, which demonstrated that patients with SPMS had 21% lower risk in time to 3-month confirmed disability progression with siponimod than with placebo. The other FDA nod went to (Mavenclad), also for active secondary progressive disease and relapsing MS, based on results of the phase III clinical trial. In that study, cladribine (also a chemotherapy drug) significantly decreased the number of MS relapses and reduced the progression of disability versus placebo. The drug had a to its ultimate approval. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Arzerra) -- approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia but investigational for MS -- outperformed teriflunomide (Aubagio) in reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR), according to two phase III studies presented at the 2019 European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) congress in September. In the ASCLEPIOS I trial, monthly injections of ofatumumab led to a 50.5% relative reduction in ARR compared with oral teriflunomide; in ASCLEPIOS II, the ARR with ofatumumab bested that of teriflunomide by 58.5%. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), which was approved in 2017 for relapsing and primary progressive MS, and rituximab (Rituxan), which is used off-label in MS, ofatumumab depletes B cells; but unlike those drugs, ofatumumab can be self-injected. Also reported at ECTRIMS were new findings about , an investigational selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator, which outperformed teriflunomide in a head-to-head trial of adult relapsing MS patients. In the OPTIMUM phase III trial, oral ponesimod reduced ARR by 30.5% versus teriflunomide over about two years. The trial aimed to place ponesimod within the spectrum of the oral MS drugs, ""which are getting to be, more and more, the standard treatment,"" OPTIMUM researcher Ludwig Kappos, MD, of University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland, told Ocrelizumab showed real-world safety and effectiveness in data presented at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) forum in March. In a prospective study of patients who started treatment in 2017, ocrelizumab showed fewer adverse events than expected in six months of clinical practice. Also at ACTRIMS, an extension study of patients from the CARE-MS II trial showed that over eight years, alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) continued to show benefits in clinical outcomes, lesion load, and brain volume loss in relapsing-remitting MS. Interim data from the real-world ESTEEM study presented at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) annual meeting in June showed that dimethyl fumarate was effective and safe for black patients with relapsing-remitting MS. And in the phase IIIb ASSESS trial, also presented at CMSC, fingolimod (Gilenya) bested glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) at lowering relapses and disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS patients. A trial published in January showed that, in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting MS, than disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), though ocrelizumab and alemtuzumab were not included in the study. Also in January were the results of a three-cohort study that showed that patients treated initially with fingolimod, natalizumab (Tysabri), or alemtuzumab had a lower risk of converting to secondary progressive MS than patients who started with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (Rebif). ""The ditherers must take note,"" wrote editorialist Ari Green, MD, of the University of California San Francisco: ""The signs are strongly pointing to the to forestall damage. Waiting on the sidelines does not appear justified."" In real-life settings, an observational study in Wales found that starting produced better long-term outcomes. And higher-efficacy infusible therapies had a disproportionately larger effect in patients, a chart review of 1,000 patients at University of Colorado in Aurora presented at ECTRIMS suggested. At ACTRIMS, a small study looked at patients with and found they had similar times to relapses, inflammatory events, and disability progression as stable patients who remained on treatment. ""This data suggest that younger age goes along with more inflammatory disease activity and that is the critical group that needs to be treated with DMTs,"" said author Tanuja Chitnis, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, in an interview with ""And potentially after the age of 45 or 50, in stable patients, there may be opportunities to stop or step down DMTs."" Biomarkers that predicted long-term MS outcomes also racked up headlines. At ECTRIMS, researchers showed that levels of serum neurofilament light (NfL) increased six years before the clinical onset of MS. Research presented at ACTRIMS indicated that early levels of serum NfL may pinpoint which MS patients are at . And in a longitudinal study published this year, 15 years after a clinically isolated syndrome event, showing that spinal cord and gadolinium-enhancing lesions had consistent links with secondary progression development and physical disability. Two studies published this year assessed rising MS drug costs. One found that MS patients with private insurance paid 20 times more in 2016 compared with 2004; the other showed that prices of self-administered MS drugs more than quadrupled in 11 years and Medicare spending for Medicare Part D beneficiaries soared more than 10-fold during the same period. The American Academy of Neurology issued new indicating that most MS patients should receive recommended vaccinations, including yearly flu shots. A case-control study presented at ECTRIMS demonstrated that . ""In the general population, vaccinations are seen as a problem; there are lobbies in many countries against vaccinations,"" Mar Tintore, MD, PhD, of University Hospital Vall d'Hebron in Barcelona, Spain, told ""In MS patients, vaccinations are especially important. Now that we are using immunosuppressive drugs, we need to vaccinate our patients.""

Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Find out about available and emerging therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory central nervous system disease that causes often disabling physical symptoms, including problems with mobility, vision, coordination and cognitive function, as well as fatigue and pain. If you've been diagnosed with relapsing-remitting , your doctor is likely to recommend immediate treatment with medications known as disease-modifying therapy (DMT). have been shown to reduce the number of relapses and delay progression of disability to some degree. These drugs differ in how they're taken and how often, whether they can be taken during pregnancy, and what side effects they can cause. They also differ in how people respond to them, and a person's response to a drug can change over time. Also, aren't a cure, and you might still need treatment for symptoms of . An understanding of can help you and your doctor form the best treatment strategy for your relapsing-remitting . These medications are among the first approved for relapsing and are still used as first line therapy. They include: The interferon beta medications are given by self-injection, either under the skin or in a muscle. The frequency of injections varies from once every two days to once every two weeks. These drugs have moderate to strong evidence of effectiveness, reducing the relapse rate and slowing the development of new -related brain lesions for relapsing . These drugs are considered generally safe and require minimal monitoring. Flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions, such as redness and discomfort, are commonly reported side effects of interferon beta drugs. This also is considered an initial therapy option for relapsing . This drug is thought to act through immune system cells known as T cells. It might also have nerve-protecting effects. Glatiramer acetate is given by self-injection under the skin, either three times weekly or every day. It's generally well tolerated, but injection site reactions, such as redness and discomfort, are common. This is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat both relapsing and primary-progressive . Not only has it been shown to reduce relapses, but it can slow disease progression. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion initially twice in two weeks. After that, the infusion is given every six months. Infusion reactions, such as a headache, rash, nausea and fever, are common. Your doctor might recommend that you be given a corticosteroid and an antihistamine before infusion to help prevent reactions. People with hepatitis B shouldn't take ocrelizamab. is a humanized monoclonal antibody that reduces the migration of immune cells across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. This medication is given intravenously every four weeks. Natalizumab is effective against relapsing , reducing the relapse rate by about two-thirds. However, it's associated with a small but important risk of a serious brain infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). People who take natalizumab must be closely monitored for symptoms of , which include progressive weakness and visual or cognitive changes that might not be reversible. A person's ongoing risk is assessed using factors such as: The presence of antibodies to a virus known as John Cunningham virus on blood testing Previous treatment of immunosuppressive drugs, such as mitoxantrone This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells, but it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions, such as a headache, rash, nausea and fever, are common with alemtuzumab. Due to the risks associated with alemtuzamab, the recommends extensive screening before using the drug. It's only available from registered providers, and people treated with alemtuzumab must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. These oral are approved for treating relapsing . This once-daily oral medication reduces the relapse rate of . Fingolimod is a unique medication that binds to many different types of body cells. It traps white blood cells in lymph nodes so that they can't enter the brain and cause new lesions. People with heart disorders or related conditions can't use fingolimod. It can temporarily slow the heart rate, so the first dose must be taken under medical supervision. It also requires monitoring of vision because of a risk of buildup of fluid in the macula, an area in the center of the retina. For that reason, people with diabetes generally shouldn't use fingolimod. Teriflunomide has been approved in two doses, 7 milligrams (mg) and 14 mg, taken once daily. It's generally well tolerated at both doses. Possible side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, elevation in liver enzymes and hair thinning. Pregnant women and people with liver conditions shouldn't use teriflunomide. Also known as BG-12, dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily. Common side effects include flushing and gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea and nausea. Its coating is designed to reduce gastrointestinal problems, and taking it with food also can help relieve them. This twice-daily capsule is similar to dimethyl fumarate but typically causes fewer side effects. It's approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of . This drug has been shown to be effective in reducing relapses and new brain lesions. It was also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include increased risk of developing infections. This once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate and help slow the progression of . It's also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include viral infections, liver problems and low white blood cell count. Other possible side effects include changes in heart rate, headaches and vision problems. There's no way to know which treatments will work best for you or how your disease will progress. Recommendations are based on several factors, including: Recent activity, including recent attack frequency, severity and recovery The severity of lesion damage to the brain and spinal cord based on an MRI Other illnesses you have or medications you take that might interact with therapy Your own preferences regarding type of therapy (oral or injectable, for example) Shared decision-making between you and your doctor is the best approach to your treatment plan. Once you start a , it's important that you continue taking your medication as prescribed. Be sure to report new symptoms to your doctor, who will monitor your response and possibly switch your medication if needed. Your situation is unique, and the best treatment is one tailored to your needs. Olek MJ, et al.

ba3f981b-db10-4c87-bd6b-1a6fac8a9517,"Watch Jack Osbourne Cover 150 Years of MS History in 5 Minutes If ‘you don’t know jack about MS,’ Jack Osbourne is here to help. In a recent video, reality star Jack Osbourne sits on a comfy brown chair inside in a dimly lit room accented with a burning fireplace. Classical music plays in the background. “Oh, hello. I didn’t see you there,” he says, before explaining, “we’re going to be taking a journey to the origins of MS research. Jump aboard and let’s go travel time.” The video is one of the latest in a series of webisodes created by Osbourne for his campaign. Now in its fifth year, the campaign was created along with Teva Pharmaceuticals and focuses on sharing information with people who have a new diagnosis or are living with MS. “We try to humanize the experience for people,” Osbourne told Healthline. “We don’t root ourselves in research. We take the research and hard fact-based evidence that others have done and have proven to be true and we put a human face to it, whether it’s through my story or other people’s stories or educational videos that are easy to understand.” That’s exactly what he does in the 5-minute long webisode, . In the video, Osbourne looks back at how our understanding of MS has changed since 1868 when the disease was officially classified by professor Jean-Martin Charcot, who Osbourne notes was also the first to diagnose the condition in people. Throughout the video, Osbourne talks about other developments of MS throughout history, including those of Dr. James Dawson, who in 1916 released a detailed description of MS as well as changes in lesions caused by the condition. But why does he present the information in the form of a history lesson? Osbourne’s personal journey with MS sparked the idea. In 2012, after experiencing optic neuritis (an inflamed optic nerve) and several months of pinching and numbness in his legs, Osbourne was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). While he experienced permanent damage to his right eye, he currently lives symptom-free. He said understanding how MS treatment has evolved over time strikes a chord with him — and he’s a bit of a history buff as well. “History is the only subject in school that I was any good at,” said Osbourne. “I love telling stories. I think it’s really important. Stories give you an idea of where we’re going to go from where we’ve been and I’ve never really seen anything that was breaking down the history of research into MS, especially as it pertains to the last hundred years or so.” With his campaign team, Osbourne came up with a concise explanation of what the last hundred years plus have looked like “in an easy to digest, somewhat lighthearted way to tell something that is kind of intense,” he said. In all aspects of Osbourne’s campaign, including the webisodes, he said he strives to present humor and lightheartedness. “I have to keep things kind of comical as best as possible because I think without that, all is lost,” he said. “If I can find a way to lift myself up through the process, I think maybe other people will get a little excited about it and not so depressed as far as what we’re talking about.” He also believes that the best way to educate is through comedy. “Some of the most educational, fact-based shows on TV now are delivered through comedy. Not that I’m a comedian in any sense, but keeping things light and funny definitely helps people retain information,” Osbourne said. While he acknowledges that his sense of humor isn’t for everybody, he believes it grabs attention. “My sense of humor is pretty dark. I make pretty dark somewhat inappropriate jokes because I guess I like to make people feel uncomfortable at times. I also like seeing my mother squirm when I make jokes about having MS,” he said with a laugh. “But really, I think keeping it light makes me and others feel better about what we’re going through and leaves people with a little hope.” In fact, hope is something he has lots of, noting that he believes researchers will figure out a way to turn off autoimmune disease during his lifetime. “We are getting so close. We’re screaming ahead and living in a time where we will see huge changes. There seems to be a breakthrough every couple of months as far as research goes or a new treatment coming to market or understanding of genetics,” said Osbourne. “Think about it. Five years ago, there was no treatment for progressive MS. Now there is. They used to tell you that diet and exercise can’t do anything for MS. Now they’re saying it does. It’s a really an exciting time for the community.” Osbourne plans to produce more webisodes and educational information as part of his campaign. He says other ideas are in the works, too, including potentially holding an event. “The great thing is we’ve grown every year and figured out a way to work through things we didn’t know and understand. I think we’ve changed with the landscape of MS in the last 5 years. I don’t think we’re going to run out of ideas any time soon, which is a great place to be,” Osbourne said. He’s proudest of his latest idea coming to life — placing educational handouts in doctors’ offices. “I always wanted to create a platform where doctors can send [their patients] the moment they get diagnosed,” said Osbourne. “Now our pamphlets have been cleared to be placed in doctors’ offices [and those can] direct new patients to our website full of information and educational content that’s easy to digest. That was always my goal.” Cathy Cassata is a freelance writer who specializes in stories around health, mental health, and human behavior.

Reaching an evidence-based prognosis for personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis , –() Personalized treatment is ideal for multiple sclerosis (MS) owing to the heterogeneity of clinical features, but current knowledge gaps, including validation of biomarkers and treatment algorithms, limit practical implementation. The contemporary approach to personalized MS therapy depends on evidence-based prognostication, an initial treatment choice and evaluation of early treatment responses to identify the need to switch therapy. Prognostication is directed by baseline clinical, environmental and demographic factors, MRI measures and biomarkers that correlate with long-term disability measures. The initial treatment choice should be a shared decision between the patient and physician. In addition to prognosis, this choice must account for patient-related factors, including comorbidities, pregnancy planning, preferences of the patients and their comfort with risk, and drug-related factors, including safety, cost and implications for treatment sequencing. Treatment response has traditionally been assessed on the basis of relapse rate, MRI lesions and disability progression. Larger longitudinal data sets have enabled development of composite outcome measures and more stringent standards for disease control. Biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain, have potential as early surrogate markers of prognosis and treatment response but require further validation. Overall, attainment of personalized treatment for MS is complex but will be refined as new data become available. Personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) depends on prognostication at baseline, a shared treatment decision between the physician and patient, and early assessment of response to therapy. Prognosis can be evaluated soon after diagnosis on the basis of demographic and environmental factors, clinical features, MRI measures and biomarkers. Individuals with poor prognostic features should be recommended high-efficacy therapies early on; studies are underway to investigate whether most patients with relapsing–remitting MS could benefit from initial aggressive therapy. During the treatment discussion between the neurologist and patient, factors such as comorbidities, pregnancy planning, patient preferences, risk tolerance, safety, cost and treatment sequencing should be considered in addition to prognosis. Early assessment of treatment response is important to identify the need to switch therapy; composite outcome measures that incorporate clinical and MRI data are best for predicting long-term disability. Personalized MS therapy is currently limited by a lack of evidence-based biomarkers; newer biomarkers, such as neurofilament light chain, have potential, but further validation and standardization of assays are required.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of OMTh on chronic symptoms of MS. Methods: Patients with MS who were evaluated at the neurology clinic at Genoa University in Italy were recruited for this study. Participants received 5 forty-minute MS health education sessions (control group) or 5 OMTh sessions (OMTh group). All participants completed a questionnaire that assessed their level of clinical disability, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality of life before the first session, 1 week after the final session, and 6 months after the final session. The Extended Disability Status Scale, a modified Fatigue Impact Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey were used to assess clinical disability, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality of life, respectively. Results: Twenty-two participants were included in the study (10 in the control group and 12 in the OMTh group). In the OMTh group, statistically significant improvements in fatigue and depression were found 1 week after the final session (P=.002 and P<.001, respectively). An increase in quality of life was also found in the OMTh group 1 week after the final session (P=.36). Conclusion: Results demonstrate that OMTh should be considered in the treatment of patients with chronic symptoms of MS.

Summary Discovering that a child has MS can present unique challenges to families, from managing injections, to communicating with school personnel about cognitive issues. Researchers interviewed 21 parents of children with MS to learn more about these challenges, and we present highlights of these interviews here. The team (Dr. David Rintell – then at Massachusetts General Hospital – and colleagues) published their findings in the  Dr. Rintell was funded by a pilot research award from the National MS Society.   Kids get MS too. Some 8,000–10,000 youngsters in the U.S. have MS, and another 10,000–15,000 experience what may be MS symptoms. In 2006, the National MS Society established a to provide comprehensive evaluation and care to children and teens (up to age 18) with MS and related disorders. Today, the network has evolved to include twelve clinical centers along with a data coordinating center  engaged in research to better understand the cause(s) of MS, the characteristics of these disorders in children and adolescents, and how best to treat them.   Being the parent of a child or adolescent with MS can be very challenging. Research on parents of children with other chronic illnesses indicates that parents experience high levels of stress, and that this stress can affect relationships throughout the family, as well as the ability to manage the disease. Few studies have addressed the specific experiences of parents whose children have MS.   This team interviewed 21 parents of children with MS to learn more about their experiences pre-diagnosis, receiving the MS diagnosis, adapting to life with MS, treatment, family life, school, living with MS over time, and advice to other parents.   Here are some highlights from these interviews, along with quotes in bold from the participating parents: “She used to sleep a lot, and I used to think it was just the lazy teenager. You look back and think, ‘shame on me.’ ” One of the most stressful aspects of having a child with MS is what the authors described as “the diagnostic odyssey” – the days, weeks, or sometimes months of uncertainty and anxiety before a diagnosis is made. The first symptoms experienced by children, even in this small group, varied widely from numbness to cognitive dysfunction. Most parents knew little about MS, and did not realize that children could get the disease. Some parents misconstrued symptoms and experienced significant guilt later on because they originally thought children were just being “lazy.” Shortening this odyssey would be one of the best ways to enhance the well-being of families affected by pediatric MS, say the authors. They noted the importance of educating pediatricians, ophthalmologists, emergency room physicians, and others on the diagnostic frontlines about early symptoms that may signal the onset of MS in kids.   “Being discharged and not having a follow up for six weeks…like most people with internet access, all you do is just read and think worst case scenario… for the next few weeks anything that happened I was like, ‘Oh my God, she’s having a relapse.’ ” Parents were generally impressed with the helpfulness of healthcare providers during the diagnostic process, but sometimes were disappointed in how information was relayed, or withheld. For example, one medical staff member relayed the need for a hospital stay to the child, when the mother had planned to do it herself more thoughtfully. After diagnosis, next steps were not always clear, and parents were sometimes left to figure it out for themselves. The authors stressed the value of a multidisciplinary approach to help families process the diagnosis of a child with MS, including professionals with expertise in mental health, psychology and patient advocacy. The National MS Society provides resources that can help, including Kids Get MS Too: A Handbook for Parents Whose Child or Teen has MS, and the MS International Federation provides .   ""When I notice things are off, I'm like, 'Are you all right, are you all right?' He says, 'Oh, my God, would you stop asking?' Because I know him. I look at him, I say, 'Because I know you, you wait three weeks and then you go, 'Oh, by the way…'"" Learning how to communicate effectively is a parenting challenge, especially for those who have teenagers with MS. Some parents reported becoming more vigilant, and as a result, overbearing, because of their worry that kids would not tell them about symptoms. Others encouraged children to become more independent, concerned that these kids were hesitating to live life to the fullest because of a preoccupation with being sick. All parents interviewed gave children at least some voice in decision-making related to MS.   The authors advise working with mental health professionals who have special expertise in adolescent development, so that families and providers can respond to the special needs of teens with chronic disease.   “The first time I did it I thought I was going to throw up, because it was just the sensation of sticking a needle in my child…” Easily, the biggest challenge reported by these parents relating to treatment was the difficulty of injections. Partly because of the process itself – children’s fear of needles, pain at the injection site, or flu-like symptoms. And partly because of the parents’ distress at observing, or causing, their children’s discomfort. Sometimes, the children were calmer, with one mother reporting that her child said, “You’re not getting the shot. I’m getting the shot. Could you just suck it up and give me the shot?”   Many adults have problems with injections as well, point out the authors, noting the success of a cognitive behavioral intervention developed for people with MS. They suggest adapting this intervention for kids. Oral medication is an option as well, particularly with   “I think his illness threw them for a total loop because physically you look at him and you think nothing’s wrong with him. So I think when the teachers get him in a classroom, they’re like, what is this mother talking about?” Communication with school personnel was a substantial, ongoing task for parents. MS can affect the school experience in a multitude of ways – fatigue can make it hard for kids to get work done on time; processing speed deficits can keep kids from picking up new information; kids can miss class time due to treatment issues. One parent talked about needing to educate teachers that her child needed to be allowed to go to the bathroom immediately upon asking, because of MS-related bladder problems. Even when accommodations are mandated (e.g., through individualized education plans) parents needed to ensure the accommodations were in fact provided.   The National MS Society provides several tools to help kids with MS thrive in school: (one parent makes copies of this for teachers every year!); ; and a handout to let students with MS know their own rights.   “Like anything else, it’s what you make of it. Just one day at a time. Don’t try to over-think it; don’t try to think too far ahead. The ‘what ifs,’ they're there, but don’t concentrate on them too much because – the ‘what ifs’ are not going to do it for you…And support is a big thing. Support’s very big.” When asked what advice they would give to kids and parents experiencing a new diagnosis of MS, the responses showed how these families experienced a mix of difficulty and resilience. Key points of advice were: Understand that it’s most difficult at the beginning, when your child is adjusting to having a chronic illness. Take it day-by-day – worrying about the future is not productive. Manage your emotions – your children will do better if they see that are handling MS. Communicate closely with healthcare providers, and include children in that process as much as is appropriate. Maintain hope – these parents have been able to do so through a variety of sources: faith, watching their children adapt, education about MS, learning about current research.   The National MS Society provides several opportunities for people affected by MS to connect with communities: ;  ; and an online community with groups for , ,  and entire . The team (Dr. David Rintell – then at Massachusetts General Hospital – and colleagues) published their findings in the      The team is planning to publish these findings in full, with the goal of informing healthcare providers who provide medical and psychosocial care to children with MS, sharing findings with parents of recently diagnosed kids, and generating hypotheses for further research.   Learn more about support for families affected by pediatric MS Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli. In these tests, you watch a moving visual pattern, or short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways. In most people with relapsing-remitting , the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on a pattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and confirmed by brain imaging scans, such as MRI. Diagnosing can be more difficult in people with unusual symptoms or progressive disease. In these cases, further testing with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials and additional imaging may be needed. Brain MRI is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis.

Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Multiple sclerosis research laboratory at Mayo Clinic such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, increased blood glucose levels, mood swings and fluid retention. The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven't responded to steroids. For primary-progressive , ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Those who receive this treatment are slightly less likely to progress than those who are untreated. For relapsing-remitting , several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate, slow the formation of new lesions, and potentially reduce risk of brain atrophy and disability accumulation. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting include injectable and oral medications. These drugs are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat . They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You'll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. This medication may help block your immune system's attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You'll need to have your heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include rare serious infections, headaches, high blood pressure and blurred vision. This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis. This twice-daily capsule is similar to dimethyl fumarate but typically causes fewer side effects. It's approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of . This once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects. This drug is associated with birth defects when taken by both men and women. Therefore, use contraception when taking this medication and for up to two years afterward. Couples who wish to become pregnant should talk to their doctor about ways to speed elimination of the drug from the body. This drug requires blood test monitoring in a regular basis. Research shows that this once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate and help slow progression of . It's also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include viral infections, liver problems and low white blood cell count. Other possible side effects include changes in heart rate, headaches and vision problems. Siponimod is harmful to a developing fetus, so women who may become pregnant should use contraception when taking this medication and for 10 days after stopping the medication. Some might need to have the heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis This medication is generally prescribed as second line treatment for those with relapsing-remitting . It was also approved for secondary-progressive . It is given in two treatment courses, spread over a two-week period, over the course of two years. Side effects include upper respiratory infections, headaches, tumors, serious infections and reduced levels of white blood cells. People who have active chronic infections or cancer should not take this drug, nor should women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Men and women should use contraception when taking this medication and for the following six months. You may need monitoring with blood tests while taking cladribine. This humanized monoclonal antibody medication is the only approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary-progressive forms of . Clinical trials showed that it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrelizumab is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Infusion-related side effects may include irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, a fever and nausea, among others. Some people may not be able to take ocrelizumab, including those with a hepatitis B infection. Ocrelizumab may also increase the risk of infections and some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a potentially serious viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in people who are positive for antibodies to the causative agent of JC virus. People who don't have the antibodies have extremely low risk of . This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells. But it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders, including a high risk of thyroid autoimmune diseases and rare immune mediated kidney disease. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. Alemtuzumab is usually recommended for those with aggressive or as second line treatment for patients who failed another medication. Physical therapy can build muscle strength and ease some of the symptoms of . A physical or occupational therapist can teach you stretching and strengthening exercises and show you how to use devices to make it easier to perform daily tasks. Physical therapy along with the use of a mobility aid when necessary can also help manage leg weakness and other gait problems often associated with . You may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in your legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal, Gablofen), tizanidine (Zanaflex) and cyclobenzaprine may help. Onabotulinumtoxin A treatment is another option in those with spasticity. Amantadine (Gocovri, Osmolex), modafinil (Provigil) and methylphenidate (Ritalin) may be helpful in reducing -related fatigue. Some drugs used to treat depression, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be recommended. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) may help to slightly increase walking speed in some people. People with a history of seizures or kidney dysfunction should not take this medication. Medications also may be prescribed for depression, pain, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, and bladder or bowel control problems that are associated with . Estriol as a potential treatment option for multiple sclerosis (MS) Long-term safety of natalizumab for treating multiple sclerosis testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease. To help relieve the signs and symptoms of , try to: Look at your sleep habits to make sure you're getting the best possible sleep. To make sure you're getting enough sleep, you may need to be evaluated — and possibly treated — for sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea. If you have mild to moderate , regular exercise can help improve your strength, muscle tone, balance and coordination. Swimming or other water exercises are good options if you're bothered by heat. Other types of mild to moderate exercise recommended for people with include walking, stretching, low-impact aerobics, stationary bicycling, yoga and tai chi. symptoms often worsen when the body temperature rises in some people with . Avoiding exposure to heat and using devices such as cooling scarves or vests can be helpful. Since there's little evidence to support a particular diet, experts recommend a generally healthy diet. Some research suggests that vitamin D may have potential benefit for people with . Stress may trigger or worsen your signs and symptoms. Yoga, tai chi, massage, meditation or deep breathing may help. Mindfulness practice: Can it reduce symptoms of MS? Vitamins for MS: Do supplements make a difference? Many people with use a variety of alternative or complementary treatments or both to help manage their symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle pain. Activities such as exercise, meditation, yoga, massage, eating a healthier diet, acupuncture and relaxation techniques may help boost overall mental and physical well-being, but there are few studies to back up their use in managing symptoms of . According to guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology, research strongly indicates that oral cannabis extract (OCE) may improve symptoms of muscle spasticity and pain. There is a lack of evidence that cannabis in any other form is effective in managing other symptoms. Daily intake of vitamin D3 of 2,000-5,000 international units daily is recommended in those with . The connection between vitamin D and is supported by the association with exposure to sunlight and the risk of . Living with any chronic illness can be difficult. To manage the stress of living with , consider these suggestions: Continue to pursue hobbies that you enjoy and are able to do. Contact a support group, for yourself or for family members. Discuss your feelings and concerns about living with with your doctor or a counselor. You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system (neurologist). including any that may seem unrelated to the reason why you scheduled the appointment. vitamins and supplements. scans, laboratory test results or other information from your primary care provider to your neurologist. including other conditions. including any recent changes or stressors in your life. to help you remember what the doctor says. Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over points you want to spend more time on. You may be asked: What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms? What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms? Does anyone in your family have multiple sclerosis? What kinds of tests do I need? Do they require any special preparation? I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together? In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment. What is multiple sclerosis?

90ab04d6-38c2-4ce7-8136-95fedc5229e8,"This is an example of a student written essay. written by our professional writers. This essay may contain factual inaccuracies or out of date material. Please refer to an authoritative source if you require up-to-date information on any health or medical issue. 1849 words (7 pages) Essay 21st Sep 2017   Bob is 65 and has had multiple sclerosis for 15 years. He has a wheelchair and drives a specially adapted car. He lives with his wife, Jean, in a cottage in the country and they have always been involved in several community and church activates. Jean is Bob’s main carer and although Bob is quite independent, Jean tends to do everything for him. Last month Jean had a slight stroke which left her with a right sided weakness and some speech difficulties that she finds frustrating. She cannot walk without a walking frame and still needs help with most personal care tasks. While Jean’s been in hospital Bob has been supported by daily visits from home carers, however he is missing his outings as Jean’s not been there to help him. Jean will be discharged from hospital next week and is worried about how they will manage. Suri is the hospital social worker and is going to meet jean later today to plan her discharge from hospital next week and her future care. Describe at least one individual using car services and explain at least two needs of this individual. Jean used to be an independent woman but after she had her stroke she has become more vulnerable and can’t do all the daily tasks that she used to do like looking after Bob. Jeans basic essential physical needs are not being met completely. The stroke has caused her right-hand side of the body to become weaker and she also struggles to walk unsupported. Jean may have to be referred to a physiotherapist who would assess her abilities and draw up a treatment plan that will help Jean improve her muscle strength and help her to walk without the frame. An occupational therapist might also have to be introduced to assess her ability to carry out everyday tasks and may have to adapt her home to suit Jean’s ability. Jean might struggle to keep a balanced diet up as she might find it hard to swallow some foods and may not be able to get access to pureed or easy to swallow food. The stroke could also be causing Jean to be extremely tired. She also might struggle to clean and dress herself and let her good hygiene go down. Cognitive needs refer to the things that helps us to develop and maintain an active mind. Jean’s stroke has cause her to have speech problems and will find it hard to communicate. She could be referred to a speech and language therapist who could do some exercises to improve the control over Jeans speech muscles. They could introduce her to some letter charts and using gestures and writing to communicate with others. Jeans memory will deteriorate as the stroke will have affected her brain. A care worker could introduce a diary or even just routines and involve her in the planning of this to help her out with daily tasks when she is discharged from hospital. Jean may also end up with dementia and if she does you could show her some family pictures or even find out what activities she used to do and encourage her to try some of them again or take her to some of her favourite places her and Bob used to go to. Without cognitive spurring, mental abilities will not develop or will deteriorate. Most of these functions will return after time and rehabilitation, but she will notice they do not return to what they used to be. Explain how two methods of assessment are used to identify needs of individuals. Needs are essential things in our life’s that we cannot live without. Needs can often be confused with wants. One way of assessing an individual’s needs is using the SPECCS model. This is your social, physical, emotional, cognitive and cultural. All individuals have these types of needs. Social needs ae the need to have conversations and experience a variety of social relationships and how we interact with others. However, people who use care services may not be able to make these needs by their self’s. if they don’t get any help they might not achieve a sense of acceptance and belonging and this may cause isolation and low self – esteem. Physical needs refer to fresh air, food, water, warmth, shelter, hygiene, sleep and exercise. These are the basic physical needs that we need in our lives to promote wellbeing. Emotional needs are our feelings. We all experience different emotions including happiness, excitement, sadness and anxiety. Emotional needs include the need for love, security and confidence. If we have these needs, we can express our feelings and people can also recognise them. Cognitive needs refer to our thought processes and how we make sense of the world. Cognitive abilities include the use of memory, thinking, understanding, communicating and making choices and decisions. Without these our mental abilities, will deteriorate. Care workers can play an important part in meeting an individual’s cognitive needs by just even talking to them and giving opinions. The last one is cultural needs. This refers to values, beliefs language, gender, sexuality, clothing worn, and food eaten. It is important for the care worker to find out about the care users cultural needs and not make any assumptions about their culture. Another way of assessing an individual’s needs is using Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. This theory is split into 5 sections. The stages in this theory are Biological and physiological needs, safety needs, belongings and love needs, esteem needs and self-actualisation.Â  Maslow believes that all humans are motivated towards achieving their full potential. He stated, “People are motivated to achieve certain needs and that some needs take precedence over others. Our most basic need is for physical survival, and this will be the first thing that motivates our behaviour. Frustrated and unmet needs can lead to dysfunctional behaviour. Describe three features of positive care practice. At least one of these ways must include reference to values and principles. There are six principles to the National Care Standards, dignity, privacy, choice, safety, realising, potential and equality and diversity. Carers should value the service users and respect their space and own way of life. The service user also has the right to stop other people from seeing or knowing about their personal information. Choices help staff understand what range of options can be put in place for the user. Carers should be encouraging and help care service users to make the most of their life and achieving as much as they can with the resources available to them. In a positive care practice empowerment, should be used. All carers should help the service users to make their own choices and have some sort of control over their own lives. The carers could provide them with opportunities, information and support to help them do this. The SSSC have a code of practice to help gain a positive care practice. The code is set out in two parts. The first part if for the employers of social service workers. Employer must make sure the social service workers are suitable for the job and help them understand their responsibilities and roles they will have. They also must have written policies in place to protect those who use the services and the carers. The employer must also promote the use of the code of practice to the social service workers. The second part is for the social service worker. They must protect and promote the rights and interests of the service users and treat them all as an individual. The worker must create trust and build confidence with the service users to allow them and you to be open and honest with each other. Promote the service users independence and help them understand their rights. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) have created a code of conduct to create a positive care practice. The nurse or midwife should be kind and respectful and putting the care and the safety of the patients first. They should also listen and take any notes that may concern them and also respect their right to their dignity, privacy and choice and will share any information about the patient’s treatment or health in a way that they should be able to understand. They should always be paying attention to the patient’s wellbeing as well as their treatment and care. Describe how one care service creates a positive care environment. Give at least one example to explain how they meet the needs of individuals. Speirs Care Home, Beith creates a positive care environment by allowing the care service users to socialise in their lounge areas and provide spacious gardens for the users to relax in beautiful surroundings. They provide regular music entertainment for the users to allow them to have some sort of social life. They have a positive atmosphere in the care home and allow the community to be involved in their fair. They allow different types of care such as palliative care, respite care and convalescent care. The home also provide any transport the users need for going out and doctor appointments or even going out on day trips. They encourage the relatives to visit regularly to allow the users with alzheimer’s to familiarise their memory and hopefully try and help them not forget. Describe one way in which legislation helps promote a positive care environment. Care workers must comply with the legislation when they are carrying out work in a care environment to create a positive care environment. The legislation becomes a policy in the work place so, if the care workers fail to do this it could jeopardise their carer as legal action will be taken. The legislation is in place for the health and safety and their right to confidentiality as a care service user. Is also promotes health and wellbeing and equality of opportunity to promote a positive care practice. http://www.carehome.co.uk/carehome.cfm/searchazref/20006048SPIA http://hub.careinspectorate.com/knowledge/national-care-standards/ http://www.sssc.uk.com/about-the-sssc/codes-of-practice/what-are-the-codes-of-practice     To export a reference to this article please select a referencing stye below: If you are the original writer of this essay and no longer wish to have your work published on UKEssays.com then please: Our academic writing and marking services with our range of university lectures!

58e33a8c-2a92-4b15-9839-0766d8eb29d4,"Regional variation in the incidence rate and sex ratio of multiple sclerosis in Scotland 2010–2017: findings from the Scottish Multiple Sclerosis Register Regional variation in the incidence rate and sex ratio of multiple sclerosis in Scotland 2010–2017: findings from the Scottish Multiple Sclerosis Register   , , –() Fifteen regional studies published over the last six decades surveying prevalence, mortality and hospital admissions have suggested that Scotland is amongst the highest risk nations for multiple sclerosis (MS) in the world. However, substantial intranational variation in rates (between regions) has been described in numerous countries, including in the only previous Scottish national survey, which used hospital admission data, to address this issue. Against this backdrop, the Scottish Multiple Sclerosis Register (SMSR) was established in 2010 to prospectively collect nationally comprehensive incidence data and to allow for regional comparisons. Here, we present the SMSR and analyse the variation in crude and age–sex standardized incidence rates, lifetime risk (cumulative incidence), and the sex distribution of cases and rates, between the 14 administrative Health Boards or regions of Scotland: 01 January 2010 to 31 December 2017. The overall incidence rate for Scotland was 8.76/100,000 person-years (standardized: 8.54). Regional incidence rates varied significantly—up to threefold—between Health Boards ( < 1 × 10). The national female-to-male sex ratio was 2.3:1, but this too varied regionally (outlier regions result in a range from 1.0 to 4.2:1). Lifetime risk ranged from 19.9/1000 for females in Orkney (58.98°N) to 1.6/1000 for males in the Borders (55.60°N). Comparison with a previous national survey suggests that these differences are longstanding. In 6 of 14 regions the lifetime risk for women exceeds 1%. This study introduces a national incidence register: a valuable research tool and the result of substantial public investment. The wide variation in incidence rates and sex ratios between regions, in a relatively homogenous population, raises questions for future study. Broad consensus exists for genetic susceptibility interacting with potent environmental risk factors in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) [,,]. Nevertheless, a detailed account of the causal chain remains elusive. One aspect of MS epidemiology that remains unexplained is the well recognized within-country regional variation in MS rates [,,,]. In many countries, differences in regional rates have been wide (up to tenfold) and persistent in the same regions across period cohorts, i.e. relative differences in regional rates persist despite different generations of patients being diagnosed by different generations of neurologists []. There may be an opportunity to identify novel contributors to aetiology by studying these variations, because the list of possible causes (genetic or environmental) is more limited between relatively similar sub-national regional populations than between disparate international ones. Addressing this, however, will require high quality and geographically precise epidemiological datasets that can guide targeted genetic, seroepidemiological, and biome research. Scotland represents a powerful environment to study MS due its very high incidence of the disease. This is reflected in a strong history of Scottish MS epidemiological study over several decades. Fifteen surveys have been published since the first by Sutherland in 1956 [], which have consistently shown a pattern of increasing prevalence and high rates by international standards [, ]. In addition, there are technical advantages particularly for making between-region comparisons in Scotland. These include a stable and homogeneous population of 5.3M, a unitary and free health-care provider system (NHS) and e-health infrastructural strengths such as a nationwide patient identifier (CHI) assigned at birth. The CHI enables lifelong tracking for all contact with public services including vaccinations, hospital admissions, prescriptions, etc., and consequently the creation and alignment of detailed datasets of social and health care interactions. However, only one study has attempted to document within-Scotland variation in rates using a national sample covering a single period []. In 2010, recognizing MS as an important public health problem, the Scottish Government established the Scottish MS Register (SMSR), a prospective incidence register, mandating the recording of all newly diagnosed cases of MS. The primary purpose was to ensure that all persons diagnosed with MS were offered contact with an MS specialist nurse within ten working days of diagnosis and, secondarily, to routinely and systematically collect comprehensive data for epidemiological research []. Our aims in this paper are twofold: first to present the SMSR to highlight its potential as a research tool, and second to analyse the first 8 years of incidence data captured therein to study the regional variability in MS rates between the 14 “Health Board” regions of Scotland. The SMSR aims for comprehensive ascertainment by coupling routine data collection with a continuous audit of service quality. The ten working day requirement is an “essential criteria” of a national standard [Standard 15.2 of the Clinical Standards for Neurology Services (2009)] which requires Health Boards to meet this target []. MS specialist nurses are obliged to report data on this outcome accurately and promptly after diagnosis which is then confirmed by the treating neurologist. Completeness and accuracy are continuously monitored by Information Services Division (ISD) of National Health Service (NHS) National Services Scotland (NSS). Individual level SMSR data, including age, date and address at the time of diagnosis, were extracted in an anonymized form. Census data, publically available for Health Board populations, were used for the denominators for all calculations based on the Scottish national census 2011 () []. Adults (legally persons ≥ 16 years old), newly diagnosed with MS in Scotland after 01/01/2010, as defined by the Revised McDonald Criteria 2005 [], are routinely recorded on the SMSR. We included all those persons with MS (pwMS) on the register diagnosed up to 31 December 2017. Persons with possible MS or clinically isolated syndrome are excluded (). Scotland has a universal health care system, publically owned and operated, free at the point of use (NHS). The great majority of health care in Scotland is delivered by the NHS. Private neurologists typically also work in the NHS (and refer to MS services via specialist nurses) and probably all pwMS in Scotland, who have been diagnosed, use some NHS services. NHS Scotland is separated into 14 territorial Health Boards which were the aggregate unit of geography used in this study. Health Board latitude was defined as the latitude of the administrative centre. Formal research ethics approval was not required as audit data were de-identified, but peer-review by the SMSR steering committee and independent internal (ISD) review by an NHS employed consultant of public health ensured the project was in line with the aims and objectives of the SMSR and consistent with usual public health practice for the use of routinely collected data obtained without explicit consent. To allow for external comparisons unconfounded by population age–sex structure, direct-standardization of incidence rates was performed to the 2013 European Standard Population (ESP) (). Indirect standardization of regional rates was conducted using national rates as the referent for between-health-board comparisons. Maps were created using QGIS v2.18.23 using publicly available shapefiles (data.gov.uk). The cartogram was created using GeoDa v1.12. Lifetime (risk) cumulative incidence rates (CIR) were calculated for each region as: $${\text{CIR}} = 1 - {\text{exp}}\left[ { - \mathop \sum \limits_{{i = 1}}^{n} ({\text{ID}}_{i} )w_{i} } \right],$$ where  = age stratum, ID = incidence density for the th age stratum, and  = the width in years of the th age stratum. This measure has the advantage of incorporating (in ID strata) the population size of the strata and so is comparable across populations of different age-structures. CIRs are the proportion of population affected over a given period, here calculated to reflect lifetime risk and are presented per 1000 persons. Statistical significance was defined using an of 0.05 throughout. Omnibus test of statistical significance of variation in rates by region was tested using a 14-sample Chi-squared test. Associations were inspected visually and where appropriate linear relationships were analysed using ordinary and weighted least squares regression models. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were generated for bivariate analyses. Simulated rates under a null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness were calculated by randomly allocating each of  = 3680 cases to Health Boards proportional to population size 100,000 times in order to create empirical distributions under the null. values for observed rates occurring under the null were calculated by comparing observed rates to the empirically derived null distributions and correcting for  = 14 independent tests using the Bonferroni method (/). Statistical analyses, simulations and tests were conducted using R and R Studio (v. 3.5.1). The dataset used here is available subject to approval of the SMSR steering committee and NHS NSS ISD. 3680/3716 (99.0%) cases were included in the regional analyses with 36 persons excluded due to incomplete address data (Fig. ). The resident populations within Health Boards are presented in Table , showing regional variation in population number and density. The majority of Scotland’s population lives in the “central belt” which includes the two largest cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. 98% of the Scottish population lives on the mainland and there are some 790 islands, 94 permanently inhabited which are broadly separated into four main island groups: The Outer Hebrides (which make up the Western Isles Health Board), The Inner Hebrides (which are grouped in the Highland Health Board), Orkney and Shetland. The incidence we refer to throughout this study is the incidence of diagnosis rather than the incidence of disease onset. The crude MS incidence rate for the Scottish population as a whole was 8.76/10 person-years (pys) (directly standardized to ESP, 8.54/10pys). The national crude incidence rate for females was 11.70/10 pys and for males 5.48/10 pys. The ratio of female case count to male was 2.27 (2.14 for adjusted rate ratio). The age range of subjects at the time of diagnosis was 65.8 years with mean age of 41.34 (SD 12.03) years and median of 40 years. Age-specific incidence rates (Fig. ) were used to calculate indirectly age-standardized incidence rates (supplementary Table 1). Crude and indirectly age-standardized rates by Health Board, over the study period, are presented in Table and Fig. , demonstrating significant variation in the incidence rate by region (, two-sided  < 1 × 10). Orkney was the highest incidence region in Scotland and there was good agreement between crude and standardized rates indicating that differences in population age-structure were not large contributors to apparent differences in rates. Lanarkshire (6.34), the Borders (6.66), Lothian (6.85) and Greater Glasgow and Clyde (7.21) formed a contiguous band of the lowest incidence regions, with adjusted rates approximately one-third that of Orkney (18.35) and one-half that of Shetland (11.01), Highland (12.07) and Tayside (12.81), the latter being the highest incidence region on the mainland. Our finding of differences in incidence rates by region agree with those previously estimated by Handel et al. [] using a different method for case ascertainment [hospital admissions—Scottish Morbidity Records 01 (SMR01)]. We replicate the threefold between-health-board variation described in that study ( = 0.85,  < 0.001), finding the same regions to be high and low incidence, despite the different patient cohort: 1997–2009 in Handel et al. [] and 2010–2017 in our study. We considered whether ascertainment discrepancies, arising from systematic differences in time from first symptoms to diagnosis, might have contributed to these results and we hypothesized that, if so, this might be reflected in differences in distribution of age at diagnosis (Fig. ). Whilst visual inspection did not suggest obvious systematic differences between groups, omnibus testing of the age distribution by region using Kruskal–Wallis test demonstrated a significant difference ( = 33.6,  = 0.002). However, this was not unexpected given the large number of cases and power to detect small deviations from uniformity, and in post hoc (Dunn’s) analyses only two (of 91) pairwise comparisons yielded a significant difference after correcting for multiple testing using the false discovery method: the median diagnosis in Glasgow occurred significantly earlier than in Forth Valley (+ 3.3 years,  = 0.02) and in Grampian (+ 3.7 years,  = 0.01) Health Boards. In addition to variation in incidence rates, we found variation in the sex ratio of cases between regions (Table ) albeit this was chiefly driven by two outlier regions in the Borders and Shetland: there was no significant difference across all regions . The (F:M) sex ratio was most equitable in Shetland 1.0 ( = 10:10, lat = 60.39°N) and most inequitable in the borders 4.18 ( = 46:11, lat = 55.58°N). Adjusting for differences in regional population age–sex structure accounted for little of this difference. A significant negative linear relationship of sex ratio on latitude was detected by ordinary least squares regression ( = − 1.30,  = 0.03)—i.e. relatively more females were affected at lower latitudes and the sex ratio was more equitable at higher latitudes. However, again the outliers drive this effect. No significant linear trend with latitude exists amongst the other Health Boards after excluding Shetland and the Borders ( = − 0.94,  = 0.56) and both areas have low numbers of cases. The effect is similarly not significant when accounting for population in weighted analyses ( = − 0.88,  = 0.09). We found that the lifetime risk of MS in Scotland is 6.55 per 1000 persons for the country as a whole and, whilst the sex ratio varies regionally, in each region the lifetime risk for females is higher than for males. However, the degree of variation in incidence is such that the lifetime risk for males in Shetland (8.63), Orkney (7.94) and Tayside (6.89) is higher than for females in some other areas (for example, Lanarkshire (6.60), Lothian (6.98), and Greater Glasgow and Clyde (7.56)). Table presents the calculated male, female and combined lifetime risk (CIR) by Health Board. This work provides the first report of standardized regional incidence rates for MS in Scotland based on the recently established SMSR which is the result of substantial far-sighted public investment. The high level of completeness of these data (99% for age, sex and address at diagnosis) is a result of mandatory reporting, the CHI system which incorporates sex and date of birth, and the importance of current address for the functioning of normal service within the NHS. This study builds on a strong track record of several decades of MS epidemiological surveys in Scotland and utilizes the SMSR for its particular advantages for aetiological investigation: chiefly, that the register is truly national, is aiming for complete ascertainment, and has a prospective, incidence design. Until the recent emergence of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), prevalence, mortality, hospital admission and even disability pensioning rates were comparable across regions relatively unaffected by differences in medical services available. However, an improved therapeutic arsenal now potentially confounds comparisons of these rates as regional discrepancies in care provision or practice may now also affect disability, admissions and survival. A strength, therefore, is that the SMSR captures incidence data, which is inherently more biologically meaningful than other rates—especially in the era of DMTs. The national crude incidence rate of 8.71/10 pys confirms Scotland as a high-incidence nation, although not the highest reported internationally. The standardized incidence we report (8.54) is lower than recent studies from other high-income countries. For example, in Denmark at 9.43 (95% CI 9.17–9.69) [] and Wales at 9.10 (95% CI 8.80–9.40) [] per 10 pys. However, given the incidence register excludes possible MS and all cases are confirmed as definite by the diagnosing neurologist, it is likely that the rates we present reflect a lower bound on the estimate of the full burden of the condition in Scotland. Further, newly recognized clinical entities (such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders), which in previous generations may have been included for calculation of MS rates, will now not be included. Caution may be merited in comparing these rates to those obtained in other settings by different methods. Our data support the assessment of the Scottish Public Health Observatory, that the SMSR is now the gold standard estimates of incidence in Scotland []. Given substantial regional variation, previous published estimates extrapolating prevalence from samples taken from single regions and/or using other methods may have erroneously estimated the burden of the disease in Scotland. Choice of index region and method of ascertainment are important potential sources for bias. A previous estimate, for example, of 10,000 prevalent cases would only be plausible if our figures represented an epidemic since 2010 and we suspect this to be a large underestimate []. Another estimate of 13,328 pwMS in 2010 derived from GP data supported by hospital episode data [] appears more plausible. However, by roughly extrapolating prevalence from these incidence data, using life-expectancy and estimates of effects of MS diagnosis on early mortality [], we suspect that this may also fall short. A recent study, using administrative data in the USA, has suggested that the prevalence of MS there may be as high as double that previously reported []. Similarly, we suspect that the burden of MS in Scotland may have been underestimated. Our finding of differences in incidence rates by region agree with those estimated by Handel et al. [] using different methods (hospital admissions) and our simulations demonstrate these differences are unlikely to have arisen due to chance (Table and supplementary Fig. 1). This correlation between studies across distinct periods is externally consistent with reports of regional variability persisting across generations in other countries (where intergenerational correlation has been reported as  ~ 0.8) []. The consistency across two methods—our study corroborating their findings of threefold variation ( = 0.85,  < 0.001), finding the same regions to be high and low incidence, whilst using a more robust dataset, and in a different patient cohort—leads us to conclude that regional variation in Scotland is real, persistent and not explained by chance or bias. In fact, a limitation of our methods is that address at the time of diagnosis is presumed to be an imperfect proxy for address at the time of onset and at the time of exposure to environmental risk factors []. Our study would thus be strengthened by data on pre-diagnosis location of residence. We would expect the imperfect correlation between location of residence at diagnosis and exposure to have diluted regional variation and so, despite finding large variations, we may have underestimated the extent of this effect. The regional variation, even on the relatively ancestrally homogenous mainland, we find to be surprisingly large. Regional differences in CIR, which can be interpreted as a hypothetical lifetime risk, range substantially, from 19.9/1000 for females in Orkney (55.98°N) to 1.7/1000 for males in the Borders (55.60°N) (Table ). And in 6 of 14 Scottish Health Boards the lifetime risk for women exceeds 1%. However, surprisingly, variation in incidence and sex ratio is of the degree that in some Health Boards of Scotland the lifetime risk for men exceeds the lifetime risk for women in other regions, despite an overall sex ratio of 2.3 (at the expense of women). The variation in sex ratio between regions may be the result of chance. The negative correlation between sex ratio and latitude (greater proportion of females at low latitudes) in our unweighted analyses is in line with international trends []. However, the Borders and Shetland are outlier regions. No convincing linear relationship between sex ratio and latitude exists outwith these areas or on weighted analyses. However, the sex ratio of MS has been reported to have changed over decades, for example, in Canada [] and Denmark [], implicating changes in an environmental risk factor(s) for which males and females have differential sensitivity or exposures. Therefore, analysis of the regional sex ratio of future cases may be informative in demonstrating that these outliers arose due to chance, as we cannot yet exclude the possibility that they are the product of some local environmental factor. Latitude predicts only a small proportion of the total variability in Scotland, but does remain significant even after controlling for population age–sex structure. This is perhaps in contrast to other Western European countries where it has been suggested that latitude’s association with incidence has diminished over time or was artefactually overestimated due to ascertainment issues or failure to standardize populations []. However, as northern populations in Scotland are typically more rural and have more outdoor work, it has been questioned—with empirical support—as to whether vitamin D levels robustly correlate with latitude in Scotland []. In addition, the lower incidence in Shetland, by far the most northerly point in Scotland, compared to Orkney and Tayside, raises further questions []. The remoteness of Shetland, with its distinct ancestry and—to an extent—culture, could explain the deviation from the general trend. However, this phenomenon, of a reversal of the latitude effect at extreme high latitudes, is actually consistent with international reports. For example, the same reversal has been noted in Scandinavia and Russia []. Nevertheless, even if some other factor explains the proportion of variation associated with latitude in the rest of Scotland, it is our opinion that this would not be any evidence against the importance of hypovitaminosis D in general, given international trends and multiple lines of evidence []. Hypovitaminosis D is widely prevalent in Scotland and may significantly contribute to the burden of MS []. This study uses routinely collected data with attendant methodological limitations. For example, it is not possible to exclude some regional variation in case ascertainment, although overall ascertainment is thought to be high suggesting that any such variation is probably small. Also, whilst the mean age at diagnosis (41.34 years) was somewhat higher in our study than in a clinically validated cohort from the UK MS register that does not include pwMS in Scotland (37.4 years) [], the similar patterns of age at diagnosis across Health Boards is an argument against there being systematic differences in diagnostic efficiency by region in Scotland. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include: differences in proportions of patients by type of MS at onset in these two cohorts, an ageing population, truncation of the SMSR at young ages due to exclusion of cases with paediatric onset (age < 16 years old), and/or delays in diagnosis due to waiting times to see a neurologist. For example, it may be that younger median age at diagnosis in Glasgow, the only region where post hoc testing identified a significant difference (relative to two other areas), could, in part, reflect access to tertiary neurological care or waiting times to see neurologists. However, local differences in services and diagnostic preferences (e.g. propensity to request a lumbar puncture prior to diagnosis), and/or net rural-to-urban migration skewing the population-at-risk, will also be contributory factors, in addition to chance variation. This paper presents the first 8 years of the SMSR, a prospective national incidence register. We confirm the high incidence of MS in Scotland, suggest that previous estimates of prevalence are likely underestimates, and corroborate previous reports of threefold variation by Health Board region suggesting these differences are both persistent and real. This has implications for service provision and supports further study to better understand the basis of regional variability. It raises the possibility that biologically important risk factors may be variably distributed in Scotland, at least regionally, and future work is now possible to determine if variation exists at a more local scale.

Rocca, Paola Valsasina, , Lucia Moiola, Angelo Ghezzi, Pierangelo Veggiotti, Maria P. Amato, Mark A. Horsfield, Andrea Falini, Giancarlo Comi, Massimo Filippi Active motor functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have a strictly lateralized pattern of activations and a preserved functional connectivity (FC) within the motor system when compared to age-matched healthy controls. However, it is still not clear whether a preserved FC in pediatric MS is present only in the motor system, or involves other relevant functional system. Resting-state (RS) fMRI is a valuable tool for an unbiased investigation of FC abnormalities of multiple networks. This study explored abnormalities of RS FC within and between large-scale neuronal networks from 44 pediatric MS patients and 27 controls and their correlation with clinical, neuropsychological, and conventional MRI measures. Compared to controls, pediatric MS patients had a decreased FC of several regions of the sensorimotor, secondary visual, default-mode (DMN), executive control, and bilateral working memory (WMN) networks. They also experienced an increased FC in the right medial frontal gyrus of the attention network, which was correlated with T2 lesion volume. Cognitively impaired patients had decreased RS FC of the right precuneus of the left WMN. An increased FC between the sensorimotor network and the DMN, and between the L WMN and the attention network as well as a decreased FC between L WMN and the DMN were also found. A distributed pattern of FC abnormalities within large-scale neuronal networks occurs in pediatric MS patients, contributes to their cognitive status, and is partially driven by focal white matter lesions.

An increased FC between the sensorimotor network and the DMN, and between the L WMN and the attention network as well as a decreased FC between L WMN and the DMN were also found. A distributed pattern of FC abnormalities within large-scale neuronal networks occurs in pediatric MS patients, contributes to their cognitive status, and is partially driven by focal white matter lesions. Internetwork connectivity is relatively preserved in these patients. AB - Active motor functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have a strictly lateralized pattern of activations and a preserved functional connectivity (FC) within the motor system when compared to age-matched healthy controls. However, it is still not clear whether a preserved FC in pediatric MS is present only in the motor system, or involves other relevant functional system. Resting-state (RS) fMRI is a valuable tool for an unbiased investigation of FC abnormalities of multiple networks. This study explored abnormalities of RS FC within and between large-scale neuronal networks from 44 pediatric MS patients and 27 controls and their correlation with clinical, neuropsychological, and conventional MRI measures. Compared to controls, pediatric MS patients had a decreased FC of several regions of the sensorimotor, secondary visual, default-mode (DMN), executive control, and bilateral working memory (WMN) networks. They also experienced an increased FC in the right medial frontal gyrus of the attention network, which was correlated with T2 lesion volume. Cognitively impaired patients had decreased RS FC of the right precuneus of the left WMN. An increased FC between the sensorimotor network and the DMN, and between the L WMN and the attention network as well as a decreased FC between L WMN and the DMN were also found. A distributed pattern of FC abnormalities within large-scale neuronal networks occurs in pediatric MS patients, contributes to their cognitive status, and is partially driven by focal white matter lesions. Internetwork connectivity is relatively preserved in these patients.

8ae5757c-45d8-4f3f-a080-d480d9d358ad,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies This edition of MSAA’s “What’s New in MS Research” provides highlights from this year’s European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. Experts from throughout the world gathered in Stockholm, Sweden in mid-September to share and discuss the latest research into the causes, diagnosis, course, and treatment of multiple sclerosis. Those investigators and clinicians were gathered for the 35th annual Congress of ECTRIMS, a key forum for presenting the findings that help advance evidence-based management of MS. This article focuses on more than a dozen studies with significance for people living with MS. The studies featured obviously constitute a very small sampling of the research unveiled in Stockholm. However, they provide a good sense of the depth, breadth, and innovation that mark the current state of research into multiple sclerosis. Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies Ofatumumab: Favorable Phase III results set stage for seeking FDA approval Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that people with relapsing-remitting MS could inject at home once a month. This experimental medication demonstrated positive Phase III study results, which were announced at the ECTRIMS 2019 meeting. Based on those results, the pharmaceutical company Novartis said it will file paperwork with the FDA by the end of this year seeking approval for use of ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS. The medication is already approved for the treatment of certain forms of leukemia under the brand name Arzerra. Two identically designed Phase III trials, ASCLEPIOS I and ASCEPLIOS II, compared ofatumumab to Aubagio (teriflunomide). More than 1,800 patients from 37 countries were enrolled in the trials. Those people were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either 20 mg of ofatumumab injected subcutaneously every four weeks, or daily, oral doses of 14 mg of Aubagio, for up to 30 months. The primary endpoint of both trials was impact on the annualized relapse rate, or ARR. In both studies, the ARR for patients receiving ofatumumab was less than half that of those receiving Aubagio. Ofatumumab also demonstrated greater suppression of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions on MRI – an indication of inflammatory activity – compared with Aubagio, and reduced the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression by roughly one-third relative to Aubagio. Meanwhile, safety data in the trial were comparable with that seen in earlier studies of the agent. Mayzent and delay in time to disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Mayzent (siponimod) helps patients with secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) delay the time until they need to use a wheelchair, according to a team of international researchers. In March 2019, the FDA approved Mayzent as the first oral drug to treat SPMS with active disease. The FDA’s approval was based on results of the Phase III EXPAND trial. Researchers drew on data from that trial to assess the impact that Mayzent had on people reaching an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 7.0, which reflects an inability to walk beyond a few steps and the need for wheelchair use. Analysis of data on more than 1,100 study participants found that, compared to placebo, Mayzent lengthened the median time to reaching an EDSS score of 7 or greater by 4.3 years (12.0 years for placebo vs 16.3 years for Mayzent). The reduction in risk of need for a wheelchair was greatest in people with more significant disability. In more than 400 study participants with an EDSS score of 6.5 at the study’s start, Mayzent cut the risk of needing a wheelchair by 28% to 36%, depending on the type of analysis employed. Impact of extending Tysabri dosing interval on relapse rates Tysabri (natalizumab) has demonstrated its efficacy in treating relapsing-remitting MS, but the standard dosing schedule of a 300-mg infusion every four weeks is associated with increased risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious and potentially life-threatening disease. In an effort to continue providing people with MS with the benefits of Tysabri while reducing their risk for PML, researchers have explored whether extending the period between infusions can preserve the disease-modifying effects of the drug while diminishing the chances of developing PML. With earlier research showing that extended interval dosing (EID) lowers the risk of PML compared to standard interval dosing (SID), a large, long-term observational study presented at ECTRIMS 2019 examined the differences in effectiveness when extending the time between treatments. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to compare 135 pairs of patients. One patient in each pair had received Tysabri on the standard-interval schedule, while the other had extended-interval dosing. The researchers found no significant difference in annualized relapse rate (ARR) or risk of relapse between the two groups. They added that a randomized, prospective study comparing the two treatment approaches is needed to provide more-definitive evidence. What’s the risk of “rebound” disease activity after stopping Gilenya? People with MS may decide to stop a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for any number of reasons, ranging from side effects or a perceived lack of effectiveness to a desire to switch to another agent or to be “treatment-free” for a period of time. The importance of consulting with a clinician before stopping treatment is underscored by the risk for rebound disease activity, or RDA, which can occur once a medication that is taken to control MS is discontinued. Investigators recently examined the records of 117 patients to determine the risk for RDA after stopping Gilenya, and to see if any factors made people more prone to experiencing “rebound.” The group included 86 women and 31 men. Nine of the 117 patients, or 7.7%, had RDA after stopping Gilenya, with the rebound activity marked by severe clinical relapses with exaggerated MRI lesions compared to their level of disease activity before starting the DMT. Compared to patients who did not experience RDA upon stopping treatment, those who did have rebound activity had a higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) before initiating Gilenya, and also had a shorter interval between their last relapse and their first dose of the medication. The duration of Gilenya treatment did not appear to affect the likelihood of rebound. The researchers added that eight of the nine people experiencing RDA had stopped treatment abruptly. In an observation that again reinforces the importance of working closely with a clinician when considering any change to treatment approach, the investigators concluded, “Our results indicate that [a] fingolimod every-other-day cessation strategy may help to prevent RDA.” Patients at the Cleveland Clinic’s Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis had lower rates of adverse events (AEs) with Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) than did patients in the Phase III clinical trials that led to the disease-modifying therapy’s approval in March 2017, according to Mellen Center researchers. In the Mellen Center cohort, 3.3% had a serious adverse event, while 21% had an infection – typically a urinary tract infection or upper respiratory infection – and 18% had an infusion-related reaction. By contrast, in the OPERA I and OPERA II trials of Ocrevus in RRMS, 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively, of patients receiving Ocrevus had a serious adverse event, 56.9% and 60.2% had an infection, and 30.9% and 37.6% had at least one infusion-related reaction. Similarly, in the ORATORIO trial of Ocrevus in PPMS, 20.4% of Ocrevus patients had a serious adverse event, and 39.9% had one or more infusion-related reactions. The Mellen Center researchers noted that the lower rates of adverse events that they recorded may have been due to differences in reporting. They also observed that patients at their institution had longer average disease duration and fewer enhancing lesions at baseline than clinical trial participants. The real-world findings are, nonetheless, welcome and reassuring. FDA approves Vumerity™, a fumarate medication designed to address GI tolerability Clinicians know that the medications that work best are those that patients take regularly. For this reason, the tolerability of an agent can be as important as its effectiveness. In a nod to this reality, Biogen and Alkermes developed Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) to provide the efficacy already demonstrated by Biogen’s disease-modifying therapy Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but with fewer of the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects reported with the latter medication. In late October, a few weeks after MS researchers returned from ECTRIMS 2019, the FDA announced that it had approved Vumerity for use in relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. In pursuing FDA approval for Vumerity, Biogen provided data from the EVOLVE-MS-1 study, an ongoing, Phase III, single-arm, open-label, two-year safety study enrolling patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Interim results from the study submitted to the FDA showed that 6.3% of patients had stopped Vumerity due to adverse events, with fewer than 1% stopping because of gastrointestinal events. In the clinical trials leading to approval of Tecfidera, 18% of patients reported abdominal pain, 14% reported diarrhea, 12% cited nausea, and 9% reported vomiting. A tilt toward monoclonal antibody therapy as first-line MS treatment Neurologists’ top choice of an initial multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment has shifted from interferon-based medications to monoclonal antibodies. That was the main finding of an analysis of data on more than 1,000 people with MS who began their first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in late 2018 or early 2019. In December 2018 and January 2019, investigators drew on records from 213 U.S. neurologists to examine those physicians’ prescribing of MS medications over the prior three months. They then compared that 2018-2019 information with comparable data on the first medications prescribed to more than 1,000 “treatment-naïve” patients (individuals who had never taken a DMT previously) in early 2018, and another 1,020 patients who received their first DMT in 2017. Researchers found that in late 2018-early 2019, 18% of treatment-naïve patients started a monoclonal antibody medication as their first DMT, compared with 8% in 2017. Conversely, the proportion of newly treated patients receiving an interferon-based medication declined from 26% in 2017 to 17% in 2019. The investigators noted that greater prescribing of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) drove much of the increase in monoclonal antibody use, and was accompanied by a quantitatively measured increase in neurologists’ comfort level with using Ocrevus for relapsing-remitting forms of MS. They added that the 2017 approval of a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate, or GA) also had significantly affected neurologists’ choice of a first-line DMT, with branded GA seeing its share of first-line prescriptions declining from 27% in 2017 to 18% in 2019, while generic GA went from accounting for 4% of first-line prescriptions in 2017 to 13% in 2019. Further evidence supporting early initiation of disease-modifying therapy Increasing age, duration of multiple sclerosis (MS), and greater disability detract from the effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies, according to an analysis of data on more than 14,000 patients. While those findings may seem intuitive, the researchers went further and quantified the extent to which medication therapy was diminished per year, per 1-point change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and other measures. The study drew on the MSBase Registry, examining data for 14,717 people who had been followed for at least one year. Seventy-two percent of the patients were female. The mean age at first visit was 36 years, and the patients had a mean duration of disease of 5.7 years and a median EDSS score of 2. Roughly three-quarters had clinically definite MS, while 20% had a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The researchers found that patients receiving treatment were 39% more likely to experience confirmed improvement of disability than their untreated counterparts. However, this effect of therapy declined with age (-2% per year), disease duration (-6% per year), and disability (-8% per EDSS step). In an observation that reinforces the value of early initiation of treatment, the investigators concluded, “Immunotherapies exert their maximum effect in young patients with shorter disease course, mild disability and a previous stability on treatment.” Tracking changes in use of DMTs as well as complementary and alternative interventions People with MS are drawing on both disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions in managing their health, according to a recent survey of more than 1,100 patients in Oregon and southwest Washington. Fielded from September 2018 to April 2019, the survey identified respondents’ use of both prescription medications for MS and interventions such as herbs and supplements, cannabis, dietary plans, and yoga. In addition to assessing current approaches to MS, researchers compared results from the 2018-2019 questionnaire with answers to a similar survey conducted in 2001. Those investigators found that the proportion of people taking a DMT at the time they were surveyed increased from 47% in 2001 to 69% now. Use of CAM at time of survey response also increased during that period, from 68% to 93%. Eighty-six percent of respondents to the 2018-2019 survey reported having employed exercise in managing their MS, with the proportion of people who have tried yoga increasing from 23% in 2001 to 46% in the recent survey. The proportion of people reporting having used meditation also increased, 16% to 39%. A majority of respondents to both surveys reported having used diet to manage their MS, with a slight increase from 59% in 2001 to 66% more recently. Low-carbohydrate and anti-inflammatory diets were the most commonly followed approaches in both surveys. Researchers noted that they will further analyze their data to explore differences in perceived benefit of DMTs between CAM users and nonusers. Three key take-aways emerge from this research. First, more people are doing more than ever before to take a pro-active approach to dealing with their MS. Second, many people have rejected the false dichotomy of either using only a prescription medication or rejecting such agents in favor of exclusive reliance on alternative approaches. Third, as use of alternative approaches grows, it is important for patients to talk openly with their clinicians about all interventions they are employing or considering, particularly given the potential for interaction between herbs and some supplements and prescription medications. Ninety-three percent of the 81 MS patients to undergo stem-cell transplantation at a Swedish center between 2004 and February 2019 remained progression free over an average follow-up period of 3.9 years, and none have died since undergoing the procedure. The investigators presenting that heartening news at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting added that 87% of the patients had not experienced a relapse since transplantation, and that the annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the entire group was 0.022. By comparison, the group’s mean ARR for the year prior to the procedure was 2.2. The patients consisted of 56 women and 25 men. Their median age was 29 years, and 95% had relapsing-remitting MS. Conversely, stem-cell transplantation did not reduce the number of active lesions seen on MRI after 24 weeks of treatment in a major international study, but did show promise in reducing the relapse rate, one of the investigation’s lead researchers told the press in discussing preliminary results presented at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting. The MESEMS trial (MEsenchymal StEm cells for Multiple Sclerosis) was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over phase II trial examining the impact of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Most of the 144 patients randomized for treatment had relapsing-remitting MS, while roughly 20% had secondary-progressive MS, and a little over 10% had primary-progressive MS. The study’s authors noted that the results presented at ECTRIMS were preliminary, and that further analysis is needed. Assessing the impact of plasma exchange when steroids don’t help with relapses Therapeutic plasma exchange – or plasmapheresis – is a technique clinicians sometimes employ when steroids aren’t helping to resolve an MS relapse. The process involves withdrawing whole blood from a vein, separating the plasma – or liquid portion of the blood – from the red and white blood cells, and then transfusing the red and white blood cells back into the patient, along with plasma replacement fluid. This “blood cleansing” approach is fairly uncommon, so Austrian and German researchers recently analyzed 14 years’ worth of data on 133 patients at their MS clinics to better understand its effectiveness. The investigators assessed clinical response to plasma exchange, with a marked clinical response defined as ≥1 step improvement in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and mild clinical improvement – which was characterized by improvement in neurological examination with change of EDSS <1 step. They also identified patients who had no improvement. Seventy-six percent of patients undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) saw improvement, with 36% having marked improvement and 40% experiencing mild improvement. In general, TPE was more effective in younger patients, those with a shorter duration of disease, and with a shorter interval between relapse and receiving TPE. By exploring how often and to what extent TPE helps patients who have not benefited sufficiently from steroids during relapses – and by identifying which patients are likely to have the best response to the treatment – the researchers have provided clinicians with valuable insights on a less commonly employed treatment option. A team of Canadian researchers showed in a small study that blood levels of a protein called serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) measured in the first five years after onset of symptoms can provide important insights on a patient’s likely course over the next 15 years. In analyzing data on 64 people with MS, they found that patients with a serum NfL level greater than 7.62 pg/mL had a nine-times greater risk of developing secondary-progressive MS over the following several years than people with lower blood levels of the protein. Similarly, when they divided patients into three groups, based on whether they had low, medium, or high NfL levels, they found that those with the highest level had more aggressive disease progression, with their Expanded Disability Stats Scale (EDSS) score increasing by 0.16 per year, reflecting greater impairment. Similarly, patients in the lowest NfL levels were 5.3-times less likely than others to reach an EDSS of 4.0 or greater. The researchers noted that their findings were consistent across the adult age range and in both men and women. They concluded that their study “demonstrates an association between early disease serum NfL and long term clinical outcomes over the longest follow-up to-date. Whether the course of such patients can be altered by earlier treatment will require further study.” In another study, a Spanish investigator has developed evidence indicating that the presence and prevalence of certain types of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can serve as predictive factors in assessing the long-term course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other molecules found in the gastrointestinal tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system, and in recent years has emerged as a focus of intense study in MS. Earlier research indicates that people with MS or at heightened risk for MS have imbalances in the mix of bacteria normally found in the GI tract of healthy people. The study reported at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting involved using molecular sequencing of stool samples to study the gut microbiota – or composition of bacterial species – of 16 people with RRMS and 15 healthy controls. The investigators then followed the people with MS over 24 months. They found that levels of family of bacteria, and particularly two types of bacteria within that family known as and were associated with an increased risk of relapses and new lesions appearing on MRI. While this was a small study whose findings need to be explored on a larger scale, it points to the many ways researchers are homing in on factors that help chart the likely course of disease – and that eventually will help patients and their clinicians formulate treatment plans accordingly. People with MS have elevated risk for other conditions even before their MS diagnosis Even before they are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, people with MS are more likely than others to have bladder problems, eye issues, and other conditions, according to a Swedish study involving more than 6,600 people with MS and almost 62,000 healthy controls. The people ultimately identified as having MS had a higher pre-diagnosis incidence of epilepsy (1.5% vs. 0.8%), autoimmune disease (1.3% vs 0.7%), bladder dysfunction (1.2% vs 0.2%), and retinal disorders (2.4% vs 1.2%) compared with controls. After MS diagnosis, the patients continued to have considerably higher rates of epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, and bladder dysfunction, as well as of toxic liver disease. The research team concluded, “Before a diagnosis of MS, patients already displayed an increased rate of comorbidity compared with MS-free controls. After diagnosis, patients with MS continued to display increased risk of several comorbidities, some of which may be explained by surveillance bias due to more frequent contact with healthcare.” Measuring the toll of MS on women’s physical, mental function Multiple sclerosis accelerates age-related physiologic decline in physical and mental function by 10-20 years in women with MS compared to their same-age counterparts. That is the unwelcome but important conclusion of researchers who drew on data from the large-scale Nurses Health Study and Nurses Health Study II and compared participants’ physical function and cognitive function scores with those of 582 women with confirmed MS. They found that women with MS who were ages 36 to 41 years had, on average, physical function comparable to that of unaffected women aged 58 to 62 years. Middle-aged women with MS were about three-times more likely than their age peers to report a slower walking pace and more than twice as likely to report almost daily urine leaks. At higher ages, women with MS were five-times more likely than unaffected peers to report problems with balance. Among women over age 75 years, women with MS were less likely to report good cognitive function than women without MS. The results, while not encouraging, are not entirely surprising either, and underscore the importance of pursuing overall good health through clinician-approved diet and exercise programs in order to optimize well-being. Recurrent demyelinating events in children: Identifying frequency and risk factors Two-thirds of children who have a first demyelinating event (FDE) will go on to have at least one more such event, with older age at FDE, presence of more than five lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and symptoms suggestive of a brainstem syndrome being among several risk factors for further events. Those were the key findings to emerge from an observational cohort study involving 75 children who had an FDE between 1999 and 2018. The children included 46 girls and 29 boys; their median age was 12 years. In 80% of cases, the FDE involved a single neurological symptom. Thirty-six had optic neuritis, while 15 had transverse myelitis, and 14 had symptoms indicative of a brainstem syndrome. Final diagnoses included multiple sclerosis (32 children), relapsing optic neuritis (7), and syndromes including polyphasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and neuromyelitis optica. Fifty-six percent of the children experienced a relapse within 60 months of their FDE, and the overall risk of relapse was calculated at 65%. A clinical presentation indicating a brainstem syndrome was associated with a 10-fold higher risk for a second demyelinating event compared with other clinical presentations, while being age 11 years or older at the time of the FDE more than doubled the risk of recurrence compared to younger children. MRI findings of periventricular, subcortical, brainstem, and lateral spinal lesions also were associated with increased risk. As investigators better understand the risks of – and risk factors for – recurrent demyelinating events in young people, clinicians can formulate their counseling approaches, diagnostic strategies, and treatment decisions accordingly to enhance care and help children and their families know what to anticipate.

Analyzing the urine of multiple sclerosis patients for JC virus could help identify those at risk of developing another rare demyelinating disease after natalizumab (Tysabri) treatment, according to a study in the Sept. 10 issue of the . JC virus in urine may help identify patients at risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy WEDNESDAY, Sept. 9 (HealthDay News) -- Analyzing the urine of multiple sclerosis patients for JC virus could help identify those at risk of developing another rare demyelinating disease after natalizumab (Tysabri) treatment, according to a study in the Sept. 10 issue of the . And two additional reports detail cases of this rare condition, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Yiping Chen, M.D., of Harvard Medical School in Boston, and colleagues followed 19 patients with multiple sclerosis who had been treated with natalizumab over 18 months. The researchers found that the JC virus shed in increasing amounts in urine six to 12 months after starting natalizumab treatment. After 18 months, JC virus was found in 20 percent of available plasma samples and 60 percent of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, although none of the patients developed PML. In one of two case reports, Werner Wenning, M.D., from Ortenau-Klinikum in Offenburg, Germany, and colleagues describe the case of a 52-year-old man with multiple sclerosis who developed JC virus-associated PML after 12 months of natalizumab therapy. Two months after the onset of neurologic and psychiatric symptoms, the patient was hospitalized and treated with plasma exchange and immunoadsorption to remove natalizumab from his system. He recovered after further steroid-pulse treatment. ""Underscoring the rare nature of PML, regardless of the underlying immune dysfunction with which it is associated, and identifying viral and host risk factors would not only aid us in better selecting patients for immunomodulatory therapies, but would also help to direct research into interventional therapies for PML itself,"" writes the author of an accompanying editorial.

The results of numerous significant studies were reported at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), held in Los Angeles in April, and the Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), which took place in Nashville in May. We have summarized some of the most interesting findings from those conferences in this update. Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Research Pipeline The treatment options for people with MS are likely to continue to expand in the years just ahead, as several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are in late stages of clinical development and/or are under review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Five noteworthy studies of such “pipeline” medications are summarized here. Cladribine and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes Cladribine is an oral medication taken for up to 20 days over a period of two years. It selectively targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to depletion of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. It is approved for use in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in several countries, but is not yet approved for use in the United States. In the Phase III CLARITY study, cladribine showed efficacy when compared to placebo over the course of two years of use by people with RRMS. A post-hoc analysis of that study’s data examined the impact of cladribine on a subset of individuals who had high disease activity as measured by relapses, MRI findings, and other characteristics. The analysis found that the effectiveness of cladribine versus placebo in this subpopulation was comparable to that seen in the overall CLARITY population in terms of reducing MRI markers of disease activity. This includes reducing such MRI markers as cumulative new T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions and cumulative combined unique active lesions. This post-hoc analysis did not focus on safety. However, in the CLARITY study from which this analysis’ MRI data were derived, certain adverse events occurred more frequently in the cladribine groups than in participants receiving placebo. These adverse events included lymphocytopenia (21.6 percent in the 3.5-mg cladribine group and 31.5 percent in the 5.25-mg group, versus 1.8 percent in the placebo group), and herpes zoster (eight patients and 12 patients, respectively, versus no patients). As clinicians experience continued progress in treating MS overall, an increasing focus is placed on improving outcomes in people with high disease activity. Studies of this type help provide informed treatment strategies for these individuals. Opicinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets LINGO-1, a protein in the central nervous system whose role is to halt myelination (repair of the protective covering of the nerves) and prevent the survival of neurons (nerve cells). The SYNERGY trial assessed various doses of opicinumab, given by intravenous infusion, in combination with interferon beta-1a, over the course of 72 weeks in people with relapsing forms of MS (RMS). The results showed a sort of “inverted U” effect with more favorable outcomes in the 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg dose groups, indicating that other factors may have been involved in how the participants responded. That finding prompted investigators to explore those factors associated with a better response to opicinumab. Their post-hoc analysis identified three factors associated with better response to the medication: shorter disease duration (less than 20 years); lower baseline magnetization transfer ratio values in T2 lesions, which may signify lower myelin content in those lesions; and lower baseline diffusion tensor imaging-radial diffusivity values in T2 lesions, a characteristic that may be consistent with greater structural integrity. Practicing “precision medicine” involves identifying those factors that enable clinicians to give the right medication to the right patient at the right time. As this study shows, that effort may entail drawing on highly technical, and possibly even less understood, biomedical characteristics and concepts in the service of individualizing care. Ublituximab and central nervous system lesions in relapsing MS Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody given by infusion. Like Ocrevus, ublituximab targets the CD20 molecule. Researchers evaluated 24-week data from a Phase II trial of the medication in people with relapsing forms of MS. Among 31 individuals who had a total of 73 T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions on MRI at baseline, no T1 Gd+ lesions were found at Week 24. Additionally, T2-lesion volume decreased by 8.1 percent from baseline to Week 24, prompting the authors to conclude that ublituximab has “robust efficacy” on MRI endpoints. Ozanimod is an oral, once-daily medication being evaluated for use in RRMS. It is a selective modulator of two types of S1P receptors: S1P1 and S1P5. Data from two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B, show that ozanimod, given at 1 mg/daily and 0.5 mg/daily, had favorable outcomes relative to Avonex (interferon beta-1a) – both in terms of annualized relapse rate (ARR) and MRI findings. Annualized relapse rate, or ARR, refers to how many relapses a person in a particular study group is likely to have, on average, over a one-year period. For example, if the placebo group in a clinical study had an ARR of “1,” the average person in that group could expect to have one relapse per year. Ozanimod, given at doses of either 1.0 mg or 0.5 mg, reduced the ARR by 48 percent and 31 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the SUNBEAM trial. In these same doses, it also reduced the ARR by 38 percent and 21 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the RADIANCE trial. Meanwhile, the adjusted mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions was reduced by 25 percent to 48 percent in people taking ozanimod versus those receiving interferon beta-1a. Additionally, the individuals taking ozanimod had fewer adverse events overall and fewer adverse events leading to study discontinuation. Siponimod, relapses, and disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Siponimod is an oral medication being studied for use in secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Its mechanism of action is similar to that of Gilenya (fingolimod), in that it works at the S1P receptor family to block the movement of lymph cells from lymph nodes; however, siponimod appears to interact with fewer of the receptors than Gilenya does – with its primary actions at the S1P1 and the S1P5 receptors, the same receptors that ozanimod targets. The Phase III EXPAND study showed that siponimod reduced confirmed disability progression (CDP). Investigators analyzed the results of that trial to understand to what extent, if any, this effect was related to a reduction in relapses. This information is important to uncover, because it could have implications for the effectiveness of the medication in people who do not experience relapses or who have very infrequent relapses. Using sophisticated statistical analyses, the researchers concluded that, “Siponimod treatment reduces the risk for CDP in both relapsing and non-relapsing SPMS patients. Our analyses suggest that siponimod’s effect on disability is largely independent from the effect on relapses.” Research into the safety and effectiveness of a DMT does not stop when that medication wins approval from the FDA. Several recently reported studies provide ongoing information on approved DMTs or findings from focused analyses of data from those medications’ major Phase III clinical trials. Highlights from several such studies are reported below. Ocrevus (ocrelimzumab) was approved by the FDA in 2017 for RMS and PPMS. The medication is administered by IV infusion, with 600 mg given every six months. The safety and efficacy of Ocrevus were assessed in two large clinical trials, OPERA I and OPERA II, in which individuals with relapsing MS received either Ocrevus or Rebif (interferon beta-1a). At the end of those trials, study participants were allowed to continue on Ocrevus or switch from Rebif to Ocrevus during a so-called “open-label extension” (OLE) period. A recent analysis found that switching from Rebif to Ocrevus at the start of the OLE period was associated with rapid and significant reductions in disease activity as identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients who changed therapies in the OLE went from having an adjusted number of 0.48 T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions per scan prior to switching, to an average 0.00 such lesions per scan after one year and two years on Ocrevus. Tysabri (natalizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that is administered by IV infusion of a 300-mg dose every four weeks. The medication was approved for use in adults with relapsing MS in 2004. However, Tysabri was voluntarily withdrawn from the market the next year after three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection caused by the JC virus, were identified in individuals taking the medication. Tysabri became available again in 2006, following implementation of a comprehensive risk-management program, which includes testing potential Tysabri users to see if they have anti-JC virus antibodies. Now, a team of New Zealand researchers have reported favorable results with administering Tysabri every six weeks rather than every four weeks, noting that they pursued extended-interval dosing with a view toward reducing the risk of PML. Those investigators report that after administering Tysabri at six-week intervals to 27 patients for an average of two years, none of the participants had lesions on MRI, and only one reported relapse. No participants were diagnosed with PML. This treatment strategy reflects ongoing efforts across the MS treatment spectrum to balance efficacy and safety to the patient’s maximal advantage. Aubagio (teriflunomide) was approved in 2012 for use in relapsing MS. It is an oral medication administered as 7-mg or 14-mg once daily. An analysis of long-term data on patients with relapsing MS who participated in two Phase III trials of the medication and the extensions of those trials found that 74 percent taking the 14-mg dose had stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores over five years. Mean EDSS scores at five years were higher (indicating disease progression) in those who experienced a relapse, compared with those who did not – at 2.70 and 2.43 respectively. A separate study examined 169 pregnancies in women who took Aubagio during pregnancy. Based on findings of teratogenicity – an elevated incidence of birth defects – in animal studies, use of the medication is contraindicated in pregnant women and females of reproductive potential not using effective contraception. Nonetheless, some women have taken the medication shortly before conceiving or while pregnant. In this study, the final dose of Aubagio was administered pre-conception or in the first trimester in all but four cases. Outcomes were known for 67 of the 169 pregnancies. Two structural abnormalities were reported: one case of congenital hydrocephalus in a full-term pregnancy and one cystic hygroma (a fluid-filled sac resulting from a blockage in the lymphatic system) detected on ultrasound during pregnancy (with the outcome of that pregnancy unknown). Researchers concluded that the current data from pregnancies exposed to teriflunomide show no warning signs of a treatment-related increased risk for birth defects. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a monoclonal antibody approved for use in RMS in 2014. It is administered by intravenous infusion over four hours for two multi-day treatment courses 12 months apart. Researchers recently analyzed data on 393 individuals who had participated in clinical trials of Lemtrada and then remained on the medication during a longer-term extension study. The researchers found that after using Lemtrada for six years, 77 percent of the more than 300 patients studied showed stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores compared to their baseline scores. Additionally, 43 percent achieved a six-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI), further underscoring the long-term benefits of treatment. Another analysis examined outcomes in extension-study patients who received re-treatment with Lemtrada due to disease activity after the initial two courses of therapy. Among 178 participants who received at least one re-treatment, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) fell from 0.85 (12 months before receiving a third course of Lemtrada) to 0.20 (12 months after the third course). The percentage of individuals with a CDI increased from 4 percent to 14 percent over those two time periods. Researchers concluded, “Patients who were re-treated due to relapse and/or MRI activity after the initial two courses demonstrate continued alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] efficacy after [Course 3] with reduced relapses and stable or improved disability.” Glatiramer acetate is an injectable DMT approved for use in relapsing forms of MS. It is available both as a branded medication (Copaxone) and in generic form from two other companies. In a one-year, placebo-controlled study, administering the medication in a dose of 40 mg/mL three-times weekly reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 34 percent and MRI disease activity by 34.7 percent relative to placebo. A new analysis shows that those benefits were sustained for up to five years in people participating in the open-label phase of the study, which was supported by Teva. The overall ARR during the entire long-term follow-up period was 0.26 for individuals who started on glatiramer acetate in the placebo-controlled phase of the study, and was 0.32 for those who switched from placebo to glatiramer acetate in the open-label phase. Researchers added that the most common adverse events seen over the long term were generally mild and consistent with the medication’s established safety profile. Interferon beta-1b was the first DMT approved for use in MS, and today is available in branded form as Betaseron and Extavia. A 23-year observational follow-up study was conducted with 87 patients treated at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. The study found that 29 percent of individuals used the medication for less than one year, while 18 percent remained on therapy for more than 15 years. Of the individuals who stopped treatment, side effects were the reason cited most often in those who discontinued therapy before five years of use, while lack of efficacy was given as the reason for stopping in those who used the medication for longer periods. A stable disease course on a DMT does not predict continued stability after discontinuing that therapy, regardless of a person’s age. Noting that clinicians sometimes recommend stopping DMT therapy as individuals with MS get older, researchers assessed the advisability of this strategy by examining data from the New York State MS Consortium (NYSMSC) database. Of 135 patients who were considered stable on DMT therapy as determined by minimal change in EDSS score, 35.6 percent saw their EDSS score worsen after stopping their DMT. Age did not affect post-discontinuation course, with 34.1 percent of people age 54 years and younger and 37.7 percent of people age 55 years and older recording unfavorable changes in their EDSS scores after going off a DMT. People with MS and their healthcare providers today face a “welcome dilemma” unimaginable even 20 years ago. With more than a dozen disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) now approved by the FDA for use in adults, patients and clinicians have an opportunity (and challenge) to select the medication likely to best address the each individual’s specific health status and needs. That can be a daunting prospect, particularly because few clinical trials have directly compared one agent with another. Given the scarcity of such studies, investigators often rely on sophisticated analytical methods – such as propensity scoring and other techniques – to assess the merits of one agent relative to others. Those methods, while useful, typically are considered by physicians to be less authoritative than a head-to-head trial of two agents. This section highlights five recently presented studies that compared agents within the same trial or via analysis of data drawn from different trials or large patient databases. In considering various treatments, however, it is critical to not only look at clinical trial data and other analyses, but also for individuals to talk with their clinician about their specific history and circumstances – in order to individualize their care and achieve an optimal effect. DMT impact on cognition in patients at increased risk of progressive disease The OPERA 1 and OPERA 2 trials were identical Phase III studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) to Rebif (interferon beta-1a) in people with relapsing MS. Study participants received either 600 mg of Ocrevus every 24 weeks or 44 ug of Rebif three times a week for 96 weeks. The studies included 186 individuals receiving Ocrevus and 180 receiving Rebif who were considered to be at increased risk of progressive disease based on their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems scores. Participants completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at baseline and during the course of 96 weeks to assess their cognitive function. Over the study period, individuals receiving Ocrevus who were at increased risk for disease progression had a greater mean improvement in SDMT scores than did increased-risk individuals receiving Rebif (6.2 for Ocrevus versus 2.6 for Rebif). Assessing DMTs in terms of annualized relapse rates Annualized relapse rate (ARR) is a measure of a DMT’s impact on disease course in MS. Researchers drew on data from two studies of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) and two studies of Aubagio (teriflunomide) to assess the ARR in newly diagnosed individuals starting one or the other of those medications. The participants had been diagnosed with relapsing MS within one year of study enrollment and had not taken other DMTs. The investigators used individual patient data from the studies to match analyzed subjects by key baseline characteristics. Their analysis showed that at 108 weeks after treatment initiation, the ARR was numerically lower in newly diagnosed individuals receiving Plegridy than in newly diagnosed Aubagio patients. However, this difference was not statistically significant. In a separate study, a German network of more than 130 neurologists drew on its database of roughly 25,000 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to assess various DMTs in terms of ARR. The analysis found that Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) had a statistically significant reduction in ARR versus interferon medications. Tecfidera also performed better than the other agents in terms of time to first relapse. A third study assessed the ARR in people with highly active RRMS who switched to either Tysabri (natalizumab) or Gilenya (fingolimod) after inadequate response to DMTs that are considered first-line therapies in Europe. Such medications include interferon medications, glatiramer acetate, Aubagio, and Tecfidera. Researchers analyzed data for 897 “patient triplets” or matched sets of individuals who either switched from one first-line therapy to another or from a first-line therapy to Tysabri or Gilenya. The study drew from the MSBase Registry, an international online registry for neurologists studying multiple sclerosis and other neuro-immunological diseases. The analysis found that after switching, individuals moving from a first-line therapy to Tysabri had an ARR of 0.21; those moving to Gilenya had an ARR of 0.30; and those switching from one first-line therapy to another had an ARR of 0.33. The ARR was statistically significantly reduced for Tysabri, with no evidence of difference for Gilenya. Earlier this year, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first DMT approved to treat relapsing MS in adolescents and children aged 10 years and older. This medication was approved for use in adults with RMS in 2010. The Phase III PARADIGMS study compared use of Gilenya to interferon beta-1a for up to two years in 214 individuals aged 10 to 17 years with pediatric-onset MS. At the end of the study, Gilenya reduced the annualized rate of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions by 52.6 percent and the number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions per scan by 66.0 percent compared with interferon beta-1a. The early recognition of MS and the evidence-based assessment of likely disease course are critical to patients’ and physicians’ ability to engage in shared decision-making on treatment choices and overall wellness strategies. A significant amount of research is being conducted to map the connections between imaging findings or biomarker levels and establishing the diagnosis and predicting the course of MS. Other studies are focused on what measures of physical function may reveal about current and future health status. Several recent studies exploring these issues are highlighted below. 2017 McDonald Criteria apply well to children at MS onset MRI findings play a key role in the diagnosis of MS, but most research on the significance of imaging results has been focused on adults. Now, a study by investigators from The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and other institutions, has found that the 2017 McDonald Criteria are largely applicable to children, as well as adults, when assessing patients at clinical disease onset. The researchers assessed more than 2,800 MRI scans from 331 pediatric patients with MS, acquired demyelinating syndrome, and related conditions, and followed those patients’ course over a median of six years. They found that the presence of ≥one T1-hypointense lesions or ≥one periventricular lesions were the MRI features most predictive of MS outcome. The 2010 McDonald criteria and 2017 version of those criteria had comparable utility in predicting a pediatric patient’s disease course, but the investigators said the 2017 criteria were easier to apply. “Both ‘black holes’ and periventricular lesions at baseline are strong predictors of MS” in children, as they are in adults, the researchers concluded, adding that evidence of new disease activity is required to confirm MS in children who present with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Location of brain lesions predictive of walking speed The presence of MRI-detected lesions in the infratentorial/cerebellar region of the brain is associated with slower walking speed in people with MS, according to a retrospective chart review of 82 individuals. A team of Connecticut-based researchers reviewed magnetic resonance images and medical records to determine whether the location of lesions in four areas of the central nervous system – the spinal cord, and the infratentorial/cerebellar, juxtacortical, and periventricular regions of the brain – was associated with mobility and disability in people with MS. No significant relationship was found between number of CNS regions with lesions and Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or time in performing the Timed 25-Foot Walk test. Similarly, no significant relationship was seen between the presence of lesions in any one region of the CNS and EDSS score. Higher number of oligoclonal bands correlates with relapses and disease progression People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who had 10 or more oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were far more likely to have relapses and disease progression over the ensuing two years than individuals with RRMS who had <10 OCBs in their CSF samples. That was the finding from a retrospective study of 128 people with RRMS on DMT therapy. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania also found that in addition to having more relapses and more new lesions on MRI, people with ≥10 OCBs were more likely to begin using an assistive device relative to their counterparts with fewer OCBs. “As OCBs may have greater diagnostic weight going forward, the quantity may be important in guiding selection of DMTs,” the study’s authors noted. Tapping into a new means of assessing MS subtype and mobility The number of times a person with MS can tap his or her foot in 10 seconds correlates with MS subtype and with results of mobility measures such as the 25-Foot Walk Test (25FWT). This finding was discovered by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and related institutions. In a study of 30 people with non-progressive MS, 30 with progressive MS, and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 10-second tap counts distinguished people with MS from healthy controls, and those with progressive MS from their peers with non-progressive MS. Further, slower foot tapping correlated with slower performance on the 25FWT and Timed Up and Go test (TUG). “The associations between foot tap speed and mobility measures, such as the TUG test and 25FWT, suggest that rapid foot-tapping may be a useful marker for tracking or predicting progression of mobility dysfunction in people with MS, regardless of their ability to ambulate,” the researchers noted. Various Strategies for Wellness and Symptom Management, Physical Activity and Exercise, Vitamin D, and Reproductive-Health Topics People with MS often must contend with a wide range of issues affecting their quality of life, overall health status, and general well-being. As the nature and impact of those issues have become better understood in recent years, an array of healthcare professionals – from psychologists and physical therapists to health educators and epidemiologists – are analyzing databases and devising innovative programs to further define and more effectively address challenges involving everything from insomnia to infertility. To follow are highlights of research in these areas. These were reported earlier this year at the Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). Well, maybe not the absolute best medicine, but apparently good medicine when it comes to addressing depression in people with MS and other neurologic conditions. Researchers at Evergreen Health in Kirkland, Washington, conducted a prospective, open trial of laughter therapy (LT) for 31 participants: 17 with MS, eight with Parkinson’s disease, two with spinal cord injury, and the remainder with other disorders of the central nervous system. After participating in eight, 60-minute laughter therapy classes taught by a certified LT instructor (yes, there is such a thing), participants who completed the course saw an improvement from baseline in their scores on a measure of depression. Scores on a separate measure of anxiety essentially were unchanged from baseline. “Our findings show that LT may reduce depression and be administered across a variety of neurological deficits, including for people with limited exercise options due to severe disability,” the researchers noted. However, they added that the approximate 50 percent attrition rate – with 14 participants not completing the program – may indicate a potential shortcoming for when the intervention is employed in people with neurological conditions. Comparing strategies for stress reduction in people with MS Both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and group education on stress reduction can provide short-and long-term benefits to people with MS, according to a randomized study involving 62 adults with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of ≤8.0. Compared to their status at the start of the study, people in both groups experienced significant reductions in stress both eight weeks and 12 months after participating in an MBRS program or group education. Both groups also saw improvement on a measure of emotional well-being at eight weeks, but that improvement was no longer statistically significant at 12 months. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of degree of stress reduction achieved or improvement in emotional well-being, suggesting that both approaches are viable options for addressing the stress and other emotional issues that can be part of living with MS. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may improve insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and fatigue in the roughly 40 percent of people with MS who experience chronic insomnia, according to an ongoing study. Seven people have completed the randomized controlled trial thus far, with five participating in a six-week program of CBT for insomnia and two serving as controls. The CBT group showed a 78 percent improvement from baseline on a measure of insomnia symptoms, compared to a 38 percent improvement in the control group. Similarly, sleep quality improved by 63 percent for people in the CBT group and 32 percent in the control group. Additionally, two measures of fatigue showed improvements of 70 percent and 50 percent, respectively, for people receiving CBT, versus a 37 percent improvement and 20 percent worsening, respectively, for control group members. Can shared medical appointments enhance wellness in MS? So much needs to happen in an MS patient’s regular visit with his or her clinician. As a result, education on wellness, managing co-morbidities, and other important topics can get lost in the time crunch. Two researchers from Cleveland explored whether shared medical appointments, or SMAs, may be a solution to that problem. In the typical SMA model, individual appointments for patients are scheduled around a time set aside for group instruction and discussion. In this case, the Cleveland researchers offered a monthly SMA, with group sessions covering topics such as nutrition, therapeutic yoga, and guided imagery. Thirty-three patients attended at least one SMA, with 45 percent of those participants returning for at least one more SMA, and 36 percent attending three or more sessions. Patient-satisfaction assessments found 75 percent of participants had a favorable view of the value of the information presented and regarding attending future SMAs. Female patients attended preferentially relative to men, noted the researchers, adding that “encouraging wellness interventions at an earlier age and to wider demographics and disability level” may encourage more people with MS to adopt healthy lifestyle practices. Becoming physically active is a challenge for people with MS – and for all people, for that matter. Staying active after completing a formal physical therapy or exercise program can be even more of a challenge. However, two New York City physical therapists have reported success in encouraging ongoing physical activity among seven of eight participants in a six-week wellness exercise class (WEC) they conducted. All eight of the program’s participants recently had been discharged from outpatient physical therapy. The weekly exercise class that they then entered consisted of 60 minutes of progressive aerobic and resistance training, as well as stretching. Upon completing the six-week class, participants showed improvement from baseline on several measures of the physical and psychological impact of MS. And, in keeping with the adage that success begets success, at a follow-up four weeks after completing the class, seven of the eight class members reported being active in an independent gym program. The researchers concluded, “Providers should work with physical therapists to assure that, after rehabilitation, affordable opportunities such as group WEC exist to help those with MS have the opportunity to independently engage in an exercise program. This bridge between therapy and discharge could safely enhance adherence to exercise post rehabilitation, and potentially decrease the need for a future prolonged course of PT.” Research supports maximal strength training for people with MS Properly supervised maximal strength training (MST) is safe for people with MS and can help improve their strength, balance, and walking speed, according to a team of researchers from Hunter College in New York City. Those researchers conducted a pilot study in which nine people with MS (six women and three men) participated in an eight-week program. The twice-weekly sessions involved leg press, knee flexion, and ankle plantarflexion, with weights increased based on participant capability and preference. At the end of the exercise program, the participants showed significant improvement from baseline in the Six Minute Walk Test and Mini-BESTest. Meanwhile, measures of fatigue and spasticity did not change significantly from the study’s start until its end, suggesting that the strength training did not increase fatigue or spasticity. The researchers noted that while the study is ongoing, the results to date suggest that “MST is a safe and effective intervention, and that [people with multiple sclerosis] can benefit from a higher intensity of intervention than might have previously been thought.” Time spent in physical activity correlates with higher Vitamin D concentrations in people with MS, according to a study of 23 women and 15 men with multiple sclerosis and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤4.0. Researchers used an activity-monitoring device, patient diaries, and measurement of Vitamin D blood levels to follow patients over a one-month period. The participants did not take Vitamin D supplements before or during the study. The fact that study participants who were more physically active had higher levels of Vitamin D than those who were not as active – despite the fact that they were not taking the Vitamin D supplements, is intriguing. This is because many MS patients have lower-than-normal Vitamin D levels, and because physical activity has been shown to improve outcomes in MS. The study’s authors noted that alternative pathways leading to the connection between disease progression and Vitamin D levels need to be considered. Long-term reduction in spasticity seen with intrathecal baclofen therapy Five years after implantation of a pump to deliver intrathecal baclofen therapy, both ambulatory and non-ambulatory people with MS had significant reductions in spasticity, according to researchers from the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center and related institutions. Those researchers examined the records of 77 individuals (40 ambulatory and 37 non-ambulatory) who had a pump implanted between 2001 and 2014, and for whom at least three years of follow-up data were available. The patient’s mean age at surgery to implant the pump was 47.1 years; 62 percent of the patients were women. For ambulatory patients, spasticity as measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) improved from 14.5 (range 10.8-20.25) at baseline to 2 (range 0-8) after five years on IBT. For non-ambulatory patients, MAS score improved from 24 (range 16.5-26) to 2 (range 0-5) after five years of IBT. Pain scores also improved significantly in both groups. Physical therapy (PT) has been shown to improve gait speed in people with MS. The medication dalfampridine extended-release (DER) also can increase gait speed in those with MS, but only about 38 percent of individuals experience this benefit. Now, the results of a small study support combining the interventions in people with MS who do not see a 20 percent or greater improvement in their Timed 25 Foot Walk test (T25W) after three weeks on the medication. The study involved eight adults with MS. Four of those people had been taking DER for three weeks and did not have a ≥20 percent improvement in T25W at the end of that period. They continued on DER for another six weeks, but also engaged in twice-weekly physical therapy during that period. The other four participants did not receive DER but also engaged in six weeks of twice-weekly PT. Among the DER + PT patients, T25FW results improved by 20.7 percent from Week 3 to Week 9, while the PT-only group had a 6.8 percent improvement in T25W during that period. Infertility and MS – findings from a large database analysis Women with MS are more likely to have a diagnosis of infertility, less likely to use infertility medications, and less likely to have a live birth than their age-matched peers without MS. Those are the main findings from an analysis of United States’ commercial insurance claims for 117,041 women with MS and more than 1.4 million women without MS. The analysis, which spanned the period from 2006 through 2015, found that 8.52 percent of women with MS and 8.02 percent of those without MS had a diagnosis of infertility. While that percentage difference is small, the researchers noted that it is statistically significant. Similarly, a significantly lower proportion of women with MS used any fertility treatment relative to women without MS (1.01 percent versus 1.19 percent). Finally, the rate of live births in women on any infertility treatment was 5.00 percent among women with MS, compared with 6.98 percent among those who did not have MS. Data from the New York State Multiple Sclerosis Consortium (NYSMSC) provide reassuring news regarding both the incidence of relapses during pregnancy and the near-term effect on infants of maternal use of DMTs in pregnancy. Among 109 women who reported a pregnancy after being diagnosed with MS, 48.6 percent had a relapse in the two years before becoming pregnant, but just 11.9 percent reported a relapse during pregnancy. Those relapses were more common in the first and second trimesters than in the third trimester. Meanwhile, 45.8 percent of the women reported a relapse in the first two years after birth, with most of the relapses occurring in the first year after delivery. Women who had experienced a relapse in the 24 months before pregnancy were more likely than others to have a relapse in the 24 months after birth, while relapse during pregnancy was not associated with postpartum relapse. Eleven of the women in the analysis were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for at least part of their pregnancy, with six continuing to use their DMT through their entire pregnancy. None of those women reported birth problems, and none of their children had been referred for special medical services at age 1 or 2 years. Hot Topics in MS: Stem Cells, Lipoic Acid, Diet and MS, Obesity and MS, Gut Microbiome, and Medical Marijuana Research into interventions for MS extends far beyond the important efforts to develop new pharmacologic treatments and to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of currently approved medications. Increasingly, investigators are assessing the impact of diet, the gut microbiome – a key component of the immune system – and various substances as they look for ways to manage symptoms and improve outcomes. Studies also are exploring the role of two very different types of interventions long used to treat other conditions — medical marijuana and stem-cell transplantation – in MS. This section reviews pertinent findings in these and other areas reported at the 2018 Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). When relapses continue while taking a DMT – a role for stem-cell therapy? An international team of researchers is assessing the role of stem-cell transplantation for individuals with highly active RRMS who continue to have relapses despite taking a DMT. At the AAN’s annual meeting, those scientists reported interim results from their Multiple Sclerosis International Stem cell Transplant (MIST) trial. The study involves 110 individuals with RRMS on a DMT who have had two or more relapses in the past 12 months. Fifty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive stem-cell transplantation, while the other 55 continue to receive the DMT that their treating neurologist deemed best for them. Importantly, the study is employing “non-myeloablative” stem-cell transplantation, meaning that patients can go through a less-demanding pre-treatment regimen than what was first used in stem-cell transplantation and still often used in treating certain types of cancer. The study’s main endpoint is treatment failure, defined as a 1.0 increase in EDSS sustained for six months or more. After a mean follow-up of three years, 60 percent of patients in the DMT arm had experienced a treatment failure, compared to just 6 percent of those in the stem-cell transplant group. During the first year after transplant, those receiving stem cells saw their EDDS score improve from 3.5 to 2.4, while it worsened in the DMT group from 3.3 to 3.9. Both of those findings were statistically significant. No deaths occurred in the stem-cell transplant group. These results led the researchers to conclude that in people with RRMS who have more than two relapses in a year while on a DMT, stem-cell transplantation is superior to continued use of a disease-modifying therapy. Meanwhile, a separate, smaller study from a single center suggests that stem-cell transplantation may be a first-line option for the minority of MS patients who have rapidly evolving severe multiple sclerosis (RESMS), also known as highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). British investigators performed stem-cell transplantation on five men and two women who had not received a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and who had experienced two or more severe relapses in the 12 months before the procedure. These individuals all had clinical or imaging findings that suggested that their MS would continue to worsen, and all had at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion seen on MRI associated with their relapses. They ranged in age from 27 to 52 years old, and their median time between symptom onset and treatment was nine months. The investigators used each patient’s own stem cells for the procedure. After a median follow-up period of 18 months, none of the participants had experienced a relapse following the transplantation, although one had a single new gadolinium-enhancing lesion six months after treatment. The median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score for these individuals improved from a median 5.5 before treatment to 3 at the last follow-up. No serious adverse effects were observed. The investigators concluded that autologous (using the patient’s own cells) hematopoietic (blood-cell producing) stem-cell transplantation is safe and effective for previously untreated patients with rapidly evolving, severe MS. Lipoic acid is a naturally occurring compound that exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its potential role as a dietary supplement for people with MS has been the focus of recent research, including a study by investigators from the Oregon Health & Science University and VA Portland Health Care System. Those researchers administered 1,200 mg of oral lipoic acid to people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and healthy controls. They then drew blood samples to measure the amount of lipoic acid found in the plasma of all three groups, as well as levels of substances involved in immune system responses. In particular, the investigators wanted to see if taking lipoic acid would stimulate the body’s production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which plays a role in modulating the immune system. They found that two hours and four hours after ingesting lipoic acid, the health controls and people with SPMS had increased cAMP levels relative to baseline, while those with RRMS had decreases in cAMP. Also, women with RRMS had lower plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E2, which stimulates cAMP, compared to women with SPMS and women without MS four hours after taking lipoic acid. These findings prompted the investigators to conclude that the differences in the way people with RRMS responded to lipoic acid relative to those without MS or with SPMS may have implications for the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents in RRMS. Following a paleolithic diet can help decrease fatigue in MS through changes in people’s lipid profiles, according to a study reported at the AAN annual meeting. The paleolithic – or so-called “caveman” diet – focuses on eating meat, fish, nuts, and vegetables available before the advent of processed food. A one-year study of 18 people with progressive MS found that a comprehensive intervention that included following a paleolithic diet, neuromuscular stimulation, and stress reduction reduced participants’ mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score from 5.51 at baseline to 3.03 at 12 months. During that time, participants saw their HDL-C (“good cholesterol”) levels increase, their total cholesterol levels decrease, and their body mass index (BMI) fall (BMI is a measure of healthy or unhealthy weight). The researchers concluded, “Lipid profile variables are associated with the improvements in fatigue in progressive MS patients on a modified Paleolithic diet-based multimodal intervention.” Meanwhile, researchers from Johns Hopkins reported on people with MS who follow a Mediterranean-style diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seafood and polyunsaturated fats while eating little red meat and drinking in moderation. The researchers found that these individuals appear to have less severe depressive and cognitive symptoms than people with MS who follow a more-traditional American diet. The researchers had 34 people with MS complete dietary recall surveys and then assessed those people for depression, cognitive impairment, and other known symptoms of MS. The investigators noted that the results of this cross-sectional survey need to be validated by interventional studies that could better examine the nature of the relationship seen between diet and the MS symptoms studied. Other research being conducted at Johns Hopkins is examining how caloric restriction affects the metabolite profiles of people with MS. In a six-month study, 19 people with MS who were receiving monthly injections of Tysabri and who had a higher body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m (indicating that they are overweight) chose from one of two calorie-restriction strategies. The first strategy, chosen by 11 individuals, involved continuous calorie restriction (CCR), with participants consuming 78.6 percent of their daily caloric needs each day. The other approach, chosen by eight participants, entailed intermittent calorie restriction (ICR), with people consuming only 25 percent of their daily caloric needs two days per week, and consuming their full caloric needs on the other days of the week. Nine of the 11 people in the CCR group and six of the eight in the ICR group completed the study. Researchers are assessing blood samples collected at baseline, three months, and six months to see how the two calorie-restriction approaches influenced the production of metabolites. They note that the results of their analysis may provide new information on how dietary changes affect clinical outcomes in MS. People who are obese at the onset of MS are likely to experience greater functional impairment and higher risk of relapses in the first two years after onset than people with a healthy weight, according to a study of more than 1,500 people with MS. Drawing on data for 1,524 participants in the Accelerated Cure Project’s study, researchers found that obesity was associated with a 15-percent increase in the number of impaired functional domains and a 30-percent increase in early relapse activity. People who were obese also were on average 8-percent older than non-obese patients at the onset of MS. The investigators explain, “These results warrant further investigation into the impact of this proinflammatory phenotype [obesity] in MS.” Gut reaction? Exploring potential ties between MS and the digestive tract’s microbiome The mix of bacteria found in the digestive tracts of people with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) differ from the bacterial milieu found in the gastrointestinal systems of people who don’t have those conditions, two recent studies found. Those studies reflect a growing research focus on potential links between MS and the “gut microbiome,” the digestive tract’s bacterial environment, which is known to play a major role in immune-system function. In the first study, American researchers used sophisticated genetic testing to analyze 42 stool samples from individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), as well as stool samples from 28 healthy donors. Compared to the samples from healthy volunteers, stool samples from people with RRMS had a statistically significant greater abundance of several types of bacteria, including Ruminococcus torques, Ruminococcus obeum, and Lactospiraces. Escherichia coli and Oscillibacter also were found more often in people with RRMS than in healthy controls. Conversely, people who did not have MS had a higher concentration of other bacteria – including bacteroides fragilis and Roseburia – than did study participants with MS. The researchers noted that further, larger studies are needed to determine whether these findings can help pave the way for markers of disease activity or even therapies that target the composition of the gut microbiome. Meanwhile, Italian investigators found differences in both the stool and blood samples of individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) – referring to individuals experiencing a symptom of MS, but who have not yet been diagnosed – relative to healthy volunteers. They found that butyrate-producing bacteria were more abundant in the healthy volunteers compared to those with CIS. Additionally, the blood of people with CIS had an increased level of a type of white blood cell involved in immune function – T helper (Th) 17 – and fewer T regulatory (Treg) cells producing Interleukin 10, compared to healthy volunteers. The researchers said that both findings indicate that gut microbiome dysfunction or imbalance exists at the earliest stages of MS. Most people with MS who use medical marijuana (MM), find that the medication helps manage their pain, spasticity, and other symptoms. This is according to two recent small-scale studies. In the first study, 14 individuals at the University of Rochester MS Center (13 with MS and one with transverse myelitis) enrolled in the New York State Medical Marijuana Program and completed a survey on their experience with MM. Ninety-three percent of these individuals who were certified by the state program to use medical marijuana actually had tried the medication at least once, with 77 percent reporting ongoing use, and 62 percent saying they used MM at least daily. Seventy-seven percent of participants said MM was helpful in managing their symptoms, 70 percent said that their quality of life improved with marijuana use, and most respondents reported no side effects. Most subjects estimated that they spent between $100 and $300 per month on MM, and cost was cited as a factor in stopping use of MM or using the agent less frequently.   The second study is being conducted in Colorado, where cannabis use – for any purpose, not just medical reasons – is legal. The experience and beliefs of 25 patients from the Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of Colorado were reported in preliminary findings from the research. Fifty-six percent of those participants believe cannabis has a beneficial effect on MS symptoms, while 8 percent think marijuana could entail harm in terms of MS symptoms. Seventy-six percent said they would consider cannabis use to ease their symptoms. Pain was the reason most frequently cited for using cannabis (by 57 percent of respondents), followed by spasticity/muscle tightness (29 percent), and muscle spasms (14 percent). Slowed thinking was the most commonly reported side effect, cited by 29 percent of participants. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents said that they were not currently using cannabis, with half of those people saying their non-usage was because they did not know enough about the medication. The authors of the second study noted, “As cannabis becomes more available under the laws of individual states, the results of this ongoing study may have important implications in the future landscape of MS symptom treatment and research exploring the efficacy of cannabis for MS symptom management.” For general information or to speak with a trained Client Services Specialist, please call MSAA’s Helpline at .

dc235da3-fec1-4305-8ae1-7dc2d3c9ed75,"The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment with a long-term, is crucial for most patients with MS, since disease activity and damage continues within the CNS even when no new symptoms are present. When a patient begins a treatment regimen early in his or her disease course, disease activity is slowed. This not only reduces the number and severity of symptom flare-ups, as well as delays the progression of the disease (and possibly delays any related disability), but also reduces the number of active lesions that appear on an MRI. A 21-year prospective study of individuals (with relapsing-remitting MS) who began therapy early in the disease found that they experienced a longer lifespan than those who did not begin treatment as early. Of those who didn’t start treatment early, MS-related pulmonary infection was the most common cause of mortality over the 21-year period. Previously, all but one* of the approved treatments were only available for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) – largely for those with RRMS – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS had been approved for these two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication had been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Additionally, in 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. While these are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS, the FDA is allowing some of the previously approved DMTs to add active SPMS to their indications. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). *In 2000, Novantrone® (mitoxantrone), given via IV infusion, was approved for RRMS, SPMS, and worsening RRMS. However, side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT that is also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. Research (including many clinical trials) is ongoing at a rigorous pace to find additional treatments for all forms of MS. Mylan’s generic version of Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate injection) Three generic versions of Gilenya® (fingolimod) capsules; while approved, these are not yet available Tecfidera® (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) Getting early treatment and staying on one of the long-term DMTs for MS may also delay the rate of conversion from RRMS to . As noted earlier, this form of MS that follows RRMS exhibits a steady worsening, with or without relapses (or flare-ups). If flare-ups do occur, they usually do not remit fully. As mentioned in the previous section, without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of more than 20 brand-name and generic DMTs since the first treatment became available in 1993, those taking a DMT experience a reduced or delayed conversion rate. For more information on long-term treatments for MS and how to select the treatment that is right for you, please see MSAA’s . Individuals who experience a more steady progression of the disease from the onset, without periodic relapses and remissions, may be diagnosed with . To date, only one disease-modifying therapy (Ocrevus) has been approved for the long-term treatment of this form of MS, although many experimental medications are being studied with PPMS in clinical trials. | Additional Evaluative Tools for Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosing Multiple Sclerosis and Evaluating Disease Activity MSAA is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 22-1912812.Copyright ©2020 Multiple Sclerosis Association of America.Reproduction of material from any mymsaa.org pages without written permission is strictly prohibited.",81,Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?,-9.71451473236084,96
cd12ec52-6dbe-427a-8026-55df746bf070,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Preliminary Results Announced from Clinical Trial of “Anti-LINGO-1” Myelin Repair Strategy in Peopl Preliminary Results Announced from Clinical Trial of “Anti-LINGO-1” Myelin Repair Strategy in People with Optic Neuritis A phase II study of the “anti-LINGO-1” repair strategy in people with optic neuritis, which is often the first clinical episode of multiple sclerosis, met its primary endpoint, announced Biogen Idec in a press release on January 8. Treatment improved nerve impulse conduction in the eyes in a study of 82 people who had experienced a first episode of this inflammation of the optic nerve, although it is not yet clear if this improvement reflects repair of damage. The trial was sponsored by Biogen Idec. Also ongoing is a study of this compound in 419 people with relapsing forms of MS. Phase II studies such as this one are designed to provide indicators of safety, benefits and optimal dosing, but larger, longer phase III studies are required to support applications for marketing approval from drug regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In MS, immune attacks lead to the loss of myelin that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. Repairing the nervous system was just a dream a few years ago. Today it holds significant promise as a strategy to restore the function that MS has taken from people; and reducing or stopping MS progression. This remarkable progress is due in large part to the National MS Society’s comprehensive efforts and multi-million dollar research investments. Today the Society is supporting 87 research projects in nervous system repair, with multi-year commitments totaling over $35 million. The human trials of anti-LINGO leverage research aimed at stimulating the body’s natural healing abilities. LINGO is a protein seen in nerve cells and cells that make nerve-insulating myelin (oligodendrocytes). Blockading this protein with a monoclonal antibody called anti-LINGO has been shown to promote myelin repair in animal models. In in people with relapsing-remitting or secondary-progressive MS, no serious adverse safety events were reported. Assessing visual outcomes in acute optic neuritis – inflammation of the optic nerve that often presents as the first clinical episode of MS – shows promise as a possible model for screening compounds for their ability to protect the nervous system and repair myelin. The optic nerve is one of the few locations in the central nervous system that can be assessed directly and noninvasively. For this phase II study, investigators recruited 82 people who had experienced a first episode of acute optic neuritis at 33 sites in Europe, Canada, and Australia for this trial, called the RENEW trial. Participants received intravenous infusions of 100 mg/kg anti-LINGO-1 or inactive placebo every four weeks for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was whether treatments improved optic nerve impulse conduction, as measured by visual evoked potential tests. Evoked potential tests measure the electrical activity of the brain in response to stimulation of specific sensory nerve pathways. They are able to detect the slowing of electrical conduction that may be caused by myelin damage along these pathways even when the change is too subtle to be noticed by the person or to show up on neurologic examination. Preliminary results reported in the press release suggest that 34% of the participants who completed the study showed improvement in optic nerve impulse conduction in the anti-LINGO-1 group, compared to on placebo, although it is not yet clear if this improvement reflects repair of damage.. No effect was shown on secondary endpoints, including change in thickness of the optic nerve fiber layers and visual function. Three serious adverse events were reported in those onanti-LINGO-1 and not in those on placebo, including two patients with hypersensitivity reactions occurring around the time of infusion and one elevation in liver enzymes, which resolved after treatment was discontinued. Otherwise the treatment was well tolerated. Analysis of this study is ongoing and full results will be presented at a medical meeting later this year, according to the press release. The SYNERGY study, which is assessing the safety and effectiveness of anti-LINGO-1 in 419 people with relapsing forms of MS, is ongoing and has completed enrollment. Full results from these studies will help to determine if anti-LINGO-1 can repair damage and restore function in people with MS. about research to repair the nervous system in MS.

Multiple Sklerose: Kognitive Defizite haben hohe Relevanz für den Alltag Multiple Sklerose: Kognitive Defizite haben hohe Relevanz für den Alltag Dtsch Arztebl 2017; 114(37): [12]; DOI: 10.3238/PersNeuro.2017.09.15.02 Der Erhalt der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit stellt eine der Herausforderungen bei Patienten mit multipler Sklerose dar. Immunmodulatorische Arzneimittel und nichtpharmakologische Maßnahmen können einen positiven Einfluss haben. Neben den klassischen physischen Symptomen, die im Rahmen einer multiplen Sklerose (MS) auftreten, existieren „verborgene Symptome“, zu denen kognitive Veränderungen, Fatigue und emotional-affektive Aspekte wie Depression und Angststörungen zählen. Die Betitelung als „verborgen“ oder „soft“ führt oftmals zu Irritationen, sind diese Beeinträchtigungen doch für die Patienten oftmals zentral und deutlich sichtbar. Mittlerweile gilt es als unbestritten, dass sich die Trias „Fatigue, Depression/Angst und kognitive Störungen“ stark negativ auf die Lebensqualität betroffener Patienten und ihre Berufsfähigkeit auswirkt () . Verborgene Symptome der MS und ihr Einfluss auf Lebensqualität und Berufsfähigkeit Eine kürzlich erschienene Studie zum Einfluss der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit auf den Grad der Arbeitsfähigkeit konnte sehr deutlich zeigen, dass die Arbeitsfähigkeit eine direkte Funktion der kognitiven Leistung ist. Dieser Effekt blieb über verschiedene kognitive Domänen hinweg stabil, sodass dieser enge Zusammenhang als gesichert angesehen werden kann (). Ein weiteres starkes Argument dafür, die Kognition im Rahmen der MS als gewichtig anzusehen, lässt sich aus der jüngsten Publikation zur Schätzung der Kostenbelastung durch MS in Europa ableiten (). Hier zeigt sich sehr deutlich, dass Kognition neben Fatigue einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Belastung leistet, da diese Symptome von Beginn an unabhängig vom Behinderungsgrad präsent sein können und die Produktivität der Patienten negativ beeinflussen. Die Folgekosten in Anbetracht der Betroffenheit oftmals noch sehr junger Patienten sind enorm und schließen vor allem häufige Arbeitsausfälle und Frühverrentung ein. Es sei daher bereits an dieser Stelle betont, dass eine Sensibilisierung seitens der behandelnden Ärzte (vor allem Neurologen und Hausärzte) für die unsichtbaren Symptome dringend angezeigt ist, um durch den Einsatz frühzeitiger Immun- und symptomatischer Therapie das kognitive Netzwerk so lange wie möglich funktionstüchtig zu halten. Die kognitiven Veränderungen bei Patienten mit MS fokussieren sich auf 3 wesentliche Bereiche: kognitive Verlangsamung (Einschränkung in der Informations­verarbeitungs­geschwindig­keit), Beeinträchtigungen der exekutiven Funktionen (z. B. eingeschränktes Multitasking, eingeschränkte mentale Flexibilität). Als hat sich die herausgestellt. Diese Verlangsamung lässt sich oftmals bereits zum Krankheitsbeginn mit sensitiven Testverfahren objektivieren und führt häufig dazu, dass auch andere kognitive Teilleistungen in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden. Zudem ist eine gute kognitive Geschwindigkeit in unserer Hochleistungsgesellschaft von besonderer Bedeutung: Wer in kurzer Zeit viel leistet und dabei noch eine gute Qualität abliefert, hat beruflichen Mitstreitern etwas voraus. Wer aber für eine gute Qualität doppelt so viel Zeit benötigt, fällt rasch aus dem Rahmen. Letzteres ist genau das, was MS-Patienten nicht selten passiert. Gibt man im testpsychologischen Kontext genügend Zeit, sind die Patienten häufig in der Lage, 100 % Qualität zu erbringen. In zeitgebundenen Testverfahren sieht man häufig ein Scheitern, weil die Quantität einfach in der vorgegebenen Zeit nicht erreicht werden kann. Neben der Verlangsamung treten Probleme der auf, und zwar dahingehend, dass die Aufmerksamkeit nicht anhaltend auf dem gleichen Niveau gehalten werden kann, sondern . Das eingeschränkte Multitasking wirkt sich zudem negativ auf die Leistungsfähigkeit im Alltag aus, da nicht mehr parallel, sondernabgearbeitet werden können. Somit haben die kognitiven Domänen, die bei der MS im Speziellen beeinträchtigt sind, eine hohe Alltagsrelevanz und stellen zu jedem Zeitpunkt der Erkrankung eine beachtliche Belastung für die Betroffenen dar. Zur Evolution der kognitiven Veränderungen über die Zeit liegen nur wenige Daten aus longitudinalen und cross-sektionalen Studien vor. Diese aber sprechen kongruent für eine deutlichere Progression in den ersten 5 Jahren nach Krankheitsbeginn und eine Abschwächung im weiteren Verlauf (, ). In jedem Fall unterscheidet sich der Verlauf sehr deutlich von dem der klassischen neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen. Dies ist ein wesentlicher Punkt in der Kommunikation mit den Patienten, da oftmals die Angst im Vordergrund steht, dement zu werden. Letztere Sorge führt häufig zu einer generellen Ablehnung, den eigenen kognitiven Status erheben zu lassen. Daher ist eine frühzeitige Aufklärung der Patienten hinsichtlich der Entwicklung von kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen sehr wichtig. Die Frage nach den konkreten Ursachen für das Auftreten kognitiver Störungen bei MS kann nicht mit Sicherheit beantwortet werden. Dennoch haben sich im Laufe der letzten 20 Jahre Hypothesen aus Studienergebnissen ableiten lassen: Zum einen zeigen bildgebende Daten, dass es nicht primär auf die Anzahl der Läsionen in der weißen und grauen Substanz ankommt, sondern vielmehr auf die Lokalisation (, ). Liegen auch nur wenige Läsionen in für die Kognition strategischen Hirnregionen, kann daraus ein kognitives Defizit resultieren. Neben der Lokalisation der Läsionen spielt die Hirnatrophie eine entscheidende Rolle. Es gilt als gesichert, dass das kortikale Gesamthirnvolumen bei kognitiv beeinträchtigten Patienten kleiner ist als bei Personen mit intakter Kognition (). Darüber hinaus gibt es Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitig auftretende atrophische Veränderung in den ersten beiden Jahren nach Diagnosestellung als Prädiktor für einen ungünstigen kognitiven Verlauf in den Folgejahren zu werten ist (). Mit Korrelationskoeffizienten von 0,5 und größer stellt die zum kognitiven Status dar. In diesem Zusammenhang sei explizit auf den Thalamus verwiesen, da es Evidenz dafür gibt, dass MS-Patienten bereits in frühen Krankheitsstadien eine thalamische Atrophie entwickeln können () und dass sowohl Struktur als auch Funktion des Thalamus maßgeblich die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit beeinflussen (). Aus den kernspintomografisch gefundenen Resultaten lässt sich gesamthaft ableiten, dass sich ein struktureller und funktioneller Schaden negativ auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und therapeutische Ansätze möglichst frühzeitig zum Einsatz kommen sollten, solange das Netzwerk noch Ressourcen zur Kompensation besitzt. Aufgrund der Bedeutsamkeit der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit für das Berufs- und Sozialleben der Patienten ist eine regelmäßige angeraten. Diese Dokumentation dient dazu, dem Patienten zum einen zu signalisieren, dass er von seiner Therapie profitiert und auch hinsichtlich der Kognition stabil ist, zum anderen sollte ein sich deutlich verschlechternder kognitiver Status auch immer Anlass dazu geben, die gegenwärtige Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Ein empfehlenswertes Instrument, um den kognitiven Status im Rahmen der klinischen Routine zu erfassen, ist die (). Sie besteht aus 3 Testverfahren: dem VLMT (verbaler Lern- und Merkfähigkeitstest) () und dem Die Durchführungszeit für die gesamte Screeningbatterie liegt bei circa 20 Minuten. Steht dafür nicht ausreichend Zeit zur Verfügung, empfiehlt es sich, zumindest den SDMT regelmäßig einmal pro Jahr durchzuführen. Die Durchführung nimmt nur 90 Sekunden in Anspruch, und die Aussagekraft des Tests ist dabei äußerst gut. Vor allem das Defizit in der kognitiven Prozessierungsgeschwindigkeit und im Arbeitsgedächtnis kann mit diesem Verfahren sehr zuverlässig erfasst werden. Selbstverständlich ersetzen Screeninginstrumente keine elaborierte neuropsychologische Untersuchung. Sie sollen eher dazu dienen, eine Sensibilisierung für die Kognition zu entwickeln, und können bei deutlich abfallender Leistung im Vergleich zum individuellen Vortest frühzeitig eine kognitive Verschlechterung aufzeigen. Die Behandlung der kognitiven Störungen bei MS ist eine , da es keine wirksame, evidenzbasierte symptomatische Therapie gibt, die jedem betroffenen Patienten empfohlen werden könnte. Zu den verlaufsmodifizierenden Immuntherapien liegen nur wenige Daten zur Kognition vor. Für die Interferone und Glatiramerazetat konnte gezeigt werden, dass sie sich nicht nachteilig auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirken, sondern Patienten unter der Therapie deutlich besser abschneiden als solche unter Placebo (–). Zu Natalizumab liegen Ergebnisse aus 2 Studien vor, die eine signifikante Verbesserung der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit in entscheidenden Domänen dokumentieren (, ). Fingolimod und Dimetylfumarat () wirken sich ebenfalls stabilisierend auf die Kognition aus, konnten aber in bisherigen Studien keine klinisch relevante Verbesserung zeigen. Eine solche Verbesserung konnte jüngst eindrücklich für Daclizumab vorgestellt werden. Im direkten Vergleich zum Interferon beta-1a i.m. schnitten die Patienten über einen Zeitraum von 144 Wochen deutlich besser ab. Hinzu kam, dass die Leistung im SDMT nach dem genannten Beobachtungszeitraum als klinisch relevante Verbesserung im Vergleich zur Baseline-Untersuchung zu werten ist (). Zur symptomatischen Behandlung der kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen muss leider konstatiert werden, dass es keine hinreichende Evidenz für die Wirksamkeit der untersuchten Medikamente gibt, zu denen Modafinil, 4-Aminopyridin, Amantadin, L-Amphetamin, Methylphenidat, aber auch Antidementiva wie Donepezil, Rivastigmin und Memantin zählen (, ). Zu den ist zu sagen, dass sich moderates Ausdauertraining positiv auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und eine Studie zur Frage der Intensität gezeigt hat, dass intensives, moderates und leichtes Training sich gleichsam positiv auswirken. Dies bedeutet, dass Patienten sich durchaus auch körperlich fordern können, sie aber die Trainingsintensität ihrer jeweiligen Verfassung anpassen sollten. Wichtig ist, dass überhaupt körperliche Aktivität durchgeführt wird (, ). Neben sportlicher Aktivität ist auch Hirnleistungstraining eine Maßnahme, von der viele Patienten profitieren (, ). Das Training sollte allerdings spezifisch auf die jeweiligen im Vordergrund stehenden Defizite zugeschnitten sein und nicht einen Rundumschlag darstellen im Sinne von „viel hilft auch viel“. Kognitive Defizite sind ernst zu nehmende Symptome der MS mit hoher Relevanz für den Alltag und die Berufsfähigkeit der Betroffenen. Das Erheben des kognitiven Status sollte bereits im Rahmen der Diagnosestellung erfolgen, um einen Verlauf über die Zeit und einen Vergleich zu einem Ausgangswert bei deutlicher Verschlechterung dokumentieren zu können. Es gibt Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitige Immuntherapie auch als Benefit im Hinblick auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit über die Zeit zu werten ist. Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung kann Anzeichen eines Schubes sein (kognitive Schübe sind keine Chimäre!). Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung (z. B. > 4 Punkte im SDMT) sollte in der Gesamtschau mit anderen Befunden (vor allem MRT) Anlass dazu geben, die bestehende Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Prof. Dr. phil. Dipl.-Psych.

a9e19085-52cc-42dd-a972-f64c460c187d,"Preserving Myelin Sheath Cells Could Be a Way to Attack MS Researchers say the destruction of these sheaths causes multiple sclerosis symptoms. Scientists have suggesting that myelin repair in people with multiple sclerosis may be possible as long as certain cells still survive. These cells, called oligodendrocytes, are acquired since birth and make up the myelin sheaths around the nerves that are destroyed by the disease. The destruction of the sheaths causes symptoms associated with MS. Repairing myelin may be the only way to repair damage from the disease’s progression. “People with MS do not generate cells needed for re-myelination. Instead their bodies depend upon cells given at birth,” Dr. Jonas Frisén, the lead study author and a professor of stem cell research at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, told Healthline. “We need to save these cells.” To obtain their data, study authors relied upon nuclear bomb tests that were conducted in the United States, Soviet Union, and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The residue of the bomb tests released radioactive carbon into the atmosphere that spread around the globe. The residue left a lasting mark on human cells. This marker was used, postmortem, to determine the age of cells. “The results were a big surprise,” Frisén said. “This is technically difficult to approach in humans. There is no other source of a marker in the environment that is integrated in DNA and can be used for the analysis of cell generation. This is the first human study.” What the researchers found was contradictory to previous thinking. In mice models, it’s the new oligodendrocytes that repair the myelin. But in humans, it’s the old cells that come to the rescue. “These results strengthen the support to treat MS aggressively and early in the disease to prevent loss of oligodendrocytes, which are not replaced efficiently. We need to save the ones we have,” Frisén said. “This was a robust study containing about 40 MS tissues and about the same healthy tissues,” he said. The postmortem samples came from tissue banks in the United Kingdom, United States, and other countries. The study is changing the way experts think about treatment strategies. “It means that prompting new oligodendrocytes is not a viable strategy,” Frisén said. “Instead, we need to keep them alive and functioning and trigger them to repair.” “This is a very provocative paper,” Claude Schofield, PhD, director of discovery research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline. “If it turns out to be true, it’s a pretty important finding.” “This will have a massive impact on how we view our approach to treating MS,” Schofield added. “More research is needed. But measuring the age of cells is not available. If we could develop chemical markers (other than nuclear isotopes) that could date cells, it is possible to recreate and do the research needed.” “This study was done postmortem with donated tissue. If we could develop markers to use with imaging techniques, we could better understand the pathology of individual MS and lead to better treatments,” Schofield said. Some cells may create longer myelin sheaths or have other unique features. These subgroups of cells were identified in a recently published in the journal Nature. The findings may be important to understanding disease progression and developing therapeutic approaches. “This is huge for MS,” Schofield said of the second study. “It will revolutionize the way we look at MS.” Schofield explains how, up until this study, we could only identify a cell by its shape and other features. But with this new methodology, we’re able to see a fingerprint of the cell and know everything about it. He likened it to the difference between a rotary phone and today’s smartphones. “Now we can find differences that we would never detect before,” he said. “In terms of understanding disease, this is the future, the most important thing going on in biology right now.” Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

""In normal human beings, the immune system will spot and attack threats to the human body, like viruses or harmful bacteria. In a person with MS, the immune system sees myelin as one of these threats. Immune system cells come into the central nervous system and start attacking the myelin sheath, creating an autoimmune response - when the human body attacks itself. On these demyelinated areas, lesions known as ""plaque"" develop. The plaques eventually turn into scar tissue, sclerosis, in many different locations, which is where the name ""multiple sclerosis"" comes from. Thus, people with MS are more or less walking around with scars on their nerves.""

Balcer, Elliot M. Frohman Objective: To study the relation of retinal nerve fiber layer thinning to clinical and physiologic measures of visual function in patients with MS or neuromyelitis optica and unilateral optic neuropathy. Methods: We studied a cohort of control subjects (n = 64) and patients (n = 24) with evidence of unilateral thinning of their average retinal nerve fiber layer as measured by optical coherence tomography in order to characterize the relationship between ganglion cell axonal degeneration and its impact upon vision and pupillary light reflex metrics using infrared pupillometry. Results: When compared to the normal fellow eye, and with respect to normal subjects' eyes, we confirmed significant abnormalities in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, total macular volume, lowcontrast letter acuity, and pupillary reflex metrics in the eye with the thinner retinal nerve fiber layer. For each .5% change in pupil diameter, there was a corresponding 7.1 μm reduction in the average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. There was a significant difference between the pupillary metric of percent change in diameter and a decrease in low-contrast letter acuity (P < 0.001). Each .5% change in pupil diameter was associated with a substantial 3.4 line loss of low-contrast letter acuity (P < 0.001). Each .5% change in pupil diameter was associated with a 0.2 mm2 decrease in total macular volume (P < 0.001). Conclusion: These findings further corroborate the hypothesis that the retina can be utilized as a model to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of axonal and neurodegeneration, and the corresponding impact of these processes upon the pathophysiology of MS and related disorders.

45b3d808-7efe-412f-a015-8cb7d28d39ac,"New nanobiosensor can help diagnose early-stage multiple sclerosis Researchers at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) in Sorocaba (state of São Paulo, Brazil) have developed a technique to diagnose early-stage multiple sclerosis, a disease of the central nervous system, and distinguish it from neuromyelitis optica, a rare yet severe autoimmune inflammatory process also affecting the central nervous system. The immune system of a person with these diseases produces antibodies that attack and damage part of the myelin sheath, an insulating layer that protects nerves, including those in the brain and spinal cord, and aids the transmission of electrical impulses. Permanent lesions form in brain regions over time. Using a nanobiosensor originally developed to detect herbicides, heavy metals and other pollutants, the UFSCar group created a method for observing myelin basic protein (MBP) peptides interacting with antibodies in samples from patients under an atomic force microscope (AFM). Atomic force spectroscopy can detect the presence of specific antibodies for each of these two diseases in cerebrospinal fluid and blood serum. If the antibodies are attracted by the peptides deposited on the sensor during the test, this is a sign that the patient has the disease. The device is highly sensitive and can detect a small amount of antibodies, so the method can diagnose the disease at an early stage."" Fabio de Lima Leite, researcher in UFSCar's Science and Technology for Sustainability Center and last author of an article on the method published in Leite began researching nanobiosensors over ten years ago with a Young Investigator Grant from FAPESP and has since continued to study the subject as a principal investigator for UFSCar's Nanoneurobiophysics Research Group (GNN). His main motivation for shifting his research focus from detecting herbicides to identifying antibodies was the difficulty in diagnosing demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorders. Multiple sclerosis is usually diagnosed clinically on the basis of symptoms reported by the patient and by MRI scanning to identify lesions in certain brain regions. ""Our method is more accurate, avoiding diagnostic errors, as well as being cheaper. An AFM can cost about 20,000 dollars, whereas an MRI machine costs upwards of 400,000 dollars,"" Leite said. For researchers, the earlier these diseases are diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin with less risk of complications. ""There's no cure, but early diagnosis can give patients quality of life and better treatment,"" said Ariana de Souza Moraes, a researcher at UFSCar and a coauthor of the article. World’s largest proteomics centre accelerates biomarker discoveries to improve people’s lives Multiple fractionation approach for measuring cancer biomarker enrichment in exosomes New biomarker of Alzheimer's may lead to enhanced diagnostic methods In the study, the researchers used serum and cerebrospinal fluid from patients who were at different stages of multiple sclerosis and receiving treatment at the hospital run by São Paulo State University's Botucatu Medical School (FMB-UNESP) under the responsibility of Doralina Guimarães Brum, a researcher at the school, and Paulo Diniz da Gama, a neurologist affiliated with the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo (PUC-SP) in Sorocaba. The samples were purified by Luís Antonio Peroni's firm RheaBiotech with FAPESP's support under its Innovative Research in Small Business Program (PIPE). To develop the sensor, it was necessary to synthesize MBP peptides. This was done at the University of São Paulo's Peptide Chemistry Laboratory, headed by Maria Teresa Machini. ""The cerebrospinal fluid and serum were purified, leaving only antibodies in each sample. This enabled us to detect specific antibodies for multiple sclerosis, such as anti-MBP 85-99. If these antibodies are circulating in a patient, they probably have multiple sclerosis. Our next step in the study is to produce a sensor that doesn't require purified samples,"" Leite said. In another study published recently in , UFSCar researchers identified patients with neuromyelitis optica and distinguished them from patients with multiple sclerosis. ""A biomarker for the disease exists, so it was possible to detect the anti-aquaporin 4 antibody in patient samples by the same method as that used to detect multiple sclerosis,"" Moraes said. Neuromyelitis optica can currently be diagnosed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), a widely available method that is inexpensive and hence affordable for most patients. ""However, this method isn't as sensitive as the nanoimmunosensor and can't detect the disease in its early stages,"" Moraes said. Another advantage of the sensor is that it can distinguish the two diseases, avoiding a common diagnostic error. ""The two disorders have similar symptoms but different action mechanisms and treatments,"" Moraes said. ""An immunomodulator is recommended for one and an immunosuppressant for the other. An incorrect diagnosis can aggravate the disease. If a patient with neuromyelitis optica is treated for multiple sclerosis, optic nerve inflammation is accelerated and can't be reversed. The sensor is expected to represent a major advance for patients with demyelinating disorders.""

The plasma is then discarded and replaced with a colloid fluid, combined back with the cellular components, and returned to the same patient. The colloid fluid is typically a combination of human serum albumin and/or fresh frozen plasma. Typically, a large-bore, double-lumen catheter is used to provide a sufficient volume of blood to perform plasmapheresis over several hours. Q: Where is plasmapheresis used in MS and related disorders? Plasmapheresis is used as a second-line therapy (after systemic corticosteroids) in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses (or “attacks”) and other central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, idiopathic transverse myelitis, idiopathic optic neuritis, and neuromyelitis optica. Plasmapheresis is occasionally used inpatients who are intolerant of high-dose corticosteroids or who have medical contraindications to high-dose corticosteroids. Q: Are there clinical trials showing efficacy of plasmapheresis? Two controlled trials evaluated the effect of plasmapheresis. One study of 116 MS patients in an acute exacerbation randomized patients to 11 courses of plasmapheresis or sham treatment over eight weeks. This treatment was added to oral cyclophosphamide and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). There was no overall difference between the two groups, although there was a trend at one month in favor of plasmapheresis. A second randomized, sham-controlled trial evaluated 22 patients with severe deficits from a variety of CNS inflammatory disorders who had been refractory to high-dose corticosteroids. Those 13-NEU-536 Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research 216.444.8600 randomized to plasmapheresis were more likely to improve, and the improvement was sustained after treatments stopped. There is no set number of plasma exchanges performed, although typically patients receive between three and seven exchanges, each of which takes 2-4 hours. The number of treatments can be guided by the clinical recovery, or sometimes a preset number of exchanges are performed. For management of natalizumab-related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, five exchanges are recommended. Q: What types of patients are more likely to improve following plasmapheresis? A retrospective study found that 44% of patients treated with plasmapheresis had moderate or marked improvement. Improvement was more likely in a patient with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and Marburg variant MS. In addition, an improvement was seen more commonly in men, those with preserved reflexes, and when treatment was started within 20 days of onset. Another study confirmed many of these observations. At the Mellen Center, we consider plasmapheresis in patients with less than 1-2 months of severe neurologic impairment secondary to CNS demyelination or inflammation. Q: Is plasmapheresis used in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)? NMO is a rare (~1% the incidence of typical MS) inflammatory disease manifest as longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, and occasionally atypical brain lesions. A highly specific auto-antibody to the aquaporin-4 water ion channel is seen in the majority of patients with NMO continued on next page 2 syndrome. High-dose corticosteroids are the typical first-line treatment for acute attacks of NMO, but corticosteroids are often insufficiently effective in NMO. Given the probable pathogenic role of antiaquaporin-4 antibodies in serum, it is not surprising that plasmapheresis has been reported to be effective in NMO. Repeated courses of plasmapheresis have also been reported to be effective in patients who did not respond to oral immunosuppressive therapies alone. Case series report improvement following plasmapheresis in patients with ADEM, too. Several trials have evaluated plasmapheresis in progressive MS. A meta-analysis of six trials found modest evidence for reducing the odds of worsening over 12-36 months. However, the control groups were not all comparable and other immunosuppressive treatments were administered, making it difficult to assess the efficacy of plasmapheresis. Given marginal data on efficacy, the logistical challenges of administering plasmapheresis, and the cost of plasmapheresis, we do not generally recommend plasmapheresis in the treatment of progressive MS. How is plasmapheresis used in the management of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? When PML is associated with treatment with a monoclonal antibody (i.e. natalizumab), plasmapheresis is typically recommended to accelerate the removal of the therapeutic antibody with the goal of accelerating immune reconstitution. This immune reconstitution is thought to help the immune system fight the CNS infection which causes PML. In the setting of natalizumab therapy, plasmapheresis has been found to accelerate the removal of natalizumab, accelerate desaturation of the α4-integrin receptors, and improve leukocyte transmigration across an in vitro blood brain barrier. However, it remains unclear if this treatment improves the ultimate outcome of PML in this setting. Plasmapheresis is a specialized medical procedure, typically performed in a dedicated plasmapheresis unit. It requires large-bore intravenous catheters to provide sufficient rate of blood flow through the machine. At our institution, Quinton catheters are typically used and have provided reliable intravenous access and excellent safety. Large-bore catheters are typically placed by Interventional Radiology. Outpatient treatment is possible, although most patients who need plasmapheresis for CNS demyelination are hospitalized because of the complications of their underlying condition. Because there are few randomized trials of plasmapheresis, insurance coverage of the procedure is sometimes difficult. Several reactions may occur during plasma exchange, including fainting, dizziness, or nausea, all of which are caused by hypotension. To reduce the risk of hypotension, patients should be encouraged to drink 6-8 glasses of non-caffeinated fluids each day starting three days before the first treatment. Rarely, patients report paresthesias because of a reaction to the blood thinner, which is treated with extra calcium. Fatigue is sometimes reported by patients after plasma exchange, but typically goes away the next day. Other risks include bleeding or an allergic reaction (itching, wheezing, or rash) to the solutions used to replace the plasma or the sterilizing agents used for the tubing. Excessive suppression of the immune system can temporarily occur due to plasma exchange, which can increase the risk of infection. Rarely, the blood may clot in the machine, making return to the patient impossible. Very rarely, deaths have been reported with plasma exchange, usually from infection or the underlying condition for which plasma exchange treatment was used. Weiner H, Dau P, Khatri B, et al.

Filippi OBJECTIVE: To determine the functional and structural substrates of motor network dysfunction in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: Using a 3-T scanner, in 12 right-handed RRMS patients and 14 matched controls, we acquired diffusion tensor (DT) MRI and functional MRI during the performance of a simple motor task with the right (R) hand. Using DT MRI tractography, we calculated DT-derived metrics from several motor and nonmotor white matter (WM) fiber bundles. Functional connectivity analysis was performed using SPM2. RESULTS: Compared with control, MS patients had abnormal DT MRI metrics of all the WM bundles studied. Compared with controls, MS patients had more significant activations of the left (L) supplementary motor area (SMA), the L primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), and the R cerebellum. They also had increased functional connectivity between the R primary SMC and the R cerebellum (p = 0.01) and the L SMA and the L primary SMC (p = 0.04). Coefficients of altered connectivity were correlated with structural MRI metrics of tissue damage of the corticospinal and the dentatorubrothalamic tract (r values ranging from -0.73 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The correlations found between measures of functional connectivity and structural damage to some of the major brain motor white matter bundles suggest an adaptive role of functional connectivity changes in limiting the clinical consequences of structural damage in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Combining measures of altered functional and structural connectivities of specific brain networks is a promising tool to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for clinical manifestations of CNS damage. https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000295504.92020.ca Dive into the research topics of 'Altered functional and structural connectivities in patients with MS: A 3-T study'.

METHODS: Using a 3-T scanner, in 12 right-handed RRMS patients and 14 matched controls, we acquired diffusion tensor (DT) MRI and functional MRI during the performance of a simple motor task with the right (R) hand. Using DT MRI tractography, we calculated DT-derived metrics from several motor and nonmotor white matter (WM) fiber bundles. Functional connectivity analysis was performed using SPM2. RESULTS: Compared with control, MS patients had abnormal DT MRI metrics of all the WM bundles studied. Compared with controls, MS patients had more significant activations of the left (L) supplementary motor area (SMA), the L primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), and the R cerebellum. They also had increased functional connectivity between the R primary SMC and the R cerebellum (p = 0.01) and the L SMA and the L primary SMC (p = 0.04). Coefficients of altered connectivity were correlated with structural MRI metrics of tissue damage of the corticospinal and the dentatorubrothalamic tract (r values ranging from -0.73 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The correlations found between measures of functional connectivity and structural damage to some of the major brain motor white matter bundles suggest an adaptive role of functional connectivity changes in limiting the clinical consequences of structural damage in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

Some of the twins with no MS symptoms showed some signs of MS-like brain lesions on MRI, and their immune profiles mimicked those of people in early stages of MS. These findings add to mounting evidence that the onset of MS is preceded by “silent” disease activity. Understanding these early signals can yield new strategies for treating and preventing disease. There is mounting evidence that MS begins below the surface, often long before any signs or symptoms emerge. Defining the constellation of hidden signals and biological markers of this MS “prodrome” will eventually enable earlier detection and treatment to prevent full-blown MS, and can also provide clues to the underlying causes of MS. This team studied a unique population of 43 sets of identical (monozygotic) twins, in which one twin had MS and the other did not. Using advanced technology allowing researchers to analyze numerous immune cells at high resolution simultaneously, they found that the so-called “immune signatures” – the pattern of immune cells – was remarkably similar between twins affected by MS and those unaffected. The team also studied twins who did not have symptoms of MS for the presence of disease activity on MRI scans, indicating increased risk of developing MS. In the subgroup of people with this activity, the researchers identified a subtle, but distinct pattern of immune cells (CD4+ T cells) known for launching immune attacks, which matched immune profiles of an unrelated group of people in early stages of MS. This study yields important clues to what might be the earliest signals of MS. Understanding these signals is the first step toward addressing them with treatment and prevention strategies.   “Immune signatures of prodromal multiple sclerosis in monozygotic twins” was published by Lisa Ann Gordes (Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München) and Luisa Klotz (University Hospital Münster) and colleagues in (published online August 17, 2020). Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

Sicotte BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging can be used to measure structural changes in the brains of individuals with multiple sclerosis and is essential for diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and therapy evaluation. The North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis Cooperative steering committee developed a uniform high-resolution 3T MR imaging protocol relevant to the quantification of cerebral lesions and atrophy and implemented it at 7 sites across the United States. To assess intersite variability in scan data, we imaged a volunteer with relapsing-remitting MS with a scan-rescan at each site. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All imaging was acquired on Siemens scanners (4 Skyra, 2 Tim Trio, and 1 Verio). Expert segmentations were manually obtained for T1-hypointense and T2 (FLAIR) hyperintense lesions. Several automated lesion-detection and whole-brain, cortical, and deep gray matter volumetric pipelines were applied. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess variability across sites, as well as systematic biases in the volumetric measurements that were site-related. RESULTS: Systematic biases due to site differences in expert-traced lesion measurements were significant (P < .01 for both T1 and T2 lesion volumes), with site explaining >90% of the variation (range, 13.0 -16.4 mL in T1 and 15.9 -20.1 mL in T2) in lesion volumes. Site also explained>80% of the variation in most automated volumetric measurements. Output measures clustered according to scanner models, with similar results from the Skyra versus the other 2 units. CONCLUSIONS: Even in multicenter studies with consistent scanner field strength and manufacturer after protocol harmonization, systematic differences can lead to severe biases in volumetric analyses.

Output measures clustered according to scanner models, with similar results from the Skyra versus the other 2 units. CONCLUSIONS: Even in multicenter studies with consistent scanner field strength and manufacturer after protocol harmonization, systematic differences can lead to severe biases in volumetric analyses.

Methods: This is a prospective study of 517 actively managed MS patients enrolled at a single center. Results: More than 91% of patients were retained, with data ascertained up to 10 years after the baseline visit. At this last assessment, neurologic disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was stable or improved compared to baseline in 41% of patients. Subjects with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) by clinical and MRI criteria during the first 2 years had long-term outcomes that were no different from those of the cohort as a whole. 25-OH vitamin D serum levels were inversely associated with short-term MS disease activity; however, these levels had no association with long-term disability. At a median time of 16.8 years after disease onset, 10.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.2–14%) of patients reached an EDSS ≥ 6, and 18.1% (95% CI = 13.5–22.5%) evolved from relapsing MS to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Interpretation: Rates of worsening and evolution to SPMS were substantially lower when compared to earlier natural history studies. Notably, the NEDA 2-year endpoint was not a predictor of long-term stability. Finally, the data call into question the utility of annual MRI assessments as a treat-to-target approach for MS care.

eb43f6c3-5cc6-4af1-b345-28f1fc1a853d,"Researchers identify a promising method to treat multiple sclerosis Seema Tiwari-Woodruff, a professor of biomedical sciences in the School of Medicine at the University of California, Riverside, and her colleagues have received a grant of $373,000 from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society for a project in which her lab will select the five best candidate compounds to speed up nerve impulses, a promising new avenue to treat multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis, a leading cause of neurological disability affecting roughly 2.3 million people worldwide, is triggered when the immune system attacks and damages the myelin sheath. Earlier research in Tiwari-Woodruff's lab showed the ligand chloroindazome (IndCl) and its analogues are able to remyelinate -- add new myelin to -- damaged axons. Remyelination of axons speeds up nerve impulses, suggesting IndCl and similar drugs may represent a promising new avenue of treating the underlying loss of myelin in multiple sclerosis. Tiwari-Woodruff's collaborators are John Katzenellenbogen at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Scott Eliasof at Frequency Therapeutics. The project, titled ""Remyelination and Immunomodulation with analogues of Chloroindazole,"" will analyze compounds for , potency, and dosing schedule, after evaluating their pathology, immunology, and functional remyelination outcomes in mouse models of multiple sclerosis. Eventually, we will evaluate the safety pharmacology of two compounds with the best efficacy, pharmacokinetics and central nervous system exposure. Our overall goals through this Fast Forward grant, organized together with our commercial partner, Frequency Therapeutics, are tightly focused on obtaining critical safety and efficacy information on a set of verified candidates needed to identify the best of IndCl analogues."" Seema Tiwari-Woodruff, Professor of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of California, Riverside New therapy may help treat or prevent multiple sclerosis Simple sugar in human breast milk can promote myelin repair in multiple sclerosis patients New approach can help identify novel treatments for autoimmune diseases Specifically, IndCl stimulates ERβ, an estrogen receptor in the body. Because ERβ is present not only in oligodendrocytes, the mylenating cells of the central nervous system, but also microglia, neurons, and T-cells, IndCl may have therapeutic benefits for other autoimmune and demyelinating diseases in addition to multiple sclerosis. Tiwari-Woodruff explained that pharmaceutical agents currently approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis reduce relapse rates but do not prevent neurodegeneration or initiate myelin repair. ""Accumulating evidence indicates that estrogens are both neuroprotective and immunomodulatory, thereby making them attractive candidates to fulfill these needs,"" she said. ""However, although estrogens display immense potential for treating multiple sclerosis, they possess several deleterious side effects, including male feminization and increasing risk of breast and endometrial cancers. Our research has focused on the development of ERβ-selective compounds for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that would be most suitable for commercial development."" The two-year grant will support a lab technician and, partially, a postdoctoral researcher.

54577771-adaf-4cdb-a0c1-bac3dd4075c4,"The first three long-term treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) became available in the early to mid 1990s and were dubbed the “A-B-C” drugs because of their brand names: , , and . These are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate, respectively. In 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved another interferon, (interferon beta-1a), for the long-term treatments of MS. This is the same drug as Avonex, but is injected differently and in more frequent and higher doses. In 2009, (interferon beta-1b) was also approved. This is the same medicinal product as Betaseron and is given in the same doses, but is marketed under a different brand name and by a different pharmaceutical company. In 2014, (peginterferon beta-1a) became the 11th DMT approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) – and the fifth interferon medication approved for MS. Plegridy is a pegylated version of interferon beta-1a. Pegylation is a chemical modification of a molecule (in this case the interferon beta-1a molecule) that extends its half-life, which refers to how long a drug stays active in the body before it is metabolized or eliminated. While Copaxone (noted earlier) was initially approved as a daily 20-mg injection, a 40-mg dose of Copaxone injected three-times weekly was approved by the FDA in 2014; physicians and their patients may choose either dose regimen. In April 2015, (glatiramer acetate injection) was approved as the 13th long-term treatment for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Glatopa is a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection), given at the original 20-mg daily dose, and as of February 2018, was also approved at the newer, 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. This is the first generic version of a disease-modifying therapy for MS to be approved by the FDA. In October 2017, was approved at both the 20-mg daily injected dose and the 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. All eight of these self-injected disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) listed above are approved by the FDA for treating either relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or all relapsing forms of MS. Some of these DMTs have also been approved for “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS), which refers to the initial symptom a patient reports prior to a diagnosis of MS. Each of these treatments is administered by self injection at one’s home, with the frequency of injections ranging from once daily to once every two weeks, depending on the drug prescribed. These therapies have been used for several years and research shows that many people are doing well on these medications for extended periods of time (some for more than 20 years). Most side effects (such as flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions) are manageable through various strategies and over-the-counter medications. Blood tests may be given periodically to monitor various items, such as liver enzymes, the number of red blood cells and white blood cells, and the possible development of neutralizing antibodies* (please see note below). In May 2016, (daclizumab) became the 14th disease-modifying therapy to be approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS (RMS) in adults. However, please note that this medication was voluntarily withdrawn from the marketplace in March 2018 by its manufacturers and is no longer available to the MS community. This voluntary withdrawal was due to new safety concerns, including several cases of inflammatory encephalitis and meningoencephalitis (both forms of brain inflammation) that were reported in Europe, as well as earlier issues with liver failure. As background information, this monoclonal antibody was self-administered subcutaneously (under-the-skin) once per month and had been shown to reduce the number of relapses as well as new or newly enhancing lesions, as compared to another approved MS medication and to placebo, in two separate studies. This medication carried safety risks, which included liver injury and immune conditions. The FDA stated that Zinbryta would only be used in patients who had an inadequate response to two or more MS drugs. Zinbryta had a boxed warning, was available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, and monthly liver-function tests were required. In August 2020, the FDA approved (ofatumumab) for adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), which includes clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary-progressive disease. Kesimpta is a B-cell therapy, which binds to and depletes B-cells shown to be associated with disease activity in MS. Typically this type of therapy is only available via infusion at a hospital or infusion center; however, Kesimpta is the first self-administered B-cell therapy for MS. It is given monthly via subcutaneous injection at one’s home. The approval of Kesimpta is based on results from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, in which Kesimpta demonstrated superiority over Aubagio (oral teriflunomide) in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR), three-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 and new or enlarging T2 lesions. The most common side effects of Kesimpta include upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), with symptoms that include sore throat, runny nose, and headache, as well as headache not related to a URTI. Other serious but less-common side effects can occur. In 2000 (prior to the approval of some of the medications mentioned above), (mitoxantrone) was approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of MS. This was the first drug indicated for RRMS, secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and worsening RRMS. Novantrone has been used for many years to treat cancer. It is given via intravenous infusion once every three months. Side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, patients must be closely monitored and are limited to a maximum of two to three years of treatment with this drug. Because of the potential risks and with the approval of more long-term treatments for MS, Novantrone is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Anyone taking Novantrone now or given Novantrone previously needs to have (as noted in this advisory), even if no longer receiving this medication. In 2004, (natalizumab), was approved for relapsing forms of MS. It is administered via intravenous infusion every four weeks. After its initial approval, Tysabri was temporarily suspended after two individuals (taking Tysabri in combination with Avonex) developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which if not discovered early, is an often-fatal viral infection of the brain. Since that time, Tysabri has been re-approved and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” In 2012, the FDA announced that three factors have been identified with increasing the risk of PML for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) being treated with Tysabri. These include: (1) the presence of JC virus antibodies (detected through a blood test); (2) previous treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, such as Novantrone, Imuran, or Cytoxan; and (3) the length of time an individual has been taking Tysabri – specifically beyond the two-year mark. More details are included in MSAA’s article, In November 2014, the FDA announced the approval of (alemtuzumab) for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This is the 12th DMT to be approved for the long-term treatment of MS, and the third intravenous medication for MS. Given for a course of five days via intravenous (IV) infusion and followed one year later by a second three-day course, Lemtrada has been approved as a second-line therapy. This classification refers to a drug that may only be prescribed when other FDA-approved treatments fail or are not tolerated well by a patient. Lemtrada should generally be prescribed for patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more of the disease-modifying therapies, because of the medication’s safety profile. Adverse events from Lemtrada can include infusion reactions to the medication, an increased risk of infection, emergent autoimmune diseases, and other serious conditions. For early detection and management of these risks, Lemtrada is only available through a restricted distribution program, the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). REMS ensures that prescriptions are only given through certified prescribers and that patients are enrolled in this important safety and monitoring program. In March 2017, (ocrelizumab) became the 15th FDA-approved treatment, notably for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS has been approved for two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication has been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Ocrevus is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target CD20-positive B cells. These are a specific type of immune cell that is an important contributor to the MS-disease process. The fact that Ocrevus targets B cells differentiates it from most of the previously approved disease-modifying therapies for MS, which target a different type of immune cell called “T cells.” Side effects can include infusion reactions and an increase in infections. Other rare adverse events, including cancer and PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but these risks are still being investigated. The eighth DMT for MS is (fingolimod), which was approved in September 2010. Pronounced as “Jil-EN-ee-ah,” this is the first oral drug available for the long-term treatment of MS. Until this time, all of the other approved treatments were given either via self injections at home or infusions at a medical facility. The approval of an oral treatment provides a more convenient and comfortable option to some individuals, particularly if they do not respond to or are unable to tolerate the other approved medications. As with the other treatments, Gilenya also has potential side effects and adverse events, including a temporary slowing of the heart rate, edema (swelling) behind the eye, and liver changes. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In May 2018, Gilenya became the first DMT also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. At this time, Gilenya is the only DMT approved for this patient population, referred to as “pediatric MS.” In December 2019, FDA approved the applications from three separate pharmaceutical companies for the first for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS in adult patients. While generic treatments carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved medication, this approval does not include the treatment of children and adolescents. Details on when these generic versions will be available to the MS community have not yet been announced. In September 2012, (oral teriflunomide) became the ninth FDA-approved DMT for relapsing forms of MS — and the second approved DMT that is taken orally. Aubagio has been approved in two dose levels: 7 mg and 14 mg. While the higher dose (14 mg) shows greater effectiveness, for individuals who may be more sensitive to the drug and experience greater side effects, the lower dose (7 mg) may be more appropriate. In October 2014, Phase III data was added to Aubagio’s label, noting that it may (1) reduce the relative risk of sustained disability progression (along with reducing the annual relapse rate) and (2) prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) in individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Common adverse events include headache, elevations in liver enzymes, hair thinning, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia (a condition that reduces the number of certain white blood cells that normally fight infection), and paresthesia (tingling, burning, or numbing sensation). More severe adverse events include the risk of severe liver injury and the risk of birth defects if used during pregnancy. (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) was approved by the FDA as a first-line therapy for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS in March 2013. This is the 10th DMT for the long-term treatment of MS. Tecfidera is administered in pill form orally and is the third oral DMT approved for MS. The approved dosage is 240 mg to be taken two times daily. Clinical trials with Tecfidera showed a reduction in relapse rate, a delay in progression of physical disability, and a slowing in the development of brain lesions, as compared to placebo. The most commonly reported side effects are flushing and gastrointestinal events, occurring more often at the beginning of treatment, and decreasing in frequency after the first one to two months on this medication. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In August 2020, the FDA awarded early approval of (dimethyl fumarate), an oral medication approved in 2013 for relapsing forms of MS in adults (as noted above). This is the first generic of any MS oral treatment available to individuals in the United States. Generic treatments have the same active ingredients and carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved (brand-name) medication. Inactive ingredients can differ with generic medications, and generic treatments are not required to conduct the same degree of rigorous clinical trials prior to approval. Mylan’s generic version of Tecfidera is given in the same dosage, with both 120-mg and 240-mg delayed-release capsules available. In March 2019, (siponimod) oral tablets became the 16th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval includes individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) – a form of MS where someone with RRMS advances to experiencing a more steady increase in disability, but relapses are still occurring. Taken by mouth once daily, Mayzent has been shown to reduce the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), slow the rate of brain volume loss, and reduce the annual relapse rate. Headache, high blood pressure, and changes in liver function tests were the most common adverse reactions reported. Patients taking Mayzent need to be monitored for changes in vision caused by macular edema, transient decreases in heart rate, decline in lung function, and changes in liver enzymes; women who could become pregnant should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping treatment. Also in March 2019, (cladribine) oral tablets became the 17th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval is for individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and for individuals with active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. This oral medication is given in two annual courses for a maximum of 20 days over two years; no treatment is needed for Years 3 and 4. Mavenclad has been shown to reduce disease activity in patients with relapsing MS, including disability progression, annualized relapse rate, and MRI activity. Potential adverse events include lymphopenia, a condition that causes abnormally low counts of white blood cells that play a role in fighting infection, and herpes zoster infection. Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of malignancy (cancer) and fetal harm. The most common adverse reactions include upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and decreased lymphocyte counts. In December 2019, the FDA approved (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This approval includes the treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This medication is taken by mouth twice daily. Vumerity is in the same class of MS therapy as Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but is believed to cause fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects – such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. (ozanimod) was approved in March 2020 for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). This once-daily oral medication is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and joins two other previously approved S1P receptor modulators: Gilenya (fingolimod) and Mayzent (siponimod). However, unlike the first two medications, Zeposia does not require a genetic test or label-based first-dose observation. In clinical trials, Zeposia was shown to have a significant effect on reducing the annual relapse rate (ARR) as well as the number of brain lesions, when compared to Avonex (interferon beta-1a). The most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory infection; elevated liver enzymes; orthostatic hypotension, which is a sudden drop in blood pressure when changing position; urinary tract infection; back pain; and high blood pressure. Warnings and precautions include an increased risk of infections, heart-rhythm issues, liver injury, fetal risk if pregnant while taking Zeposia, a decline in pulmonary (respiratory) function, and macular edema (swelling behind the eye). The launch date for Zeposia has not yet been announced. In April 2020, the FDA approved (monomethyl fumarate) delayed-release oral capsules to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Bafiertam is a “bioequivalent alternative” to Biogen’s Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), which means that the active ingredient and site of action do not differ significantly between the two medications. The therapeutic effect is assumed to be equivalent. Since a lower dose of Bafiertam is equivalent to Tecfidera, this may potentially lead to a reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. However, these side effects have not been evaluated in clinical trials in people with relapsing forms of MS. The launch date for Bafiertam has not yet been announced. Individuals are usually prescribed only one type of DMT during any one time period. Several large clinical trials have been conducted to study each of these drugs separately for their safety and effectiveness in MS. Although differences exist in study design and specific findings, trials generally showed these common results: Reduced the development of new areas of inflammation as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans Showed some evidence of delaying disease progression and/or disability Some may prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) for individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS refers to individuals who do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed with MS, but have experienced symptoms. The documented effectiveness of each of these drugs varies to some extent, and differences can be attributed to the type of the drug, dose and administration, as well as variations in study design. Stronger drugs may offer greater effectiveness but may also pose greater health risks. Additionally, the effectiveness and side effects of each drug may vary from one patient to another, so individuals need to consult with their physician to determine which treatment might be the best option for them. Each of the approved treatments has side effects that are usually manageable. At this time, Novantrone is the only drug that has a set limit of doses, which is necessary to avoid cardiotoxicity (heart damage). Tysabri increases the risk of PML (described above) and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” For early detection and management of potentially severe adverse events, Lemtrada is only available through the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). Patients beginning on Gilenya are monitored for changes in heart rate and are given baseline evaluations for any issues with the heart, lungs, liver, eyes and vision, as well as white-blood-cell count. The other drugs mentioned earlier appear safe provided the person taking the drug is not experiencing any adverse effects and blood tests continue to be normal. While no damage to the reproductive system or the fetus has been observed, these drugs are not recommended if a woman is pregnant or considering pregnancy during her treatment period. Male patients considering certain long-term treatments may want to discuss options for family planning with their doctor. Other treatments are sometimes used to try to slow MS disease progression when other therapies have been ineffective. Such treatments are approved by the FDA for other illnesses, but not specifically for the treatment of MS. These include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy, methotrexate, azathioprine (Imuran), and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). In 2014, the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition (MSC) published two papers detailing the current evidence that supports the FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The first paper was written for medical professionals. The second paper summarizes the information and has been written for members of the MS community. To view either of these papers, please go to the following links: For medical professionals (updated June 2019): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence For members of the MS community (updated March 2017): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence; SUMMARY *Additional information about interferons: Some individuals develop neutralizing antibodies (NABs) to the interferons (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, and Extavia), but their impact on the effectiveness of these medications has not been established. Many continue to do well on these drugs despite the presence of NABs. Others may have sub-optimal results even without NABs present. The MS Council and the American Academy of Neurology have concluded that the higher-dosed interferons are likely to be more effective than lower-dosed interferons. Several factors, however, must be considered when selecting one of these drugs, and this decision must be made on an individual basis under the guidance of a qualified physician. Please note that MSAA does not endorse or recommend any specific drug or treatment. Individuals are advised to consult with a physician about the potential benefits and risks of the different treatment therapies.

eeb7650e-58a9-4e35-8150-9866f8531407,"— Investigational drug may have different GI tolerability than dimethyl fumarate by SEATTLE -- The investigational drug diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) reduced disease activity in newly-diagnosed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and in patients previously treated with interferons or with glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), interim results of the phase III study showed. In addition, adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events with diroximel fumarate were mild or moderate and led to treatment discontinuation in <1% of patients, said Sibyl Wray, MD, of Hope Neurology Multiple Sclerosis Center, in Knoxville, Tennessee, in a poster presentation at the (CMSC) annual meeting. Diroximel fumarate is a novel oral fumarate drug designed to rapidly convert to monomethyl fumarate (MMF) in the body. This may give the drug a different GI tolerability profile than (Tecfidera), which was approved by the FDA in 2013 to treat relapsing-remitting forms of MS. ""If indeed the data shows efficacy in phase III studies, then this new fumarate should offer an additional alternative to treat MS,"" said John Corboy, MD, of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, who was not involved with the research. ""Presumably, it should be similar in efficacy to doses of dimethyl fumarate that produce similar quantities of MMF after in vivo metabolism,"" Corboy told . In a collaborative effort with Biogen, Alkermes has of diroximel fumarate under the pathway which includes drugs that are not entirely novel molecular entities, referencing Biogen's prior dimethyl fumarate research. EVOLVE-MS-1 is an ongoing, single-arm, open-label, 2-year safety study that plans to enroll approximately 1,000 patients. Data presented at the CMSC meeting were interim results from 696 patients treated for a median of about a year. Participants were ages 18 to 65 years, had a confirmed relapsing-remitting MS diagnosis, and were neurologically stable with no evidence of relapse in the 30 days before screening. They received diroximel fumarate 462 mg twice daily after a 1-week titration period. Overall, incidence of GI adverse events in patients treated with diroximel fumarate was 30.9%. The GI events were generally mild (68%) or moderate (28%) in severity. They resolved in 88.8% of cases and led to 0.7% of patients discontinuing the drug. Flushing or flushing-related events also were reported by 44.3% of EVOLVE-MS-1 patients. They mostly occurred in the first month of treatment, resolved in 74.4% of cases, and led to <1% of patients discontinuing the drug. A post hoc subgroup analysis looked at efficacy in two groups: 82 newly-diagnosed patients who were naive to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), and 361 patients who previously had been treated with interferon or glatiramer acetate at any time since diagnosis. Overall, 17.1% of newly diagnosed and 19.4% of previously treated patients discontinued diroximel fumarate treatment. In newly-diagnosed patients, treatment with diroximel fumarate led to an adjusted annualized relapse rate of 0.19, representing an 83.3% risk reduction compared with the 12 months before the start of the study. By week 48, 87% of these patients were relapse-free. Mean disability scores remained stable over the first year. The mean gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesion count was 2.2 at baseline and 0.1 at week 48. Among patients who previously had used interferon or glatiramer acetate, treatment with diroximel fumarate led to an adjusted annualized relapse rate of 0.18, a 71.9% decrease from the 12 months before the study start. By week 48, 89% of these patients were relapse-free (compared with 51% in the 12 months before the study started) and mean disability scores were stable. The mean Gd+ lesion count was 1.1 at baseline and 0.4 at week 48. An FDA decision about diroximel fumarate is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the ongoing Alkermes and Biogen also are comparing the GI tolerability profile of diroximel fumarate against dimethyl fumarate, with results expected later this year. The research was sponsored by Biogen and Alkermes. Wray disclosed relevant relationships with Biogen, EMD Serono, Genentech-Roche, Sanofi-Genzyme, Alkermes, Celgene, Novartis, and TG Therapeutics.

8fb626b8-5670-4387-bfc3-d7f0bb3c2c4c,"Originally published September 29 2015 Multiple sclerosis, and vitamin D, B12 deficiencies by Michael Edwards (NaturalNews) All nutrients have a role to play in health. When we are found to be deficient in particular vitamins or minerals, it could be that we are not eating enough foods that provide them or our state of health may be such that we are unable to properly metabolize and process them.Many studies have shown that people with multiple sclerosis have lower levels of specific vitamins and other nutrients, especially vitamin D and vitamin B12.Those who have MS have low levels of vitamin B12 in their cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, or both. A vitamin B12 deficiency is often mistaken for MS.Studies have shown patients with MS given vitamin B12 supplements have experienced clinical improvements with symptoms. Those with MS are also likely to be low in other B vitamins and should consider a B vitamin complex with extra B12. It is always best to take a complex B rather than taking just one B vitamin for any length of time. B vitamins work together to perform many vital roles in the body.Foods rich in vitamin B12 include: If you are suffering from a digestive disease that inhibits absorption such as celiac disease or you are elderly, vegan, or vegetarian it may be difficult for you to reach your daily requirement of B12 without supplementation.Even if you are not aware that you have a digestive disorder, chances are you suffer from leaky gut syndrome if you have MS or any other autoimmune . Elimination of gluten from your diet, treating Candida overgrowth, and repairing your gut will go a long way toward your recovery from MS.The farther away a person lives from the equator, the greater the risk of developing MS, which suggests vitamin D deficiency may play an important part in the development of this disease.Study after study shows that when people are chronically ill they either are or they were deficient. Vitamin D is a hormone our bodies produce after we are exposed to sunlight.Vitamin D is stored in fat and released as needed, but this does not work right for particularly toxic people or overweight people and most of us in the modern world do not get nearly enough vitamin D in the summer regardless of our ability to store it. We certainly get enough in our diet to make up for our lack of outdoor .If you have MS you will likely feel an immediate improvement by supplementing with vitamin D. Avoid very high doses of vitamin D for long periods of time.We can also get vitamin D from the following foods:Vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiencies play a role in MS, but they are not the only causes of this disease. A is most certainly a big part of the problem with this disease, and diet management is paramount not only to manage symptoms naturally, but also to getting well.

30c124f4-0535-41d8-8afe-54d8b8ab9c54,"Bryostatin-1 alleviates experimental multiple sclerosis , Matthew D. Smith, Hasti Atashi Shirazi, , , Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder targeting the central nervous system (CNS). The relapsing-remitting phase of MS is largely driven by peripheral activation of autoreactive T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 lymphocytes. In contrast, compartmentalized inflammation within the CNS, including diffuse activation of innate myeloid cells, characterizes the progressive phase of MS, the most debilitating phase that currently lacks satisfactory treatments. Recently, bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a naturally occurring, CNS-permeable compound with a favorable safety profile in humans, has been shown to act on antigen-presenting cells to promote differentiation of lymphocytes into Th2 cells, an action that might benefit Th1-driven inflammatory conditions such as MS. In the present study, we show that bryo-1 provides marked benefit in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental MS animal model. Preventive treatment with bryo-1 abolishes the onset of neurologic deficits in EAE. More strikingly, bryo-1 reverses neurologic deficits after EAE onset, even when treatment is initiated at a late stage of disease when peak adaptive immunity has subsided. Treatment with bryo-1 in vitro promotes an anti-inflammatory phenotype in antigen-presenting dendritic cells, macrophages, and to a lesser extent, lymphocytes. These findings suggest the potential for bryo-1 as a therapeutic agent in MS, particularly given its established clinical safety. Furthermore, the benefit of bryo-1, even in late treatment of EAE, combined with its targeting of innate myeloid cells suggests therapeutic potential in progressive forms of MS.

Stadtler OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of interferon beta-1a (IFNβ-1a) combined with methotrexate (MTX), IV methylprednisolone (IVMP), or both in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with continued disease activity on IFNβ-1a monotherapy. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included RRMS, Expanded Disability Status Scale score 0-5.5, and ≥1 relapse or gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesion in the prior year on IFNβ-1a monotherapy. Participants continued weekly IFNβ-1a 30 μg IM and were randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial design to adjunctive weekly placebo or MTX 20 mg PO, with or without bimonthly IVMP 1,000 mg/day for 3 days. The primary endpoint was new or enlarged T2 lesion number at month 12 vs baseline. The study was industry-supported, collaboratively designed, and governed by an investigator Steering Committee with independent Advisory and Data Safety Monitoring committees. Study operations, MRI analyses, and aggregated data were managed by an academic coordinating center. RESULTS: The 313 participants had clinical and MRI characteristics typical of RRMS. Combinations of IFNβ-1a with MTX or IVMP were generally safe and well tolerated. Although trends suggesting modest benefit were seen for some outcomes for IVMP, the results did not demonstrate significant benefit for either adjunctive therapy. The data suggested IVMP reduced anti-IFNβ neutralizing antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: This trial did not demonstrate benefit of adding low-dose oral methotrexate or every other month IV methylprednisolone to interferon beta-1a in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000341934.12142.74 Dive into the research topics of 'Results of the Avonex Combination Trial (ACT) in relapsing-remitting MS'.

761675ad-25ad-4cbd-8831-86f82f8ed4d1,"by There have been several new treatments for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis over the last few years, but no drugs have been approved to treat the more severe form of the disease, progressive MS. In this exclusive video, , of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, discusses the treatment landscape for progressive forms of MS. The single, largest, unmet need in treating multiple sclerosis at this point, which is the last quarter of 2016, is treatment of progressive disease. We have over a dozen therapies for treating relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, and we've been very successful at doing that, having therapies since 1993. At the present time, there's no approved therapy for treating progressive disease. We've got lots of clinical trials, which we could talk about, but that's our largest unmet need. Treating progressive MS has been more difficult because we don't have a clear understanding of what's driving progression in MS. We have a pretty good understanding that relapsing forms of MS are inflammation, periodic flare-ups of the inflammation, and by suppressing that inflammation, we can suppress those flare-ups and have a very good outcome. In progressive disease, it's unclear what role is being played by inflammation, although we have a pretty good idea inflammation is a part of the disease process, but also what part is due to underlying neurodegeneration? So the treatment strategies that are being employed, tested, are things turning off the inflammation more long-term in progressive patients, but also attempting to treat the underlying degenerative aspect of the disease. But it's more complicated. It's harder to measure changes in progressive patients than it is in, say, relapsing patients. The biggest challenge in developing drugs for treating progressive MS relates to, again, our lack of a full understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic process. The other problem is that progression tends to occur rather slowly, and so it takes longer to do the clinical trials. We can get a proof-of-concept answer for an anti-inflammatory agent for treating relapsing MS in a six-month study. We don't have the same sort of confident proof-of-principle metric for looking at progressive MS. We're trying to employ brain volume or subsets of brain volume, but even there, it's almost surely going to take longer than six months. Hopefully a year, but it's unclear. Then when you get into the pivotal type trials where you want to really provide good evidence that a drug works with a clinical outcome, two years had been our standard in relapsing forms of MS. That may not be long enough in progressive forms of MS, so we're looking at alternative treatment designs such as longer designs going out through three years or event-driven designs, where you do the study as long as it takes to have X number of events, which is the number that you hope will be able to define a treatment's success. The approach that's being taken for trying to treat progressive disease is several layered. One is there are studies going on looking at anti-inflammatory agents, and we've had some successes and some failures. We learn from each. So we had a study that looked at fingolimod, an S1P1 receptor modulator, which worked very well in relapsing disease. Looked at it in primary progressive MS and it didn't work, and it was a very good study, and so we learn a lot from negative studies as well. We have more recently a study of ocrelizumab, a B-cell inhibiting monoclonal antibody that has reported out a successful outcome. We're waiting for the publication of the paper, but it's in the hands of the FDA to see if they're convinced that there's enough data to approve it for use in progressive multiple sclerosis. It was tested in primary progressive MS. We have another study that has just been reported out of the meeting, not yet published, looking at an S1P1, so a next generation of fingolimod. It's a drug called siponimod that, again, reported out modest, but positive results in treatment of secondary progressive MS. On the other hand, we had a negative study with anti-inflammatory agent looking at natalizumab, a highly successful agent for treating relapsing MS. It didn't work for treating secondary progressive MS. So from that, we're getting some clues as to who might be the right population of progressive individuals to treat with anti-inflammatory agents. At the same time, other agents are being explored. For example, neuroprotective-type agents are being looked at. Early phase studies to see if they can have an effect on progressive MS.

Over 1,000 presentations covered virtually every aspect of MS research. Among these were the latest results from trials of emerging therapies, nervous system repair and rehabilitative strategies, studies furthering our understanding of progressive MS, and much more. Access research news, blogs, a Webcast, and other updates from the meeting -- including a special announcement of the first research projects launched by the international . Below are a few highlights from the many presentations focusing on stopping MS, restoring function, and ending MS forever. In most cases, studies presented are considered preliminary. Many results will be analyzed more thoroughly, and usually published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Many studies were presented related to investigational therapies moving through the development pipeline, and others explored benefits and safety of currently available therapies. – A concentrated (high-yield) formulation of Daclizumab (Biogen Idec and AbbVie) targets the immune attack in MS. More than 1,800 participants with relapsing-remitting MS received either DAC HYP injected under the skin once every four weeks, or Avonex® (interferon beta, Biogen Idec) injected once weekly, for 96 to 144 weeks. The annual relapse rate (the primary endpoint of the study) was reduced by 45% in the DAC HYP group over Avonex, and disease activity on MRI was reduced by 54%. There was no apparent reduction in progression of disability. Serious infections, skin-related adverse events, and liver enzyme abnormalities were increased in the DAC HYP group. Biogen Idec and AbbVie plan to file for marketing approval in 2015. ( the abstract.) – To test equivalence of a generic form of glatiramer acetate, a clinical trial involving 735 people with relapsing-remitting MS was conducted. GTR (generic glatiramer acetate, Synthon BV) reduced disease activity on MRI scans similarly to Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd). Participants were randomly assigned to receive GTR (20 mg/day injected under the skin), Copaxone (20 mg/day injected under the skin), or inactive placebo (injected daily under the skin) for nine months. Disease activity on MRI brain scans, the primary endpoint of the study, was equally reduced in both the Synthon GTR and the Copaxone groups. Clinical outcomes and safety/tolerability were similar as well. ( the abstract.) -- RPC1063 (Receptos, Inc.) is an investigational therapy similar to fingolimod, but which appears selective in its activity while it inhibits immune cells from entering the brain and spinal cord. In a phase 2 trial, 258 participants with relapsing MS took oral RPC1063 (.5 mg), RPC1063 (1 mg), or placebo. Results showed cumulative new, active MRI lesions were reduced by 86% in both RPC1063 arms over placebo between weeks 12 and 24 (the primary endpoint). The study was not designed to detect reductions in annual relapse rates. RPC1063 was deemed tolerable, with most common adverse events being respiratory infections, headache, and urinary tract infection. No notable heart, lung, eye problems or cancers were noted. A phase 3 study is ongoing versus interferon beta-1a. ( the abstract.) Dr. Victoria Leavitt (Manhattan Memory Center, New York) and colleagues compared the average core body temperatures (measured with an ear thermometer) of 111 people with relapsing-remitting MS to that of 85 people who did not have MS. The RR MS group had a higher average body temperature, and the researchers also reported that people with RR MS had higher body temperatures than people with secondary-progressive MS. The researchers speculate that higher temps reflect the inflammatory process in the brain, which is active in RR MS. Further research is necessary to determine whether body temperature is a useful tool for tracking the shift from RR MS to secondary-progressive MS. (Read abstracts and .) -- “Comorbidities” are medical conditions that can occur alongside MS, such as hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease. Dr. Ruth Ann Marrie (University of Manitoba) noted that these can play a role in disease progression, citing a 2010 study in which she and colleagues examined nearly 9,000 people enrolled in the , and found that these and similar conditions were associated with a substantially increased risk of disability progression. “Among people with MS, we have an opportunity to aggressively treat comorbidity and improve the course of disease,” she said. ( the abstract.) about managing MS and another condition. -- Cholesterol is an important component of myelin, the nerve insulation damaged by MS. Dr. Charlotte Teunissen (VU University Medical Center Amsterdam) reviewed the evidence that cholesterol may be a useful biomarker for MS progression, noting that high serum cholesterol is related to clinical signs of progression, such as reduced thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (in the back of the eye). Related to cholesterol is its metabolite (breakdown product) 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and its levels have been linked to brain tissue volume and also disease progression. Serum levels of this molecule change before the appearance of clinical signs in mouse models of MS. Dr. Teunissen is now funded by the international to search for such biomarkers. ( the abstract.) -- First results from a small, involving people with relapsing MS were presented by Dr. Jeffrey Cohen of the Cleveland Clinic. This was a safety trial of a strategy aimed at using people’s own stem cells taken from their bone marrow, called mesenchymal stem cells, to inhibit immune mechanisms and augment natural tissue repair processes. After the cells were grown and re-injected, the researchers reported finding no serious safety concerns or any uptick in disease activity. A larger, controlled study of this approach to test for benefits is in the planning process. ( the abstract.) -- Cell-based therapies represent a promising area of research for both slowing MS activity and for repairing the brain’s myelin that has been damaged by MS, although they are still experimental in MS. Finding good sources of and faster ways to produce them would help drive progress. One approach is to use a person’s skin or other adult cells and reprogram them to become stem cells (called “induced pluripotent stem cells”). Dr. Stefano Pluchino’s team (University of Cambridge, UK) and collaborators in Italy described a new process they successfully used to transform mouse skin cells directly into brain stem cells in only one step, rather than many steps previously required. ( the abstract.)  – Dr. Catherine Lubetzki (Salpetriere Hospital, Paris) described the chemical factors that can activate and recruit immature myelin repair cells residing in the brain (oligodendrocyte precursor cells or OPCs) to sites of MS injury. Some immune factors activate OPCs, and other proteins, such as semaphorins, guide them to where they are needed and increase myelin repair. She noted that new insights into these processes have led to lab testing of potential new myelin repair strategies which are being readied for testing in people. ( the abstract.) about research to repair the nervous system. – Dr. Laura De Giglio (Sapienza University of Rome, Italy) and team previously reported that Nintendo’s videogame “Dr. Kawashima Brain Training™” improved attention, processing speed and working memory in people with MS. Now they report that it also increased “connectivity” between areas of the brain, shown by functional MRI (which captures active images of the brain while a person is performing tasks). Further research in larger groups of people should help refine this approach for improving cognitive function in people with MS. ( the abstract.) -- Dr. Rob Motl (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and team explored the relationship between aerobic fitness and hippocampal volume in MS. The hippocampus – a region of the brain important for cognition and memory – has a role in transforming new information into long-term memory. Novel evidence showed an association between aerobic fitness and greater hippocampal volume. This work provides a stronger basis for examining aerobic exercise training as an approach for delaying or reversing shrinkage of the hippocampus in MS, which is exciting news for people with MS who struggle with memory loss. ( the abstract.) about rehabilitation research to restore function. ENDING MS – Finding and Understanding MS Risk Genes -- Dr. David Hafler (Yale University) delivered the keynote lecture on how to use risk genes as guideposts for understanding what goes wrong in MS, how to fix it, and even prevent it. He and others founded the International MS Genetics Consortium, a team that has revolutionized the study and understanding of MS genetics. He noted that there will likely be hundreds of MS risk genes uncovered. “Each by itself has a small effect on disease risk; but each interacts with the environment,” he noted. “These are not bad genes, and it’s not a bad environment – it’s a bad interaction.” ( the abstract.) -- Dr. Philip De Jager (Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston) presented the latest findings by the International MS Genetics Consortium from a National MS Society-funded study. The goal was to replicate and expand its pivotal genetics study . From cumulative studies involving over 80,000 people, Dr. De Jager announced that they have identified more than 159 genetic variations related to MS, and more importantly, have begun to identify the specific immune cells and proteins involved, and how much weight each one carries in terms of risks of developing MS. “We have created a reference map of MS susceptibility,” said Dr. De Jager. “Now we turn to the task of understanding the biology of MS susceptibility.” ( the abstract.) -- Dr. Noriko Isobe (University of California, San Francisco) and the International MS Genetic Consortium reported on how genes differ between African Americans and Caucasians with MS, following up on a . Seven novel genes were identified among African Americans with MS that were not uncovered in the larger gene scans. These results may help sort out why MS is often more severe for African Americans, and also may help identify the MS risk genes that may be most important. ( the abstract.) -- Dr. Jennifer Graves and the Network of Pediatric MS Centers reported on findings from an of what triggers MS in kids. They showed that low vitamin D status, which has been linked to MS risk, was associated with MS relapses only if kids have a specific immune gene (HLA-DRB1*15:01/03). Further research, which is underway, may shed new light on who may be helped most by vitamin D supplementation. ( the abstract.) – Because low levels of vitamin D have been linked to increased risk of developing MS, Dr. Marianna Cortese  (University of Bergen, Norway) and team wanted to know at what ages vitamin D supplements might decrease the risk of MS. They surveyed 953 people with MS and 1717 people without MS about their use of cod liver oil (a source of vitamin D) during childhood, adolescence and adulthood. They found that those who reported taking cod liver oil at ages 13-18 had nearly half the risk of developing MS compared to those who never took cod liver oil or who took it at other ages. According to this study, teen years may be the best time for vitamin D supplements to reduce the risk of developing MS. ( the abstract.) – Looking for links between dietary patterns and the risk of developing MS, Dr. Dalia Rotstein (Harvard’s Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston) and colleagues evaluated dietary habits reported by women involved in the Nurses’ Health Study (I and II), focusing in on any apparent differences between the 480 women who developed MS and those who did not. The researchers looked at five popular diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, and found that none were associated with higher or lower risk of developing MS. The need for more research on diet is one of the drivers of the National MS Society’s planned summit meeting on wellness research and programs. (the abstract.) Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

Rocca, Sarlota Mesaros, Elisabetta Pagani, Tatjana Stosic-Opincal, Katarina Kacar, , Domenico Caputo, Jelena Drulovic, Giancarlo Comi, Massimo Filippi Purpose: To apply voxelwise analysis of diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) tractography and T2-weighted MR lesion measurements to characterize intrinsic damage to the brain white matter (WM) tracts and the relation of this damage to the presence and location of focal lesions among the main clinical phenotypes of multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with institutional review board approval. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Brain dual-echo and DT MR images were obtained in 172 patients with MS (22 [13%] with clinically isolated syndromes [CIS] suggestive of MS, 51 [30%] with relapsing-remitting [RR] MS, 44 [26%] with secondary progressive MS, 20 [12%] with benign MS, 35 [20%] with primary progressive MS) and 46 healthy control subjects. Probability maps of the major brain WM tracts were produced. Between-group comparisons were assessed by using analysis of covariance. Results: Compared with the healthy control subjects, the patients with CIS had significantly increased (P<.001) mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in the majority of WM tracts. The primary progressive MS group showed diffuse increases in mean, axial, and radial diffusivity, with fractional anisotropy (FA) damage involving the majority of WM tracts. No relevant difference in diffusivity measures was found between the CIS and RR-MS groups. Compared with the benign MS group, the RR-MS group had reduced FA values in all WM tracts and decreased axial diffusivity in the majority of tracts. The secondary progressive MS group had pronounced damage to the majority of tracts and, compared with the benign MS group, pronounced FA alteration of the tracts relevant for motor impairment.

A small but significant difference was found in the response to measles between the MS and normal control groups but not between the MS and neurological disease control groups. In each of the groups, the response of both peripheral blood leukocytes and purified T-cells to measles was significantly less than the response to mumps or vaccinia. The lower response to measles was not due to the presence of blocking factors or to lack of antigenicity of the measles virus preparation used in the assay. These findings suggest that differences exist in the normal immune response between these viruses. Precise quantitation of the immunological response to viruses in MS and other disease states will depend on identification of the various functionally reactive cell populations.

8ee519d7-f582-4190-9cad-a75cec325d9c,"Low-Frequency and Rare-Coding Variation Contributes to Multiple Sclerosis Risk International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium Multiple sclerosis is a complex neurological disease, with ∼20% of risk heritability attributable to common genetic variants, including >230 identified by genome-wide association studies. Multiple strands of evidence suggest that much of the remaining heritability is also due to additive effects of common variants rather than epistasis between these variants or mutations exclusive to individual families. Here, we show in 68,379 cases and controls that up to 5% of this heritability is explained by low-frequency variation in gene coding sequence. We identify four novel genes driving MS risk independently of common-variant signals, highlighting key pathogenic roles for regulatory T cell homeostasis and regulation, IFNγ biology, and NFκB signaling. As low-frequency variants do not show substantial linkage disequilibrium with other variants, and as coding variants are more interpretable and experimentally tractable than non-coding variation, our discoveries constitute a rich resource for dissecting the pathobiology of MS.

77861db6-a8f0-4a6b-9ded-df166d22724f,"Highlights from The American Academy of Neurology’s Annual Meeting Highlights from The American Academy of Neurology’s Annual Meeting : For easier reading, certain definitions have been included within the text and are often repeated throughout the article. Additionally, for easier reading, a brand name of an approved drug is used versus the generic name wherever possible. This year’s American Academy of Neurology (AAN) meeting was especially exciting for multiple sclerosis (MS) clinicians and researchers. Results were presented from clinical trials that have been ongoing for the past three-to-four years, many of which focus on the ""new generation"" of oral drugs for managing MS progression. Studies have looked at the effectiveness and safety of the new agents, particularly as compared to the standard injectible drugs that became available starting in the early 1990’s. Data on these new agents have been released gradually as the studies progressed through the clinical trials process, and anticipation of the details from completed studies has been building. In the DEFINE Phase III study, BG-12 previously demonstrated significant reductions in the proportion of patients who experienced a relapse, in annualized relapse rate (ARR), and in disability progression, when compared to placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). These data were presented in late 2011 at the ECTRIMS/ACTRIMS meeting. (Please refer to MSAA’s for an overview of the ECTRIMS/ACTRIMS joint meeting highlights.) MRI results from the DEFINE study were presented at this year’s AAN meeting and focused on brain atrophy (shrinkage) as well as lesion volume as seen on MRI. After two years, brain atrophy, as measured by a decrease in the volume of brain tissue, was much less extensive in the groups receiving BG-12 twice or three times per day (""BID"" and ""TID""), with reductions in brain atrophy of 30 percent and 17 percent versus placebo. There was also a significant reduction in MS-related lesion activity in the treated groups. Clinical results were presented for the CONFIRM two-year Phase III study of 1,417 patients. The study compared BG-12 (given either twice per day or three times per day) against placebo and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) against placebo. The primary endpoint was the a ARR (relapse rate) at two years; secondary clinical endpoints included the proportion of patients who experienced a relapse, and disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS). Both dosing regimens of BG-12 significantly reduced the ARR compared to individuals taking a placebo, by 44 percent and 51 percent, respectively. BG-12 reduced the risk of relapse by 34 percent (when taken twice per day) and 45 percent (when taken three times per day) versus placebo, while Copaxone reduced the risk of relapse by 29 percent versus placebo. BG-12’s side effects were generally mild. These included skin flushing, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting, mostly during the first few weeks of treatment. These clinical and MRI data further support the earlier clinical data from the DEFINE study. They suggest that BG-12 has the potential to be a valuable treatment option for people with RRMS. The much-awaited full results of the Phase III CARE-MS 1 and CARE-MS 2 studies were presented at the AAN. Early results were first released in the fall of 2011 at the ECTRIMS/ACTRIMS joint meeting. : The CARE-MS I study compared the clinical and MRI results of treatment with alemtuzumab, to treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif) in patients with RRMS who had not received prior treatment with any disease-modifying therapies. Rebif was given according to the regular dosing of three times per week, while alemtuzumab was given intravenously for five days, and then a second time one year later for three days. CARE-MS I was a multicenter international trial. Data were collected for each patient during a two-year period from the time of the first infusion. Clinical Results: The ARR (relapse rate) was 0.18 (or slightly less than one relapse every five years) for alemtuzumab-treated patients. This was as compared with 0.39 (or slightly less than one relapse every two-and-a-half years) for Rebif-treated patients. This means that alemtuzumab reduced the ARR 55-percent more than Rebif. The proportion of patients who were relapse-free was 77.6 percent with alemtuzumab compared to 58.7 percent with Rebif. Alemtuzumab’s relapse reduction was significantly greater beginning the first year of study, with a relapse rate of 22 percent among alemtuzumab patients compared with 46 percent among individuals receiving Rebif. This relapse reduction further increased during the second year of study. Supportive analyses of the risk of severe relapses found that the risk was lower with alemtuzumab. Individuals taking alemtuzumab had a 64-percent reduction in severe relapses, and a 59-percent reduction in relapses requiring steroid treatment. The significant reduction in relapses with alemtuzumab compared with high-dose, high-frequency Rebif suggest that there is potential for alemtuzumab to be a meaningful addition to treatment options for RRMS. MRI Results: These clinical data were supported by MRI outcomes. Through Year 2, fewer alemtuzumab patients developed new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (areas of active inflammation and myelin damage in the brain) than Rebif-treated patients (15.2 percent versus 27.2 percent). Additional positive MRI data favoriting alemtuzumab include the finding that alemtuzumab reduced median T1-hypointense lesion volume (lesions with lower intensity) more than Rebif from baseline to Year 2. The volume of lesions with lower intensity was reduced by 21.6 percent with alemtuzumab, versus 1 percent with Rebif. This MRI data supports the clinical benefits of alemtuzumab over Rebif seen in previous comparative studies. CARE-MS II is the third study to compare alemtuzumab with Rebif (interferon beta-1a given subcutaneously). It was designed to evaluate the effect of alemtuzumab on relapse and disability as compared to Rebif in people with RRMS who had relapsed on prior therapy. The study design was the same as that in CARE-MS I. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the ARR and time to six-month sustained accumulation of disability as measured by the EDSS disability scale. The group treated with alemtuzumab showed a decrease in the mean EDSS score, versus a slight worsening of disability in those treated with Rebif. Approximately 29 percent of patients treated with alemtuzumab experienced a six-month sustained reduction in disability, as compared to 13 percent with Rebif. Relapse data showed that 65 percent of patients treated with alemtuzumab were relapse-free at two years, as compared to 47 percent with Rebif. These data also showed a 49-percent reduction in relapse rate as compared to Rebif. The adverse event profile was consistent with previous studies. A program to monitor for development of thyroid issues and immune thrombocytopenia was successful in early detection of these known complications from alemtuzumab. (Immune thrombocytopenia is a condition where the number of circulating platelets in the blood is reduced; symptoms include a tendency for bleeding and bruising.) Based on the data from these studies, it is expected that alemtuzumab will be submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the EMA (the European equivalent of the FDA) to approve its use in treating RRMS. [Update: On June 12, 2012, the parent company announced that alemtuzumab had been submitted to both the FDA and the EMA for approval in treating relapsing forms of MS.] The Phase III TRANSFORMS study of 1,153 patients with RRMS compared Gilenya to interferon beta-1a. Clinically, 83 percent of those on Gilenya were free of relapses as compared to 69 percent of the interferon beta-1a patients. There was no statistical difference between the groups in terms of disability progression. MRI measures showed 56 percent versus 49 percent to be free of new/enlarging T2 (more intense) lesions, and 90 percent versus 81 percent were free of Gd-enhancing T1 (less intense) lesions. As has been the case for the interferons and Copaxone, a pregnancy registry is ongoing to determine the effects of Gilenya treatment on maternal, fetal, and infant health. This six-year multinational study will include up to 500 women who were exposed to Gilenya shortly before or at any time during pregnancy. Based on data about cardiovascular risks, the United States prescribing information for Gilenya has been updated, adding new contraindications to treatment. These include a history or presence of cardiac conditions (such as myocardial infarction or stroke in the previous six months, second-and third-degree atrioventricular block, or other serious cardiac rhythm disturbances) or in patients treated with certain antiarrhythmic drugs. The updated prescribing information recommends that all patients starting treatment should undergo electrocardiography immediately before the first dose and at the end of the initial six-hour observation period, along with hourly measurement of blood pressure and heart rate. (For more information on Gilenya, please refer to MSAA’s online news article, """") Data were presented on two new investigational oral agents now in Phase II trials that have a mechanism similar to that of Gilenya (fingolimod). Both drugs were well tolerated and reduced lesions related to RRMS. It is hoped that these agents, ONO-4641 and siponimod (BAF312), will maintain or improve on the efficacy and safety of Gilenya. However, both were still associated with cardiovascular effects, such as bradycardia (slowed heart rate). No direct comparison to Gilenya has been reported as yet for these new agents. In the Phase 2 DreaMS trial, led by the University of Colorado in Denver, 407 patients with RRMS were randomly assigned to placebo or one of three different doses of ONO-4641 (0.05 mg, 0.10 mg, or 0.15 mg once daily for 26 weeks). Patients were included if they had EDSS disability scores of up to 5.5, had two or more relapses during the two years before the trial, or one or more in the previous year, or one or more gadolinium-enhancing (active) lesions within the previous three months. The primary endpoint was the number of T1 (less intense) gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI; secondary endpoints included new and enlarging T2 (more intense) lesions. All three treatment groups showed a substantial decrease in MRI disease activity as measured both by gadolinium-enhancing lesion numbers and new or enlarging T2 lesions. A reduction in the number of cumulative T1 lesions was seen from weeks 10 to 26 with each of the three drug doses relative to placebo. Compared to placebo, lesion counts were reduced by 82 percent in the 0.05 mg/day group; 92 percent in the 0.10 mg/day group, and 77 percent in the 0.15 mg/day group. The study was not designed to evaluate relapse rates or disability progression, but there was a statistically significant decrease in relapse rate with the 0.10-mg dose. Most of the patients have gone on to an open-label safety extension phase (where everyone is taking the active drug and no one is on a placebo). More safety data will be gathered and the drug is expected to advance to a Phase III study. Adverse events were similar to those seen with Gilenya, including bradycardia and lymphopenia (a reduction in circulating lymphocytes) in some patients. These were dose-related. Researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas reported data from a Phase II dose-finding study of siponimod in patients with RRMS. Siponimod has a relatively short half-life compared to Gilenya, which means that the drug does not stay in the body as long. Researchers hope that this will minimize cardiac issues. The trial had a complex design whose goal was to determine the most appropriate dosing regimen. One group of 188 patients received placebo or once-daily siponimod in doses of 10 mg, 2 mg, or 0.5 mg for six months. A second group of 109 patients were given one of two additional intermediate doses of 1.25 mg or 0.25 mg for three months. Patients completing the core study were eligible for a three-month extension. At six months, the proportion of relapse-free patients as compared to placebo was 84 percent for the 10-mg group, 92 percent for the 2-mg group, and 77 percent for the 0.5-mg group. In the placebo group, 72 percent were relapse-free. After six months, the ARR (relapse rate) was lower with the three higher doses than the two lower doses and placebo. Additionally, MRI findings indicated that treatment with siponimod was associated with a reduction in active lesions on MRI. The 2-mg dose reached statistical significance versus placebo, with a reduction in active lesions of approximately 80 percent. Tysabri is one of the eight FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies for relapsing forms of MS. A very small percentage of patients (approximately one in one thousand) taking this drug may develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious and potentially fatal condition. PML is caused by the activation of the JC virus (JCV), which typically remains dormant in those exposed to the virus, but may become active when the immune system is weakened (such as when taking a medication that suppresses the immune system). A blood test is now available to see if an individual has been exposed to the JC virus. Three risk factors have been identified for developing PML. The risk factors (now added to Tysabri’s label) are: The presence of anti-JCV antibodies, which identifies a previous exposure to the JC virus Longer duration of Tysabri treatment, especially for more than two years Prior treatment with an immunosuppressant medication, such as mitoxantrone (Novantrone), azathioprine (Imuran), methotrexate, cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), or mycophenolate. In a study of nine patients who discontinued the drug after testing positive for the JC virus, five experienced relapses within six months. Of those, three who returned to Tysabri and one who used an alternative therapy failed to return to the functional level they had while taking Tysabri. (For more information on these risk factors and the test for JCV antibodies, please refer to MSAA’s online news article, ""."") Rituximab has previously been shown to be effective in treating RRMS. A small German study of 15 patients (11 with SPMS, one with PPMS, and three with neuromyelitis optica) tested this monoclonal antibody, which selectively depletes a specific subpopulation of B cells (a type of lymphocyte, which are immune-system cells produced to fight infection and disease) . Primary endpoints were confirmed disease progression as measured by an increase in score on the EDSS disability scale and MRI indicators of progression. Secondary endpoints were ARR (relapse rate) and safety parameters. In all 15 patients, Rituximab reduced inflammatory brain lesions and clinical relapses. It also showed a stabilizing of EDSS and progression as indicated by MRI. This study was too small to provide statistical data, but testing in larger numbers of patients – especially those with PPMS rather than a mixture of diagnoses – would be of interest. The Results of the CombiRx Trial Show No Added Benefit Over Treatment with the Individual Drugs The CombiRx trial of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) and Avonex (interferon-beta-1a given via intermuscular injection) combination therapy in RRMS has been ongoing since 2005, involved 1,008 patients with RRMS, and many have been waiting with much anticipation for the results to be announced. Since the two drugs have quite different mechanisms of action, it was hoped that combining them might yield a significant improvement in clinical response. For the combination to be considered more effective, it had to be significantly superior to the more effective of the two monotherapy treatments (Copaxone and Avonex), and that was mostly not the case. Clinically, the combination did not outperform the individual drugs in rates of disability progression and time to first relapse. Changes on the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) did not differ between groups. (The MSFC is a scale that measures both lower and upper extremity function, as well as cognitive function.) No differences were seen in the percentage of patients experiencing a relapse over the course of three years, or the time to first relapse, in patients treated with either drug alone or with the combination. In addition, the combination did not show an advantage over either drug alone in several key radiologic (MRI) measures, including brain atrophy, the volume of normal-appearing grey and white matter, and T2 lesions. The only area in which the combination was slightly more effective compared to either drug alone was in terms of new lesion activity visible on MRI and the accumulation of total lesion volume. Ampyra™ (dalfampridine) is an oral, timed-release medication developed to improve the conduction of impulses between damaged nerves of the central nervous system (CNS). Ampyra was approved by the FDA in January 2010, after Phase III clinical trials showed that a greater number of individuals with MS experienced improvement in walking speed when taking Ampyra, compared to when taking a placebo. Ampyra is the first drug to be approved to increase walking speed in individuals with MS. Its benefits continue to be observed in clinical trials for up to five years in an extension study. This study has 483 patients, all of whom participated in a late-stage clinical trial with Ampyra. (For more information on Ampyra, please refer to MSAA’s online news article, ""Ampyra™ Approved to Improve Walking for Individuals with MS."") CCSVI (chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency) The evidence continues to increase that occlusions (obstructions) of the vascular system (CCSVI) in cerebrospinal veins (certain veins located in the head and neck) imaged with ultrasound and magnetic resonance venography do not appear to be related to multiple sclerosis. Reports from an ongoing study at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston showed that people with and without MS had abnormalities consistent with CCSVI, and that this abnormality was not more common in people with MS. The group used strict ultrasound criteria definitions, and concluded that their tests – neurosonography and magnetic resonance venography – did not support the concept that CCSVI is causally involved in MS. Shortly after the AAN meeting, the FDA issued an alert about risks, including death, associated with the surgical treatment of CCSVI. Further tests must be approved by the FDA for patient safety monitoring as well as rigorous measurement of any potential treatment effects. Further clinical trials are planned.

Baranzini, Philip L. de Jager, Multiple sclerosis is a heterogeneous disease with an unpredictable course and a wide range of severity; some individuals rapidly progress to a disabled state whereas others experience only mild symptoms. Though genetic studies have identified variants that are associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, no variants have been consistently associated with multiple sclerosis severity. In part, the lack of findings is related to inherent limitations of clinical rating scales; these scales are insensitive to early degenerative changes that underlie disease progression. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the retina and low-contrast letter acuity correlate with and predict clinical and imaging-based outcomes in multiple sclerosis. Therefore, they may serve as sensitive phenotypes to discover genetic predictors of disease course. We conducted a set of genome-wide association studies of longitudinal structural and functional visual pathway phenotypes in multiple sclerosis. First, we assessed genetic predictors of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy in a discovery cohort of 374 patients with multiple sclerosis using mixed-effects models adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, optic neuritis and genetic ancestry and using a combination of single-variant and network-based analyses. For candidate variants identified in discovery, we conducted a similar set of analyses of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer thinning in a replication cohort (n = 376). Second, we assessed genetic predictors of sustained loss of 5-letters in low-contrast letter acuity in discovery (n = 582) using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. We then evaluated candidate variants/pathways in a replication cohort. (n = 253). Results of both studies revealed novel subnetworks highly enriched for connected genes in early complement activation linked to measures of disease severity. Within these networks, C3 was the gene most strongly associated with ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy (P = 0.004) and C1QA and CR1 were top results in analysis of sustained low-contrast letter acuity loss. Namely, variant rs158772, linked to C1QA, and rs61822967, linked to CR1, were associated with 71% and 40% increases in risk of sustained LCLA loss, respectively, in meta-analysis pooling discovery and replication cohorts (rs158772: hazard ratio: 1.71; 95% confidence interval 1.30–2.25; P = 1.3 × 10; rs61822967: hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.16–1.68; P = 4.1 × 10). In conclusion, early complement pathway gene variants were consistently associated with structural and functional measures of multiple sclerosis severity. These results from unbiased analyses are strongly supported by several prior reports that mechanistically implicated early complement factors in neurodegeneration.

N2 - Multiple sclerosis is a heterogeneous disease with an unpredictable course and a wide range of severity; some individuals rapidly progress to a disabled state whereas others experience only mild symptoms. Though genetic studies have identified variants that are associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, no variants have been consistently associated with multiple sclerosis severity. In part, the lack of findings is related to inherent limitations of clinical rating scales; these scales are insensitive to early degenerative changes that underlie disease progression. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the retina and low-contrast letter acuity correlate with and predict clinical and imaging-based outcomes in multiple sclerosis. Therefore, they may serve as sensitive phenotypes to discover genetic predictors of disease course. We conducted a set of genome-wide association studies of longitudinal structural and functional visual pathway phenotypes in multiple sclerosis. First, we assessed genetic predictors of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy in a discovery cohort of 374 patients with multiple sclerosis using mixed-effects models adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, optic neuritis and genetic ancestry and using a combination of single-variant and network-based analyses. For candidate variants identified in discovery, we conducted a similar set of analyses of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer thinning in a replication cohort (n = 376). Second, we assessed genetic predictors of sustained loss of 5-letters in low-contrast letter acuity in discovery (n = 582) using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. We then evaluated candidate variants/pathways in a replication cohort. (n = 253). Results of both studies revealed novel subnetworks highly enriched for connected genes in early complement activation linked to measures of disease severity. Within these networks, C3 was the gene most strongly associated with ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy (P = 0.004) and C1QA and CR1 were top results in analysis of sustained low-contrast letter acuity loss. Namely, variant rs158772, linked to C1QA, and rs61822967, linked to CR1, were associated with 71% and 40% increases in risk of sustained LCLA loss, respectively, in meta-analysis pooling discovery and replication cohorts (rs158772: hazard ratio: 1.71; 95% confidence interval 1.30–2.25; P = 1.3 × 10-4; rs61822967: hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.16–1.68; P = 4.1 × 10-4). In conclusion, early complement pathway gene variants were consistently associated with structural and functional measures of multiple sclerosis severity. These results from unbiased analyses are strongly supported by several prior reports that mechanistically implicated early complement factors in neurodegeneration.

Zuppichini, Monroe P. Turner, Jeffrey S. Spence, , Darin T. Okuda, Bart Rypma The neural mechanisms underlying motor impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) remain unknown. Motor cortex dysfunction is implicated in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, but the role of neural–vascular coupling underlying BOLD changes remains unknown. We sought to independently measure the physiologic factors (i.e., cerebral blood flow (ΔCBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (ΔCMRO), and flow–metabolism coupling (ΔCBF/ΔCMRO), utilizing dual-echo calibrated fMRI (cfMRI) during a bilateral finger-tapping task. We utilized cfMRI to measure physiologic responses in 17 healthy volunteers and 32 MS patients (MSP) with and without motor impairment during a thumb-button-press task in thumb-related (task-central) and surrounding primary motor cortex (task-surround) regions of interest (ROIs). We observed significant ΔCBF and ΔCMRO increases in all MSP compared to healthy volunteers in the task-central ROI and increased flow–metabolism coupling (ΔCBF/ΔCMRO) in the MSP without motor impairment. In the task-surround ROI, we observed decreases in ΔCBF and ΔCMRO in MSP with motor impairment. Additionally, ΔCBF and ΔCMRO responses in the task-surround ROI were associated with motor function and white matter damage in MSP. These results suggest an important role for task-surround recruitment in the primary motor cortex to maintain motor dexterity and its dependence on intact white matter microstructure and neural–vascular coupling.

989f887f-2454-437a-bbeb-749abb921d96,"The FDA has approved Vumerity, a new drug to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Experts say Vumerity is effective and has fewer side effects than current medications. Biogen has set the annual price of Vumerity at $88,000, drawing criticism from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Biogen has released the annual price it will charge for a new oral treatment for relapsing forms of . The company said the price for Vumerity will be $88,000 per year. The company sent a statement to Healthline saying it is taking steps to make sure the drug is affordable for customers. “Biogen will work to maximize patient access to Vumerity through their insurance benefits, including potential value-based agreements with payers based on real-world patient outcomes,” the statement read. Biogen and Alkermes plc the approval of by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late October, making it the 18th FDA-approved treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The announced price tag brought quick criticism from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “Vumerity is an efficacious and tolerable treatment option for people with relapsing MS, but being priced only $500 lower than the least expensive oral disease modifying treatment does not show the commitment to affordable access that we had hoped,” Bari Talente, executive vice president, advocacy, National MS Society, said in a . She noted the price of Tecfidera, another Biogen treatment for MS, has risen $40,000 to almost $95,000 since it debuted in 2013. “We urge Biogen to publicly commit to keeping price increases lower than the rate of inflation,” Talente said. Vumerity is expected to be similar in results to but with fewer side effects. “Both drugs use a unique mechanism of action that is not offered by other treatments,” , a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center in Maryland and the vice president of healthcare access for , told Healthline. Past has shown that Tecfidera has success on multiple sclerosis with a 53 percent reduction of relapses, 38 percent reduction in the likelihood of disability progression, and 90 percent reduction on active contrast MRI lesions. However, “Tecfidera has bad side effects, especially in the beginning,” noted Costello. “Vumerity is different and has less gastrointestinal problems.” Costello explained that people with uncomfortable side effects may not adhere to a treatment. Considered a follow-up drug to Tecfidera, doctors predict better adherence with Vumerity due to the fewer side effects. The active ingredient in Vumerity is diroximel fumarate, which is rapidly converted to monomethyl fumarate in the body. Tecfidera is a dimethyl fumarate and also converts to monomethyl fumarate. “[The drugs] become identical in what they do in the body. But, how they get there is different,” explained Costello. “We expect Vumerity to provide the same benefits as Tecfidera, but we are waiting [on] results,” , neurologist at Missouri Baptist Medical Center in St. Louis, a trial site for the EVOLVE-MS study, told Healthline. Singer is also the director and founder of . “The research I presented at ECTRIMS in September 2019 showed approximately 30 percent of those on Vumerity had gastrointestinal side effects but less than 1 percent discontinue due to this side effect,” Singer told Healthline. “The full results from the EVOLVE-MS trials are pending.” Vumerity is approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS, and active secondary progressive MS. It’s not approved for primary progressive or secondary progressive MS that’s not active. But, “it may work for other forms of MS,” said Costello. “We want the DMTs to be a positive experience,” Singer said. “Vumerity provides another option for MS.” The drug’s warning label does include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) as a possible risk. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy. Gastrointestinal issues are common but not to the extent with Tecfidera. Other warnings are allergies, liver damage, and low white blood cell count. “There are very rare cases of PML with Tecfidera in MS patients with very low lymphocytes (white blood cell type) for numerous months in patients over age 50. Simple blood counts should be done to monitor,” said Singer. “The goal with Vumerity is to achieve success of Tecfidera with better tolerability,” explained Singer. Biogen offers customer-assisted programs to help reduce or eliminate costs. Costello explained that both Tecfidera and Vumerity have a unique mechanism of action, unlike any other drug. This provides people with options and different ways to reduce inflammation with MS. Treatment choices are up to doctors and their patients making a shared decision. Costello suggests talking about goals, risk tolerance, monitoring, and your ability to adhere to a specific treatment. “The disease, plus the person’s goals and values, is the conversation that drives the medication choice,” said Costello.

30ecc319-3294-4510-8bc8-e00e1d0bb333,"Fingolimod Increases Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Level Secretion from Circulating T Cells of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis     , –() The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis involves an autoimmune and a neurodegenerative mechanism. Central nervous system-infiltrating immune cells in multiple sclerosis also possess a neuroprotective activity through secretion of neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Fingolimod was shown to slow the progression of disability and loss of brain volume. The objective of this study was to explore whether fingolimod induces secretion of neurotrophins by immune cells. Blood was drawn from 21 patients before the initiation of treatment with fingolimod and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The levels of the neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, β-nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor were screened in the supernatants of separated T cells and monocyte cultures using a customized, multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels were further validated by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment with fingolimod significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion from T cells. A specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed these results in the supernatant of T cells after 6 and 12 months of therapy. T cells that reach the bloodstream of fingolimod-treated patients with multiple sclerosis may contribute to the neuroprotective effect of this therapy by increased secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This mechanism of action of fingolimod in patients with multiple sclerosis has not been previously reported. This is a preview of subscription content, .

Ziel war es, epidemiologische Daten zur Zahl an multipler Sklerose (MS) erkrankter Menschen, zur Verlaufsform der Erkrankung und zur Versorgungssituation in Deutschland zu erhalten. Nach Abschluss der zweijährigen Pilotphase wurden der Basisdatensatz modifiziert und neue Zentren rekrutiert. Diese Zentren erhoben zwischen 2005 und 2006 insgesamt 5 821 Datensätze. Nach einer zweistufigen Qualitätskontrolle konnten 5 445 Datensätze (93,5 %) ausgewertet werden. Im Durchschnitt dauerte es 3,5 Jahre, bis die Diagnose gestellt wurde. Mehr als 70 % der Patienten wurden immuntherapeutisch behandelt. Demgegenüber wurden symptomatische Therapien wesentlich seltener verordnet. Zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2006 nahmen 57 Zentren am MS-Register teil: 29 Akutkliniken, 11 Rehabilitationskliniken, 13 Schwerpunktpraxen und 4 regionale MS-Zentren. Das MS-Register liefert wertvolle Informationen über die Versorgungssituation von MS-Patienten. Diese Daten liefern die Grundlage für gezielte Maßnahmen zum Ausgleich von Unter- und Fehlversorgung und tragen dazu bei, die Lebenssituation von MS-Patienten zu verbessern.

Sie ist die Erkrankung, die im jungen Erwachsenenalter am häufigsten zu einer dauerhaften Behinderung führt. In Deutschland sind schätzungsweise 120 000 bis 140 000 Patienten davon betroffen; die genaue Zahl ist nicht bekannt. Ebenso wenig weiß man über die Verteilung auf die einzelnen Verlaufsformen oder den Schweregrad der dauerhaften Behinderung (). Trotz der hohen volkswirtschaftlichen Bedeutung mit Krankheitskosten von 40 000 Euro pro Patient und Jahr () ist die Versorgungssituation von MS-Patienten nur unzureichend bekannt. Deshalb ist auch unter gesundheitsökonomischen Aspekten und im Hinblick auf den zielgerichteten Einsatz begrenzter Ressourcen ein flächendeckendes Register wünschenswert. Eine systematische Erhebung existiert für Deutschland bisher nicht. Aus diesem Grund wurde unter Federführung der Deutschen Multiplen Sklerose Gesellschaft (DMSG), Bundesverband e.V. im Jahr 2001 ein MS-Register initiiert, das Querschnittsdaten zur Häufigkeit der Erkrankung und deren Unterformen in Deutschland liefern soll. Ferner erhofft man sich Aufschluss über die Verteilung innerhalb der einzelnen Schweregrade, den Einfluss der Erkrankung auf die Berufs- und Arbeitsfähigkeit und die Versorgung mit immunmodulierenden, symptomatischen und nicht medikamentösen Therapien. Nach der zweijährigen Pilotphase, an der 3 223 Patienten () teilnahmen, werden nun die Ergebnisse der Extensionsphase präsentiert. In der Pilotphase wurden alle MS-Patienten eingeschlossen, die in der Zeit vom 7. Januar 2002 bis 31. Dezember 2003 in den teilnehmenden Zentren behandelt wurden und die nach ausführlicher Aufklärung einer zentralen Auswertung des erhobenen Basisdatensatzes schriftlich zustimmten. Die Art der Datenerhebung, -speicherung und -auswertung erfolgte gemäß den aktuell gültigen Datenschutzbestimmungen der Bundesländer. Beteiligt waren 5 Zentren mit besonderer Erfahrung in der Betreuung von MS-Patienten, die unterschiedliche Versorgungsstufen und geografische Gegebenheiten aufwiesen und verschiedene Regionen Deutschlands repräsentierten (). Basierend auf den Erfahrungen der Pilotphase wurde die Eingabemaske () modifiziert. Dabei wurden Parameter entfernt, wenn sie entbehrlich schienen, oder ergänzt, wenn sie unvollständig waren, und präzisiert, wenn die Eingaben missverständlich aufgefasst werden konnten. Damit war der Basisdatensatz zum einen verschlankt, zum anderen aber auch ausreichend präzise und eindeutig. Das vollständige Erhebungsinstrument ist bei den Autoren erhältlich. Die Dokumentation erfolgte vor Ort in den Zentren durch die behandelnden Ärzte. Zur zentralen Qualitätskontrolle und Auswertung wurden die Datensätze pseudonymisiert und alle 3 Monate auf Datenträger zur MS-Forschungs- und Projektentwicklungs-gGmbH Hannover (MSFP) gesandt. Dort wurden Vollständigkeit (Alter, Geschlecht, Behinderungsgrad und Diagnosesicherheit) und Inkonsistenzen überprüft und auffällige Datensätze zur Korrektur zurückgegeben. Doppelte Datensätze, die im Erhebungszeitraum entweder in einem Zentrum mehrfach (Längsschnittuntersuchung) oder in mehreren Zentren konsekutiv (zum Beispiel bei akut-stationärer und nachfolgender rehabilitativer Behandlung) erhoben wurden, konnten anhand eines eindeutigen Schlüssels sicher identifiziert werden. Für die Querschnittsanalyse wurde nur der jeweils letzte Datensatz verwendet. In der zweijährigen Pilotphase wurden 3 458 standardisierte Basisdatensätze dokumentiert, von denen nach der Qualitätskontrolle 3 223 (93,2 %) für die weiteren Analysen verwendet werden konnten (). Seit dem 15. März 2005 nehmen kontinuierlich neue Zentren am Register teil. Zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2006 hatten 57 Zentren ihre Bereitschaft zur standardisierten Dokumentation erklärt (). Von 35 Zentren wurden bisher insgesamt 5 821 Datensätze erhoben (). Nach der Qualitätskontrolle standen 5 445 Datensätze zur Verfügung (93,5 %). Die übrigen teilnehmenden Zentren lieferten die Daten erst nach dem Stichtag, sodass diese für die Auswertung noch nicht berücksichtigt werden konnten. Da nicht alle Datensätze bezüglich aller Parameter komplett waren, ergeben sich für die einzelnen Auswertungen unterschiedliche Bezugsgrößen. Das durchschnittliche Alter (± Standardabweichung) zum Zeitpunkt der Erhebung betrug 44,2 ± 11,5 Jahre, im Mittel waren die Patienten 12,7 ± 9,2 Jahre erkrankt. Das Alter bei Krankheitsbeginn war 31,4 ± 10,2 Jahre (7 bis 75 Jahre), überwiegend manifestierte sich die MS zwischen dem 20. und 40. Lebensjahr (70 %), trat aber auch bei 9 Patienten erstmals vor dem 10. Lebensjahr (0,2 %) und bei 44 Patienten nach dem 60. Lebensjahr (0,9 %) auf. 4,9 % der Patienten erkrankten erstmals nach dem 50. Lebensjahr. Bei der Diagnosestellung waren die Patienten 34,8 ± 10,7 Jahre alt. Damit dauerte es durchschnittlich 3,4 ± 5,5 Jahre, bis die Diagnose „MS“ gestellt wurde. Dieser Zeitraum war auch bei Neudiagnosen ab dem Jahr 2000 nahezu unverändert (3,6 Jahre). Frauen waren 2,5-mal häufiger betroffen als Männer (72 versus 28 %). Ein schubförmiger Verlauf war bei 55 % zu verzeichnen, 32 % litten an einer sekundär chronisch-progredienten Verlaufsform, und 9 % hatten von Krankheitsbeginn an einen chronisch-progredienten Verlauf. Bei 1 % handelte es sich um eine Erstmanifestation. Der klinische Zustand war bei 16,9 % der Patienten im letzten Jahr stabil geblieben, wohingegen 17,1 % mehr als einen Schub beziehungsweise eine rasche Progression aufwiesen. Die Mehrzahl der Patienten (56,0 %) hatte eine langsame Progression beziehungsweise weniger als einen Schub pro Jahr. Die Verteilung der EDSS („Expanded Disability Status Scale“), die international standardmäßig zur Quantifizierung des Behinderungsgrades verwendet wird (), zeigt die . Die mediane EDSS betrug 3,5; 51 % der Patienten waren noch uneingeschränkt gehfähig (EDSS < 4), 28 % benötigten eine Gehhilfe, um 100 m weit zu gehen (EDSS ≥ 6), und 6 % waren ständig auf den Rollstuhl angewiesen (EDSS ≥ 8). Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, einen Behinderungsgrad von 4,0 beziehungsweise 6,0 auf der EDSS in Abhängigkeit vom Lebensalter zu erreichen, ist in dargestellt. Daraus lässt sich beispielsweise ablesen, dass 60 % der Patienten im Alter von 50 Jahren und 40 % der Patienten im Alter von 60 Jahren noch keine Gehhilfe benötigten, um 100 m weit zu gehen. Voll berufstätig waren nur noch 1 183 Patienten (27,9 %), 1 671 Patienten (39,4 %) waren vorzeitig berentet, 6,0 % arbeitslos gemeldet, nur 0,7 % führten MS-bedingt eine Umschulungsmaßnahme durch. Der Anteil der vorzeitig Berenteten war stark vom Lebensalter abhängig (). Die zeigt die Abhängigkeit vom Behinderungsgrad: Es ist auffällig, dass der Verbleib im Erwerbsleben zwar vom Schweregrad der körperlichen Behinderung abhing, aber ein nicht unerheblicher Teil (14,8 %) der vorzeitig Berenteten eine EDSS < 3,5 aufwies, also noch uneingeschränkt gehfähig war. Immunmodulatorische und symptomatische Therapiemaßnahmen 71 % der Patienten wurden immunmodulatorisch behandelt, dabei wurden am häufigsten die Interferone eingesetzt (). Die Eskalationstherapie mit Mitoxantron wurde ebenfalls vergleichsweise häufig angewendet. Andere Therapieoptionen inklusive intravenöse Immunglobuline wurden nur selten genutzt. 670 Patienten (20 %) wurden nicht immunprophylaktisch behandelt, dazu zählten vor allem sekundär chronisch-progrediente Patienten mit langsamer Progression. Allerdings wiesen auch 98 der immuntherapeutisch unbehandelten Patienten (14,9 %) eine rasche Progression beziehungsweise häufige Schübe auf. gibt einen Überblick über die Behandlung häufiger MS-Symptome. Vor allem die schnelle Erschöpfbarkeit („Fatigue“) und kognitive Störungen, obwohl oft vorhanden, blieben größtenteils unbehandelt. Demgegenüber wurden Schmerzen und Depression vergleichsweise häufig medikamentös therapiert. Ein erheblicher Anteil der Patienten, die an Spastik oder Blasenstörung litten, war weder mit medikamentösen noch mit nicht medikamentösen Maßnahmen versorgt. Nach dem erfolgreichen Abschluss der Pilotphase konnte in der nun folgenden zweiten Phase des Projekts die Datenerhebung ausgeweitet und in knapp zwei Jahren 5 445 neue Datensätze registriert werden. Charakteristisch für die MS ist das unvorhersehbare und rezidivierende Auftreten von Krankheitssymptomen („schubförmiger Verlauf“), mit dem bei 90 bis 95 % der Fälle die Erkrankung beginnt. In 5 bis 10 % der Fälle kommt es zu einer schleichenden Verschlechterung insbesondere des Gehvermögens („primär chronisch-progredienter Verlauf“). Nach etwa 10 bis 15 Jahren geht die MS bei 30 bis 40 % der Patienten nach initial schubförmigen Verlauf in die chronische Phase über („sekundär chronisch-progredienter Verlauf“) (). Die vorliegenden Ergebnisse zeigen im Vergleich mit der Pilotphase () einen höheren Anteil chronisch-progredienter Patienten und eine Verschiebung zu höheren Behinderungsgraden. Dieses Resultat dürfte in erster Linie durch die zunehmende Rekrutierung von Rehabilitationskliniken, aber auch niedergelassenen Praxen bedingt sein. Die hier dargestellten Ergebnisse entsprechen denen aus populationsbasierten epidemiologischen Untersuchungen (–) und unterstreichen, dass mit der Ausweitung des Registers zunehmend repräsentative Daten gewonnen werden. Während in früheren Untersuchungen zum natürlichen Krankheitsverlauf 50 % der Patienten nach einer Krankheitsdauer von etwa 15 Jahren auf eine Gehhilfe angewiesen waren, um 100 m zurückzulegen (EDSS 6,0) (, ), deuten neuere Untersuchungen mit einer medianen Zeit von 20 beziehungsweise 29 Jahren bis zur EDSS 6,0 nun eine weitaus günstigere Prognose der MS an (, –). Da der genaue Beginn der Erkrankung oftmals schwer festzulegen ist, ist eine Betrachtung, bei der man die Abhängigkeit des Schweregrades der Behinderung vom Lebensalter zugrunde legt, für die individuelle Beratung der Patienten hilfreicher. Im Alter von 50 Jahren beziehungsweise von 60 Jahren konnten noch 60 % beziehungsweise 40 % der Patienten eine Strecke von 100 m noch ohne Hilfe gehen, vergleichbar den Ergebnissen aus British Columbia, Kanada (). Im MS-Register war ein Großteil der Patienten bereits über mehrere Jahre immuntherapeutisch behandelt, sodass diese prognostisch günstigen Zahlen nicht den natürlichen Krankheitsverlauf, sondern eher den Verlauf unter der derzeitigen Versorgung mit krankheitsmodifizierenden Medikamenten und verbesserten symptomatischen Therapiemaßnahmen widerspiegeln. Trotz verbesserter technischer Möglichkeiten und neuer Diagnosekriterien, die prinzipiell die Diagnosestellung innerhalb eines Monats nach Symptombeginn erlauben (), ist die durchschnittliche Zeit von der Erstmanifestation bis zur Diagnosestellung mit 3,4 Jahren wie in der Pilotphase vergleichsweise lang. Dies betrifft auch die ab dem Jahr 2000 diagnostizierten Patienten. Es bleibt abzuwarten, ob durch die intensivere Aufklärung über Verlauf und frühe Behandlungsmöglichkeiten und mit der weiteren Umsetzung der diagnostischen Kriterien die Diagnose künftig früher gestellt und damit eine längere diagnostische Unsicherheit vermieden werden kann – wie es die Daten des NARCOMS-Register der nordamerikanischen MS-Zentren für andere Länder belegen (). Hier sei besonders an Hausärzte, Augenärzte, Orthopäden und Urologen appelliert, junge Patienten mit nicht eindeutig durch eine periphere Ursache erklärbaren neurologischen Ausfällen rasch einer neurologischen Diagnostik zuzuführen, um bei subklinisch aktivem Verlauf frühzeitig mit der erforderlichen Behandlung beginnen zu können (, ). Nach einer Krankheitsdauer von knapp 13 Jahren bezogen fast 40 % der Patienten bei einem mittleren Alter von 44 Jahren Rentenleistungen aufgrund einer Erwerbsminderung. Nur 28 % der Patienten waren noch in Vollzeit berufstätig. Ähnliche Zahlen sind auch aus anderen Untersuchungen bekannt (, , ) und – wie bei dem höheren Anteil schwerer betroffener MS-Patienten zu erwarten – ungünstiger als in der Pilotphase (). Der relativ niedrige Anteil an Arbeitslosen in der Gruppe der MS-Patienten im Vergleich zu der Arbeitslosenquote von 10 bis 12 % in der Gesamtbevölkerung dürfte widerspiegeln, dass in den Fällen schwerer Vermittelbarkeit bei eingeschränkter Leistungsfähigkeit die Indikation zur Berentung großzügig gestellt wird. Obwohl der Anteil der vorzeitig Berenteten erwartungsgemäß mit dem Ausmaß der körperlichen Behinderung zunahm (, , ), waren immerhin 15 % der erwerbsunfähigen Patienten noch uneingeschränkt gehfähig. Dies bedeutet, dass noch andere Faktoren als die körperliche Funktionseinschränkung für die vorzeitige Berentung verantwortlich sein müssen. Insbesondere kognitive Einschränkungen und die Fatigue-Symptomatik werden mit der EDSS nicht adäquat abgebildet, und gerade diese beiden Faktoren sind wahrscheinlich ein wesentlicher Grund für die eingeschränkte berufliche Leistungsfähigkeit (). Daher ist es dringend notwendig, die Ursachen zu identifizieren, die zum vorzeitigen Ausscheiden aus dem Arbeitsprozess führen und gezielte therapeutische Strategien zu entwickeln, um langfristig die berufliche Leistungsfähigkeit bei guter Lebensqualität zu erhalten (). Eine verlaufsmodifizierende Behandlung wurde – in Übereinstimmung mit der Pilotphase und dem NARCOMS-Register () – bei mehr als 70 % der Patienten durchgeführt. Knapp die Hälfte der Patienten erhielt eine immunmodulatorische Basistherapie (Interferon-b und Glatiramerazetat) nach dem Stufenschema der Multiple Sklerose Therapie Konsensusgruppe (MSTKG) (, , ). Der im Vergleich zur Pilotphase höhere Anteil von Mitoxantron- und regelmäßigen Steroid-Pulstherapien erklärt sich mit dem höheren Anteil chronisch-progredienter Patienten, bei denen diese Therapieformen die einzig verfügbaren Optionen sind. Da Natalizumab erst Mitte 2006 zugelassen wurde, sind bisher nur wenige Behandlungen damit dokumentiert. Andere Immuntherapeutika, auch intravenöse Immunglobuline, wurden nur selten angewendet. Art und Häufigkeit der eingesetzten Substanzen sprechen also dafür, dass die evidenzbasierten Empfehlungen der MSTKG, die mittlerweile in die Leitlinien der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Neurologie übernommen wurden (), tatsächlich im klinischen Alltag umgesetzt werden. Dennoch werden viele Patienten, trotz vorhandener Krankheitsaktivität, das heißt rasche Progression und/oder mehr als ein Schub pro Jahr, nicht immunprophylaktisch behandelt. Noch auffälliger ist die Unterversorgung mit symptomorientierten Therapiemaßnahmen: hier wurden die meisten Patienten, insbesondere bei kognitiven Störungen, Fatigue oder Ataxie, nicht zielgerichtet behandelt. Damit ist für MS-Patienten im Allgemeinen und besonderes im Hinblick auf die Therapie der Symtome (, –) eine deutliche Unterversorgung festzustellen. Die Gründe hierfür sind vielfältig. Eine Erklärung könnte darin liegen, dass Patienten in den Zentren mit der Frage nach einer geeigneten Therapiemöglichkeit vorgestellt wurden und die Behandlung möglicherweise erst nach der Dokumentation geändert wurde, also noch nicht erfasst ist. Hierüber können nur Folgeuntersuchungen Aufschluss geben. Eine andere Schlussfolgerung wäre, dass Patienten, die an multipler Sklerose erkrankt sind, in Deutschland häufiger eine Therapie ablehnen beziehungsweise eine Behandlung frühzeitiger abbrechen als in anderen europäischen Ländern, obwohl sie grundsätzlich indiziert wäre. Daher ist eine umfassende Aufklärung und Beratung über Nutzen und Risiken einer Behandlung und die Vereinbarung realistischer Therapieziele dringend notwendig (). Für einige Symptome der multiplen Sklerose wie beispielsweise Fatigue oder kognitive Störungen gibt es entweder keine eindeutig wirksamen Therapiemaßnahmen oder aber keine Versorgungsstrukturen, die zum Beispiel eine ambulante neuropsychologische Behandlung erlauben würden. Hier besteht dringender Bedarf an weiterer klinischer Forschung, aber auch an strukturellen Anpassungen, um eine adäquate Versorgung von MS-Betroffenen sicherzustellen. Bei der vorliegenden Erhebung wurden nicht nur die Neuerkrankungen registriert, sondern alle Patienten, die im Erhebungszeitraum ein Zentrum aufgesucht hatten. Diese Vorgehensweise ist bei einer chronischen Erkankung wie der multiplen Sklerose mit hoher Prävalenz und vergleichsweise niedriger Inzidenz () sinnvoll, weil gerade zu Krankheitsbeginn eine hohe diagnostische Unsicherheit und starke psychische Belastungen bei den Betroffenen bestehen. Die Erhebung ist nicht populationsbezogen, sondern zentrumsbasiert, sodass ein Selektionsbias vorliegen könnte. Die wünschenswerte, vollständige Erfassung hätte die Teilnahme aller an der Versorgung von MS-Patienten Beteiligten vorausgesetzt und wäre nur mithilfe einer gesetzlichen Verpflichtung wie zum Beispiel in Dänemark möglich. Die mit populationsbasierten epidemiologischen Studien vergleichbaren demografischen Daten lassen aber den Schluss zu, dass die Ergebnisse dennoch repräsentativ für die Gesamtheit der MS-Population sind. Das MS-Register beschreibt nur die Versorgungssituation von MS-Patienten im Querschnitt; Informationen über den Krankheitsverlauf vor Therapieeinleitung liegen nicht vor. Somit können also keine Aussagen über eine differenzielle Wirksamkeit der Therapien getroffen werden. Dies wird erst bei den geplanten Verlaufsuntersuchungen möglich sein. Trotz dieser Einschränkungen liefert das MS-Register wertvolle Informationen über die Versorgungssituation von MS-Betroffenen, die die Grundlage für gezielte Maßnahmen zum Ausgleich von Unter- und Fehlversorgung bilden und so die Lebenssituation von MS-Patienten in Deutschland insgesamt verbessern können. Das deutsche MS-Register bildet die Basis für ein europaweites MS-Register im Rahmen eines von der EU geförderten Projektes, das derzeit in Trägerschaft der Europäischen MS-Plattform (EMSP) durchgeführt wird. Das Projekt wird in Trägerschaft der MS-Forschungs- und Projektentwicklungs gGmbH (MSFP) mit der DMSG, Bundesverband e.V., durchgeführt. Finanziert wird das MS-Register von der Deutschen-Multiple-Sklerose(DMS)-Stiftung, die offizielle Stiftung der DMSG. Die DMS-Stiftung erhält freie Spenden von Privatpersonen, Organisationen und der pharmazeutischen Industrie. Eine Einflussnahme auf die Inhalte der geförderten Projekte erfolgt nicht.

This project aimed at collecting epidemiological data and information on health care provision for MS patients in Germany. Methods: After a 2-year pilot phase, the original sample was modified, and new centers were recruited, resulting in the registration of a total of an additional 5821 patients in 2005 and 2006. Following a 2 stage process of quality control, standardised data sets of 5 445 patients (93.5%) were able to be analysed. Results: Mean duration from onset of disease to diagnosis was 3.5 years. More than 70% of patients received immunomodulatory drugs, whereas symptomatic treatments were less commonly administered. The number of participating centers as at 31. December 2006 was 57 (29 neurological hospitals, 11 rehabilitation units, 13 specialized practitioners, and 4 regional MS centers). Discussion: The MS registry provides valuable data on the health care situation of MS patients, and may help to improve service provision and overall quality life for these patients in Germany.

It affects quality of life and correlates with worsened disease outcome. Out approach is to try to systematically identify and treat this problem early and effectively. Q: How common are cognitive disorders present in MS? The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MS is estimated to be between 40 and 65 percent (Bobholz and Rao, 2003; Benedict, Zivadinov, 2011). The cognitive abilities most often affected include episodic memory (recall of previously studied information, like a shopping list or story), working memory (temporary on-line maintenance and manipulation of information), divided attention (multi-tasking ability), and speed processing. Language, executive, and visuospatial functions are relatively spared. However, there is considerable variation in the neuropsychological presentation of MS patients. For example, one study identified six distinct cognitive profiles among patients with relapsing MS entering a trial of interferon-β1a (Fischer, 1999). The largest subgroup, which included 34% of the sample, was cognitively intact. Only 2% showed global cognitive impairment across multiple cognitive domains. The remainder showed circumscribed deficits in two to three cognitive domains. At the Mellen Center, we specifically inquire about the presence of cognitive symptoms at each visit. This is done both in our previsit screening questionnaire and as part of our review of symptoms for each visit. If this is an issue for the patient or their families, we inquire more deeply into this issue. Q: What other factors need to be considered when a patient states they have cognitive problems? (Differential diagnosis) Early in the process of cognitive evaluation for MS patients, other facts should be considered. Standard assessment of laboratory parameters used for general cognitive disorders should be undertaken (For example, thyroid indices and vitamin B12 level). The patient should have an assessment for depression to ensure that the problem is not primarily related to an emotional disorder (see below). Questions about sleep disturbance should be asked as sleep disorders are common in MS and may affect cognitive abilities. The medication the patient is taking should be evaluated for negative impact on cognition. Q: Do physical disability, disease course, and disease duration correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Level of physical disability, as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), has at best a modest correlation with severity of cognition in MS. This is not surprising since the EDSS is heavily influenced by non-cognitive signs and symptoms, such as ambulation. Several studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction is greater in secondary progressive than in relapsing-remitting MS (Gaudino, Chiaravalloti et al.,2001). Cross-sectioning studies have found only a modest relationship between duration of the disease and the extent of cognitive impairment. As noted above, this is likely due to the inter-patient variability in the presentation of cognitive disorders. It is important to note that cognitive changes can occur early in the course of the disease (Deloire, Salort et al.,2005) and, in some patients, may never occur. Longitudinal neuropsychological studies of MS patients studied over an extended period of time suggest that approximately 5-10 percent of patients experience a discernible worsening of cognitive functioning over the course of a year (Amato et al., 2001). Unlike patients with progressive dementias, MS patients with cognitive impairment can be stable for years. In addition, recent cases reports have noted cognitive impairment as a sole manifestation of relapse of MS, with cognitive declines correlating with new lesion formation on MRI imaging. For the above reasons we also do not assume that patients with physical disabilities are cognitively impaired, now do we assume that those without physical impairment are cognitively intact. Q: Do abnormalities detected on brain MRI scans correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Compared to demographic and disease variables, neuroimaging indices correlate relatively well with cognition in MS. Several studies have demonstrated an inverse relation between cognitive performance and the number of volume of lesions on conventional MRI, including T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging (Rovaris and Filippi, 200). Regionally specific relations between lesion volume and cognition have been reported. For example, one study showed specific relations between frontal lobe involvement and executive functions, like conceptual reasoning (Arnett, Rao et al., 1994). Some studies have suggested that brain atrophy is a better predictor of cognitive impairment in MS than lesion volume (Bermel, Bakshi et al., 2002; Benedict, Weinstock-Guttman et al., 2004). Longitudinal studies have shown a relation between progressive brain atrophy and cognitive changes patterns in MS (Hohol, Buttman et al., 1997). There are occasional patients with subacute cognitive changes that correlate with the presence of new lesions, so that a new complaint of cognitive dysfunction may prompt further imaging to assess for disease activity (Pardini, 204). Recent studies indicate that cortical lesions are not only present in early clinical MS, but may be as common as white matter lesions (Lucchinetti 2011). Such lesions and associated tract degeneration may underly some component of the cognitive dysfunction in MS. Note that in addition there are patients with prominent cognitive symptoms with limited lesion burden or atrophy on brain imaging. In such patients, we would assess carefully for other factors such as medication, sleep disturbance, and depression masquerading as cognitive deficits (See below). Q: Do cognitive disorders correlate with other factors related to MS (for example, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders)? Emotional problems, sleep disorders, and fatigue are significantly more common in individuals with MS than in the general population. Although the relationship among these symptoms may be complex, depression has been reported to affect cognitive test performance in the areas of rapid information processing, working memory, and executive function in MS patients (Arnett, Higginson et al., 2001). Although subjective reports of fatigue do not necessarily correlate with observable deficits in cognitive function, decrements in cognitive performance occur during sustained mental effort and after completion of cognitively challenging tasks in MS patients (Krupp and Elkins, 2000; Schwid, Tyler et al., 2003). It is reasonable to assume that patients' performance may be compromised if they are significantly depressed, fatigued, or sleep deprived during cognitive testing. There are many medicines used in MS care that may have a negative impact on cognition. We assess these medicines in our patients with cognitive deficits and consider whether they can be changed to alternative medicines or whether they can be weaned off. Medicines that have such an impact include steroids (particularly IV high dose solumedrol), anticholinergics such as oxybutynin, tricyclic antidepressants, sedatives, beta blockers, muscle relaxants, etc. In addition, the chronic use of marijuana and related substances can have a negative effect on cognition. Sleep disorders may be seen with MS and may affect daytime cognitive performance. We do inquire about sleep at the Mellen Center and consider expert evaluation depending on symptoms presented (for example, snoring, restless leg, periodic leg movements, repeated awakenings, etc). There are documented events where subacute cognitive impairment is the only clinical manifestation of a relapse documented by a decline in neuropsychological function and imaging findings of new lesion formation. A subacute decline in cognition should prompt both a search for factors such as infection, new medications, or emerging illness, or imaging to assess for new lesion activity. Q: How can cognitive disorders be detected in the clinical setting? A: We note that patient self-report of cognitive deficits in unreliable. Patients with MS who are depressed will report cognitive impairment, while patients with cognitive deficits may under report their deficits. An informant (family member, close friend) is critical to assist in giving history to document cognitive impairment. One method for identifying cognitive dysfunction is to administer rating questionnaires to patients and their family members. One such scale is the MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ), a 15-item self-informant-report inventory (Benedict, Cox et al., 2004). Results suggest that informant ratings of cognitive problems are more likely to correlate with objective neuropsychological tests than patient self-reports. Unfortunately, informant ratings are not always available in the clinical setting. An alternative approach is to use a brief cognitive screening examination. One commonly used test, the Mini-Mental State Examination, has been found to be insensitive to the cognitive impairments in MS. Performing extensive cognitive testing can be too time consuming for centers with limited staff, yet performing an annual cognitive screen may be necessary as part of ongoing MS care. Langdon and others (2012) extensively reviewed the literature on neuropsychological measures in MS. They determined that the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), with the possible addition of the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised learning trials, is a reasonable screen. Their expert panel judged these studies to be preferred over others when rated on psychometric qualities (reliability, validity, and sensitivity), an international application, ease administration, feasibility in the specified context, and acceptability to patients. The SDMT consists of single digits paired with abstract symbols. The patient must say the number corresponding with each symbol. The test can be administered and scored within 5 minutes. It is a sensitive test of information processing speed that is preferentially affected in MS patients. It is well validated against multiple MRI measures and has minimal practice effect. One problem with the standard SDMT is that there are not multiple versions, so as a repeated measures test this would be subject to a training effect. The California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition comprises a 16 item word list, with four items belonging to each of 4 categories. This is read aloud 5 times in the same order to the patient at a rate slightly slower than 1 per second. This test can be completed in 5-10 minutes including instructions, testing, and responses. This test has also been validated with brain MRI measures. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised Learning T1-3 requires the patient to inspect a 2x3 stimulus array of abstract geometric figures. There are three learning trials of 10 seconds, then the stimulus is removed and the patient is required to draw the array from memory. This study also correlates with a variety of MRI measures. Other measures which could be used include the PASAT, MOCA test, and others. At the Mellen Center we screen both with items on a self-reported quality of life scale as well as in our review of symptoms. We have not systematically used screening tools in out entire population though this would be a reasonable approach as well. Q: What is the role of neuropsychology in ascertaining and monitoring cognition? The brief cognitive screening batteries described above could be administered by a non-neuropsychologist to determine if an MS patient is experiencing some form of cognitive dysfunction. Such a result is of limited importance, however, if not tied into specific clinical management. For this to happen, it is common to refer MS patients for a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment performed by a board certified clinical neuropsychologist. Such as assessment typically entails three to four hours of testing and includes a clinical interview. Comprehensive assessments can provide detailed baseline and follow-up data as well as information that pertains to complex matters such as differential diagnosis (e.g. MS dementia versus Alzheimer's disease in an elderly patient), guidance for rehabilitation or therapies, or determination of disability status. Neuropsychology testing can be particularly helpful if work or school related performance has been questioned, potentially leading to recommendation for accommodations (for example, breaks between tasks, more time for examinations, quieter workspace, part time work, etc.) Referral to a clinical neuropsychologist, board-certified by the American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, is recommended. Q: What non-medication interventions exist for cognitive dysfunction? Non pharmacologic treatment for cognitive impairment in MS, variously described as cognitive retraining, cognitive remediation, or cognitive rehabilitation among other labels, includes three main approaches: (1) restorative therapies that aim to improve specific abilities, (2) compensatory approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of cognitive strategies, and (3) adaptive approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of external aids and modifications (Amato and Zipoli, 2003). Recent studies have begun to assess interventions specifically designed to improve targeted aspects of learning and memory in MS (Chiaravalloti, DeLuca et al., 2005). A recent Cochrane Review found low level evidence for the benefit of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS patients (Rosti-Otajarvi 2004). Variations in study design and conduct precluded a strong recommendation for such rehabilitative strategies. In addition to the direct treatment of cognition, it is useful to detect and treat comorbidities such as depression and fatigue that can influence cognition and quality of life (Amato and Zipoli, 2003; Bagert, Camplair et al., 2002; Bakshi, 2003). Cognitive-behavioral counseling based in neuropsychological principles has been shown to improve insight and social skills, leading to a reduction in disinhibition and social aggressiveness in cognitively impaired MS patients (Benedict, Shaprio et al., 2001) In addition, a single study indicated reduced brain atrophy in patients actively exercising, which might have an impact on cognition (Lovera, 2010). Compensatory strategies may be helpful. These include a simplified schedule of activities, reminder lists or other strategies, reducing clutter in the household, among others. Where available, vocational rehabilitation may be useful to counsel the patient on alternatives or adaptions which might assist them in the workplace. In general populations, various preventive strategies to spare cognition have been supported by epidemiological or clinical trials data. These may be worth discussing with patients concerned about preventing cognitive decline: Treating hypertension, diabetes, and other vascular risk factors Data on brain training is limited at the present time. Q: What medication approaches are there for cognitive dysfunction? Treatment of cognitive problems in MS has received relatively little clinical or empirical attention in the past. However, recent years have seen the emergence of studies of pharmacologic interventions that have undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny in well-designed clinical trials (Doraiswamy and Rao, 2004). Prevention of cognitive impairment in MS is an important target of therapy. Some disease-modifying medications have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognition (e.g., Fischer, Priore et al. 2000). Pharmacologic strategies used to treat cognitive impairment in other disorders may have a beneficial effect on MS. A randomized, placebo-controlled study demonstrated a modest but statistically significant benefit of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil on memory test performance in MS (Krupp, Christodoulou et al., 2004). However, a larger multicenter study of donepezil did not confirm this finding (Krupp et al 2011). It may also be helpful to minimize, when possible, the use of medications with potential adverse cognitive consequences, such as bladder-control medications with anticholinergic effects (Tsao and Heilman, 2005). A randomized multicenter study of memantine 10mg bid in MS patients with cognitive symptoms shows more fatigue and neurological adverse events than patients on placebo and no positive effect on cognition. Higher doses of memantine may have more cognitive side effects in this population as well. Other medications considered for use in this population have not been tested in a randomized trial way. These include activating antidepressants, stimulants, and modafinil. There is limited data to support the use of these medications in this situation. Q: What do families need to think of when there are cognitive disorders? Independent of the severity of physical disability, cognitive dysfunction can have a major impact on employment and activities of daily living in MS (Rao, Leo et al., 1991). Severity of cognitive impairment, as measured by neuropsychological testing, is predictive of ability to drive (Schultheis, Garay et al., 2002), employment status (Benedict, 2005; Rao, Leo et al., 1991), success in rehabilitation (Langdon and Thompson, 1999), and social skills (Knight, Devereux et al., 1997). It is critical that patients and family members receive accurate information and psychosocial counseling to assist them in coping with these sometimes intractable consequences of MS. There are specific recommendations available on the assessment and management of cognitive impairment in MS which may be useful to families and patients with such impairment (Benedict Zacharia, et al., 2006). Specific considerations to discuss with families include safety (to avoid falls, wandering, injury); financial oversight; and driving safety. Bobholz, JA and Rao, SM (2003).

Background Optic neuritis is a common presenting feature of both neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis. Distinguishing between NMO and RRMS is important in guiding treatment, but biomarkers of NMO and MS can be absent early in the disease process. We looked for differences in MRI characteristics of optic neuritis associated with NMO and MS that provide an early clue in the diagnostic workup. Design/Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 26 NMO and 26 RRMS patients presenting to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with MRI-confirmed acute optic neuritis.

d65d4d50-59af-4b09-8c23-65bf1ca8bd72,"CORONAVIRUS: DELAYS FOR ROUTINE SURGERIES, VISITOR RESTRICTIONS + COVID-19 TESTING. 800.223.2273 Neurological Institute Cleveland Clinic Menu Call for Additional Assistance Neurological Institute Menu Cleveland Clinic Menu / Institutes & Departments / Neurological Institute / Departments & Centers / Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis / Multiple Sclerosis Approaches / Siponimod Siponimod Siponimod is a medication that has been approved by the FDA to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, which has been defined to include relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease. SPMS with active disease refers to those patients who are in a progressive phase of the disease and continue to have clinical relapses. In the clinical trials, siponimod appeared to have the most benefit for patients who were younger, had gadolinium-enhancing lesions, lower disability, and shorter disease duration. The benefit of siponimod in patients with SPMS without relapses is less clear. Siponimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulator that selectively binds the S1P subtypes 1 and 5. It acts as a functional antagonist, as binding to S1P1 induces receptor internalization and degradation in T and B cells. The ultimate result is prevention of lymphocyte egress from the lymphoid tissue into the central nervous system (CNS). Additionally, preclinical studies have shown that siponimod inhibits demyelination, and attenuates the production of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-17 by astrocytes and microglia. This suggests that siponimod may act directly on the CNS in addition to its role in decreasing circulating lymphocytes. Siponimod has a rapid onset of action, and reduces circulating T and B cells within 4-6 hours. Its half-life is approximately 30 hours. Circulating lymphocytes counts recover within a week after treatment discontinuation. Complete elimination of siponimod from the body takes approximately 10 days. Siponimod is metabolized in the liver through the Cytochrome P450 system (primarily through CYP2C9, subsequently by CYP3A4). Genetic variants to the CYP2C9 enzyme can slow siponimod metabolism. This is important in determining the correct dose and titration schedule for a given patient, as patients with the *3 variant of CYP2C9 demonstrated slower rates of drug metabolism. Specifically, heterozygotes with CYP2C9 *3 have moderately slowed metabolism, and homozygotes with CYP2C9 *3/*3 have severely impaired metabolism. As a result, CYP2C9 *3 heterozygotes should follow a lower dose titration and lower final dose; CYP2C9 *3/*3 genotype is a contraindication to siponimod. Does siponimod have any significant drug interactions? While siponimod does not induce nor inhibit the CYP450 system, its metabolism can be affected by medications that are CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers. For example, a patient who takes warfarin, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, may have increased levels of siponimod. We recommend a careful review of a patient’s medication list, and would use siponimod cautiously in patients who take CYP450 modulators. What did the clinical trials of siponimod for MS show? Siponimod was approved for treatment of MS based on the results of two clinical trials. The first was , which was a phase II randomized, double-blind, dose-finding, placebo comparison trial for patients with RRMS. This showed that siponimod at a dose of 2mg approached peak efficacy as measured by a reduction in the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions or new enhancing lesions. It also showed that the medication had favorable tolerability and safety. While there were two significant cardiovascular adverse events, both of these patients had preexisting cardiac risk factors, and both of these events occurred after drug discontinuation and washout. The safety 24-month extension study did not identify any new serious safety signals compared to the original study. The second study was EXPAND, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial of patients with SPMS. EXPAND demonstrated that siponimod reduced the risk of confirmed disability worsening in patients with SPMS by 21%, reduced the risk of relapses compared to placebo by 55%, and slowed the rate of radiographic disease activity and brain atrophy. The side effects of siponimod that occurred in greater than 10% of patients in clinical trials are as follows: Siponimod, similar to other S1P modulators, can lead to temporarily bradycardia immediately following the first dose, although a five-day titration appears to mitigate first-dose bradycardia. There were no symptomatic bradycardic events or adverse reactions, nor clinically significant changes in baseline blood pressure observed in the trials. Siponimod also induced cardiac conduction abnormalities in 3% of patients in clinical trials, including first- and second-degree AV block. Approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials experienced increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). 2% of siponimod patients developed macular edema, compared to less than 1% of placebo patients. In the clinical trial EXPAND, macular edema was seen in 2% of siponimod patients compared to <1% of placebo patients. Patients with a prior history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of macular edema when taking siponimod. While this is not an absolute contraindication, we recommend obtaining a baseline ophthalmologic evaluation. We typically complete this using optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT monitoring for macular edema is only done if symptoms suggestive possible macular edema. OCT monitoring for macular edema is only done if symptoms suggestive possible macular edema. Is siponimod associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? There have been no cases of PML reported in patients treated with siponimod, although PML has been associated with another S1P modulator fingolimod. Infingolimod the rate of PML is very low. . Accordingly, a risk of PML during siponimod treatment cannot be excluded. We believe that if PML is to develop in patients taking siponimod, it will occur at the same low rate as was seen in fingolimod. Currently, we do not feel that positive JC virus serology should preclude treatment with siponimod. Clinical trials showed that the overall rate of infections was comparable between siponimod and placebo group (49.0% vs 49.1%, respectively), and the rate of serious infection was slightly increased for the siponimod group compared to placebo (2.9% vs 2.5%). The siponimod group had a higher rate of herpetic infections (including VZV), , upper respiratory infection, and fungal skin infection. While not reported for siponimod, rare cases of cryptococcal meningitis have been reported in patients taking fingolimod, another S1P modulator. Siponimod reduces the circulating absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), which is its intended pharmacodynamics effect. The magnitude of reduction is dose-dependent, and is approximately 20-30%. Lymphopenia (defined as ALC < 200/µL) occurred in 1% of patients, however there is no correlation between lymphopenia and an increased risk of infections, including PML. Contraindications to siponimod include patients homozygous for the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype; significant heart rhythm or conduction abnormalities (unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker); or in the past six months has had myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, decompensated heart failure, or Class III or IV heart failure.   Siponimod is a once-daily oral medication that follows an initial titration. Prior to starting the medication, CYP2C9 genotype must be tested in order to determine how the drug will be metabolized for a specific patient. This determines the titration strategy and target dosage. If a titration dose is missed for more than 24 hours, treatment should be restarted with Day 1 of the titration schedule. If treatment is interrupted for more than 4 days, patients should repeat the titration. For patients with CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2: initiate siponimod therapy with the standard 5-day titration, followed by the maintenance dose of 2 mg taken once daily beginning on day 6. This standard titration should be prescribed using the starter pack (which includes 12 pills of 0.25mg), followed by a separate prescription for the 2mg maintenance pills. Titration for wild-type CYP2C9 Genotypes (*1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2) For patients with CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*3, or *2/*3: initiate siponimod therapy with an altered 4-day titration, followed by the maintenance dose of 1 mg taken once daily beginning on day 5. The titration should be given as a prescription for siponimod 0.25 mg x 7 pills, followed by a separate prescription for the 1mg maintenance dose. Titration for heterozygote CYP2C9 Genotypes (*1/*3, or *2/*3) Siponimod is contraindicated for patients with the *3/*3 CYP2C9 genotype due to dangerously prolonged siponimod metabolism. Prior to starting treatment with siponimod, we recommend the following tests: this can be done in a patient’s home at no cost to the patient through the pharmaceutical company Virus IgG antibodies (VZV), and we recommend vaccinating VZV antibody-negative patients prior to starting treatment OCT to screen for macular edema, can also consider ophthalmologic examination to screen for asymptomatic uveitis It is also recommended that patients not have active infections when starting siponimod Is monitoring required during the first dose like with fingolimod? For the majority of patients, first dose observation is not necessary. First-dose 6 hour monitoring is recommended for patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, sinus bradycardia (HR < 55 bpm), or first- or second-degree AV block as detected on baseline EKG. This monitoring should include hourly measurements of pulse and blood pressure, as well as an EKG at the end of the observation period. What monitoring is done during siponimod treatment? Although routine monitoring is not stipulated in the prescribing information, we at the Mellen Center recommend measuring blood pressure during office visits, and checking CBC with differential and LFTs 3-6 months after starting treatment, then every 6-12 months while on the medication. On these labs, we expect to see a 20-30% reduction in ALC, but we monitor for lymphopenia (ALC < 200/µL) and elevated ALT. For any significant abnormalities, more frequent monitoring is reasonable. Currently, there are no data to suggest that the lymphopenia produced by siponimod leads to a higher risk of infection. We recommend routine clinical monitoring for infections for all siponimod patients, especially for those who develop ALC < 200/µL with concomitant leukopenia, or for patients with a history of frequent infections. For other S1P modulators such as fingolimod, rebound disease activity may occur after drug discontinuation. While this phenomenon was not seen in the siponimod clinical trials, we consider it a potential risk, and therefore patients should be monitored closely for relapses, MRI lesion activity, or disability worsening after stopping the drug. Additionally, rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have occurred in patients receiving other S1P modulators, though this has not yet been reported in siponimod patients. It is therefore considered a potential risk, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops a new neurologic symptom or deficit. Although there are no data on the safety of siponimod in pregnant woman, siponimod has been shown to cause teratogenicity in various animal models. Therefore, female patients of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive methods while on siponimod, and wait at least 2 months (based on the half-life of the drug) after the last siponimod dose before attempting to conceive. There are currently no data on the safety of siponimod on the breastfed infant, however animal studies have shown that the medication is secreted into breast milk. A discussion of the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while on siponimod should occur with each patient individually. Which vaccines should a patient receive while on siponimod? Prior to starting siponimod therapy, VZV antibodies should be checked, and patients who are antibody-negative should receive VZV vaccination. After starting siponimod, patients should receive all age-appropriate vaccines, including the annual flu vaccine, though we recommend avoiding any live vaccines. Killed or inactivated vaccines are considered to be relatively safe.

Unkonventionelle Therapien der multiplen Sklerose: Nutzen unklar Unkonventionelle Therapien der multiplen Sklerose: Nutzen unklar Dtsch Arztebl 2005; 102(30): A-2102 / B-1774 / C-1678 Zusammenfassung Die meisten MS-Patienten setzen unkonventionelle Therapien ein. Vor allem spezielle Diäten werden vielfach angewandt. Der Nutzen dieser Therapien ist unsicher, die möglichen Risiken weitgehend unbekannt. Die Datenlage ist spärlich, es existieren Hinweise auf günstige Auswirkungen ungesättigter Fettsäuren. Die Einnahme von Vitamin D ist mit einem geringeren Erkrankungsrisiko assoziiert. Für eine nach Krankheitsbeginn einsetzende Therapie mit Vitamin D gibt es keine ausreichende Basis. Spekulativ ist die günstige Wirkung einer Zufuhr verschiedener Mineralstoffe, Selen, Antioxidanzien, Fischöl oder Vitamine. Viele Patienten geben eine subjektive Besserung von Spastik, Ataxie oder Schmerzen unter Cannabinoiden an, auch wenn objektive Parameter unverändert bleiben. Die hyperbare Oxygenation zeigte in mehreren Studien heterogene Ergebnisse. Keine dieser Therapiestrategien kann empfohlen werden. Schlüsselwörter: multiple Sklerose, alternative Therapie, Ernährung, hyperbare Oxygenation, Cannabis Summary Alternative and Complementary Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis Most MS patients adopt unconventional therapies, although the scientific evidence is scarce. The efficacy of these therapies is unproven, and possible risks are largely unknown. Frequently, particular diets are used. Possibly, unsaturated fatty acids may prove beneficial. Long-term supplementation of vitamin D is associated with a decrease in the incidence of MS. There is, however, insufficient evidence to indicate the influence of Vitamin D on the course of the disease. The effects of various minerals, selenium, antioxidant compounds, fish oil or vitamins remain speculative. Many patients use cannabis to alleviate spasticity and pain. Hyperbaric oxygenation has been the subject of several studies with heterogeneous results. None of these therapies can be recommended. Key words: multiple sclerosis, alternative therapys, diet, hyperbaric oxygenation, cannabis Zur Therapie der multiplen Sklerose (MS) stehen mit Beta-Interferonen, Glatiramerazetat, Mitoxantron und Corticoiden wirksame Arzneistoffe zur Verfügung. Allerdings führt kein Medikament zu einer Heilung. Die Therapieeffekte sind aber nur moderat, und der langfristige Nutzen ist noch nicht ausreichend untersucht (). Zudem verläuft die Erkrankung auch unter diesen Therapien langfristig oft progredient. Für Subgruppen, insbesondere für Patienten mit chronisch progredientem Krankheitsverlauf, ist die Wirksamkeit dieser Arzneimittel nicht nachgewiesen. Deswegen überrascht es nicht, dass viele Patienten mit unkonventionellen Heilverfahren experimentieren. Aus der großen Zahl der unkonventionellen Therapien, die bei MS angewendet werden (), beschränken die Autoren sich in dieser Übersicht auf Maßnahmen, über die wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen vorliegen oder die zumindest eine rationale Basis haben. Unkonventionelle Therapien Die Abgrenzung unkonventioneller versus konventioneller Therapien ist schwierig. Weder das Kriterium des wissenschaftlichen Wirkungsnachweises noch die Rationalität oder Irrationalität einer Therapie haben eine hohe Trennschärfe (). Zudem beruhen viele konventionelle symptomatische Therapien ebenfalls auf anekdotischer Evidenz und nicht auf großen Therapiestudien (). So ist beispielsweise Physiotherapie zur Behandlung von MS-Symptomen allgemein akzeptiert, obwohl valide klinische Studien über den langfristigen Nutzen fehlen. Die Autoren benutzen die pragmatische Definition der Cochrane Collaboration: „Komplementäre und alternative Medizin ist ein weiter Bereich therapeutischer Ressourcen [. . .] unterschiedlich zu denen des politisch dominanten Gesundheitssystems einer bestimmten Gesellschaft [. . .] Die Grenzen zwischen komplementärer und alternativer Medizin und dem dominanten System sind nicht immer scharf oder festgelegt“ (). Stellenwert unkonventioneller Therapien bei MS-Patienten Unkonventionelle Verfahren werden von den meisten MS-Patienten im Verlauf der Erkrankung eingesetzt (, , ). Dabei sind regionale Gegebenheiten von Bedeutung. So werden zum Beispiel in Nordamerika häufig Gebete eingesetzt (), was in Europa weniger populär ist. In einer deutschen Erhebung gaben 64 Prozent der Patienten an, unkonventionelle Therapien anzuwenden (), vor allem Frauen, schwer Erkrankte und religiöse Patienten. Das wichtigste Motiv der Patienten ist weniger Misstrauen gegenüber der Schulmedizin, sondern der Wunsch, keine Chance zu verpassen und aktiv in den Krankheitsprozess einzugreifen. Die meisten Patienten führen unkonventionelle Therapien in Eigenregie durch, der behandelnde Arzt wird häufig nicht informiert (, , ). Die Effekte der unkonventionellen Therapien werden von den Patienten übereinstimmend als positiv beurteilt. Nebenwirkungen werden selten angegeben (, ). In einer kanadischen Befragung berichteten fünf Prozent der Anwender über Nebenwirkungen, dagegen 72 Prozent über positive Effekte (). Abzuratende unkonventionelle Therapien Weder der Nutzen noch die Risiken unkonventioneller Therapien sind wissenschaftlich gesichert. Allgemein werden unkonventionelle Therapien als risikolos angesehen. Tatsächlich gibt es nur wenige Fallberichte über relevante Nebenwirkungen bei MS (). Erfahrungsgemäß ist es weder sinnvoll noch erfolgversprechend, Patienten, die eine unkonventionelle Therapie durchführen und von ihrer Wirkung überzeugt sind, abzuraten, solange die wissenschaftlich indizierte Therapie weitergeführt wird. Allerdings sind verschiedene unkonventionelle Therapien kostspielig. So kostet zum Beispiel der von der Firma Seviton vorgesehene Jahresbedarf an diversen Nahrungsergänzungsmitteln 2 029,35 Euro (). Das hält viele Patienten aber nicht ab oder motiviert vielleicht sogar, diese und noch weit höhere Summen auszugeben. Die Auswirkungen auf die Lebensqualität sind schwer einschätzbar. Manche Maßnahmen sind aufwendig und teuer, was aber oft nicht als belastend, sondern im Gegenteil als stabilisierend erlebt wird. Abgeraten werden sollte von Therapien, bei denen Komplikationen bekannt sind, die schmerzhaft oder grundsätzlich gefährlich sind. Aufgrund der Gefahr einer Immunreaktion müssen parenterale Behandlungen bei MS kritisch beurteilt werden. Dies trifft insbesondere auf die Frischzellentherapie zu, von der in seltenen Einzelfällen lebensgefährliche allergische Komplikationen bekannt sind (), ebenso auch die gelegentlich bei Ataxie praktizierte Injektion homöopathischer Zerebellumextrakte. Ein Zusammenhang zwischen Quecksilber und MS ist spekulativ. Die schmerzhafte und kostspielige Entfernung von Amalgamplomben ist nicht gerechtfertigt, zumal dabei relativ hohe Mengen Quecksilber freigesetzt werden (). Es gibt kaum Daten über Phytotherapeutika und MS. Wie alle Pharmaka können auch Phytotherapeutika Nebenwirkungen hervorrufen (). Bei parenteraler Anwendung homöopathischer Pflanzenextrakte wurden Fälle einer akuten MS-Variante beschrieben (). Echinaceaprodukte werden trotz negativer Therapiestudien häufig zur Infektabwehr eingesetzt. Da immunstimulierende Wirkungen in vitro nachgewiesen sind (, ), führen viele Hersteller MS als Kontraindikation auf, obwohl klinische Daten hierzu fehlen. Dasselbe trifft für Bienen- oder Schlangengiftinjektionen, hyperbare Oxygenation, Ozontherapie oder Eigenblutbehandlung zu. Diese Behandlungen könnten bei der MS wegen des Risikos allergischer Reaktionen oder der Bildung toxischer Radikale gefährlich sein. Nahrungsergänzungsmittel Zahlreiche Nahrungsergänzungsmittel, die von jedem in den Verkehr gebracht werden können, werden als unkonventionelle Heilmittel eingesetzt. Obwohl Qualität oder Verunreinigungen kaum überprüfbar sind, sind die Präparate in der Regel unbedenklich. Bei niedrigen Herstellungskosten vieler Substanzen und hohen Preise sind die Gewinnspannen groß. Ungesättigte Fettsäuren Es gibt epidemiologische Hinweise auf einen Zusammenhang der MS-Inzidenz mit dem Konsum gesättigter Fette tierischer Herkunft (). In Tierexperimenten wurden immunmodulatorische und antiinflammatorische Effekte mehrfach ungesättigter Fettsäuren, vor allem der w-3-Fettsäuren beobachtet, die bei MS günstig sein könnten (, ). Aus den essenziellen Fettsäuren a-Linolensäure (w-3) und Linolsäure (w-6) werden andere Fettsäuren gebildet, die Vorstufen verschiedener Leukotriene und Prostaglandine sind. Diese Vorgänge sind komplex und unterliegen zahlreichen Regelmechanismen (, ). Die traditionelle Vorstellung, w-3-Fettsäuren (zum Beispiel im Fischöl) wirkten „antiinflammatorisch“ und w-6-Fettsäuren (zum Beispiel Arachidonsäure) „proinflammatorisch“, ist grob vereinfachend (). Ein optimales Verhältnis von w-3 zu w-6 Fettsäuren wird mit etwa 1 : 5 angegeben. In den meisten Industrienationen ist dieses Verhältnis zugunsten der w-6 Fettsäuren verschoben (1 : 15 bis 1 : 19). Die wichtigste w-6 Fettsäure, Linolsäure (zum Beispiel in Sonnenblumenöl) ist in Tiermodellen der MS wirksam (, , , ). Neben epidemiologischen Befunden bildete dies die Basis für drei kleine Therapiestudien mit Linolsäure (, , ). In keiner wurden günstige Effekte auf Schubrate oder Grad der Behinderung nachgewiesen. Eine Metaanalyse ergab allerdings, insbesondere für die Untergruppe der gering behinderten Patienten (EDSS-0-2), ein signifikant positives Ergebnis (). Größere Studien mit Linolsäure wurden – vermutlich wegen des fehlenden kommerziellen Potenzials – nie durchgeführt. Eine Studie mit dem Öl der Nachtkerze (evening primrose), das reich an a-Linolensäure (w-6) ist, zeigte keine positiven Effekte (). Im Vergleich mit w-6 sind w-3 Fettsäuren (zum Beispiel Fischöl) bei MS schlechter untersucht, und die Resultate sind uneinheitlich (). In der Nurses’ Health Study war kein Zusammenhang zwischen Inzidenz der Erkrankung und Konsum von w-3-Fettsäuren erkennbar (). Zwei kleine Pilotstudien (, ) suggerieren positive Effekte von w-3-Fettsäuren auf den Krankheitsverlauf der MS. Die größte und methodisch beste kontrollierte Studie bei 292 Patienten () ergab positive Trends, aber keine signifikanten Unterschiede zwischen Fischöl und Placebo. Demgegenüber können hohe Dosen von w-3-Fettsäuren (> 3g/d) Nebenwirkungen (unter anderem Blutungskomplikationen, Fischgeruch) hervorrufen (). Deswegen sollte eine hochdosierte Therapie mit w-3-Fettsäuren unter ärztlicher Kontrolle erfolgen. Der Nutzen ungesättigter Fettsäuren bei MS ist trotz Hinweisen aus epidemiologischen und experimentellen Studien ungesichert. Die Empfehlung der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Ernährung, den Konsum mehrfach gesättigter Fette einzuschränken und ein bis zwei Fischmahlzeiten pro Woche zu konsumieren, ist schon aufgrund der kardiovaskulären Wirkungen der w-3- Fettsäuren gerechtfertigt (). Für eine zusätzliche Einnahme von Fischölen oder anderen Fettsäurepräparaten gibt es keine Evidenz. Calcium und Vitamin D Seit langem wird über Zusammenhänge der geografischen Verteilung der MS mit Sonnenlichtexposition und Vitamin D spekuliert (). Vitamin D hat vielfältige Effekte auf das Immunsystem und günstige Wirkungen in Tiermodellen der MS (, ). Teilnehmerinnen der prospektiven Nurses’ Health Study, die Vitamin-D-Präparate zu sich nahmen, hatten ein um 40 Prozent geringeres MS-Erkrankungsrisiko (). Effekte einer Vitamin-D-Therapie bei manifester MS wurden hier nicht untersucht. Bei MS-Patienten wird angesichts der hohen Rate an Osteoporose infolge Vitamin-D-Mangel, Inaktivität und Cortisontherapien die Indikation zu einer Prophylaxe mit Calcium und Vitamin D weit gestellt (). Unsicher ist, ob der Krankheitsverlauf dadurch beeinflusst wird. Bisherige Interventionsstudien mit Vitamin D oder Calcium sind klein, methodisch schwach und im Ergebnis widersprüchlich (,). Vitamin B12 Beziehungen zwischen Vitamin B12 und MS werden seit mehr als 50 Jahren angenommen (, ). MS-Patienten haben häufig einen manifesten B12-Mangel (–, ). Jedoch waren zwei kleine Therapiestudien mit Vitamin B12 enttäuschend (, ), sodass es für eine Behandlung der MS mit Vitamin B12 keine rationale Basis gibt. Bei suspekten Symptomen sollte ein Vitamin B12-Mangel ausgeschlossen werden, weil das klinische Bild eines Vitamin B12-Mangels von MS-Symptomen maskiert oder imitiert werden kann (). Selen und andere Antioxidanzien Oxidative Prozesse spielen in der Pathogenese der MS eine wichtige Rolle (). Es werden zahlreiche antioxidativ wirksamer Substanzen von MS-Patienten eingenommen, unter anderem die Vitamine A, C, E, Selen, Coenzym Q, Alpha-Liponsäure oder Anthocyane (zum Beispiel Rotweinextrakte). Die Wirksamkeit bei MS ist spekulativ. Da einige Antioxidanzien immunstimulierende Wirkungen haben, sind auch negative Effekte denkbar (). Deswegen sollte vom Konsum dieser Substanzen abgeraten werden. Als potentes Antioxidans könnte Selen günstige Effekte ausüben. Untersuchungen zur Häufigkeit von Selenmangel bei MS ergaben divergierende Ergebnisse (, , , ). Trotz nachvollziehbarer theoretischer Überlegungen liegen bislang keine klinischen Daten vor, die den Einsatz von Selen rechtfertigen. In einer Therapiestudie mit Selen, Vitamin C und Vitamin E stieg zwar die Aktivität der Glutathionperoxidase in Blutzellen an (), ein Effekt auf den Krankheitsverlauf war methodisch bedingt nicht erkennbar. Epidemiologische Studien zeigten keinen klaren Zusammenhang zwischen Vitamin E und MS-Inzidenz (, , , ). Die Supplementierung mit den Vitamine A, C, und E ist ungefährlich, wenn die empfohlenen Höchstmengen nicht überschritten werden. Klare Hinweise für positive Effekte dieser Vitamine bei MS existieren nicht. Spezielle Diäten Enthusiastischen Erfahrungsberichten zum Trotz wurde ein Nutzen einer bestimmten Ernährung bei MS bisher nicht nachgewiesen (). Fast alle Diäten sind wissenschaftlich nicht untersucht. Erwähnt sind hier nur drei populäre Varianten der zahlreichen „MS-Diäten“. Ausgehend von der Tatsache, dass die MS erst seit der Industrialisierung bekannt ist, spekulierte Evers, dass „denaturierte“, das heißt verarbeitete Nahrung für die Entstehung der MS verantwortlich sei. Die Evers-Diät beruht darauf, jedes Lebensmittel so natürlich wie möglich zu belassen. Gekochte, gebackene, oder sonst in irgendeiner Weise verarbeitete Speisen werden vermieden (). Ernährungsphysiologisch betrachtet handelt es sich um eine Variante der ovo-lakto-vegetabilen Ernährung. Die Einhaltung der Diät ist aufwendig. Wissenschaftliche Daten zugunsten der Evers-Diät liegen nicht vor. Fratzer entwickelte auf dem Boden pathophysiologischer Theorien eine komplexe Therapie, deren zentraler Punkt die Modifikation der Fettzufuhr ist (, ). Daneben werden verschiedene Nahrungsergänzungsmittel verabreicht. Durch eine Änderung der Relation der w-3- zu w-6-Fettsäuren in der Ernährung soll die Produktion von Arachidonsäure und pro-inflammatorischer Zytokine verringert werden. Eckpunkt der Fratzer-Diät ist eine fettarme Kost mit besonderer Beschränkung der Linolsäure (also der Fettsäure, für die die besten Studienergebnisse vorliegen). Auch für die Fratzer-Diät gilt, dass es außer einer Fragebogenaktion () keine wissenschaftlichen Daten gibt. Wichtigstes Ziel der Swank-Diät ist eine maximale Reduktion der Zufuhr gesättigter Fettsäuren (, ). Zusätzlich werden Pflanzenöl und Lebertran eingenommen. 144 Anwender der Swank-Diät wurden bis zu 34 Jahre nachuntersucht (). Bei den Patienten, die sich streng an die Diät hielten, wurden positive Auswirkungen auf die MS beobachtet. Die Studie war weder kontrolliert noch randomisiert, und die Patientenauswahl nicht repräsentativ, sodass diese Studie nicht Basis einer Therapieempfehlung sein kann. Cannabis Anerkannt sind Cannabinoide zur Appetitstimulation bei Tumorkachexie und AIDS sowie bei chemotherapieinduziertem Erbrechen. Cannabinoide vermitteln über spezifische Rezeptoren im Gehirn (CB1) und an Zellen des Immunsystems (CB2) vielfältige Wirkungen, die sich auf Symptome und Verlauf der MS auswirken könnten. Cannabis wird, meist illegal, von MS-Patienten häufig (bis zu 16 Prozent) angewendet (, , ). Bei therapeutischer Anwendung wurden bisher keine bleibenden Gesundheitsschäden bekannt (). Cannabinoide sind bei Tiermodellen der MS und Spastik wirksam (, , , ). Die meisten Therapiestudien sind klein und haben zweifelhafte Bewertungskriterien, die auf der Selbsteinschätzung der Patienten beruhen. Auch ist eine echte Verblindung wegen der psychischen Wirkungen nicht möglich. Eine Trennung von psychischen und somatischen Wirkungen ist bei Symptomen, wie Schmerz oder Allgemeinbefinden schwierig. Placeboeffekte sind wegen des positiven Vorurteils vieler Patienten unvermeidlich. Einzelberichte und kleine Fallserien wiesen auf positive Auswirkungen von Cannabinoiden auf MS-assoziierte Spastik hin (, , ). Zwei kleine (, ) und eine größere randomisierte Studie mit 667 Patienten () zeigten aber keine Änderung der Spastik unter Cannabinoiden. In der CAMS-Studie () verbesserte sich die Gehstrecke, es trat eine subjektive Verbesserung von Schmerz, Schlaf, Muskelspasmen und Spastik ein. Wesentliche Nebenwirkungen waren nicht erkennbar. Insgesamt bestätigt die CAMS-Studie Ergebnisse früherer Arbeiten, dass Cannabinoide hauptsächlich das subjektive Empfinden der Patienten positiv beeinflussen (insbesondere die Schmerzwahrnehmung). Günstige Auswirkungen auf MS-assoziierte Schmerzen wurden auch in zwei weiteren Studien berichtet (, ). In Bezug auf Tremor fand trotz einzelner positiver Berichte (, ) eine kleine kontrollierte Studie keine Besserung unter Cannabinoiden (). Viele Patienten unter Cannabinoiden berichten von einem verbesserten Allgemeinbefinden. Allerdings ist die Wirksamkeit durch kontrollierte Studien nicht belegt. Deshalb können Cannabinoide bei MS nicht allgemein empfohlen werden. Bei einzelnen MS-Patienten mit schweren Symptomen, die auf übliche Maßnahmen nicht ansprechen, kann ein individueller Behandlungsversuch mit Cannabinoiden, das entweder als Fertigarzneimittel über die internationale Apotheke (Marinol) oder als Rezepturmedikament (Dronabinol) erhältlich ist (), versucht werden (, ). Hyperbare Oxygenation (HBO) Aufgrund viel versprechender Experimente bei Tiermodellen und positiver Fallberichte wurden neun kontrollierte klinische Studien mit HBO bei 504 MS-Patienten durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse sind in einer Metaanalyse zusammengefasst (). Bis auf zwei Studien (, ) waren die Untersuchungen negativ (, ) oder wiesen sogar auf eine klinischer Verschlechterung hin (). Sowohl die Risiken als auch die Kosten der HBO sind beträchtlich, sodass von dieser Therapie bei MS abgeraten werden sollte. Fazit Für keine der unkonventionellen Therapien liegt ausreichend wissenschaftliche Evidenz vor, um sie empfehlen zu können. Die klinischen Studien sind überwiegend klein und methodisch mangelhaft. Die Studienergebnisse sind aber keinesfalls durchgehend negativ, es gibt zahlreiche Hinweise auf die Wirksamkeit mancher Therapien. Einige Untersuchungen deuten darauf hin, dass sich unkonventionelle Therapien weniger auf objektiv messbare Befunde der MS auswirken als vielmehr auf Selbstwahrnehmung, psychisches Wohlbefinden und Lebensqualität. Diese Hypothesen sollten mit geeigneten Zielkriterien in größeren Studien geprüft werden.

Lee Mosley, Natalie Perez, Alok Dhar, Howard E. Gendelman, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. The cause of motor neuron degeneration remains largely unknown, and there is no potent treatment. Overexpression of various human mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) genes in mice and rats recapitulates some of the clinical and pathological characteristics of sporadic and familial ALS. Glatiramer acetate (GA) is an approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and neuroprotective properties in some neurodegenerative conditions. A recent report suggested that GA immunization could delay disease progression in some, but not all, G93A SOD1 transgenic mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, it has been theorized that derivatives of GA could enhance immunogenicity and positively affect disease outcomes. The purpose of our study was to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of TV-5010, a high molecular weight GA, in three different SOD1 mutant mouse models. We used large numbers of two SOD1 transgenic mouse strains overexpressing the G93A mutation, B6SJL-TgN[SOD1-G93A]1Gur and B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J, and the SOD1 mutant mouse overexpressing G37R (line 29). Regardless of the frequency of injections and the dose, treatment with TV-5010 was ineffective at altering either disease onset or survival in both SOD1 G93A mutants used and in the SOD1 G37R transgenic mice; in multiple studies, disease was accelerated. These studies suggest that, at a range of dosing regimens and carrier used, TV-5010 immunization was ineffective in delaying disease in multiple preclinical therapeutic models for ALS. The biological response in animals, and ultimate clinical translation, will ultimately be dependent on careful and appropriate dose, route and carrier paradigms.

Greenberg, Dean Wingerchuk, , Michael Levy Background: Low 25-hydroxyvitaminDlevels have been associated with a higher risk of developing multiple sclerosis and increased relapse rates in patients with multiple sclerosis. As a sterol hormone involved in multiple immunologic pathways, vitamin D may play a role in preventing monophasic immune-mediated central nervous system attacks from developing into recurrent disease. Objective: To investigate the association between low serum vitamin D levels and recurrent spinal cord disease. Design, Setting, and Patients: We performed a retrospective analysis at Johns Hopkins Transverse Myelitis Center, Baltimore, Maryland, evaluating 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels in 77 patients with monophasic and recurrent inflammatory diseases of the spinal cord. Main Outcome Measure: Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Results: Vitamin D levels are significantly lower in patients who developed recurrent spinal cord disease, adjusting for season, age, sex, and race. Conclusions: This study provides a basis for a prospective trial of measuring 25-hydroxyvitaminDlevels in these patient populations and assessing the influence of vitamin D supplementation on the frequency of relapses in those with recurrent inflammatory spinal cord disease.

Sotirchos, , Andrew Aston, Olwen C. Murphy, Nicole Pellegrini, Nicholas Fioravante, Hunter Risher, Esther Ogbuokiri, Ohemaa Kwakyi, Brandon Toliver, Simidele Davis, Nicholas Luciano, , , , , Background: Studies evaluating associations between body mass index (BMI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures in multiple sclerosis (MS) are lacking. Objective: To assess whether elevated BMI is associated with accelerated retinal atrophy. Methods: In this observational study, 513 MS patients were followed with serial spectral-domain OCT for a median of 4.4 years. Participants were categorized as normal weight (BMI: 18.5–24.9 kg/m), overweight (BMI: 25–29.9 kg/m), and obese (BMI: ⩾30 kg/m). Participants with diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled hypertension and eyes with optic neuritis (ON) ⩽6 months prior to baseline OCT or during follow-up were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed with mixed-effects linear regression. Results: Obese patients (n = 146) exhibited accelerated rates of ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) atrophy relative to normal weight patients (n = 214; –0.57%/year (95% confidence interval (CI): –0.65% to –0.48%) versus –0.42%/year (95% CI: –0.49% to –0.35%); p = 0.012). GCIPL atrophy rate did not differ between overweight (n = 153) and normal weight patients (–0.47%/year vs –0.42%/year; p = 0.41). Each 1 kg/m higher BMI was associated with accelerated GCIPL (–0.011%/year; 95% CI: –0.019% to –0.004%; p = 0.003) atrophy. Multivariable analyses accounting for age, sex, race, MS subtype, and ON history did not alter the above findings. Conclusions: Elevated BMI, in the absence of overt metabolic comorbidities, may be associated with accelerated GCIPL atrophy. Obesity, a modifiable risk factor, may be associated with accelerated neurodegeneration in MS.

ce8ace1e-c920-4fbe-b15d-e66b9d1059e8,"Women with lupus had higher amounts of a specific bacterium in their gut, along with increased levels of an antibody to that bacterium. Bacteria and other microorganisms living in your gut, known as the microbiome, play a big role in . They help you digest food, provide essential vitamins and other nutrients, and help control your immune system. But when the intestinal communities are out of balance, they may contribute to health problems, including autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. A new study in women now suggests that systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus or SLE, is linked to the overgrowth of certain bacteria in the intestines. Lupus is a chronic disease that results in inflammation in many parts of the body, including the kidneys, heart, and brain. This disease, which is more common in women, is potentially life-threatening. Like other autoimmune diseases, lupus is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking a person’s own tissues, rather than foreign germs. In the study, researchers found that 61 women diagnosed with lupus had higher amounts of a gut bacterium known as , compared to 17 healthy women. The bacterium was also present in healthy women, but at much lower levels. “The results showed that lupus patients have gut microbiome patterns different from healthy individuals, and these changes correlated with disease activity,” said , a research professor in the department of medicine at the University at Buffalo, who was not involved in the study. The paper was published February 19 in the . Most people with lupus have times when their disease is mostly quiet, known as a remission. In between, symptoms can increase, or “flare.” The study found that levels increased in the gut during flares. Blood tests also showed a rise in antibodies — immune proteins — that bind to the bacterium during these times. Alexander said “the antibodies generated by the patient against this bacteria was directly proportional to the severity of the disease.” The authors of the paper caution that their results can’t show whether the overgrowth of s causes or triggers lupus, or if disease flares allow the bacterium to thrive in the gut. Dr. Martin Kriegel, PhD, an assistant professor of immunobiology and rheumatology at , who was not involved in the study, said it’s likely a “two-way street.” Alexander said the study strengthens the idea “that gut bacteria affect the disease lupus, and opens the door to developing prognostic tests that reveal the disease status of the lupus nephritis patient.” “However, a lot more work remains to be done,” she added. works on identifying specific bacteria that contribute to lupus. In a study published last month in , Kriegel and his colleagues found that a certain gut bacterium worsened the disease in lupus-prone mice. This bacterium, , is not the same as the one identified in women with lupus by the authors of the recent study. Kriegel said the “sheer number of bacteria in the gut makes it likely that not just one bacterium plays a role in lupus.” Nor do they all have the same impact on the disease. “There are some overlapping effects of certain bacteria,” said Kriegel, “but for the most part we found that different bacteria induce different aspects of the disease.” Lupus is a complex disease with a lot driving it. Even the “bad” bacteria involved in triggering the disease can be “good” in some people. “There are definitely genetic and other factors involved,” said Kriegel, “because the bacterium that we found — — is actually quite innocuous. It’s even promoted as a probiotic.” Preliminary studies with animal models point to possible treatments for lupus and other autoimmune diseases. One approach would be to alter the gut microbiome. This could be done by eliminating bad bacteria, such as with an antibiotic. However, antibiotics — which Kriegel described as “an atomic bomb to the microbiome” — can also kill good bacteria. In a study published last year in , Kriegel and his team developed a vaccine against a bacterium involved in lupus in mice. The vaccine primes the immune system to attack one specific bacterium while leaving other bacteria alone. Another option would be to increase the good bacteria, such as with probiotics — live bacteria ingested in pill form. Or with fecal transplants, in which gut bacteria are transferred from the gut of a healthy donor to a person with lupus. In the 2019 study, Kriegel’s lab gave resistant starch to lupus-prone mice, after which their disease symptoms lessened. “The diet change that we gave to the mice shifted the microbiome, so that good bacteria grew and produced factors that suppressed the bad bacteria,” said Kriegel. is a carbohydrate found in foods like green bananas, whole-grain oats, lentils, and cooked and cooled rice. It is fermented in the large intestine, where it feeds good bacteria in the gut. But all of these treatments were tested in mice and have yet to be tested or proven to work in people. Given the complex nature of lupus, it’s unlikely that treatment will be one-size-fits-all. This points toward a more personalized medicine approach to lupus. “There will be subgroups of patients with a certain disease that will benefit from modulating the microbiome in one way,” said Kriegel, “and another subset of patients that will benefit from altering it in another way.” Lupus is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes inflammation throughout your body.

Individuals are exposed to multiple factors, often simultaneously, and evaluating patterns of exposures and high-dimension interactions may allow for a better understanding of health risks at the individual level. When jointly evaluating high-dimensional exposures, common statistical methods should be integrated with machine learning techniques that may better account for complex settings.

While highlighting several advantages of the method, we also discuss specific drawbacks and practical issues that should be considered when using Logic regression in population-based studies. With this paper, we encourage researchers to explore the use of machine learning techniques when evaluating large-dimensional epidemiologic data, as well as advocate the need of further methodological work in the area.

The 184-kDa alsin protein, encoded by the full-length ALS2 gene, contains three different guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor-like domains, which may play a role in the etiology of the disease.

Four ALS2-deficient mouse models have been generated by different groups and used to study the behavioral and pathological impact of alsin deficiency. These mouse models largely fail to recapitulate hallmarks of motor neuron disease, but the subtle deficits that are observed in behavior and pathology have aided in our understanding of the relationship between alsin and motor dysfunction.

3647adda-ef9e-44f2-98ff-f8eca3472c1c,"Fingolimod vs Glatiramer Acetate in RRMS: We Have a Winner — Head-to-head ASSESS trial fulfills post-marketing commitment by SEATTLE -- Fingolimod (Gilenya) bested glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) at lowering relapses and disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS patients, the phase IIIb showed. Over 12 months, the annualized relapse rate was nearly 41% less patients taking fingolimod 0.5 mg compared with patients taking glatiramer acetate in the head-to-head trial, reported Bruce Cree, MD, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco, and colleagues, in a at the annual meeting. In addition, the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions and gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions were fewer with fingolimod, they added. Fingolimod thus becomes the first disease-modifying therapy to demonstrate superiority to glatiramer acetate, in terms of relapses and brain lesions, in a direct comparison. ""Head-to-head clinical trials are the optimal method for assessing the relative benefits and risks of treatments,"" Cree told ""In the ASSESS study, two doses of fingolimod -- 0.5 mg and 0.25 mg oral daily -- were compared to glatiramer acetate 20 mg subcutaneous daily,"" he said. ""Fingolimod 0.5 mg was shown to be superior to glatiramer acetate on reducing the risk of clinical relapses, as well as brain MRI measures of disease activity."" ""Although the 0.25 mg dose of fingolimod was superior to glatiramer acetate on some MRI measures, it was not significantly better than glatiramer acetate in reducing the risk of clinical relapse,"" Cree continued. ""These observations indicate that the 0.5 mg dose of fingolimod is the optimal dose for adult MS patients."" Fingolimod was the for multiple sclerosis to reach the market when the FDA approved it in 2010. Last year, it was approved as the first drug. The 0.5-mg dose is the one currently approved for adult patients and children weighing more than 40 kg. Serious but rare safety concerns have emerged in recent years, most recently that patients treated with fingolimod may experience when they stop taking the drug. In November 2018, the FDA added a new warning about this risk to fingolimod's . Previously, the agency had issued safety information about (PML) and recommendations with fingolimod use. Fingolimod's efficacy in relapsing MS was demonstrated in the phase III placebo-controlled and trials. Fingolimod also showed superior efficacy to intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex) in the head-to-head phase III study. The ASSESS study started in 2012 as part of a post-approval commitment to the FDA. In this multicenter, double-blinded trial, Cree and colleagues randomized 1,064 relapsing-remitting MS patients 1:1:1 to once-daily fingolimod 0.5 mg, fingolimod 0.25 mg, or subcutaneous glatiramer acetate 20 mg. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among treatment groups. In total, 859 participants completed the study. Over 12 months, fingolimod 0.5 mg significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) compared with glatiramer acetate: 0.153 versus 0.258, for a relative reduction of 40.7%;=0.0138. Fingolimod 0.25 mg showed numerically fewer relapses than glatiramer acetate (ARR 0.221 vs 0.258), but the relative reduction was not significant. Both doses of fingolimod led to a significant reduction in the mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI (54.4% relative reduction for the 0.5-mg dose and 42.1% for the 0.25-mg dose) and in gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions (55.6% fewer for both doses), compared with glatiramer acetate. Serious adverse events occurred in 7.3% of the 0.5 mg fingolimod group, 8.7% of the 0.25 fingolimod group, and 6.2% of the glatiramer acetate group. The most common serious event was MS relapse in all three groups. In addition, 0.9% of the 0.5-mg fingolimod group and 1.1% of the 0.25-mg group developed basal cell carcinoma, which occurred in none of the patients treated with glatiramer acetate. ""Unexpected safety signals were not observed in this clinical trial,"" Cree noted. ""The adverse events that occurred were consistent with the established safety profile of both fingolimod and glatiramer acetate."" The study was sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Cree has received personal compensation for consulting from AbbVie, Akili, Biogen, EMD Serono, and Novartis.

The study population was defined as regular active-duty military personnel deployed to the Persian Gulf War theater for one or more days from August 8, 1990-July 31, 1991. The authors obtained information on deployment dates from the Defense Manpower Data Center, Seaside, CA. The study included only 18 cases of ALS in total (six among deployed veterans) and was also limited by its exclusive use of Department of Defense (DOD) hospitalization records, inclusion of only active-duty military personnel, and no more than 6 years of followup (through July 1997). The mean duration of active service during the followup period was only 3.4 years for Gulf War veterans and 3.8 years for nondeployed veterans. This study has been superseded by others with more inclusive populations and longer periods of followup. Kang and Bullman (2001) performed a study to investigate causes of death of Gulf War veterans compared with concurrently serving veterans who were not deployed. Vital status and cause of death were determined from a variety of databases for 621,902 veterans who served in the Persian Gulf before the termination of hostilities and for 746,248 non-gulf-deployed Gulf War-era veterans, stratified by branch of service. The Gulf War veterans included in the study arrived in the Persian Gulf prior to March 1, 1991. That date was chosen in order to exclude those who arrived in the Persian Gulf theater after hostilities had ended and, therefore, might not have received “exposures of concern” (for example, chemical and biologic warfare agents, certain vaccines, and pyridostigmine bromide). The authors obtained information on deployment dates from the Defense Manpower Data Center. For disease-specific death determination, cause of death was obtained from death certificates. Followup terminated at death or on December 31, 1997, providing a maximum followup of slightly less than 7 years. The investigators found no specific cause of death that occurred with greater frequency in the veteran group that actively served in the Gulf War Theater. With respect to ALS, no excess risk was observed in the Gulf War veterans; an imprecisely ""2 Evidence Regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans."" Institute of Medicine. 2006. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11757. estimated risk ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.21–1.66) adjusted for age (in years), race, sex, branch of service, unit component, and marital status was reported. The authors did not provide the number of cases of ALS that they identified. It could be argued that the risk reduction (the point estimate was less than 1) is of the same order of magnitude as the increases in relative risk reported in other studies described in this chapter. However, this study was uninformative because of its wide confidence limits and the short followup period (it encompassed only about 7 years after the war). Haley (2003) found an excess incidence of ALS among deployed Gulf War veterans in comparison with the expected incidence based on US vital statistics. The study population was defined as the approximately 695,000 members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard who served in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations from August 1990-April 1991. The analysis spanned 1991–1998. In the first half of that period, the increase in incidence was not apparent (standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 0.94; 95% CI, 0.26–2.41), but from 1995 to 1998 the increase was more than double (SMR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.27–3.88). Incidence peaked in the final year of analysis (1998: SMR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.03–7.43) and increased markedly from 1991 to 1998 (p=0.05). Although the study used passive and active means of case ascertainment similar to those of Horner et al. (2003) (described below), it differed in several key respects: it restricted cases to those below the age of 45 years (instead of all ages); accepted only clinically definite cases of ALS (instead of clinically definite, probable, and suspect cases); used 8 years of followup (instead of 10); and used as a comparison population the age-adjusted rates from US mortality statistics (instead of age-adjusted rates in non-gulf-deployed Gulf War-era veterans). The major criticism of this study is its use of mortality statistics from the general population to estimate the “expected” incidence (Armon 2004c). Mortality may underestimate incidence of ALS (Armon 2004a). In addition, age at onset of ALS was defined as age at death minus 2 years. The calculations for the expected number of cases were age-adjusted but were not sex-adjusted. Because the majority of the deployed Gulf War veterans were men ""2 Evidence Regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans."" Institute of Medicine. 2006. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11757. and mortality from ALS is higher in men (Armon 2004a), those calculations may have resulted in an overestimation of the SMR. In summary, Haley’s analyses may have underestimated the expected rates in the comparison population, thereby making SMRs appear higher. Because of the limitations discussed above, the meaning of Haley’s study results remains uncertain. Horner and colleagues conducted a nationwide epidemiologic study with the goal of identifying all new occurrences of ALS among deployed and nondeployed veterans in the 10 years after the end of the Gulf War (Horner et al. 2003). All active-duty and mobilized Reserves and National Guard personnel were eligible if they had served for at least 1 month at any time during the period August 2, 1990-July 31, 1991 (defined as the Gulf War period). Military personnel were considered deployed if they were in the gulf region or received hazardous duty pay during the Gulf War. All other individuals in the study population were defined as nondeployed, although they may have been stationed outside of the US. Information on deployment status and dates was obtained from the Defense Manpower Data Center. The authors used active and passive methods of case ascertainment; active methods included screening of inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy medical databases of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and DOD. For the passive methods, they established a toll-free telephone number and conducted solicitations through relevant Internet sites and mass mailings of study brochures to practicing VA neurologists and to members of the American Academy of Neurology. For all cases originally identified, they determined eligibility; and for all cases included in the analyses presented, the diagnosis of ALS was verified with medical-record or mortality-record review. Among nearly 2.5 million eligible military personnel, they identified and confirmed 107 cases of ALS, which yielded an age-adjusted average annual incidence of 0.43 per 100,000 persons. Most of the cases (about 86%) were found through active ascertainment methods. Nearly 700,000 of the 2.5 million military personnel had been deployed to the gulf region and are referred to as deployed military personnel hereafter. Comparing deployed ""2 Evidence Regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans."" Institute of Medicine. 2006. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11757. with nondeployed personnel, Horner et al. observed an almost doubled age-adjusted risk of ALS (RR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.29–2.84). The risk of ALS was increased among deployed active-duty veterans (RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.38–3.36). There was also an increase in the risk of ALS among deployed veterans who served in the reserves or National Guard (RR, 2.50; 95% CI, 0.88–7.07), although the estimate for this smaller group was less precise. Further subgroup analyses by service branch confirmed increased risks for Air Force personnel (RR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.24–5.78) and Army personnel (RR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.10–3.77); for other service branches, the numbers of ALS cases observed were small and rendered the comparison of deployed with nondeployed personnel less informative. Overall, the authors estimated the excess risk attributable to deployment to be 18% (95% CI 4.9%–29.4%), and the risk difference to be 0.32 per 100,000 persons per year. The foremost limitation of this study lies in the potential for underascertainment of cases, which, if different between deployed and nondeployed groups, may have resulted in overestimation or underestimation of the risk. For example, underascertainment might occur if nondeployed veterans with ALS were less likely to be listed in the record systems used for active case identification or had less incentive to participate in the study than deployed personnel. Because of the rarity of ALS, differential underascertainment of even a small number of cases might exaggerate differences between groups considerably. The concern that ALS would more likely be underascertained in nondeployed than in deployed personnel, thus creating the impression that nondeployed veterans suffered a lower rate of the disease, was raised in a letter to the editor of Neurology by Carmel Armon, an ALS researcher (Armon 2004b). In a followup of the study of Horner et al., Coffman and colleagues (2005) formally assessed the potential impact of such a bias by using three statistical modeling methods known as capture-recapture methods: log-linear modeling, the sample coverage approach, and ecologic modeling. On the basis of the three modeling approaches, the investigators concluded that a modest underascertainment of cases among nondeployed military personnel might have occurred, whereas little or no underascertainment was apparent in deployed personnel. However, even after correcting the ALS rates among ""2 Evidence Regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans."" Institute of Medicine. 2006. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11757. the nondeployed for underascertainment, the investigators still estimated an increased age-adjusted risk of ALS in the deployed military personnel (RR, 1.77; lower bound, 1.21 with the log-linear model). Those results confirmed the original findings of Horner et al. (2003). However, their validity relies on the assumption that the number of underascertained cases in nondeployed military personnel derived from the models is a correct approximation of the number of cases missed. Armon (2004b) pointed out that the Horner et al. estimated rates for nondeployed personnel were lower than the age-adjusted rates reported in a high-quality population-based study of ALS conducted in Washington state by McGuire et al. (1996). Armon presented a table with ALS incidence rates standardized to the 1990 US population for deployed and nondeployed personnel (3.6 and 1.4 per 100,000 people per year, respectively; reported by Horner et. al.) and for the population from McGuire et al. (2.1 per 100,000 people per year; calculated by Armon). However, dividing the incidence rates in deployed personnel by the incidence rates in the McGuire et al. population (serving as the comparison group), the RR is 1.7. This result is similar to the RR estimates using the capture-recapture analyses (Coffman et al. 2005). Using the McGuire et al. rates lends further support to the Horner et al. results because even if there was underascertainment of ALS among the nondeployed military personnel (resulting in lower rates in that comparison group), the rates among deployed personnel were still higher than those reported by McGuire et al. The committee discussed the implications of the decision by Horner et al. to use persons rather than person-time to calculate risk ratios. In order for that approach not to have resulted in bias, the investigators had to make the following assumptions: (1) that the disease is rare, and removing cases from the denominator will affect followup time minimally at worst, and (2) that the cohort is young and healthy enough not to experience competing risks or loss, which would remove subjects from the person-time denominator during followup (that is, that loss to followup or right censoring is minimal). The committee believes that those assumptions are reasonable for this cohort and the 10-year followup time after the Gulf War. ""2 Evidence Regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans."" Institute of Medicine. 2006. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11757. Weisskopf et al. (2005) published the results of an analysis of a cohort study in which they examined the relationship between self-report of military service and death from ALS. The study subjects were drawn from male participants in an ongoing cohort, the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS II) cohort. The CPS II cohort, assembled in 1982, included a total of 508,334 men who completed a four-page questionnaire at baseline. The CPS II cohort was originally designed as a prospective cohort study to examine environmental and lifestyle risk factors in the etiology of cancer. The information collected also included data on military service. In the self-administered questionnaire, military service was determined by the question “Were you in the US armed services?” For those who reported military service, followup questions were included to collect information on the branch, the location, and the years of service. At baseline, persons who did not respond to the military-service questions were excluded (N=6,854). Because monitoring for the occurrence of ALS during followup was not included as part of the CPS II, the authors used ALS mortality as the outcome. To ascertain ALS mortality, the CPS II cohort records were linked to the National Death Index and death certificates were obtained. The CPS II cohort was established in 1982, but ALS deaths were not coded separately on death certificates before 1989. Therefore, the statistical analysis included followup (from 1989 to 1998) of only the cohort members alive in 1989 (N=408,288). During the followup period, 280 deaths of which ALS was the underlying or contributory cause were identified in the cohort of more than 400,000 participants. Of the 280 deaths, 217 were among 281,874 men who reported military service, and 63 were among 126,414 men who reported no military service. Cox proportional-hazards analysis with adjustment for differences in age, smoking history, education, alcohol consumption, self-reported exposure to pesticides and herbicides, and several main lifetime occupations (farming, jobs involving electrical work or welding, and food preparation) showed that persons who reported any military service were 1.5 times more likely to have died with a notation of ALS on their death certificates as those who reported no military service. For different branches of the military, risk ""2 Evidence Regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans."" Institute of Medicine. 2006. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11757. appeared higher among those who reported serving in the Army and National Guard (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09–2.17) and in the Navy (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.28–2.74). Increases in risk (although not reaching conventional levels of significance) were also found in those who served in the Air Force and Coast Guard. There was no evidence of an increased risk for those people who served in the Marine Corps. The authors also examined ALS mortality according to the number of years of military service; there was an increase in risk regardless of the number of years of service. Finally, they examined the risk in relation to service during periods of war (that is, World War II, Korea, or Vietnam) as well as the number of wars during the period of service. Increase in ALS mortality was found to be similar across the three wars, with the RR reaching conventional levels of statistical significance only for service during World War II, the subgroup with the largest sample size. There was some evidence of a trend toward increasing risk as the number of wars during the service period increased from zero to more than two. Although the study was large, the interpretation of the results is limited by the use of self-report of military service and the use of ALS mortality as a proxy for ALS incidence. The first limitation is mitigated somewhat because most people who have been in the military are likely to remember their service, and the report of military service took place some time prior to the onset of disease and is thus independent of subsequent ALS status. However, the use of mortality data rather than incidence data is a weakness. Nevertheless, the fact that the median survival in ALS is 3 years means that mortality data for ALS can be a good proxy for incidence data. The use of death certificates to ascertain death from ALS, however, is a potential problem because of inaccuracy of death certificate reporting of ALS. However, given the inevitable progression of ALS, it is unlikely that a large number of cases would be miscoded on death certificates. Even if some miscoding occurred, it probably was not related to military service inasmuch as the data were recorded before the putative link between service in the Gulf War and ALS had been widely reported. Weisskopf et al. have reported on the first study of ALS and military service in which sufficient data to adjust for lifestyle factors and occupation ""2 Evidence Regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans."" Institute of Medicine. 2006. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11757. were available. Such adjustments did not materially change the effect estimates. A letter to the editor of the journal after publication of the Weisskopf et al. study raised a concern about the use of a cohort of subjects originally recruited for a cancer study. The authors of the letter suggested that the volunteer cohort might have been healthier than nonparticipants and the occurrence of ALS might have been underestimated (Horner et al. 2005). Weisskopf et al. replied that they were not concerned that the association that they found between military service and ALS mortality could have been due to the self-selection of healthy volunteers. They supported their view by showing that the age-specific death rates from ALS in the cohort were similar to those in the US population. The study by Weisskopf et al. is the first to suggest a relationship between military service before the Gulf War and ALS mortality. While the study does have limitations inherent in an analysis of a cohort assembled for other purposes, the findings are intriguing. The implication is that military service in general—not confined to exposures specific to the Gulf War—is related to the development of ALS. The findings, if validated in other studies, suggest that exposures during military service, even among those with no wartime service, might be responsible. The committee identified one high-quality cohort study that examined the relationship between serving in the military and development of ALS (Weisskopf et al. 2005). The study authors reported an increased risk of ALS among men who served in the military in the period 1910–1982, regardless of which war or wars the men served in. Risk was also increased among men who served in the military during nonwartime periods. Although the study has some limitations (such as lack of confirmation of ALS diagnosis because the data came from death certificates), overall it was a well-designed and well-conducted study. It adequately controlled for confounding factors (age, cigarette use, alcohol consumption, education, self-reported exposure to pesticides and herbicides, and several main lifetime occupations). ""2 Evidence Regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans."" Institute of Medicine. 2006. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11757. Three other studies corroborate the findings of the Weisskopf et al. study regarding service in the military and development of ALS. Horner et al. (2003), Haley (2003), and Smith et al. (2000) reported associations between deployment to the Gulf War and ALS. Although the Horner et al. study was well conducted and provides some evidence regarding military service and development of ALS, it is limited by the potential for underascertainment of cases in the comparison group. The Haley study had additional methodologic limitations. Mortality statistics from the general population were used to estimate the expected incidence, and the calculation of expected incidence was age-adjusted but not sex-adjusted. Both limitations may have underestimated the expected incidence of ALS. A study using hospitalization records of Gulf War veterans still on active duty suggested an increased risk of ALS (Smith et al. 2000). Several problems are related to the design of the study, and the committee found it to be of little value in its assessment. Finally, a mortality study of Gulf War veterans did not report an increase in the risk of ALS (Kang and Bullman 2001); again, multiple methodologic problems limit its value in the committee’s assessment. On the basis of its evaluation of the literature, the suggestive evidence of an association between military Armon C. 2004a. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature MyNAP members save 10% online. or to save! Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) our Lou Gehrig's disease is a fatal, mostly non-familial disease that affects the nervous system of humans by causing the degeneration of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The degeneration halts communication between the nervous system and voluntary muscles in the body. This leads to muscle paralysis and eventually the muscles that aid in breathing are affect; causing respiration to fail. The disease, which affects 20,000-30,000 men and women in the United States at any given time, has no effective treatment; most people with ALS die from respiratory failure within 5 years of the onset of symptoms. Recent epidemiologic studies report an association between the development of ALS and prior service in the U.S. military. The studies evaluated either veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf War or veterans who served in the military in the period 1910-1982. Due to these findings, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) asked the National Academies to conduct an assessment of the potential relationship between military service and the later development of ALS. The project was assigned to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which appointed a committee and gave it the task of evaluating the scientific literature on ALS in veterans. The committee began its work by identifying medical and scientific literature on ALS. PubMed, a database created and managed by the National Library of Medicine. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans; Review of the Scientific Literature presents the findings of this committee. The committee reviewed, evaluated, and summarized the scientific literature on ALS in veterans, composed primarily of peer-reviewed, published literature. This report includes the recommendations of the committee. 2 Evidence Regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Veterans A Examples of Risk Factors Possibly Relevant to Military Service B Possible Conceptual Models Linking Military Service and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Students who want to study financial services at the master's degree level may enroll in either a Master of Science (MS) or a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program. Both programs provide training in business and financial analysis. Some courses may be offered online. The goal of a Master of Science program in Services is to prepare students for careers in a financial services-related field, such as financial planning or financial analysis. Students gain advanced knowledge in financial planning tools, analysis strategies, and implementation methods. Programs require 30-36 credit hours. Some programs are offered online, but necessitate that certain requirements be fulfilled on campus. Common course titles include: Master of Business Administration in Financial Services In addition to the generalized business courses of an MBA, these programs incorporate courses specific to financial services. They tend to emphasize financial technology and communications more than MS programs. The goal is for graduates to be able to apply their knowledge to specific business environments based on the financial interests of customers or companies. Example course titles include: Financial service careers are available in a wide variety of settings, including: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predicts that for financial analysts will increase by 6% between 2018 and 2028. These workers earned a median salary of $85,660 in 2018, according to the BLS. After three years of experience, graduates of programs registered with the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. may sit for the Certified Financial Planner (CFC) examination. Eligibility also includes passing a background check and the standards of conduct of the board. Certification must be renewed biannually. Requirements include a 2-CEU class in either ethics or standards, as well as 28 hours in other accepted topics. Independent study programs, teaching and live presentations may be acceptable for up to 15 hours of the required CEUs. In conclusion, MS and MBA programs in financial services prepare students for high-level careers in the field and professional certification.

Between 2018 and 2028, the BLS projects that job opportunities for economists will grow 8%. The BLS also predicts that employment for financial examiners will grow 7% during the same period. Financial examiners earned $80,180 as a median annual wage in May 2018. Graduates may pursue a doctorate degree in global economics. While many organizations seek applicants with a bachelor's degree for entry-level positions, a master's degree is often required for more advanced roles, and a Ph.D. may be required for top jobs. A Ph.D. is also required for those interested in teaching at the college level. A master's degree in international economics provides students with a comprehensive education in global business, including issues related to banking and finance. Graduates are prepared for advanced careers or further study in the field.

Filing a disability claim for Social Security benefits may be a complicated or even an overwhelming task. Even if the person claiming benefits has satisfied the requirements of the law and has a strong case, there are pitfalls. Many claims are denied when first filed and must be resubmitted or appealed. A successful claim may need the support of experts in medicine, law, psychology and social work. This task is often beyond the abilities of injured, disabled or sick workers. A Social Security Advocate is skilled in assembling that evidence, following applicable rules, submitting the application with supporting material and then representing the client throughout the process. College degree required in many cases. Some positions require law degree. Law degree required for some jobs, other positions have no specific license or certification requirements. Representative must not be disqualified, suspended or legally prevented from acting as a representative or dealing with the Social Security Administration. Organizing supporting material or witnesses, critical thinking, presenting arguments to application authorities, legal and case-law knowledge. $115,820 for lawyers in general. No specific figure for Social Security Disability attorneys or advocates. Sources: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, (May, 2015) Students pursuing a career as a disability advocate may seek an education in law or social work to qualify as an advocate. Training or education in the medical field can also prepare the student to work with disabled clients. Some Social Security disability advocates are lawyers, but it is not always a requirement. Advocates who are lawyers must be legally able to practice in the United States. The Social Security Administration () requires non-attorney representatives for disability claimants be of good character and capable of providing valuable advice to clients. In addition, the representative must not be disqualified, suspended or legally prevented from acting as a representative or dealing with the Social Security Administration. Step 2: Gain Experience Working in a Case Management Position Work experience in worker's compensation, social services, healthcare and case management can provide aspiring advocates with the skills needed to work with Social Security claimants. Employers seeking attorney advocates may require litigation experience to assist claimants in appeals hearings. Social Security disability advocates may apply to an advocacy or law firm for employment. Social Security representatives may also work as an independent advocate providing services to clients. Step 4: Continuing Education for Career Advancement A common way to advance a career within the field of social work is to obtain advanced degrees, certificates, or credentials. Bachelor's, master's and even law degrees may be necessary to achieve desired career goals.

It can cause symptoms that come and go, including numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, vision problems and trouble walking or talking. In this protocol, learn about the causes of MS and what treatments are available. Discover how an imbalanced immune system contributes to the inflammation that drives the disease. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to modulate the immune response in MS and help improve symptoms, in some clinical trials. What is Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath—the coating that insulates and protects neurons. This demyelination causes disruptions in neural communication and potentially neuronal death, leading to disability. MS may follow several disease courses, the most common of which is relapsing remitting. Relapsing remitting MS is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks followed by periods of remission. Natural interventions such as vitamin D and essential fatty acids may help relieve inflammation and improve symptoms of MS. What are the Risk Factors for Multiple Sclerosis? Genetic predisposition Viral infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) Vitamin D deficiency Hormonal imbalance Exposure to organic solvents Food sensitivities Smoking What are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Note: Symptoms of MS vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms may include: Fatigue Numbness or tingling in limbs Impaired vision Muscle weakness, clumsiness Loss of balance, dizziness, potential nausea and vomiting Bladder dysfunction Changes in memory, reasoning, and spatial perception What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis? Note: There is currently no cure for MS. Treatments include therapies to calm acute attacks, slow or modify the disease course, and alleviate symptoms. Several experimental therapies are currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Therapies for acute attacks: Corticosteroids Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange to remove inflammatory factors and antibodies) Disease-modifying therapies: Beta interferons to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression Glatiramer acetate, an immunomodulator Immunosuppressant drugs (eg, mitoxantrone) Monoclonal antibodies (eg, natalizumab) Dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker, to increase the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses Symptom management may include: muscle relaxants medications to reduce fatigue antidepressants What are Additional Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis? Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech therapy Cognitive rehabilitation Vocational rehabilitation Swank low-fat diet Hormone therapy What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Multiple Sclerosis? Vitamin D. As vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS, supplementation may be helpful. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that MS patients taking vitamin D had fewer relapses and less inflammation. Essential fatty acids. Omega-3 (ie, DHA and EPA) and certain omega-6 (ie, GLA) fatty acids have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve some symptoms of MS. Antioxidants. Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, and MS patients tend to have low levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione peroxidase. Supplementing with selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, and/or N-acetylcysteine may boost glutathione peroxidase levels for potential benefits. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to inhibit the activity of ICAM-1, a protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Supplementation with lipoic acid reduced ICAM-1 levels and T-cell migration into the central nervous system in patients with MS. Vitamin B12. Patients with MS may be deficient in vitamin B12. Supplementation has been shown in several studies to improve symptoms and the clinical course of the disease in patients with MS. Biotin. Biotin (vitamin B7) has demonstrated positive effects in patients with MS. Studies showed high doses of biotin improved measures of MS-related disabilities in some patients. Other natural interventions that may benefit patients with MS include coenzyme Q10, ginkgo biloba, green tea, and curcumin. 2 Introduction Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of autoimmunity and inflammation characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath that insulates and protects neurons. When a patient experiences an ""attack,"" or episode of increased disease activity, the resultant impairment of neuronal communication can manifest as a broad spectrum of symptoms, affecting sensory processing, locomotion, and cognition. Scientific research suggests both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease. Current medical treatments for MS include potent immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce immune function, and anti-inflammatory medications as well as invasive procedures such as plasma exchange, which attempts to reduce inflammatory mediators in a patient's blood. Largely ignored and discounted by mainstream medicine, nutrients offer immune-modifying benefits that can help complement pharmacological and clinical interventions and improve quality of life for MS patients. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests vitamin D may be a missing link in virtually all autoimmune diseases, including MS. This single vitamin has the ability to modulate the immune system in ways that even pharmaceutical drugs cannot. A multitude of epidemiological studies have revealed that individuals with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are at considerably increased risk for developing MS; in fact, up to 90% of MS patients are deficient in vitamin D.1 3 Understanding Multiple Sclerosis Within the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) a vast network of neurons are constantly communicating amongst themselves, and with the peripheral nervous system (outside of the brain and spinal cord), to control every aspect of human function, from sight and hearing, to cognition and mobility. The efficiency and accuracy of communication between individual neurons form the basis for our ability to do things as diverse as complete simple daily tasks and comprehend complex philosophical or mathematical ideas. Neuronal communication is similar to the transmission of an electrical current through a series of wires. Droves of neurons work together to deliver messages to every corner of the body by transmitting signals along their long, cylindrical mid-sections called axons and passing it on to the next neuron. This is repeated until the message reaches its destination. Like electrical wires, neuronal axons require insulation to ensure that they are able to transmit a signal accurately, and at high speeds. Specialized cells called oligodendrocytes provide this insulation to neurons by wrapping the axons in an insulating material called myelin. Without this myelin sheath, neuronal communication becomes nearly impossible, and neurons become susceptible to damage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease which ultimately leads to the inability of neurons to communicate amongst themselves. Because multiple sclerosis is not selective for specific neurons, and can progress through the brain and spinal cord randomly, each patient's symptoms may vary considerably. During the initial stages of the disease, symptoms often emerge for a finite time before regressing for an extended period. 4 Pathology of Disease Progression Demyelination MS is an immuno-inflammatory disease in which immune cells enter the central nervous system (CNS) and destroy the myelin sheath. Immune cells, which become activated through complex mechanisms migrate into the CNS, and attack the myelin sheath. The resultant demyelination is thought to be carried out by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages, three primary classes of immune cells, which are routinely found in MS lesions.2 Loss of myelin followed by subsequent lack of neural communication and neuronal death is accepted as the primary cause of disability in MS patients.3 Axonal transection, or the severing of axons, occurs under conditions of both acute and chronic demyelination.4-6 Remyelination Remyelination is the process by which demyelinated axons are naturally re-wrapped with myelin, restoring nerve conduction and functionality.7 This phenomenon is the result of oligodendrocytes repairing the damage to the myelin sheath that occurs during an episode of increased disease activity. However, as the disease progresses over years (usually decades) the oligodendrocytes begin to lose their ability to repair the damage, and symptoms become progressively worse and episodes more frequent due to remyelination failure. In addition to developing therapies that slow MS disease progression, many laboratories are developing novel therapeutics that aim to promote remyelination and reverse existing CNS damage. Inflammation In addition to immune-mediated loss of myelin, another characteristic feature of MS is inflammation caused by a class of white blood cells called T cells.8,9 Some of the damage in the CNS is directly carried out by two subpopulations of T lymphocytes called T helper 1 and T helper 17 which produce pro-inflammatory factors.10 Recent studies have identified that chemical mediators, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), contribute to the autoimmune characteristics of these T cells. Data suggest absence of these pro-inflammatory signals was sufficient to prevent inflammation in the brain.11 This suggests that therapeutic strategies directed at blocking the production of inflammatory mediators could be effective for treating MS. Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Panacea? Mainstream medicine has failed to recognize the pivotal role of vitamin D in regulating the overactive immune system in MS patients. Greater than 30 years have passed since vitamin D was originally hypothesized to be an important environmental determinant of the prevalence of MS.12,13 During the three decades following the initial linking of vitamin D and MS, evidence has continued to mount. It is now known that MS occurs more frequently in individuals with lower blood levels of vitamin D. A study published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association found that, compared to those with the highest vitamin D blood levels, those with the lowest blood levels were 62% more likely to develop MS. MS attacks occur less frequently during seasons corresponding with the highest exposure to sunlight; since vitamin D synthesis depends upon exposure of the skin to sunlight, the summer months also bring the highest blood levels of vitamin D.14 A recent study has quantified the impact of vitamin D blood levels on risk for MS relapse—for each 4 ng/ml increase in 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the blood, the risk for MS relapse is reduced by 12%. The investigators who conducted this study concluded that ""Clinically, raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels by [20 ng/ml] could halve the hazard of a relapse.""15 Vitamin D mediates these disease-modifying effects through complex and powerful interactions with the immune system. Hostile immune cells, which attack the myelin sheath, are calmed upon exposure to vitamin D. In fact, when aggressive immune cells taken directly from MS patients are exposed to the active form of vitamin D, the cells divide and reproduce much more slowly, indicating that vitamin D has the ability to impede the aberrant autoimmunity that is a driving force in MS. However, vitamin D does more than just arrest damaging immune cells; it also supercharges protective immune cells. T-reg cells are specialized components of the immune system that help keep immunity balanced. If too few T-reg cells are present, the immune system becomes overactive, as in autoimmune diseases like MS. Vitamin D increases the number of protective T-reg cells, restoring equilibrium to an overactive immune system.16 In a randomized controlled trial, supplementation with doses of vitamin D ranging from 10,000 IU to 40,000 IU daily over the course of 52 weeks resulted in a reduction in relapses and a reduction in the number of aggressive immune cells in patients with MS.17 Despite robust findings across a range of studies on the link between vitamin D and MS, mainstream medicine and the federal government have only just recently begun to realize the need to initiate federally funded trials. Results of a large scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the effects of vitamin D in MS are currently pending.1 Life Extension customers should not be surprised if vitamin D emerges as a frontline treatment for MS in the coming years. However, instead of waiting for mainstream physicians to begin recommending vitamin D to MS patients, Life Extension suggests all individuals monitor their blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and maintain a blood level of 50–80 ng/mL. This is because low vitamin D levels are also an emerging risk factor for numerous other diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.18-22 The amount of supplementation required to achieve this blood level varies from person to person, but it appears many individuals require supplementation of 5,000‒8,000 IU vitamin D daily to reach these levels. More information about the role of vitamin D in health is available in the compelling Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""Startling Findings About Vitamin D Levels in Life Extension Members."" 5 Risk Factors for MS Genetics and Family History Studies have established a definitive role for genetics as contributing factor for developing MS. The most compelling data reveal that while unrelated adopted siblings have a 0‒2% disease risk, identical twins demonstrate a 25% disease risk.23 Several studies have identified susceptibility genes related to many aspects of immune function.24-28 While these genetic links are helpful in understanding MS population clusters, findings such as the 25% disease risk among identical twins and the geographic distribution of MS suggest that up to 75% of MS must be attributable to non-genetic or environmental factors. Infection Infection is one of the more widely suspected non-genetic risk factors for MS. Data suggest that, in genetically predisposed individuals, exposure to an infectious agent may lead to MS.29 One common theory, molecular mimicry, proposes that presentation of foreign antigens that are molecularly similar to self-antigens leads to an autoimmune response.30,31 In other words, viruses involved in the development of autoimmune diseases could possibly display very similar proteins to the proteins found on nerves making these nerves also a target for antibodies. Investigators have probed the involvement of several viruses including: herpes simplex virus (HSV), rubella, measles, mumps, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV).32 Currently, the strongest evidence for the involvement of an infectious agent implicates EBV. Virtually all patients who have MS are infected with the EBV.32 Further, levels of antibodies to EBV are strongly correlated with the risk of developing the disease.33 Low Vitamin D Levels Considering the regulatory role that vitamin D plays in immune system reactivity, it is not surprising that population-based studies have consistently found lower levels of vitamin D in the blood of patients with MS compared to healthy control subjects. Data from the Nurses' Health Study (more than 92,000 women followed from 1980 to 2000) and the Nurses' Health Study II (more than 95,000 women followed from 1991 to 2001), support the notion of a protective effect for vitamin D against the risk of developing MS. The incidence of MS was 33% lower in women that consumed the most vitamin D as compared to those that consumed the least. In addition, those that consumed at least 400 IU daily of vitamin D from supplements had an astounding 41% lower incidence of MS.18 In a recent study, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco discovered low 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels in African Americans with MS as compared to controls.34 The senior author, who is also the associate director of UCSF Multiple Sclerosis Center concluded, ""It seems relatively clear low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis."" Hormones Studies have shown that MS is more common in women than men, and that the disease course is affected by the fluctuation of steroid hormones during the female menstrual cycle.35 It is also widely reported that MS patients who become pregnant experience a significant decrease in relapses, enabling women who have MS to bear children safely.36 Animal models of multiple sclerosis have shown that the pregnancy hormone, estriol, can ameliorate disease and can cause an immune shift.36,37 Other studies note that pregnant women who have MS tend to experience a rebound of their disease within three months post-delivery.38 These findings suggest hormones can regulate the course of MS, and this theory is further supported by research demonstrating that steroid hormones (eg, estrogens, testosterone, progesterone, and, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) can modulate the immune system.39-41 The specific relationship of hormones to the disease process of MS is complex, with ratios between the individual hormones also playing a role. For example, during a human study that examined the presence of MS lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients with high estradiol and low progesterone levels had more lesions that those who had low levels of both hormones. Further, patients with a high estrogen to progesterone ratio had a significantly greater number of ""active,"" inflamed lesions than patients who had a low ratio.42 These studies suggest that maintaining youthful hormone balance may ease the symptoms of MS. A study from Italy provided further evidence that abnormal hormone levels may play a role in the development of MS. The investigators measured hormone levels in 35 women and 25 men with MS, and in 36 people without the disease. Women with low testosterone levels were found to have more brain tissue damage, as determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The women with MS had lower levels of testosterone throughout their monthly cycle compared to women who did not have the condition. Testosterone levels did not vary between men with MS and unaffected men. However, men with MS who had the highest levels of the female hormone estradiol were found to have the greatest degree of brain tissue damage.43 More information about optimizing and balancing hormone levels can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols. Organic Solvents In the mid-1990s, researchers in Sweden evaluated 13 studies investigating the connection between solvent exposure and autoimmune disease. Organic solvents include chemicals such as toluene, paint thinner, and acetone, the latter of which is commonly found in nail polish remover. Ten of those studies indicated a significant relationship between organic solvent exposure and MS. All of the analyses suggested exposure to solvents increases a person's relative risk of developing MS.44 In another study scientists analyzed the occupational health records of more than 57,000 workers in Norway, covering a 16-year period. They concluded that workers, such as painters, who are routinely exposed to organic solvents, had twice the risk of developing MS than those who were not occupationally exposed. These results were compatible with the hypothesis that organic solvents are a possible risk factor for MS.45 Individuals interested in protecting themselves from organic solvents and other environmental toxins should read Life Extension's ""Metabolic Detoxification"" protocol. Food Sensitivities Sensitivities to certain foods may also play a role in the development or exacerbation of MS. Antibodies to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, is more common in patients with MS.46,47 MS is also most prevalent in areas where consumption of wheat gluten and milk are also high.48 This relationship led scientists to explore a possible link between antibodies produced to bovine milk proteins and the ability of those antibodies to cross-react to the protective sheathes around nerves triggering an MS episode. Indeed, this immunologic cross-reactivity has been demonstrated in the laboratory in rodents that have MS.49,50 Further investigations have revealed that in MS patients, higher levels of these antibodies are produced within the central nervous system.51 Additional studies are still needed to understand how this cross-reactivity plays into the development and progression of MS. To help rule out food sensitivities, Life Extension suggests blood testing such as the Food Safe Allergy test and the Celiac Disease Antibody Screen. Call 800-226-2370 for more information on how to obtain this type of testing. Additional information about food allergies is available in the Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""What's Really Making You Sick?"" Smoking A recently published literature review, evaluating more than 3,000 MS cases and 450,000 controls, supports the emerging consensus that smoking increases the risk of developing MS by approximately 50%.52 It is unlikely that smoking alone accounts for the worldwide variation in MS prevalence, and thus, the interplay between genetic markers and smoking has also been investigated. One such study reported that smokers that have two known genetic markers for MS had two times the risk for developing MS than their non-smoking counterparts.53 Another study has also verified that smokers diagnosed with MS but in remission have 3.5 times the risk of reactivating and progression of their disease than their non-smoking counterparts.54,55 6 Symptoms and Diagnosis MS can affect people of all ages; however, the average age of disease onset is between 20 and 40 years.48 Fatigue, numbness in the limbs, impaired vision, muscle weakness, loss of balance, and bladder dysfunction are frequent symptoms. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers.48 Symptoms affecting mobility tend to appear early in the course of MS and they may include weakness, clumsiness, leg dragging, stiffness, and a tendency to drop objects. Common sensory symptoms include numbness, sensations of heaviness, tingling, and electrical sensations. Visual symptoms are also common, affecting more than one-third of all people who have MS. The classic visual disturbances, such as blurred or foggy vision and eyeball pain, usually appear early in the course of the disease. MS can also interfere with the nerves that supply the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which is where balance is perceived. This can result in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. In the later stages of the disease, involvement of the genitourinary tract may result in loss of bladder, sexual, and bowel function.56 Over 40% of MS patients suffer from changes in memory, reasoning, spatial perception, and verbal fluency.57 Symptoms of MS are often triggered or worsened by an increase in body temperature. MS is a tremendously variable and unpredictable disease. Different patients will experience different symptoms, rates of disease progression, and responses to treatment. Four Disease Courses Have Been Identified in MS Progressive relapsing (PR) MS, which is the least common disease course, shows progression of disability from onset but with clear acute relapses, with or without full recovery. Approximately 5% of people with MS appear to have PRMS at diagnosis. Secondary progressive (SP) MS begins with an initial relapsing-remitting disease course, followed by progression of disability. Typically, secondary-progressive disease is characterized by: less recovery following attacks, persistently worsening functioning during and between attacks, and accompanied by progressive disability. Many patients with RRMS do develop SPMS ultimately. Primary progressive (PP) MS is characterized by progression of disability from onset, without plateaus or remissions or with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements. A person with PPMS, by definition, does not experience acute attacks. Ten percent of diagnosed MS are PPMS. Relapsing remitting (RR) MS represents 85% of clinical diagnoses of the disease. It is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks with full recovery or with residual deficit upon recovery. Periods between disease relapses are characterized by a lack of disease progression. Diagnosis No single test gives a definitive diagnosis for MS, and variable symptoms and disease course make early diagnosis a challenge. Most presumptive diagnoses of MS are based on the clinical symptoms seen in an acute attack. These presumptions are then supported by a combination of diagnostic imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), antibody testing of the fluid found in the CNS, measurements to evaluate how efficiently nerves conduct impulses (since demyelination slows nerve conduction) and evaluation of how the symptoms progress through time.58 7 Conventional Therapies A cure for MS has yet to be discovered, and although recent efforts have brought advances in available treatments, substantial room for improvement remains. Presently, conventional medical treatment typically focuses on strategies to treat acute attacks, to slow the progression of the disease, and to treat symptoms. Conventional Medical Treatments to Treat Acute Disease Flares Corticosteroids. For acute MS flares, corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are commonly administered in high doses to suppress the immune system and decrease the production of proinflammatory factors. These drugs are often prescribed for short periods and can be effective at alleviating the symptoms of MS. Corticosteroids should not be used for long-term therapy, however, because of their many side effects, including increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cataracts, elevated blood sugar, mood swings and weight gain. Also, while corticosteroids may reduce the symptoms of the disease, they have no effect on its progression.59 Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). Plasmapheresis is a process in which whole blood is separated into blood cells and plasma, the liquid part of blood. In MS patients the plasma contains unusually high levels of antibodies and proinflammatory factors that exacerbate symptoms. Plasma exchange helps remove these factors quickly and is sometimes used to help combat severe symptoms of multiple sclerosis relapses in people who are not responding to intravenous steroids. Conventional Medical Treatment to Modify the Course of the Disease Beta interferons. Beta interferons (Avonex, Betaseron) reduce inflammation and slow progression of the disease, but like many medications used in conventional medical treatment of MS, the mechanism of action is poorly understood60,61 This specific treatment may be accompanied by adverse effects such as suicidal depression, liver damage, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions.62 Glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is an MS treatment that yields fewer adverse side effects than beta interferon while still remaining clinically effective. Glatiramer has a chemical structure similar to the protective myelin sheath around nerves and serves as a decoy for antibodies that would otherwise attack this sheath.63 Side effects may include flushing, rapid heartbeat, nausea, shortness of breath after injection, and injection site reactions.64 Mitoxantrone and fingolimod. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) and fingolimod (Gilenya) are immunosuppressants. Clinical data show these drugs can slow the rates at which disability progresses and the rate at which new lesions form in the brain and spinal cord. These therapies, however, are not used as a first-line treatment as they can cause severe side effects including heart disease, leukemia, decreased white blood cell counts, and increased rates of infection.65 Natalizumab. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is thought to block a protein that allows white blood cells to enter the brain and spinal cord and cause disease progression in MS. Due to an association with three cases of a potentially fatal infection of the CNS,66 this is a controversial drug that is only available for patients enrolled in the Tysabri Outreach Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH) program.67 This medication is reserved for people who do not see results from other types of treatments. Dalfampridine. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medication approved in 2010 that increases the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses.68 This drug represents a new class of therapies that is aimed at addressing neurologic deficits directly. Medications to Treat Symptoms Muscle relaxants. Multiple sclerosis patients may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in the legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may improve muscle spasticity. However, baclofen may increase weakness in the legs, and tizanidine may cause drowsiness or a dry mouth. Medications to reduce fatigue. Drugs such as amantadine (Symmetrel) may help reduce fatigue. Other medications. Medications may also be prescribed for depression, pain and bladder or bowel control problems that may be associated with multiple sclerosis. Medications on the Horizon There are approximately 20 experimental therapies that are on the pathway to approval by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA). Investigators are making progress toward developing treatments that may be capable of protecting the CNS as well as encouraging repair of brain and spinal cord lesions. Many of these drugs are potentially valuable as treatments for MS, but are months or years from traversing all phases of the FDA process. Laquinimod. Laquinimodhas been shown to decrease proinflammatory factors and increase factors that promote nerve protection without increasing risk of infection. Laquinimod was well tolerated by most patients, with only a few reports of adverse effects.69 Alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is an antibody specific for mature white blood cells that targets them for destruction by the immune system. This drug is approved for the treatment of certain types of lymphoma and leukemia. In one study, it was shown to be more effective than beta interferon in reducing disability progression and relapse rate, however, the trial was discontinued early due to serious side effects.70 Fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a substance that has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and shows promise in MS to decrease white blood cell infiltration into the spinal cord.71 Therapy and Rehabilitation to Improve Quality of Life In addition to one or more drug-based therapies, MS patients will often participate in rehabilitation programs intended to maintain or improve their ability to perform at home and at work. More specifically these programs focus on general fitness and aim to address problems related to mobility, speech and swallowing, and cognitive deficits. Common rehabilitation strategies include: Physical therapy. Practices that aide mobility and functionality through structured physical activity on a scheduled basis. Occupational therapy. Skills aimed at using work, self-care, and leisure activities to foster development and limit disability. Speech therapy. Work with speech therapists can help MS patients overcome speech and language difficulties and help with troublesome swallowing. Cognitive rehabilitation. Assistance in managing difficulties with memory, high order thinking, and perception. A variety cognitive rehabilitation options are available. For example, playing chess regularly is a great way to promote neuronal function and communication; computer-based ""brain training"" programs are also helpful. Vocational rehabilitation. Support in making career plans, gaining job skills, and approaches to remaining gainfully employed. 8 Multiple Sclerosis Nutritional Protocol Most patients that employ complementary treatments for MS do so as an accompaniment with conventional drug treatments and find both classes of therapy to provide clinical benefits.72 The following section outlines key details and evidence-based findings concerning the latest complementary approaches to treating MS. Vitamin D As previously mentioned, mainstream medicine has overlooked a critical missing link in MS management—vitamin D. This hormone-like vitamin is capable of safely interacting directly with the genome to modulate a variety of physiological functions, including aspects of immune function involved in autoimmune diseases like MS. Two human clinical trials demonstrated that individuals with MS using vitamin D tended to have fewer relapses and less inflammation.17,73,74 In a year-long Vitamin D study, recurrence rate of MS ""attacks"" was 27% lower compared to baseline.74 In another large-dose Vitamin D trial, MS patients given 28,000‒280,000 IU weekly were found to have fewer active lesions during the 28-week long study.75 In light of the accumulating epidemiological and clinical evidence of the importance of vitamin D in this disease, supplementing the diet with vitamin D appears to be a low cost means to address this risk. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are polyunsaturated FAs which cannot be synthesized in humans and therefore must be provided via dietary sources. Both plant and animal foods are potential sources of omega-3 FAs. For example, linolenic acid, found in flaxseed, flaxseed oil, and preferably, fish and fish oils have very high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A small study looking at the effects of omega-3 FAs on MS found that immune cells from treated patients and healthy controls produced significantly fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines after three months of treatment with 6 grams of fish oil per day.76 One double-blind placebo-controlled study exists to date looking at the effect of omega-3 FAs on MS disease progression. In this study 312 patients were given either fish oil or olive oil placebo for two years. The results of this trial exhibited a trend toward decreased disease severity in the omega-3 FA group when compared with control.77 More recent studies have shown that MS patients given 10 grams of fish oil per day for three months exhibited significantly reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a factor correlated with disease progression, and also had greater concentrations of omega-3 FAs in their red blood cell membranes.78 Other work has shown that MS patients, while on a low-fat diet with omega-3 FA supplementation, experienced significantly reduced fatigue and lower relapse rates.79 Based upon clinical data and patient accounts, omega-3 FAs appear to be well tolerated and safe with no reports of adverse events. Linoleic Acid and Omega-6 Fatty Acids Linoleic acid is converted to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a beneficial omega-6 FA, after it is taken orally. However, this conversion is occasionally impaired, especially during inflammatory disease states.48,80 GLA has been shown to quell inflammation and research involving an animal model of MS has demonstrated that GLA administration significantly improved clinical outcomes when compared with control treatment.81 Some studies have shown significantly reduced relapse rates and disease progression scores, while others have found no differences between treatment and control groups.81-83 A closer look at data from these trials revealed that patients with lower levels of disability at the beginning of the trial exhibited a smaller increase in disability over the study period than did controls. In addition, linoleic acid was found to reduce the severity and duration of MS episodes in patients at all levels of disease severity.84 Selenium and Vitamin E Patients who have MS tend to have abnormally low levels of glutathione peroxidase, a powerful endogenous antioxidant.85,86 Researchers in Denmark conducted a small study in which patients with MS were given an antioxidant mixture containing about 2,000 mcg selenium, 2 grams vitamin C, and 480 mg vitamin E once daily for five weeks. Although glutathione peroxidase levels were initially lower in patients with MS than in normal control subjects, after five weeks of antioxidant therapy, levels of this antioxidant enzyme increased five-fold and reported side effects were minimal.85 ""[O]xidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. This finding also suggests the importance of antioxidants in diet and therapy of MS patients.""87 N-Acetylcysteine An effective strategy for increasing the body's supply of the powerful antioxidant glutathione is taking the oral supplement N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant that serves as a precursor to glutathione.48,88 NAC's potential benefit in the context of MS has been noted by some researchers.48,89 In a rodent MS model, NAC was able to diminish clinical symptoms and pathological evidence of CNS injury, and attenuate inflammation.90 Lipoic Acid Lipoic acid (LA) is a dietary supplement with antioxidant properties and has been studied specifically in MS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated primarily by immune cells, are implicated as mediators of demyelination and nerve damage.91,92 Known to cross the blood-brain barrier, LA decreases the activity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. It is believed that ICAM-1 and other adhesion molecules are responsible for allowing certain pro-inflammatory immune cells, like T-lymphocytes, to enter the CNS, paving the way for induction or exacerbation of inflammation and tissue damage.93-95 In an animal MS model, LA produced a significant reduction of demyelination and infiltration of the CNS by T lymphocytes.96-98 Other researchers have followed up on these studies. In a pilot clinical trial, 37 patients with MS were randomly assigned to receive various doses of LA (up to 2,400 mg/day) or placebo. After two weeks, patients were assessed for levels of ICAM-1 and tolerability of high-dose LA. In addition to being well tolerated by patients, LA treatment was associated with reduced ICAM-1 levels and reduced T-cell migration into the CNS.99 Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is an essential part of healthy mitochondrial function and energy production with potential usefulness in treating MS. Decreased levels of CoQ10 are associated with many disease states, including heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.100,101 CoQ10 was low in patients with MS.102 Several clinical trials of CoQ10 have been performed in neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.103 CoQ10 is a powerful lipid-soluble antioxidant that is also capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E in the body. Based upon clinical evidence, CoQ10 appears to be well tolerated and safe with potential usefulness in the management of MS. Vitamin B12 Some data suggest patients with MS have abnormally low levels of vitamin B12 in their cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, or both.104 In fact, clinical vitamin B12 deficiency and MS share remarkably similar characteristics, occasionally rendering correct diagnosis difficult.105 Notably, vitamin B12 plays a key role in the generation of myelin and thus, for decades, integrative physicians have prescribed B12 injections for patients who have MS. Data suggest patients given vitamin B12 supplements have experienced clinical improvements in their symptoms.48 For example, in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the effects of six months of vitamin B12 (1 mg/week injection) on 138 patients with MS. The researchers concluded that the clinical course of patients with MS improved after beginning vitamin B12 treatment.106 Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo biloba extracts are primarily composed of flavonoids and terpenoids and have been reported to have properties that can influence neural activity and improve cognitive performance. While controlled trials of the effects of ginkgo biloba on cognitive function have generated inconsistent findings, more recent studies found encouraging results for patients with MS.107-109 In one study, patients received 120 mg of ginkgo biloba extract or placebo twice per day for 12 weeks. Those patients taking ginkgo biloba exhibited improved measures of attention and reported fewer difficulties with memory. Green Tea (Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate) Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of many active ingredients of green tea that have been reported to have beneficial effects on the nervous and immune systems. In an animal study of MS, ECGC was found to prevent severity of clinical signs by decreasing inflammation and protecting nerve cells.110 According to animal research, green tea has the ability to significantly increase regulatory T cells which are critical to providing balance to the immune system and suppressing autoimmunity.111 Curcumin Curcumin is an active component of turmeric, a popular Indian spice. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent anti-inflammatory effects.112 A research group carrying out animal studies has demonstrated exciting findings that curcumin treatment results in a significant reduction in disease severity and a reduction in duration of acute attacks.113 In a follow-up study, laboratory researchers found curcumin not only suppressed disease severity, but also was associated with reduction of levels of IL-17 a cytokine that has been directly implicated in the progression of MS.114 Biotin Biotin, a water-soluble B-complex vitamin, is sometimes referred to as vitamin B7. Biotin participates in biochemical reactions catalyzed by decarboxylase enzymes, supporting energy production and fatty acid and myelin synthesis.115,116 The Adequate Intake for biotin is 30 micrograms, and low-to-moderate amounts are common in multivitamin supplements.117,118 Biotin's role in neuron functioning is evidenced by its therapeutic effect in a rare genetic disease known as biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease.118 Children affected by this disease experience progressive neurological dysfunction, including speech and motor dysfunction, mental retardation, seizures, and possibly death. Early treatment with biotin and thiamine (vitamin B1) appears to prevent progression in most cases.119,120 More recently, researchers have been exploring biotin's potential benefits in patients with MS. In the first clinical trial to demonstrate the potential of high-dose biotin in MS therapy, 23 patients with progressive MS were treated with 100–300 mg biotin daily for an average of 9.2 months. While improvements were not seen for two to eight months after initiating biotin therapy—suggesting biotin may instigate a slow and progressive repair of MS-related nerve damage—vision improved in all four participants with MS-related optic nerve injury, and motor function and overall disability improved in 16 of 18 participants (89%) with prominent spinal cord involvement.116,118 In a randomized controlled trial, 154 patients with progressive MS received either 100 mg biotin three times daily or placebo for 12 months. Thirteen (12.6%) of the biotin-treated subjects versus none of the placebo subjects exhibited improvements in measures of MS-related disability after nine months that persisted through the end of the trial. In addition, only 4.2% of biotin-treated subjects compared with 13.6% of placebo subjects had progressively worsening disability scores at nine months. At the end of the 12 months, placebo subjects were switched to high-dose biotin, and overall stabilization of disability was seen in all subjects at a 24-month follow-up.121 Biotin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients have been observed to be lower than those of healthy people, leading to speculation that low biotin availability may contribute to the pathology of MS.122 Although the mechanism of biotin's ability to prevent or repair nerve damage is unknown, biotin may prevent progressive demyelination by improving mitochondrial function, increasing brain energy production, supporting myelin production by increasing lipid synthesis, and affecting gene expression.118,123 Biotin is excreted through the urinary system, and high doses appear to be well tolerated in trials to date.118,124 However, high doses of biotin may interfere with certain lab tests, including thyroid function tests, leading to misdiagnosis of thyrotoxicosis.117,125,126 In addition, the possibility of teratogenicity has been suggested by animal research124; therefore, the safety of high-dose biotin in pregnancy is not established. Swank Diet Dr. Roy Swank first proposed a connection between increased consumption of saturated animal fat and the incidence of MS in 1950.127 He conducted a study which enrolled 208 patients with MS in the early 1950s, all of whom had experienced at least two acute relapses, and followed their progress over 34 years.128 In this study, patients maintained the now termed Swank diet, which consists of: less than 15 grams/day of saturated animal fat, 10‒15 grams/day of vegetable oil, 5 grams/day of cod liver oil, and one multivitamin. Long-term follow-up results from this study indicate that the patients adhering to the Swank diet experienced reduced MS disease activity and progression of disability when compared to patients that did not follow the regimen. While these results are encouraging, this trial is criticized for its lack of a proper control group and un-blinded design. Nevertheless, the Swank diet remains one of the most popular complementary approaches to treating MS. Swank Low-Fat Diet: Detailed Guidelines Saturated fat should remain less than 15 grams per day Unsaturated fat should be approximately 20‒50 grams per day No red meat should be consumed during the first year After the first year, a maximum of 3 oz. of red meat per week Dairy products must have 1% butterfat or less Processed foods containing saturated fat should not be eaten A source of omega-3, a multivitamin, and a mineral supplement are recommended daily Wheat, gluten or dairy product quantities are not restricted, unless they are foods which cause allergies or reactions. 9 Hormone Therapy Because women often experience improvement of MS symptoms while pregnant, hormone therapy using estrogen has been studied as a treatment for the disease. In human studies, estriol treatment (8 mg/day) in nonpregnant women with MS was associated with reduced lesion numbers and lesion volumes and when treatment ceased, these values returned to levels observed before treatment.37 Patients given estriol also had enhanced cognitive function. With respect to immune studies, estriol was associated with reduced pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production and these changes correlated well with the reduced formation of lesions.39 Other studies have shown that male MS patients treated with 10 mg of testosterone exhibited improved cognitive performance and reduced brain atrophy, although MRI data showed no change in lesion formation.129 In another similar study, testosterone treatment in males was associated with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and increased production of neuroprotective factors.130 There is currently debate among researchers about the role of hormones with MS and how that relationship may be exploited as a means of therapy. Some studies argue for hormone replacement as a new therapeutic approach.131 More information can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols.

Addictions Counselor: Job Description & Career Info Whether it's alcohol or prescription drugs, an addictions counselor can help you conquer whatever addiction dominates you. The education options differ by place of employment and specialization, but undergraduate and graduate degree programs are available. Most employers require experience and licensure, and certification can be obtained through exams and field work. Addictions counselors help patients overcome personal addiction problems. Requirements vary, with some states allowing high school graduates with certifications to become counselors and others requiring candidates to have a master's degree. Varies by state from a high school diploma to a master's degree State license or certification typically required 22% for substance abuse, behavioral disorder, and mental health counselors $41,070 for substance abuse and behavioral disorder counselors Addictions counselors work with patients suffering from substance abuse problems and other addictions such as gambling. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), addictions counselors develop recovery programs and coping strategies to avoid relapses (www.bls.gov). In addition to counseling addicts, they may conduct sessions with family members and friends. In serious cases, they may refer a patient to a psychiatrist or other medical professional. The BLS indicated that employment for substance abuse, behavioral disorder, and mental health counselors is expected to increase 22% from 2018-2028, which is significantly faster than average. As awareness of the benefits of counseling has grown, more individuals have sought these counselors' services. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, both government agencies and employers now fund drug treatment programs (www.nida.nih.gov). Another factor spurring the growth of addictions counseling is that many states are referring non-violent and first-time drug offenders to treatment rather than prison. The BLS reported that substance abuse and behavioral disorder counselors earned a median wage of $41,070 annually in May, 2018, with most earning salaries between $26,210 and $65,080. The highest-paying industries included junior colleges and scientific research and developmental services. Educational requirements for addictions counselors vary depending on the type of certification they wish to attain. Individuals may earn initial certifications with a certificate or associate's degree. More advanced levels of certification typically require a bachelor's or master's degree. In addition to coursework, extensive clinical experience is typically a requirement. Certificate and associate's degree programs include foundational coursework in addictive behaviors and treatments. Some courses may be directed toward children and families or specific addictions such as alcohol. Students at the bachelor's degree level may consider addiction studies, psychology, behavioral science or related majors. These curricula offer coursework relevant to addictions counseling, including decision making, human development, applied statistics and social psychology. Master's degree programs in substance abuse and addiction counseling are available, and some clinical psychology and mental health counseling programs may also offer an addictions counseling concentration. Graduate-level curricula include advanced topics in the diagnosis and treatment of addicts. Students may be required to complete a research project prior to graduating. Clinical experience through a practicum or internship places students in healthcare facilities where they are supervised by licensed professionals. Students gain hands-on experience with patients and receive feedback on their performance. Internships may last up to a year and count toward experience requirements for certification and licensure. Addictions counselors working in a private practice are required to be licensed. Educational and experience requirements for licensure differ by state but often include completing a postsecondary degree and accruing a set number of contact hours. In addition, a written certifying exam may be required. Some states allow counselors who have earned a license in another state to transfer their credentials and work without repeating the entire licensing process. The Association for Addiction Professionals, formerly the National Association for Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, offers several certifications in the field (www.naadac.org). As individuals gain more education and experience, they qualify for advanced-level certifications. The first credential offered is the National Certified Addiction Counselor, Level 1, which requires a state license and either three years or 6,000 hours of experience. The National Board for Certified Counselors offers the National Certified Counselor (NCC) and Master Addiction Counselor (MAC) credentials (www.nbcc.org). Individuals interested in earning a MAC credential must first hold the NCC. Each of these credentials requires a master's degree, experience and a passing score on a certifying exam. An addictions counselor may find work in rehab centers, schools, and medical facilities, among other places. They assist clients in fighting and coping with their addictions. Addictions counselors must have clinical experience and be licensed and possess a college degree at minimum, although, many positions demand a master's degree. Substance Abuse Counseling Guide 1.

MBA Vs M.S. in Computer Science: Salary & Benefits Increased technological innovation and digital dependence have resulted in great demand for individuals with knowledge and expertise in computer science. There are two very valid options for graduate-level education in computer science, a Master of Science (MS) in Computer Science and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) with a specialization in computer science. Both provide advanced training and qualifications geared toward upper-level careers with high-paying salaries. Computer Science Careers for Master's Degree Program Graduates There are a great number of lucrative technological careers to choose from once you have completed either an MS in Computer Science or an MBA program. Usually, a person with an MS in Computer Science receives a greater average salary, with the exception being in cases where a position is more management-oriented and less technical. A sampling of job titles available to program graduates and the corresponding salaries are listed below. Software developers and programmers assess client needs and use this information to design software, applications, and digital models that fit an organization's business profile. They are generally also tasked with monitoring software, maintaining programs, and strategic planning. While a bachelor's degree is generally all that's required to enter this profession, some employers prefer their software developers to have a master's degree. IT project managers provide oversight of entire projects from start to finish, including planning, design, execution, and monitoring. They are responsible for the ongoing maintenance and supervision of a project, including controlling the budget, setting deadlines, and controlling quality. While many of these professionals hold a bachelor's degree, a master's degree could also be useful for landing a position as a project manager. Senior Java developers might perform many of the same tasks as senior software developers; however, these professionals specialize in using the JAVA programming language to develop a website's user interface design. They may develop application programming interfaces and work with other software developers and end users to ensure a site functions properly. The minimum education needed for this position is usually a bachelor's degree in computer science. In some cases, however, a master's degree can be used to fulfill a position's experience requirements. Information Technology IT Business Systems Analyst IT business analysts are tasked with maximizing the efficiency of a company or institution through an analysis of its computer systems. They examine all technological aspects of an organization to determine its needs and propose upgrades or the installation of new systems with an eye toward increasing profits. A bachelor's degree is the minimum requirement, but some employers prefer applicants with a computer science master's degree, especially for more technical positions. The range of content is the main difference between these two computer science degrees. MBA programs typically cover a wide variety of topics, providing a broad base of business and financial knowledge, although students can narrow their focus by specializing in particular areas. MS in Computer Science programs, on the other hand, provide more specific knowledge and skills in this field. Also, MS in Computer Science programs are generally more technical than an MBA curriculum, which is more strategic in nature. Although relatively rare, there are MBA programs out there with specialization options in computer science as well as programs that allow you to customize your degree with computer science electives or a minor in computer science. MBA programs can be completed in 2-3 years and cover a very diverse set of financial topics, featuring courses such as finance, accounting, and marketing. For admission into an MBA program, a bachelor's degree that meets minimum GPA requirements is generally necessary. You will need to provide transcripts, acceptable GRE (Graduate Record Examination) or GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) results, proof of relevant work experience, and letters of recommendation. Programs awarding a master's degree in computer science also typically require 2-3 years of coursework. The focus is entirely on advanced technological concepts, with common courses including programming, computer systems, and algorithms. The admission requirements are roughly the same as those for an MBA program, with small details varying from school to school. Completion of either an MS in Computer Science or an MBA with a specialization in computer science can open up a vast array of technology career options. The MS in Computer Science is particularly beneficial for technological positions, such as programming and software development. The MBA, on the other hand, is a much broader qualification that enhances your expertise in technological areas while better preparing you for a variety of business careers management positions.

Enter zip: Per most MBA (Master of Business Administration) programs in the United States, prospective students must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited U.S. institution or equivalent. Although applicants come from various academic backgrounds, admission committees deem individuals with a strong background in quantitative-based coursework, e.g., algebra, calculus, finance, economics, etc., highly attractive, and, therefore, such individuals are most likely to be admitted into the program. With that said, however, there are other important components to one's MBA application, including: *GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) or GRE (Graduate Records Examination) scores Please note that most MBA programs prefer applicants to take the GMAT over the GRE, although either one can typically be taken. 3.5 is typically the benchmark for graduate programs. *Practical experience in business, marketing, economics, etc. According to B Schools (as of 2020), top-tier MBA applicants generally have at least four years of relevant business experience before applying to a program. Especially when written by seasoned experts in the field or highly renowned professionals, letters of recommendation can have a significant impact on one's MBA application.

Licensing requirements for industrial psychologists vary, and graduates should check with the state in which they wish to work.

Strayer University What is your highest level of education completed? Aspiring case workers must, at minimum, complete a bachelor's degree, usually in the field of social work. Supervisory positions and employment in healthcare facilities generally require a master's degree. Both programs of study require completion of on-the-job training through supervised counseling and internships. Case worker training begins with a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. Those positions requiring additional training usually necessitate a Master in Social Work (MSW). The BSW curriculum encompasses topics such as social justice, welfare services and policies, at-risk clienteles, diversity issues and ethics. These programs train individuals to work in different organizations both in the public and private sector. Skills in communication, case management and crisis intervention are emphasized. Additionally, students study social policy and cultural diversity. Some common coursework might include: Applicants are required to have already completed a bachelor's degree to apply for this program. Graduate programs usually require two additional years of study and incorporate didactic training and internships. Students of MSW programs generally choose to specialize in a specific area, such as family, child, and school services; substance abuse and mental health; or public health and medical services. These programs may be found online. Some of the course topics might include: Policies and strategies for community intervention According to the BLS, healthcare social workers make a median annual wage of $56,750 as of May 2019. From 2018-2028, the job outlook for social workers is expected to grow 17%, which is faster than average compared to all other occupations. After completing case worker training at the undergraduate or graduate levels, candidates must obtain a license to practice. Licensure guidelines vary by state, but candidates generally accumulate a specified amount of practical experience and pass a civil service examination. Separate professional credentials are available through the National Association of Social Workers (NASW). Certifications are available in hospice and palliative care; gerontology; children, youth and family services; school social work; healthcare; and case management. Many educational opportunities are available for case workers through schools of social work, healthcare facilities and government agencies. Additionally, numerous programs are offered through the NASW and other professional agencies focused upon a specific area of the practice. Employers also offer regular training opportunities in order to ensure workers are current in work policies and government regulations. Case workers may join the NASW to obtain career support, continuing education and professional development opportunities. Members must adhere to a code of ethics. Licensed social workers must fulfill varying continuing education requirements as determined by state regulations. Case workers help clients address different problems affecting them at home or in the workplace; these professionals will need either a bachelor's or master's degree and state licensure in order to find employment. After completing these degrees, case workers can earn certification in different specializations and attend extra courses to stay current on their education.

Enter zip: CCENT (Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician) certification is beneficial to entry-level professionals because it helps them improve their skills in basic networking. Having the CCENT certification in an individual's professional background, however, does not mean that it will help professionals automatically land a job. What is true, however, is that it increases one's probability of being employed because most employers prefer hiring professionals whose skills and expertise in basic networking are validated. Apart from this, a CCENT certification alone is not worth it if the job applicant's professional experience and skills do not match the preferences of their desired employers. Landing a job in the network and computer systems industry may be challenging because it is one of the most high-paying jobs in the IT industry. Despite diverse employer preferences, it remains that getting a CCENT certification will inevitably increase one's competitive advantage against other non-certified technicians.

Quality of life (QoL) has gained increasing importance in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess QoL and potentially associated factors such as depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism in patients starting glatiramer acetate (GA) in clinical practice. A prospective cohort study carried out in relapsing-remitting MS patients starting GA as first-line treatment. Patient information on QoL (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 [MSQoL-54]), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), sexual dysfunction (Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19) and work absenteeism was assessed from starting GA to week 96. Ninety-eight evaluable patients were enrolled in the study (mean age, 38.0 ± 8.4 years; female, 69.4%; mean MS duration, 42.6 ± 62.9 months; annual relapse rate since MS diagnosis, 0.4), and followed up at weeks 24 (n=96), 48 (n=94), 72 (n=89) and 96 (n=80). Patient QoL was preserved during the study, with improvements on the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health (p<0.05) and health distress (p<0.05). Depression, primary and secondary sexual dysfunction remained stable, but the number of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction decreased at week 96 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism also decreased over the study (p<0.01). Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism affected MSQoL-54 physical and mental health composites (p<0.05). QoL of our patients was preserved during the 96-week administration of GA. Though depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism impair patient QoL, they remained stable or even improved during the study. Absenteeism; Depression; Glatiramer acetate; Quality of life; Multiple sclerosis; Sexual dysfunction Quality of life assessment in patients with has gained increasing importance as it encompasses all aspects of patients lives that may be affected by the disease. Though patients quality of life worsens as multiple sclerosis progresses and physical function deteriorates, it depends not only on the disability caused by physical limitations but also on their emotional status, which may also affect the perception of wellbeing and quality of life [-]. In this scenario, depression has been shown to have a notable impact on quality of life, and is considered a significant and independent predictor of impaired quality of life [-]. Sexual dysfunction is another common and often underestimated clinical symptom of multiple sclerosis that, along with its emotional , has been shown to affect patients quality of life [,]. The information available on the impact of sexual dysfunction on quality of life, however, is still limited. The consequences of multiple sclerosis often negatively affect patients working life and may even lead to permanent unemployment []. This unemployment represents one of the factors that most modifies patients way of living as a result of its influence on their usual activities or interests and its impact on increasing emotional distress [], while sustaining employment has been shown to be associated with improved quality of life [,]. First-line disease-modifying drugs for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis including (INFb)-1a, INFb-1b and glatiramer acetate have been shown to improve the course of the disease. However, their effect on patients quality of life has not yet been fully clarified. Indeed, the information available on INFb's effect on quality of life is controversial, ranging from some benefit [] to absence of effect [-] or even to quality of life detriment []. The effect of glatiramer acetate treatment on quality of life has not been well assessed, and improvements in quality of life have been reported in treatment-naïve patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis six months after starting GA treatment that were sustained for another six months []. In light of the above, this study aimed to expand the information available on quality of life and potentially associated factors such as depression, and work absenteeism in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis starting glatiramer acetate as first-line treatment in clinical practice. This study was conducted in the Departments of at 37 Spanish hospitals in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, all its amendments and national regulations. The study was approved by the ethic committee of Hospital Donostia (San Sebastián, Spain) and all patients gave their written informed consent. Between November 2009 and November 2010, all patients meeting selection criteria who agreed to participate in the study were consecutively recruited into the study. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 to 60 years, with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, no previous treatment for multiple sclerosis and a score of 5.5 or less on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Patients were to start (Copaxone®, Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., London, United Kingdom) for multiple sclerosis treatment and must not have had any cognitive impairment that precluded understanding of the patients information sheet and informed consent form. This was a prospective cohort study conducted in patients with -remitting multiple sclerosis receiving glatiramer acetate treatment for multiple sclerosis and followed-up for two years according to clinical practice. All treatments were administered from commercial sources and according to routine clinical practice. No restrictions regarding patients treatment were specified in the study protocol. Patients information was retrieved from their medical charts at the start of glatiramer acetate treatment (baseline) and at weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96. The data retrieved at these visits included , medical history of multiple sclerosis, patients disability according to the EDSS [], quality of life measured according to scores on the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Live-54 (MSQoL-54) questionnaire [,], depression according to scores on the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [,], sexual disfunction according to the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19 (MSISQ-19), [,] and work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis according to the occurrence of work absenteeism, the number of working days missed and the causes of work absenteeism. EDSS scores, which range from 0 (normal neurological status) to 10 (death from multiple sclerosis), were obtained by the same researcher in a given patient. The MSQoL-54 questionnaire consists of 54 items distributed in 12 multiple-item scales and two single-item scales, including questions from the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey as a generic core measure and 18 additional items specific for multiple sclerosis that assess health , sexual function, overall quality of life, cognitive function and energy. Physical and mental health composite scores are calculated as a simplified two-dimension solution to MSQoL-54 questionnaire. The composites scores range from 0 (poor health) to 100 (optimal health). The BDI is composed of 21 categories of symptoms and attitudes which describe a specific behavioral manifestation of depression and consist of a graded series of four to five self-evaluative statements. Numerical values are assigned for each statement from 0 (neutral) to 3 (maximal severity) indicating the degree of severity of the manifestations of depression. Total scores range from 0 to 63, where higher scores indicate worse depressive states. Patients may also be categorized as having ups and downs considered normal if their BDI scores were 10 or less, as having mild mood disturbance if their BDI scores were between 11 and 16, as having borderline clinical depression if their BDI scores were between 17 and 20, as having moderate depression if their BDI scores were between 21 and 30, as having severe depression if their BDI scores were between 31 and 40 and as having extreme depression if their BDI scores were higher than 40. The cut-off value of at least 17 points was established as suggestive of the presence of depression. The MSISQ-19 consists of 19 items assessing the perceived influence of multiple sclerosis symptoms on sexual activity and satisfaction. Scores on the MSISQ-19 show the presence of primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction. Primary sexual dysfunction occurs as a result of neurologic changes related to multiple sclerosis that directly affect sexual feelings and/or sexual response, secondary sexual dysfunction refers to physical changes related to multiple sclerosis that affect the sexual response indirectly and tertiary sexual dysfunction refers to psychological, emotional, social and cultural aspects of multiple sclerosis that impact upon sexuality. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, measured according to scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire. Sample size was calculated to fulfill the primary objective of the study. At the time of study design, the only data available on the impact of multiple sclerosis therapy on quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire was reported by Simone et al., who found that multiple sclerosis patients followed up for two years experienced a decrease of six or more points in 80% of MSQoL-45 measurements (dimensions and summary composite scores), with an standard deviation of approximately 20 points []. Taking into account these data, an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a two-sided analysis, the number of evaluable patients needed to be enrolled into the study to detect a difference of six or more points in MSQoL-54 scores would be of 92 patients; considering a percentage of missing data of 20% or lower, e.g. due to non-evaluable patients, the total sample size would be of 110 patients. Analysis of the primary endpoint included the calculation of mean scores and standard deviations (SD) of both physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study. Comparison of these scores during the study was performed using the repeated measures general linear model. Comparison of scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline with those reported at week 24, 48, 72 and 96 were also performed using paired t-tests. The secondary endpoints included assessment of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism at baseline. Other secondary endpoints were the change in depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism during the study and their impact on patients quality of life. The distribution of patients according to the following categories of the BDI was calculated as the frequency and valid percentage in each study visit: ups and downs considered normal (BDI scores, =10), mild mood disturbance (BDI scores, 11-16), borderline clinical depression (BDI scores, 17-20), moderate depression (BDI scores, 21-30), severe depression (BDI scores, 31-40) and extreme depression (BDI scores, >40). The overall frequency of patients with depression, which was defined as a BDI score =17, was also calculated. Comparison of mean BDI scores and the proportion of patients within the above categories during the study was performed using paired t-tests and McNemars tests, respectively. The impact of depression on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire reported by patients with those without depression using t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. The frequencies and valid percentages of patients with primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores were calculated in each study visit. The overall frequency of sexual dysfunction in each study visit was also assessed according to patients with at least one of these categories (primary, secondary or tertiary sexual dysfunction). Changes during the study were assessed using McNemars tests. The impact of sexual dysfunction on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire between patients without sexual dysfunction and those with any kind of sexual dysfunction by using Mann-Whitney tests. Work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis was assessed according to the frequency and valid percentage of patients missing at least one day from work, the mean (SD) number of working days missed and the causes for work absenteeism. Changes in the frequency of patients absent from work and the number of working days missed during the study were assessed using McNemars tests and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. The impact of work absenteeism on patients quality of life was assessed by comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire in patients at least one day absent from work versus those with no day absent from work using Mann-Whitney tests. A correction method for multiple testing was not performed in the statistical analysis for the present study due to the controversy about its use in observational studies leading to potential risks and errors [,]. Further information on this subject is provided in Appendix 1. Missing data were not considered in the analyses and a significance level of 0.05 was used for statistical testing. The statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). A total of 101 patients agreed to participate in the study, three of whom were excluded from the analysis due to insufficient available data. Therefore, the evaluable population comprised a total of 98 patients, whose characteristics are described in Table 1. Patients disposition during the study is shown in Figure 1. When paired comparisons were performed to assess differences in EDSS scores from baseline, it was shown that the mean EDSS scores remained stable throughout the study period but with a slight tendency to improvement at week 96 (mean [SD], 1.1 [0.3] versus 1.0 [0.2], p=0.058). In addition, the proportion of patients with minimal disability slightly increased and the proportion of patients with moderate disability that did not need any technical aid slightly decreased, though not significantly, reaching 95.0% (n=76) and 5.0% (n=4) of patients, respectively, at week 96. Even though scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire improved slightly during the 96-week study period, the results obtained from the repeated measures general linear model showed that statistically significant differences were not attained in either the physical or mental health composites (Figure 3). Similarly, comparison of scores on the physical and mental health composites between baseline and weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 only showed statistically significant differences in the mental health composite at week 72, in which the scores were significantly higher than baseline (mean [SD], 70.6 [15.3] versus 73.9 [15.9], p<0.05; Figure 4). In addition, consistent statistically significant improvements from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 were observed in the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health and health distress (Figure 4). A total of 65 (66.3%) patients reported experiencing ups and downs considered normal according to the BDI at baseline, while 20 (20.4%) patients showed mild mood disturbance, 10 (10.2%) borderline clinical depression and 3 (3.1%) patients moderate depression. Therefore, a total of 13 (13.3%) patients showed overall depression (Table 2). No significant differences were found in either the mean BDI scores or the distribution of patients among the BDI categories throughout the study. The analysis of the impact of depression on patients quality of life showed that patients with depression reported worse scores on both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study period (Figure 5a). Multiple sclerosis intimacy and sexuality questionnaire-19 The overall frequency of patients with baseline sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores reached 43 (45.3%) patients, and remained stable throughout the 96-week study period. When the type of sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 was analyzed at baseline, primary sexual dysfunction was found in 31 (32.6%) patients, secondary sexual dysfunction in 21 (22.1%) patients and tertiary sexual dysfunction in 17 (17.9%) patients (Table 2). Distribution of patients with primary and secondary sexual dysfunction did not significantly change from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 or 96. However, the proportion of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction tended to decrease from baseline to week 72 (p=0.057), reaching statistically significance at week 96 (p<0.05). The presence of sexual dysfunction was shown to worsen patients quality of life, as patients with sexual dysfunction reported lower scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire during the whole study period (Figure 5b). *p<0.001; p<0.005; p<0.01; §p<0.05. D: depression; MHC: mental health composite; ND: no depression; NSD: no sexual dysfunction; NWA: no work absenteeism; PHC: physical health composite; SD: sexual dysfunction; WA: work absenteeism. At baseline, 46 (52.9%) patients reported having missed at least one day from work in the previous six months due to multiple sclerosis. The mean (SD) number of working days missed was 45.8 (56.5) days and the main reasons for work absenteeism were clinical signs of multiple sclerosis and disease relapses (Table 2). When work absenteeism was analyzed over the whole study, statistically significant decreases from baseline were observed in the proportion of patients missing at least one day from work at week 24 (p<0.01), week 48 (p<0.001), week 72 (p<0.01) and week 96 (p<0.01). Even though the number of working days missed from work decreased from baseline, statistically significant differences were only reached at week 48 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism was associated with patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, as patients absent from work reported worse scores on both the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline, week 24, week 48, week 72 and week 96 (Figure 5c). This prospective cohort study showed that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate under clinical practice conditions. Although glatiramer acetate treatment may have played a role in slowing down worsening of multiple sclerosis, this finding must be considered with caution since our patient population had intrinsically low disease activity in terms of EDSS scores and annual relapse rate. However, other studies also showed low disease activity in patients treated under clinical practice conditions [,], and another reported early gain in quality of life measured by the Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life scale in patients receiving glatiramer acetate in daily practice []. A protective effect on quality of life of other first-line treatments for multiple sclerosis such as IFNb has also been previously suggested in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis[], whose quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54, Short Form 36-Item Health Survey and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires remained stable for up to three years [-]. However, though some improvements in the physical health composite of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire have been reported after two years of treatment with IFNb [], detriments in patients quality of life have also been reported during the same duration of IFNb treatment, mainly as a result of worsening of the mental health composite []. In our study, disability, depression, primary sexual dysfunction and secondary sexual dysfunction were observed to remain stable during the study period, while tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis were significantly improved at week 96. Maintenance of disability even during 15 years of glatiramer acetate administration has been previously reported, showing a mean EDSS change of 0.6 points from the start of treatment []. However, since the EDSS is highly dependent on ambulation and does not provide information on parameters associated with patients wellbeing [], other parameters that might be potentially associated with patients wellbeing needed to be assessed. Indeed, our results support the influence of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism on the quality of life of patients with relapsing remitting-multiple sclerosis. These results are in line with previous studies reporting that multiple sclerosis patients with lifetime major depression show lower quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire, mainly in terms of energy, mental health, cognitive function, general quality of life, and emotional role limitations []. Depression measured according to the BDI or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression has been reported to be associated with both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [-], regardless of the disease-related physical disability and disease type []. Depression has been claimed to be a significant independent predictor of impaired patient quality of life measured using the MSQoL-54 and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires [-]. Patients with sexual dysfunction have also been shown to have poorer quality of life, with significantly lower scores on all scales of the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey [] and on all of scales of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire except for pain and cognitive function []. Similar detriments in quality of life were observed in unemployed versus unemployed patients, who had lower scores on most dimensions of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [,], suggesting the importance of sustained employment after the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis []. Though the low disease activity of our study patient population does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the effect of glatiramer acetate, decreased work absenteeism has previously been reported in patients receiving this agent [,]. In addition, there is no evidence that glatiramer acetate aggravates depression and it might even induce an antidepressant effect through its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activity []. Indeed, switching to glatiramer acetate has been recommended when a depressive episode is confirmed in patients receiving INFb []. Moreover, recently published data on patients switching from IFNb to glatiramer acetate [], and preliminary results from ongoing studies in patients switching to glatiramer acetate [,] showed patients quality of life remained stable or even improved. The authors acknowledge that although observational studies provide valuable information on treatments administered in clinical practice, their limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. The open-label study design, the absence of a comparator group and the potential regression to the mean effect should also be taken into account. In addition, data on other factors that might have influenced patients quality of life such as relapses, fatigue and treatment-related adverse events were not retrieved, and longer follow-up might have been needed for potential differences to become evident. The low disease activity of the study patient population precluded drawing conclusions about the effect of glatiramer acetate and may limit the representativeness of the study findings. Though caution is advisable when interpreting the study results, we consider that they still provide helpful information to physicians when treating multiple sclerosis in clinical practice. In conclusion, the study results show that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate in clinical practice conditions. Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis are factors that significantly impair patients quality of life. However, our study shows stable disability, depression and primary/secondary sexual dysfunction as well as improved tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism. The study findings should be interpreted with caution based on the low disease activity of the patient population. Further research is still needed to confirm the effect of glatiramer acetate, and to increase knowledge of other potentially associated factors, the long-term effect of multiple sclerosis therapies and the impact of the switch to glatiramer acetate on patients quality of life. There is currently no unanimity about the use of multiple test corrections (methods such as those of Bonferroni, Holm, Benjamini, etc.). In general, these methods reduce the probability of making type I errors, but they increase the probability of making type II errors. It seems cautious to prioritize minimizing the probability of type I errors over type II errors in studies where: several treatments are compared, probabilistic independence is expected between analysis groups and/or variables that would give rise to multiple tests, results have confirmatory implications for practical use. Methods of correcting for multiple testing provide solutions for these situations. However, if any of the above conditions are not a priority or are not applicable to the study, it would be cautious to minimize the probability of making a type II error rather than a type I error. Using multiple test corrections would minimize type I errors, but it would also increase the probability of type II errors, which would imply that differences that are really related to the phenomena under study would not be detected. In the present study, the effect of only one treatment was assessed during the study follow-up, and its use was supported by certain evidence of effectiveness. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume the overall absence of probabilistic independence in the measurements of variables of patients included in the study. Consequently, the authors decided to prioritize the avoidance of increasing the probability of committing type II errors. For readers who may be interested in the effect of multiple test corrections, Bonferroni correction would result in a p-value that was estimated to be of 0.0003 for the analyses carried out in this study. The authors would also like to explain that significant p-values of the study analyses were classified to be shown in the article as p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.005 or p<0.001. The data included in this appendix is intended to provide the reader interested in knowing more about multiple test corrections with some information to interpret the study results based on the multiple test correction approach used. Finally, the authors would like to advise the reader that the study conclusions should not be considered as definitive. As mentioned in the article, the study findings should be interpreted with caution and further research is still needed to confirm them.

Precision Metalworker: Educational Requirements & Career Info With a high school diploma applicants can begin a career in precision metalwork. Certificate and degree programs are available, and may be preferred by some employers. Precision metalworkers fabricate metal parts, products, equipment and tools for industry employees and consumers. They typically learn their trade through training programs and apprenticeships, although some degree programs are available. A number of career specialties exist in the field of precision metalworking. Apprenticeship is common; certificate and degree programs available Apprenticeship is common; certificate and degree programs available Apprenticeship is common; certificate and degree programs available The traditional career path for precision metalworkers was to begin training as an apprentice, then advance to the position of journeyman and finally to become a master craftsman. While these titles are no longer universally used, they still represent the typical progression followed in this field. Apprenticeships combine on-the-job training with classroom instruction. Some apprenticeships are union-sponsored. These are typically paid positions that last up to five years. Some require the apprentice to work full time during the day and attend classes at night. Course subjects may include blueprint reading, drafting, precision measurement, shop equipment operation, computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining and computer-aided design (CAD). Employer-sponsored and non-sponsored apprenticeship programs are also available. Training is also available at vocational schools and community colleges that culminate in a certificate or associate's degree. Graduates from these programs typically are hired at the apprentice level. Though their specific duties differ, a commonality among all types of precision metal workers is that they transform raw metal material into finished goods. Learn more about a few common positions below. These workers bend, shape and join metal sheets into such products as duct systems, stainless steel restaurant equipment and structural siding. They work from plans and drawings and may use computer-controlled saws, shears and presses. Machinists are precision metalworkers who operate large equipment, such as lathes, mills and grinders, to fabricate metal parts. The equipment they use may be CNC. Machinists work from written blueprints or electronic specifications.

Full Sail University MS in Entertainment Business (Campus) Become a High School Graduate Maryland: Program and School Info Become a High School Graduate Maryland: Program and School Info The Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Adult Learning's Division of Workforce Development and Adult Learning administers the National External Diploma Program. The NEDP allows adults to earn a high school diploma by demonstrating skills that are comparable to different academic areas. Adults may have learned these skills through life experience or work experience. The skills tested through the NEDP include reading, social awareness, mathematics, writing, self-awareness, aesthetic awareness, oral communication, scientific awareness, consumer awareness and critical thinking. The NEDP is not classroom based. All work is done at a self-guided pace and meetings are one-on-one with the student and NEDP personnel. To qualify for the NEDP, a person must be at least 18 years old and not currently enrolled in high school. Students in the program must be able to work independently and keep themselves on track with the requirements of the program. It is also recommended that a student have some specific trade or ability that they have specialized in, such as construction or managing a home. The NEDP requires students to demonstrate academic and life skills through performing practical activities, such as reading from a newspaper, measuring the length of a board or writing a letter. Skills may also be proven through documentation, such as proof of work experience or training. To successfully complete the NEDP, students must create a skills portfolio and complete evaluations by NEDP advisors. The evaluations involve students performing activities that showcase their skills and knowledge. Students must produce evaluation results that showcase their competency in ten areas in order to pass the program. These areas are financial, civic, and health literacy; geography; history; science; and the 21st century workplace. Additionally, students are tested for college and career readiness. Once the NEDP is completed, students are awarded a Maryland high school diploma from the State Board of Education. More than 7 million job openings requiring a high school diploma or equivalent will be added to the economy each year, on average, from 2016 to 2026, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, jobs requiring an associate degree will have a growth rate of 7.9% from 2018-2028. Your high school diploma is your path to the future for a better career and a sustainable wage.

Common job titles for graduates of this degree include accountant, auditor, tax examiner, and stockbroker. For most of these careers, usually a bachelor's degree is sufficient, and in some cases licensure may also be required, particularly for stockbrokers, auditors, and accountants. Financial accounting is generally a specialization selected by students completing bachelor's or master's degree programs in accounting. Accounting degree programs prepare students to understand accounting methods, financial statements and tax documents. A bachelor's degree in accounting or a related discipline A bachelor's degree in accounting or a related discipline A bachelor's or master's degree in business administration After completion of a financial accounting degree program, there are several potential career paths for graduates. Some of the job options certified public accountants, tax examiners or stockbrokers. Certified public accountants (CPAs) may provide accounting and auditing advice and services to private individuals, government bodies, corporations or other organizations. Many certified public accountants specialize in a particular area, such as financial analysis, tax preparation or financial document auditing. To become certified, public accountants must meet state licensing requirements, which vary by state but typically involve a combination of education and experience. All CPAs must also pass the Uniform CPA Examination, a lengthy 4-part exam assembled by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, before becoming licensed by their State Board of Accountancy. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employment for accountants and auditors is expected to grow by 6% between 2018 and 2028 (). The median annual salary for these professionals was $70,500 in May 2018. Tax examiners work for government bodies at the local, state or federal level to determine the validity and accuracy of tax statements submitted by individuals and small businesses. These individuals must have comprehensive knowledge of the tax codes of the government body for which they work. Tax examiners at the federal level are required to hold bachelor's degrees or possess commensurate education and experience. According to the BLS, job growth for tax examiners, collectors and revenue agents is expected to decline by 2% between 2018 and 2028. Tax examiners and related workers earned a median annual salary of $54,440 in May 2018. Stockbrokers work for individuals or corporations to facilitate the trade of stocks, bonds and other securities. They may also provide investment advice or educate clients about how the stock market operates. Although not a formal requirement, most stockbrokers complete degree programs related to the field, such as in business management, economics, finance and mathematics. Stockbrokers are also required to gain four months of experience at brokerage firms and pass the General Securities Registered Representative Examination to obtain licensure. The BLS reported in 2018 that securities, financial services and commodities sales agents earned median yearly wages of $64,120. The licensure sometimes required for accountants and auditors is the CPA designation, which requires a combination of work experience and education, in addition to successful completion of a 4-part exam by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Licensure for stockbrokers, on the other hand, involves passing the General Securities Registered Representative Examination, which can only be written after an individual has accumulated four months of experience at a brokerage firm. While tax examiners do not require licensure, they must possess a thorough knowledge of government tax codes.

CPAs focus on what assets and money a client has while CFAs help determine how clients can increase their money through investments. Sources: *PayScale; **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics CPAs and CFAs are both involved with reviewing financial records, consulting with clients and performing calculations. CPAs also produce financial records. They may calculate taxes owed or assess business practices to identify ways to save money. They must also ensure that applicable financial regulations are followed and some may opt to focus on using their skills to identify evidence of fraud or other crimes. CFAs concentrate on understanding market conditions, assessing businesses and determining the best way for a client to invest their money. Their objective is to use investments to produce investment revenue for their clients and in order to do this they may buy or sell things such as stocks on behalf of their clients. A certified public accountant is a professional accountant who has gained relevant work experience and completed certification requirements after earning a bachelor's degree in accounting. They are qualified to perform more tasks than regular accountants are qualified to do. Some CPAs opt to specialize in specific areas of accounting, such as financial analysis. Attention to detail is very important for CPAs since they work with large amounts of data and must ensure it is correct. They also need mathematical skills to perform calculations. Some may opt to pursue roles in management and CPAs are also eligible for executive positions in companies. Producing tax returns and other financial documents A chartered financial analyst is a highly trained financial analyst who has earned a CFA certificate. They can pursue this certificate after they have earned a bachelor's degree and spent several years working in this field. They may also opt to complete a master's degree to be eligible for advancement opportunities.

BS in Criminal Justice - Crime Scene Investigation BS in Accounting - Auditing and Forensic Accountancy Criminal Justice - Bachelor's Cyber and Information Security Technology - Bachelor's Homeland Security - Bachelor's Cyber and Information Security Technology - Associate's Television and movies may portray forensic science as merely a part of murder investigations. However, it's a broad field applied to numerous facets of the justice system. may specialize in a wide range of scientific disciplines and their findings are often used in investigations and trials for both the prosecution and defense of criminals. Forensic scientists are responsible for collecting evidence from crime scenes and analyzing it scientifically in order to determine what happened and who committed a crime. Often, their analyses of evidence can be used in a court of law. However, this field is distinct from crime scene investigation. There are many different specialized jobs within the field of forensic science. These include fingerprint technician, evidence technician, autopsy specialist, and forensic analyst. Let's take a look at the jobs available in forensics, and how to get into forensic science. Problem-solving, analytical, investigative, research, organization, and communications skills; persistence and patience You may have wondered how to get into forensics. Let's take a look at the steps it takes to get a job in forensics. Your first step when considering how to get a job in forensic science is to choose a discipline. Forensic science is a broad field, integrating various disciplines of science in the pursuit of civil justice. Professionals in this field may specialize in one of several forensic science disciplines, including toxicology, pathology, physical anthropology, behavioral science and general forensics, among other specialties. Step 2 is to earn a bachelor's degree. You must have at least bachelor's degrees to find employment in this occupation. Depending on the chosen discipline, students may focus their studies on the natural or biological sciences. For example, students interested in a career in toxicology may focus on microbiology, while those looking to begin a career in forensic ballistics may choose to focus on physics. You may be wondering how to get a degree in forensic science, since the field is so broad. Some colleges and universities offer Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science programs. Employing classroom and laboratory instruction, these 4-year degree programs combine various sciences applicable to forensic science studies. The combination of different learning environments will help teach you how to work in forensics. According to the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, some disciplines require only bachelor's degrees, while others may require advanced degrees in applicable fields of science or medicine. So the third step is to consider an advanced degree. Forensic anthropologists typically have Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in anthropology with focuses on human osteology and anatomy. Forensic odontologists must have at least Doctor of Dental Science (DDS) degrees. Forensic pathologists must obtain medical licensure from the American Board of Pathology, which requires four years of medical school and five years of combined residency and fellowship training. Step 4 is to gain experience. Forensic scientists typically work in laboratories, hospitals, morgues, government facilities and police departments. Specific job duties vary according to discipline, but forensic scientists generally conduct scientific investigations and analyze findings to reveal details about occurrences, such as deaths, car accidents, and non-violent crimes. They work closely beside crime scene investigators, officers, deputies, and attorneys. Forensic scientists may serve as expert witnesses in criminal trials, where they present their findings to juries and judges. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the forensic science job outlook projected a 14% growth from 2019-2029 and the average annual salary was $59,150. The last step is to obtain certification. Earning a voluntary professional certification may help you demonstrate your competence in your specialty. The American Board of Criminalistics (ABC) offers two levels of certification for practicing forensic scientists. Candidates for diplomate certification must hold bachelor's degrees in an applicable science, have two years of experience in criminology and pass a 220-question certification examination. Candidates for fellow certification must meet all diplomate requirements, complete a proficiency testing program and pass a comprehensive exam.

These professionals may become a hospital administrator or a clinical manager. Another option is to work as a health information manager and oversee the updating and storage of patient records. While doctors and nurses are the face of the healthcare field, these professionals rely on managers and administrators to create and maintain an effective and efficient organization. Individuals working in health administration are responsible for organizing and supervising both small health clinics and major hospitals, and job duties often depend on the type of facility in which an administrator works. Those with a degree in health administration should possess the training to manage healthcare facilities, including hospitals, doctor's offices, health insurance providers and health science research laboratories. Common duties include budgeting, creating facility-wide policies, organizing project teams and attending board meetings. Administrators must have strong communication skills and be effective leaders. Information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) stated that medical and health services managers, sometimes referred to as administrators, supervise the daily functions of a healthcare facility. Many manage particular departments, such as surgical or oncology. Some general administrators manage the entire hospital. They must verify that each department meets certain healthcare standards, such as having a particular amount of nurses on the floor. Often, they report to investors or a board of directors to discuss hospital business. Unlike general administrators, clinical managers supervise individual departments. These specialists sometimes work as associate administrators who report to a head administrator during routine meetings. Most help create and enforce hospital rules. They also devise goals for department members to achieve, approve budgets and advocate for their department. Since many departments work together, such as emergency and post-surgical, clinical managers coordinate the efforts of their departments with those of others to boost efficiency. Health information managers assure that private information provided by patients and personnel is kept safe and confidential. These individuals supervise data entry specialists and verify that information is being sent correctly with the proper forms. As computer software changes, managers must know how to use the new equipment and set up training meetings to teach staff members. Most managers run database reports to make sure information is being correctly input and properly accessed. Degrees in health administration or healthcare management are widely available, but degree level requirements vary based on position. For example, the BLS stated that those with a bachelor's degree tend to start off their careers in smaller facilities or by supervising individual departments. Most bachelor degree programs related to health administration include coursework like accounting, statistics, leadership and healthcare law. Those with a graduate degree may act as senior administrators over entire hospitals or research facilities. While many obtain a master's or doctorate degree in health administration, some major in business administration, public works or health sciences, per the BLS. Most programs last 2-5 years and include courses on topics like healthcare policies, professional ethics, healthcare economics and management strategies. Many programs require students to participate in multiple internship residencies to build real-world experience. There are many career options for individuals with a health administration degree. Some opt to work as hospital administrators while others may choose to pursue a career as a clinical manager or health information manager. In 2018, the BLS reported the mean salary for medical and health service managers was $113,730. Health Care Administration Guide 1.

These programs generally supply students with the basic office skills and medical knowledge they need to begin working in this field. Some programs are fully online, while others include both online and on-campus coursework.

Majors that offer education in these areas include medical administration, medical assisting, and medical transcription. Most online medical secretary programs emphasize medical terminology, medical office procedures and administrative office skills. An online medical secretary program can take 1-2 years to complete and result in either a certificate or diploma. Students can also prepare to become medical secretaries by completing an online certificate or diploma program in medical assisting or medical transcription. While many distance education programs for aspiring medical secretaries are conducted entirely online, some are presented in a combination of on-campus and online classes. In some programs, courses in an online medical secretary certificate or diploma program are taken in a specific sequence. Many programs require students to take between 10-15 credits each semester, though in some cases up to 18 credits per semester must be taken.

Medical Psychology: Career Options, Job Duties and Requirements How a person acts can be related to their physical health. Medical psychologists provide help for patients that focus on the connections between the person's health and their behavior. They may diagnose psychological disorders and then treat these disorders, or take measures to prevent them if possible. Medical psychologists practice clinical psychology centering on the relationship between patients' behaviors and their physical conditions. These professionals promote disease prevention through psychological counseling and healthy lifestyle choices. Most hold doctoral degrees and gain extensive clinical experience during their studies. Psychologists must meet their state's licensing requirements, and many obtain optional professional certification in medical psychology. Doctoral degree in psychology is most common, although some can practice with master's degrees 15% for clinical, counseling and school psychologists $76,990 for clinical, counseling and school psychologists Medical psychology is a specialty branch of clinical psychology focusing on connections between health and behavior. Medical psychologists use behavioral science-based procedures as a solution to both mental and physical health issues. These psychologists also use their understanding of how lifestyle influences health to prevent diseases and promote physical wellbeing. A student on the medical psychology path can choose from a variety of specialty areas, including clinical child psychology, clinical neuropsychology and clinical health psychology. Graduates might go into public or private practice, work at a medical center or teach medical psychology at a college or university. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), about 181,700 psychologists were employed in 2018, whereas employment of nearly 207,800 is anticipated for 2028. The BLS predicts that positions for clinical, counseling and school psychologists will increase much faster than average between 2018 and 2028. The mean salary among these types of psychologists as of 2018 was $85,340, the BLS said. Medical psychologists have an understanding of basic psychology and biology, as well as general medical and clinical psychology. They use this knowledge to diagnose, treat and prevent psychological disorders that also can lead to physical disorders. Psychologists working in medical centers usually work with physicians to create treatment plans that promote both physical and mental health. Some medical psychologists treat severe disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia. Other psychologists help patients deal with personal issues, helping them talk though worrying or confusing life situations. According to the BLS, most psychologists are required to have a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) before they can open an independent practice. Students should enroll in a program that is accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). Doctoral programs in medical psychology generally consist of at least five years of study in addition to the completion of a dissertation. They combine didactic courses with clinical experiences and opportunities for extensive research. Many doctoral programs in the field require students to have a master's degree in a psychology-related field before they apply, although some doctoral programs grant students a master's degree as well. All psychologists must meet licensing requirements set by their state. Additionally, voluntary certification in medical psychology is available through the American Board of Medical Psychology. Medical psychologists are highly trained professionals who have completed several years of postsecondary training to prepare to enter the field of clinical psychology. In addition to a master's or doctoral degree in psychology, they also need to be licensed.

Grand Canyon University MS in Information Technology Management (Bridge) MS in Information Technology Management MS in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity BS in Information Technology - Cybersecurity Game technology - such as software engineering, visual effects, animation and motion graphics - allows video game designers, developers and programmers to create interactive entertainment. Associate's degree programs in game design, animation, computer technology and digital arts are available, although a bachelor's degree in one of these, or a related field, is needed for most jobs. Master's degree programs are geared towards those who want to specialize in a particular technology area; they also incorporate training in project development and entrepreneurship for game technology professionals. Within these programs, you'll gain hands-on training with industry software and complete several projects to build a portfolio. Here are some of the main concepts you'll encounter while studying game technology: This course introduces students to types of video games and the technological, strategic and artistic components that are involved in creating a game. Topics in the course examine elements of a video game, user interface, game engine and rendering. Students may get an introduction to business, and how technology affects the marketing, publication and distribution of video games Students in this foundational course develop and refine basic C++, Java and Flash programming skills to design computer and Web-based applications for gaming. In addition to object-oriented programming languages, basic programming courses cover major scripting languages such as Python, JavaScript and Lua. Students build simple applications at the beginning and gradually advance to building their own program applications with 2-D and 3-D graphics. This course is offered at levels for undergraduate and graduate degrees. Undergraduate game modeling courses, taken toward the middle and end of a program, cover basic design principles like mapping, shading and texturing in 3-D game design, allowing students to conceptualize 3-D coordinate systems and learn to construct 3-D game models. Students use Maya or 3D Studio Max software to rig and model characters, as well as backgrounds and scenery. Graduate-level modeling courses apply spline and polygon modeling methods to more advanced 3-D rendering. Master's degree students learn the applications of artificial intelligence in many types of games. This graduate-level course examines logic programming that allows game programmers to create non-playing characters that interact with a player's character in a video game and adversaries that respond to a player's actions. Rather than providing a set of instructions for a program to carry out, students develop constraints and decision trees for the program to operate within. Courses may teach LISP programming language or require students to have prior experience with it.
