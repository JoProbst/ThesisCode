People with EDS often experience joint hypermobility, which can lead to joint instability and dislocations. EDS can also affect the gastrointestinal system, including causing nausea, stomach pain, and constipation. Treatment for EDS typically involves physical therapy and medication to manage symptoms.",109,ehlers danlos syndrome POTS nausea stomach pain,-0.033765409141778946,0
49015b2b-6ce7-4403-8b83-285b37c4f33c,"Pain and gastrointestinal dysfunction are significant associations with psychiatric disorders in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorders: a retrospective study   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   &     , –() In this retrospective study, we investigate the frequency and types of psychiatric disorders and their relationship to systemic manifestations in a cohort of 391 Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) patients based on the current 2017 International Classification of EDS diagnostic criteria. A detailed, systematic retrospective chart review was undertaken for patients assessed for HSD or EDS at two Canadian health centres. Patients were diagnosed according to the Villefranche criteria and reclassified for this study according to the 2017 International Classification of EDS. Data validation and statistical analyses were conducted. Psychiatric disorders were very common, with 49.4% of the total cohort affected; 28.9% reported multiple psychiatric diagnoses. Mood (34.5%) and somatoform (28.6%) disorders were most common. Interestingly, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was significantly enriched in the HSD, but not EDS cohort ( = 0.0002, 95% CI 3.48–9.00) compared to the general population. There were no differences in the systemic associations with having psychiatric manifestations in the HSD compared to the EDS subsets. Muscle/body pain (OR 1.99) and gastrointestinal dysfunction (OR 2.07) were significantly associated with having mood disorders, and gastrointestinal dysfunction (OR 2.61) and nerve-related pain (OR 3.27) were associated with having somatoform disorders across the cohort. The common systemic associations with the presence of psychiatric manifestations in both HSD and EDS reaffirm that the conditions should be treated as a spectrum rather than as wholly separate entities, particularly with respect to psychiatric management. EDS and HSD patients share common psychiatric presentations, though ADHD is more common with HSD. This is a preview of subscription content, to check access.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and chronic fatigue in adolescents: Working toward recovery Chronic fatigue is common and often multifactorial in adolescents. In some patients, fatigue is due to a concurrent medical condition, inadequate sleep habits or coexisting psychological challenges. Occasionally, however, the fatigue persists in the absence of identifiable medical conditions. Many teens who experience chronic fatigue have additional symptoms, including tachycardia, dizziness, headaches, nausea and abdominal pain, that suggest the presence of some form of autonomic dysfunction. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is one type of autonomic dysfunction. Specific definitions vary, but generally include chronic fatigue and two key components: Excessive postural tachycardia (more than 40 beats a minute) with supine to upright positioning on a tilt table In addition to these signs and symptoms, adolescents with POTS often also experience depression and anxiety. According to , a pediatric physiatrist at Mayo Clinic Children's Center in Minnesota, the social and economic consequences related to POTS are significant. ""Adolescent patients diagnosed with POTS may experience decreased school attendance, withdrawal from extracurricular activities, decreased academic performance and truancy,"" notes Dr. Driscoll. ""And, as patients have multiple consultations while seeking a diagnosis and treatment, this condition can also have a significant financial impact on families."" While research continues to explore the pathophysiology of this condition, it's important to note that effective treatment is available for these patients. Dr. Driscoll advises that once the medical evaluation is complete, providers should encourage patients and their families to move beyond the search for medical diagnoses and focus on recovery. ""Education and motivating patients to incorporate new healthy-living practices into their lives can help remediate POTS symptoms and reduce the negative impact of POTS and chronic fatigue in adolescents,"" says Dr. Driscoll. In a recent article published in Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care, Dr. Driscoll and colleagues provide an overview about POTS and chronic fatigue, reviewing the relevant medical and psychological literature, and drawing upon the authors' practice experiences. Below are a few highlights from this review article, focusing on recovery strategies. As they struggle to find help for a condition that is not yet well-understood, many patients with POTS and their parents experience feelings of isolation and lack of social support. Education focusing on self-management and fostering social support is helpful. Individual and group education sessions that involve both patients and their families can encourage social interaction and lessen the feelings of isolation. Sessions should encourage a systematic approach to comprehensive lifestyle changes required for managing this condition. Patients with POTS can experience a wide range of symptoms that no single medication or treatment can relieve. Treatment plans at Mayo Clinic typically use multidisciplinary care teams that may include specialists in general pediatrics, neurology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, sleep medicine, pulmonology, cardiology, infectious disease, psychology, psychiatry, and others as needed. Improvement in sleep hygiene, aerobic exercise and strength training, and cognitive behavioral therapy for pain and symptom management can be effective recovery tools. To improve the effective circulatory volume and enhance venous return, patients are advised to avoid sudden changes in posture, prolonged recumbency, high temperatures, large meals, and vasodilating or sympathomimetic drugs. Increased intake of fluids (preferably caffeine-free) and salt is usually helpful. Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of including exercise and activity in the treatment plan. Exercise increases the effective circulatory volume and improves stroke volume and conditioning. Although there are currently no widely accepted specific exercise recommendations for patients with POTS, Dr. Driscoll says that patients should start with a duration and intensity that they can manage comfortably. They should gradually work toward performing at least one hour of age-appropriate aerobic exercise daily and strength training three times a week. Patients with severe fatigue may benefit from starting with recumbent strengthening, cycling, rowing or swimming, with a gradual transition to activities in an upright posture. When nonpharmacologic therapies fail to provide adequate relief from headache, circulatory problems and gastrointestinal symptoms, patients may benefit from incorporating some medication in their therapeutic regimen. These can include: Beta blockers and vasoconstrictors to reduce blood pooling and increase venous return Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to address intestinal flow and blood flow Currently, data supporting the use of medications to treat ""brain fog,"" nausea and abdominal pain associated with POTS are scarce. Some patients experience pain and fatigue symptoms that significantly limit their ability to function and participate in school or social activities. Some patients experience pain and fatigue symptoms that significantly limit their ability to function and participate in school or social activities. When these patients don't get relief from typical medical or nonpharmacologic strategies, they may benefit from a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Mayo Clinic's Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Center offers a 15-day program that includes a group pediatric outpatient interdisciplinary chronic pain rehabilitation program. This program helps participants focus their efforts on increasing function, tapering off of pain medications, and using cognitive behavioral therapy to build pain management and coping skills. The program's multidisciplinary team also emphasizes stress management, treatment of depression and anxiety, and sleep hygiene. Family members are taught: To promote independent use of positive coping skills In summary, adolescents with POTS can progress toward recovery with multidisciplinary care that includes patient and family education and a daily treatment plan including fluid and salt intake, aerobic exercise, improved sleep hygiene, and psychological support.

d6616bae-4cf8-40ad-93e6-5d6d179d9e18,"One sign of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is having joints that can extend past the normal range of motion. See more The human body is made up of many kinds of tissue that serve important daily functions. Tissues hold the body together, protect the body's insides, enable movement and carry electrical messages from the brain to the rest of the body. Everything the body does depends on its tissues. So what happens when connective tissues, including bones and inner layers of skin, don't work the way they should? Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, or EDS, is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissues and prevents the body from functioning in the way that it should. Symptoms of EDS include: Joints that move beyond the normal range of motion, which can lead to dislocations and chronic pain Extremely delicate skin that is susceptible to injury Overly stretchy skin, which makes the skin vulnerable to damage and exposes a person's internal organs to harm EDS abnormalities such as these are caused by faulty collagen, which is the substance that gives strength and elasticity to connective tissues in the skin, joints and blood vessel walls [source: ]. The six main types of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome each have their own specific symptoms. The severity of these symptoms varies on a case-by-case basis, sometimes affecting the patient in such a minor way that EDS goes undiagnosed, and sometimes causing severe mobility issues. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is rare, and patients diagnosed with EDS should remain under a doctor's care in order to address their specific symptoms. If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, you might be wondering what the symptoms of EDS are and how it is treated. You also might be worried about passing it on to your children. Keep reading to find out what you need to know. Although all forms of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome share certain symptoms, such as muscle fatigue and stretchy skin, the six distinct types of EDS each present specific symptoms. Three of these types are extremely rare. The most common forms of EDS are hypermobility, classical EDS and vascular EDS. , which affects 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 people, causes looseness in both large and small joints. Dislocations are common, and patients often experience pain in their joints and limbs [source: ]. affects 1 in 20,000 to 40,000 people, and it's marked by skin hyperextensibility (stretchiness), scars and wounds that don't heal properly, fatty and noncancerous growths, and delicate skin tissue that is vulnerable to bruising [source: ]. has been reported in an estimated 1 in 250,000 people. This type is considered highly serious because of the risk of major organs or blood vessels rupturing. People with vascular EDS have very thin and fragile skin, which is often so translucent that veins can be seen through it [source: ]. Easy bruising is common. High risk factors associated with vascular EDS often result in a life expectancy of about 50 years [source: ]. The other three forms of EDS are rare, having been reported in fewer than 100 cases worldwide. , which is marked by congenital hip dislocation, has been seen in only about 30 cases [source: ]. Patients with this type of EDS also experience early onset arthritis, increased bruising, stretchy skin and atrophic scarring, which marks the deterioration of tissue [source: ]. People with , which has been reported in a dozen cases around the world, have severely fragile skin with a soft, doughy texture. They, too, are highly susceptible to bruising, though the disorder does not inhibit wound healing as it does in other forms [source: ]. The least common form of EDS is , which has been reported in only a few cases worldwide [source: ]. Weak muscle tone and delayed motor development, often resulting in loss of movement during a person's 20s or 30s, are common in this EDS type [source: ]. With kyphoscoliosis, the spine becomes increasingly curved as the disease progresses, and the eyes, marked by small corneas, are easily damaged and ruptured. Next, you will learn what impact these symptoms have on patients diagnosed with EDS. The scarring seen in Classical EDS can look similar to the stretch marks caused by pregnancy and growth spurts. This type of scarring results from weakened elastic fibers in the skin [source: ]. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a lifelong condition, but daily symptoms vary from patient to patient. Daily symptoms might be severe and debilitating, causing immobility and the risk of rupture, or they could be so minor that the disease goes undiagnosed [source: ]. Most EDS symptoms can be organized into two categories: skin-related symptoms and joint-related symptoms. Skin-related symptoms largely relate to issues of sensitivity and fragility. Hyperextensibility, in which skin becomes overly stretchy like a rubber band, is one such symptom. The skin might also appear unusually velvety and soft, or it might be malleable and ""doughy"" [source: ]. In other cases, specifically in vascular EDS, extremely fragile skin is almost translucent and is highly vulnerable to tearing. Whether the skin is stretchy or delicate, certain complications, such as increased bruising, abnormal scarring, cysts beneath the skin and premature aging, can arise [source: ]. Wounds, particularly those that have been stitched, might also have difficulty healing because of the skin's condition. The most severe possible complication is when an artery or organ ruptures because the skin is too thin to provide adequate protection, which occurs in vascular EDS. Joint-related symptoms largely affect a person's ability to move. Hypermobility, when a joint is overly loose, occurs in small and large joints -- from a toe to a shoulder -- and can cause many complications. Dangerous complications associated with hypermobility include susceptibility to dislocation, chronic joint pain, early onset arthritis and osteoporosis. In rare cases, hip dislocation and spine curvature can result from deteriorating bone tissue. Though the symptoms of EDS might appear daunting, several treatments and measures exist to relieve patients' pain and difficulties. EDS in itself is not fatal, and most people diagnosed with it are able to live a relatively normal life because its symptoms are treatable. The hypermobility of joints resulting from EDS, which allows a greater range of motion than is typical, was the secret behind performers in early circuses and performance tours, such as ""The Human Pretzel"" and ""The Elastic Lady"" [source: ]. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a genetic condition, so no cure or remedy exists to reverse the disease or permanently eliminate its symptoms. However, effective means of dealing with EDS do exist. Doctors who treat patients with EDS focus on pain management and preventive care for symptoms that have not presented. Daily pain management often uses a combination of pain relievers and physical therapy. A patient's physical therapy focuses on strengthening muscles, which in turn can strengthen the patient's joints. A doctor or physical therapist should prescribe a carefully planned workout routine because some exercises are detrimental to EDS patients. Any exercise that involves locking the joints, especially weightlifting, should be avoided, because these cause the joints additional stress and harm [source: ]. Preventive care methods involve making a person's environment as safe as possible and learning how to protect joints from further damage. Even simple daily activities, such as reaching for cereal on a high shelf, can cause injury. Homes should be arranged to accommodate daily needs and protect the body from potential damage, such as falls. Special self-help devices, such as step stools, hair dryer stands and long-handled combs, can be used to prevent overstretching [source: ]. Although these measures help alleviate pain and prevent injury on a day-to-day basis, patients with EDS should consult several types of doctors, including ophthalmologists, dentists and EDS specialists, to design a complete treatment plan. Genetic counselors are an important component of treatment for individuals with EDS. By analyzing the genetic structure of the problematic collagen, geneticists can understand more clearly which type of EDS a patient has. Identifying the EDS type enables doctors to design an effective treatment plan tailored to the individual. A genetic counselor explains the technical side of the geneticists' findings and serves as an information resource, answering questions and providing additional facts. Genetic counselors can also connect patients to support groups and can counsel families dealing with the disease [source: ]. One primary service provided by genetic counselors is helping EDS patients and their partners understand and evaluate the risks of pregnancy. Read on for more information about pregnancy and EDS. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is diagnosed by physical examination, study of the family history, and one or more of these tests: , which can identify classical, vascular, kyphoscoliosis, and arthrochalasis EDS , which can help diagnose kyphoscoliosis , which can identify vascular EDS by analyzing collagen production , which checks for mitral valve prolapse, a heart condition that has been associated with classical and hypermobility EDS [source: ] As with EDS symptoms, the risks associated with pregnancy in EDS patients vary greatly from case to case. Risks do exist, and most doctors will closely monitor any pregnant woman with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome throughout her pregnancy. Doctors might advise some women against pregnancy if they believe the potential complications could prove fatal. Complications that can arise during an EDS pregnancy include premature delivery and excessive bleeding during delivery. Also, if the baby inherits EDS, the membranes surrounding the baby might rupture, possibly causing extensive bleeding for the mother and danger for the child [source: ]. Many EDS pregnancies result in miscarriage. Vascular EDS presents the most potential problems for pregnancy. Because of the highly delicate state of the body, several complications can occur before and during birth. The uterus could hemorrhage or rupture before delivery, which can be fatal for the mother and would almost certainly require a hysterectomy immediately after the birth, if the mother survives. Delivery itself can be dangerous for the mother because patients with EDS have a difficult time healing. Having a C-section is especially risky, and vaginal tearing during labor can lead to more severe complications for the mother [source: ]. Doctors and geneticists typically advise women with EDS to determine genetic risk prior to becoming pregnant. This is a primary function of geneticists and genetic counselors treating people with EDS. Genetic tests help determine the risk of transmission of EDS to the fetus, which increases the number of possible complications during pregnancy [source: ]. Genetic counselors and other doctors can help explain and evaluate the risks of pregnancy. Although the odds might seem against women with EDS giving birth without complications, each case is different. EDS patients should discuss their specific conditions and symptoms with the appropriate doctors and counselors in order to determine the best treatments and pregnancy plans for them. With pregnancy, as with all facets of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, the more specific the information a person has, the better prepared he or she is to live -- and enjoy -- daily life.

af289a02-7165-45ae-974e-7779c3f0aa20,"One sign of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is having joints that can extend past the normal range of motion. See more The human body is made up of many kinds of tissue that serve important daily functions. Tissues hold the body together, protect the body's insides, enable movement and carry electrical messages from the brain to the rest of the body. Everything the body does depends on its tissues. So what happens when connective tissues, including bones and inner layers of skin, don't work the way they should? Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, or EDS, is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissues and prevents the body from functioning in the way that it should. Symptoms of EDS include: Joints that move beyond the normal range of motion, which can lead to dislocations and chronic pain Extremely delicate skin that is susceptible to injury Overly stretchy skin, which makes the skin vulnerable to damage and exposes a person's internal organs to harm EDS abnormalities such as these are caused by faulty collagen, which is the substance that gives strength and elasticity to connective tissues in the skin, joints and blood vessel walls [source: ]. The six main types of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome each have their own specific symptoms. The severity of these symptoms varies on a case-by-case basis, sometimes affecting the patient in such a minor way that EDS goes undiagnosed, and sometimes causing severe mobility issues. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is rare, and patients diagnosed with EDS should remain under a doctor's care in order to address their specific symptoms. If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, you might be wondering what the symptoms of EDS are and how it is treated. You also might be worried about passing it on to your children. Keep reading to find out what you need to know. Although all forms of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome share certain symptoms, such as muscle fatigue and stretchy skin, the six distinct types of EDS each present specific symptoms. Three of these types are extremely rare. The most common forms of EDS are hypermobility, classical EDS and vascular EDS. , which affects 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 people, causes looseness in both large and small joints. Dislocations are common, and patients often experience pain in their joints and limbs [source: ]. affects 1 in 20,000 to 40,000 people, and it's marked by skin hyperextensibility (stretchiness), scars and wounds that don't heal properly, fatty and noncancerous growths, and delicate skin tissue that is vulnerable to bruising [source: ]. has been reported in an estimated 1 in 250,000 people. This type is considered highly serious because of the risk of major organs or blood vessels rupturing. People with vascular EDS have very thin and fragile skin, which is often so translucent that veins can be seen through it [source: ]. Easy bruising is common. High risk factors associated with vascular EDS often result in a life expectancy of about 50 years [source: ]. The other three forms of EDS are rare, having been reported in fewer than 100 cases worldwide. , which is marked by congenital hip dislocation, has been seen in only about 30 cases [source: ]. Patients with this type of EDS also experience early onset arthritis, increased bruising, stretchy skin and atrophic scarring, which marks the deterioration of tissue [source: ]. People with , which has been reported in a dozen cases around the world, have severely fragile skin with a soft, doughy texture. They, too, are highly susceptible to bruising, though the disorder does not inhibit wound healing as it does in other forms [source: ]. The least common form of EDS is , which has been reported in only a few cases worldwide [source: ]. Weak muscle tone and delayed motor development, often resulting in loss of movement during a person's 20s or 30s, are common in this EDS type [source: ]. With kyphoscoliosis, the spine becomes increasingly curved as the disease progresses, and the eyes, marked by small corneas, are easily damaged and ruptured. Next, you will learn what impact these symptoms have on patients diagnosed with EDS. The scarring seen in Classical EDS can look similar to the stretch marks caused by pregnancy and growth spurts. This type of scarring results from weakened elastic fibers in the skin [source: ]. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a lifelong condition, but daily symptoms vary from patient to patient. Daily symptoms might be severe and debilitating, causing immobility and the risk of rupture, or they could be so minor that the disease goes undiagnosed [source: ]. Most EDS symptoms can be organized into two categories: skin-related symptoms and joint-related symptoms. Skin-related symptoms largely relate to issues of sensitivity and fragility. Hyperextensibility, in which skin becomes overly stretchy like a rubber band, is one such symptom. The skin might also appear unusually velvety and soft, or it might be malleable and ""doughy"" [source: ]. In other cases, specifically in vascular EDS, extremely fragile skin is almost translucent and is highly vulnerable to tearing. Whether the skin is stretchy or delicate, certain complications, such as increased bruising, abnormal scarring, cysts beneath the skin and premature aging, can arise [source: ]. Wounds, particularly those that have been stitched, might also have difficulty healing because of the skin's condition. The most severe possible complication is when an artery or organ ruptures because the skin is too thin to provide adequate protection, which occurs in vascular EDS. Joint-related symptoms largely affect a person's ability to move. Hypermobility, when a joint is overly loose, occurs in small and large joints -- from a toe to a shoulder -- and can cause many complications. Dangerous complications associated with hypermobility include susceptibility to dislocation, chronic joint pain, early onset arthritis and osteoporosis. In rare cases, hip dislocation and spine curvature can result from deteriorating bone tissue. Though the symptoms of EDS might appear daunting, several treatments and measures exist to relieve patients' pain and difficulties. EDS in itself is not fatal, and most people diagnosed with it are able to live a relatively normal life because its symptoms are treatable. The hypermobility of joints resulting from EDS, which allows a greater range of motion than is typical, was the secret behind performers in early circuses and performance tours, such as ""The Human Pretzel"" and ""The Elastic Lady"" [source: ]. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a genetic condition, so no cure or remedy exists to reverse the disease or permanently eliminate its symptoms. However, effective means of dealing with EDS do exist. Doctors who treat patients with EDS focus on pain management and preventive care for symptoms that have not presented. Daily pain management often uses a combination of pain relievers and physical therapy. A patient's physical therapy focuses on strengthening muscles, which in turn can strengthen the patient's joints. A doctor or physical therapist should prescribe a carefully planned workout routine because some exercises are detrimental to EDS patients. Any exercise that involves locking the joints, especially weightlifting, should be avoided, because these cause the joints additional stress and harm [source: ]. Preventive care methods involve making a person's environment as safe as possible and learning how to protect joints from further damage. Even simple daily activities, such as reaching for cereal on a high shelf, can cause injury. Homes should be arranged to accommodate daily needs and protect the body from potential damage, such as falls. Special self-help devices, such as step stools, hair dryer stands and long-handled combs, can be used to prevent overstretching [source: ]. Although these measures help alleviate pain and prevent injury on a day-to-day basis, patients with EDS should consult several types of doctors, including ophthalmologists, dentists and EDS specialists, to design a complete treatment plan. Genetic counselors are an important component of treatment for individuals with EDS. By analyzing the genetic structure of the problematic collagen, geneticists can understand more clearly which type of EDS a patient has. Identifying the EDS type enables doctors to design an effective treatment plan tailored to the individual. A genetic counselor explains the technical side of the geneticists' findings and serves as an information resource, answering questions and providing additional facts. Genetic counselors can also connect patients to support groups and can counsel families dealing with the disease [source: ]. One primary service provided by genetic counselors is helping EDS patients and their partners understand and evaluate the risks of pregnancy. Read on for more information about pregnancy and EDS. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is diagnosed by physical examination, study of the family history, and one or more of these tests: , which can identify classical, vascular, kyphoscoliosis, and arthrochalasis EDS , which can help diagnose kyphoscoliosis , which can identify vascular EDS by analyzing collagen production , which checks for mitral valve prolapse, a heart condition that has been associated with classical and hypermobility EDS [source: ] As with EDS symptoms, the risks associated with pregnancy in EDS patients vary greatly from case to case. Risks do exist, and most doctors will closely monitor any pregnant woman with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome throughout her pregnancy. Doctors might advise some women against pregnancy if they believe the potential complications could prove fatal. Complications that can arise during an EDS pregnancy include premature delivery and excessive bleeding during delivery. Also, if the baby inherits EDS, the membranes surrounding the baby might rupture, possibly causing extensive bleeding for the mother and danger for the child [source: ]. Many EDS pregnancies result in miscarriage. Vascular EDS presents the most potential problems for pregnancy. Because of the highly delicate state of the body, several complications can occur before and during birth. The uterus could hemorrhage or rupture before delivery, which can be fatal for the mother and would almost certainly require a hysterectomy immediately after the birth, if the mother survives. Delivery itself can be dangerous for the mother because patients with EDS have a difficult time healing. Having a C-section is especially risky, and vaginal tearing during labor can lead to more severe complications for the mother [source: ]. Doctors and geneticists typically advise women with EDS to determine genetic risk prior to becoming pregnant. This is a primary function of geneticists and genetic counselors treating people with EDS. Genetic tests help determine the risk of transmission of EDS to the fetus, which increases the number of possible complications during pregnancy [source: ]. Genetic counselors and other doctors can help explain and evaluate the risks of pregnancy. Although the odds might seem against women with EDS giving birth without complications, each case is different. EDS patients should discuss their specific conditions and symptoms with the appropriate doctors and counselors in order to determine the best treatments and pregnancy plans for them. With pregnancy, as with all facets of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, the more specific the information a person has, the better prepared he or she is to live -- and enjoy -- daily life.

bf941203-5127-41ed-b256-6c8500a58207,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited disorders that affect your connective tissues — primarily your skin, joints and blood vessel walls. Connective tissue is a complex mixture of proteins and other substances that provide strength and elasticity to the underlying structures in your body. People who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome usually have overly flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin. This can become a problem if you have a wound that requires stitches, because the skin often isn't strong enough to hold them. A more severe form of the disorder, called vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can cause the walls of your blood vessels, intestines or uterus to rupture. Because vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can have serious potential complications in pregnancy, you may want to talk to a genetic counselor before starting a family. There are many different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common signs and symptoms include: Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocations are common. Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when you let go. Your skin might also feel exceptionally soft and velvety. Damaged skin often doesn't heal well. For example, the stitches used to close a wound often will tear out and leave a gaping scar. These scars may look thin and crinkly. Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal. The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines — which also may rupture. Different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are associated with a variety of genetic causes, some of which are inherited and passed on from parent to child. If you have the most common form, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there's a 50% chance that you'll pass on the gene to each of your children. Complications depend on the types of signs and symptoms you have. For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus. If you have a personal or family history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and you're thinking about starting a family, you may benefit from talking to a genetic counselor — a health care professional trained to assess the risk of inherited disorders. Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affects you and the risks it poses for your children.

What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? What Causes Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? Who Gets Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Diagnosed? How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Treated? What Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder that can make someone feel faint or dizzy. It happens when the autonomic nervous system (ANS) doesn't work as it should. The autonomic nervous system is the body's ""autopilot"" system, controlling things like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. The autonomic nervous system problems seen in POTS (also called ) can affect children and adults. Symptoms vary from mild to disabling. What Happens in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? The autonomic nervous system keeps blood pressure at the right level for the brain no matter what position a person is in — standing (vertical), lying flat on the back (called supine), and sitting or reclining (called recumbent). Usually when a person stands, the nerves of the autonomic nervous system tell blood vessels in the lower body to constrict (tighten). The tightening vessels work against gravity to keep blood from collecting in the legs. This automatic response makes sure the brain has enough blood flow to work well. If there is not enough blood flow to the brain, a person may feel lightheaded or pass out every time they stand. In POTS, the autonomic nervous system doesn't work in the usual way, so the blood vessels don't tighten enough to make sure there is enough blood flow to the brain. To try to keep enough blood flowing to the brain, the autonomic nervous system makes the beat a lot faster instead. What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS is named for an unusual jump in the heart's beating speed that happens when a person stands. Other symptoms that can happen with POTS include: heart palpitations (feeling the heart beat or race) lightheadedness (almost passing out; vision tunnels or goes gray or dark) Most POTS symptoms happen only when standing or changing to a standing position. But these may happen without standing: sweating without a cause (such as exercise or warm weather) What Causes Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS might first be noticed after a viral infection or an injury. But it's hard to tell if one of these caused POTS or just happened around the same time that POTS became a problem. Research to learn more about the cause of POTS is underway. Who Gets Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS affects more girls than boys, and is more common when one or both parents had POTS. It often begins in the early or mid-teens. How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Diagnosed? There's no single test to diagnose POTS. Doctors start by doing a complete physical exam and taking a . POTS causes a heart rate increase of 40 or more beats per minute within 10 minutes of when someone moves from a supine (lying down) position to a standing one. The heart rate goes up dramatically, with little if any drop in blood pressure. Doctors can measure this easily. Sometimes, doctors do a ""tilt-table test."" In this test, a person is strapped to a table, then tilted from a supine (lying on the back) position into a standing position while heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. Doctors also make sure the problem isn't due to anything besides the autonomic nervous system. Depending on the symptoms, tests might be done on other parts of the body. These might check the blood, heart, brain, eyes, ears, kidneys, muscles, nerves, hormones, digestive tract, and more. Typically, a diagnosis of POTS is confirmed when symptoms have lasted for several months and no other causes are found. If someone has POTS, the medical team will look for reasons that the autonomic nervous system doesn't respond normally to standing. Finding an answer can help treatments work well. How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Treated? POTS is a chronic (long-term) problem. So doctors try to prevent and manage the things that cause it. That way, a child or teen doesn't have to take medicines for a long time.  a slow increase in exercise, starting with seated, reclined, or horizontal exercises (such as rowing, recumbent bicycling, and swimming) raising the head of the bed so some pressure stays in the blood vessels in the legs during sleep psychological counseling to help manage stress and choices that trigger symptoms The autonomic nervous system is involved in many body functions, so managing all the symptoms related to it can be hard. Sometimes, patients try a few different treatments to find what works well without unpleasant side effects. Multiple doctor's visits may be needed to find the best combination of treatments that improve symptoms. POTS symptoms usually improve over time. Often, they'll completely disappear as kids grow. If a clear and treatable cause is corrected, the symptoms are likely to go away more quickly. Note: All information is for educational purposes only.

There's no single test to diagnose POTS. Doctors start by doing a complete physical exam and taking a . POTS causes a heart rate increase of 40 or more beats per minute within 10 minutes of when someone moves from a supine (lying down) position to a standing one. The heart rate goes up dramatically, with little if any drop in blood pressure. Doctors can measure this easily. Sometimes, doctors do a ""tilt-table test."" In this test, a person is strapped to a table, then tilted from a supine (lying on the back) position into a standing position while heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. Doctors also make sure the problem isn't due to anything besides the autonomic nervous system. Depending on the symptoms, tests might be done on other parts of the body. These might check the blood, heart, brain, eyes, ears, kidneys, muscles, nerves, hormones, digestive tract, and more. Typically, a diagnosis of POTS is confirmed when symptoms have lasted for several months and no other causes are found. If someone has POTS, the medical team will look for reasons that the autonomic nervous system doesn't respond normally to standing. Finding an answer can help treatments work well.

What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? What Causes Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? Who Gets Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Diagnosed? How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Treated? What Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder that can make someone feel faint or dizzy. It happens when the autonomic nervous system (ANS) doesn't work as it should. The autonomic nervous system is the body's ""autopilot"" system, controlling things like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. The autonomic nervous system problems seen in POTS (also called ) can affect children and adults. Symptoms vary from mild to disabling. What Happens in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? The autonomic nervous system keeps blood pressure at the right level for the brain no matter what position a person is in — standing (vertical), lying flat on the back (called supine), and sitting or reclining (called recumbent). Usually when a person stands, the nerves of the autonomic nervous system tell blood vessels in the lower body to constrict (tighten). The tightening vessels work against gravity to keep blood from collecting in the legs. This automatic response makes sure the brain has enough blood flow to work well. If there is not enough blood flow to the brain, a person may feel lightheaded or pass out every time they stand. In POTS, the autonomic nervous system doesn't work in the usual way, so the blood vessels don't tighten enough to make sure there is enough blood flow to the brain. To try to keep enough blood flowing to the brain, the autonomic nervous system makes the beat a lot faster instead. What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS is named for an unusual jump in the heart's beating speed that happens when a person stands. Other symptoms that can happen with POTS include: heart palpitations (feeling the heart beat or race) lightheadedness (almost passing out; vision tunnels or goes gray or dark) Most POTS symptoms happen only when standing or changing to a standing position. But these may happen without standing: sweating without a cause (such as exercise or warm weather) What Causes Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS might first be noticed after a viral infection or an injury. But it's hard to tell if one of these caused POTS or just happened around the same time that POTS became a problem. Research to learn more about the cause of POTS is underway. Who Gets Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)?

Boguski, MD, PhD Australian singer/songwriter Sia (born Sia Kate Isobelle Furler), 43, is known for wearing elaborate wigs and headpieces that hide her face. However, the """" singer is not hiding the fact that she was recently diagnosed with the connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. ""Hey, I'm suffering with chronic pain, a neurological disease, ehlers danlos and I just wanted to say to those of you suffering from pain, whether physical or emotional, I love you, keep going. Life is f***g hard. Pain is demoralizing, and you're not alone."" In the past, Sia has suffered from depression, addictions to painkillers and alcohol (she's been sober for 9 years), and in 2010 was diagnosed as having Graves' disease. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of inherited connective tissue disorders caused by abnormalities in the structure, production, and/or processing of collagen. The new classification, from 2017, includes 13 subtypes of EDS. Although other forms of the condition may exist, they are extremely rare and are not well-characterized. The signs and symptoms of EDS vary by type and range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications. Features shared by many types include joint hypermobility and soft, velvety skin that is highly elastic (stretchy) and bruises easily. - characterized primarily by joint hypermobility affecting both large and small joints, which may lead to recurrent joint dislocations and subluxations (partial dislocation). In general, people with this type have soft, smooth, and velvety skin with easy bruising and chronic pain of the muscles and/or bones. - associated with extremely elastic (stretchy), smooth skin that is fragile and bruises easily; wide, atrophic scars (flat or depressed scars); and joint hypermobility. Molluscoid pseudotumors (calcified hematomas over pressure points such as the elbow) and spheroids (fat-containing cysts on forearms and shins) are also frequently seen. Hypotonia and delayed motor development may occur. - characterized by thin, translucent skin that is extremely fragile and bruises easily. Arteries and certain organs such as the intestines and uterus are also fragile and prone to rupture. People with this type typically have short stature; thin scalp hair; and characteristic facial features including large eyes, a thin nose, and lobeless ears. Joint hypermobility is present, but generally confined to the small joints (fingers, toes). Other common features include club foot; tendon and/or muscle rupture; acrogeria (premature aging of the skin of the hands and feet); early onset varicose veins; pneumothorax (collapse of a lung); recession of the gums; and a decreased amount of fat under the skin. - associated with severe hypotonia at birth, delayed motor development, progressive scoliosis (present from birth), and scleral fragility. Affected people may also have easy bruising; fragile arteries that are prone to rupture; unusually small corneas; and osteopenia (low bone density). Other common features include a ""marfanoid habitus"" which is characterized by long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly); unusually long limbs; and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or protruding chest (pectus carinatum). - characterized by severe joint hypermobility and congenital hip dislocation. Other common features include fragile, elastic skin with easy bruising; hypotonia; kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis); and mild osteopenia. - associated with extremely fragile skin leading to severe bruising and scarring; saggy, redundant skin, especially on the face; and hernias. The combined prevalence of all types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome appears to be at least 1 in 5,000 individuals worldwide. The hypermobile and classical forms are most common; the hypermobile type may affect as many as 1 in 5,000 to 20,000 people, while the classical type probably occurs in 1 in 20,000 to 40,000 people. Other forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are rare, often with only a few cases or affected families described in the medical literature. Mutations in at least 19 genes have been found to cause the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Mutations in the or gene, or rarely in the gene, can cause the classical type. Mutations in the gene cause the classical-like type and have been reported in a very small percentage of cases of the hypermobile type (although in most people with this type, the cause is unknown). Some of the genes associated with the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, including COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, and COL5A2, provide instructions for making pieces of several different types of collagen. These pieces assemble to form mature collagen molecules that give structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. Other genes, including ADAMTS2, FKBP14, PLOD1, and TNXB, provide instructions for making proteins that process, fold, or interact with collagen. Mutations in any of these genes disrupt the production or processing of collagen, preventing these molecules from being assembled properly. These changes weaken connective tissues in the skin, bones, and other parts of the body, resulting in the characteristic features of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. The inheritance pattern of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes varies by type. The classical, vascular, arthrochalasia, and periodontal forms of the disorder, and likely the hypermobile type, have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The classical-like, cardiac-valvular, dermatosparaxis, kyphoscoliotic, spondylodysplastic, and musculocontractural types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, as well as brittle cornea syndrome, are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. A diagnosis of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) is typically based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Depending on the subtype suspected, some of the following tests may be ordered to support the diagnosis: Collagen typing, performed on a skin biopsy, may aid in the diagnosis of vascular type, arthrochalasia type, and dermatosparaxis type. People with EDS often have abnormalities of certain types of collagen. Genetic testing is available for many subtypes of EDS; however, it is not an option for most families with the hypermobility type. Imaging studies such as CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, and angiography may be useful in identifying certain features of the condition. Urine tests to detect deficiencies in certain enzymes that are important for collagen formation may be helpful in diagnosing the kyphoscoliosis type. The treatment and management of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is focused on preventing serious complications and relieving signs and symptoms. The features of EDS vary by subtype, so management strategies differ slightly. Because several body systems may be affected, different medical specialists may need to be involved. The main aspects of management include cardiovascular work-up, physical therapy, pain management, and psychological follow-up as needed. Surgery is sometimes recommended for various reasons in people with EDS. However, depending on the type of EDS and severity, there may be an increased risk of various surgical complications such as wound healing problems, excessive bleeding, dissection, and hernias. Surgery for non-life threatening conditions particularly should be carefully considered. Sources: , Michele R. Berman, MD, and Mark S.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of conditions that affect the connective tissues in the body. These tissues include cartilage, bone, fat and blood. They support organs and other tissues throughout the body. Doctors classify Ehlers-Danlos syndrome into 13 types based on their most notable features and the parts of the body where symptoms appear. People with the most common type have symptoms including very loose joints and fragile skin that tears easily. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can be genetic, meaning it is passed down through family members. An estimated 1 in 5,000-20,000 people have the most common type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Each type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome has its own symptoms. The most common type of the condition is Ehlers-Danlos hypermobility, or hypermobile EDS. Its symptoms include: Soft skin that is thinner and stretches more than normal A defect in collagen (proteins that add flexibility and strength to connective tissue) causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. People with the disorder have a faulty gene that leads to weak collagen or not enough normal collagen in their tissues. These defects can harm the connective tissue’s ability to support muscles, organs, and other tissues. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 06/25/2018.

A novel missense mutation of in a patient with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome A novel missense mutation of in a patient with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome , Article number:  () Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by hyperextensible skin, joint hypermobility and soft tissue fragility. For molecular diagnosis, targeted exome sequencing was performed on a 9-year-old male patient who was clinically suspected to have EDS. The patient presented with progressive kyphoscoliosis, joint hypermobility and hyperextensible skin without scars. Ultimately, classical EDS was diagnosed by identifying a novel, mono-allelic mutation in [NM_000393.3(COL5A2_v001):c.682G>A, p.Gly228Arg]. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by a varying degree of skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility and generalized connective tissue fragility. According to the Villefranche nosology, there are six subtypes of EDS that are classified on the basis of their clinical, biochemical and molecular characteristics: classical, hypermobile, vascular, kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasia and dermatosparaxis. Accurate EDS diagnosis allows for appropriate screening of life-altering complications, including vascular and hollow organ rupture, and ligamentous laxity, leading to chronic dislocation with subsequent pain and long-term disability. The various forms of EDS are diagnosed on the basis of the patient’s clinical presentation and family history. However, because of overlapping symptoms, diagnosing EDS remains a challenge, and many patients are left undiagnosed or have a delayed diagnosis. These cases may remain uncategorized, even by well-trained medical professionals. Mutations in genes encoding fibrillar (type I, III and V) collagen chains or proteins have been identified in most types of EDS, with the exception of the hypermobility type. These known underlying genetic defects are different in each subtype. Genetic testing may be diagnostically useful to identify specific EDS subtypes, but even in typical cases, genetic defects are not always detected in disease-causing genes. Because of shared clinical features between EDS subtypes, the diagnosis of these rare conditions is difficult, and an accurate diagnosis using the appropriate genetic test for each subtype can be challenging. For a molecular diagnosis outside the expected EDS genotype–phenotype relationship, simultaneous testing for multiple potential disease-causing genes in the suspected EDS patient may be an effective and systematic approach. Conventional Sanger sequencing has routinely been used for genetic testing to identify disease-causing mutations; however, it is laborious, expensive and time consuming for multiple candidate genes. Recently, targeted exome sequencing (TES) of candidate or known disease-associated genes utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been used to diagnose patients with various types of disorders, including EDS. Here we report a mono-allelic missense mutation of (MIM 120190), NM_000393.3(COL5A2_v001):c.682G>A, detected in a TES panel for the coding regions of 4,813 clinical phenotype-associated genes, including EDS-associated genes, in a Japanese patient with EDS. Through this approach, the patient was diagnosed with classical EDS (cEDS). The patient is the fifth child of healthy, non-consanguineous parents. After an uneventful pregnancy, he was born at 35 weeks gestation following the premature rupture of the fetal membranes. His birth weight was 1,924 g (−1.3 SD). Because of an unknown cause, perforation of the terminal ileum occurred at the age of 2 days, and an ileostomy was performed. After follow-up with central venous nutrition and tube feeding, closure of the ileostomy was performed at the age of 52 days, and he left the hospital at the age of 73 days. He achieved head control at the age of 9 months and walked independently at the age of 18 months. At the age of 1 year, the patient was diagnosed with hypotonia and kyphoscoliosis, and treated with a brace at another clinic. His kyphoscoliosis was non-responsive to the brace and increased in severity over time. At the age of 9 years, the patient was suspected to have a connective tissue disorder because he showed muscle weakness and joint hypermobility. Therefore, he was readmitted to our hospital for diagnosis. Clinical examination at the age of 9 years showed a boy with a height of 117.4 cm (–2.3 SD) and weight of 19.9 kg (–1.5 SD). He had joint hypermobility (Beighton score=6), mild hyperextensible skin (~1.5 cm on the volar surface of the forearm) and severe kyphoscoliosis (), but did not have widened atrophic scars. In the minor diagnostic criteria for cEDS, smooth velvety skin, muscle hypotonia and delayed gross motor development were observed in addition to the manifestations of tissue extensibility and fragility (perforation of the terminal ileum at the age of 2 days). No abnormality was revealed during physical examination of the chest and abdomen or during an ophthalmological evaluation. Echocardiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal. No family history of EDS was observed. On the basis of his clinical presentation, the patient was suspected of having cEDS (MIM 130000), kyphoscoliotic EDS (MIM 225400) or other related minor EDS types in which severe progressive kyphoscoliosis is prominent. Molecular diagnosis was performed on genomic DNA extracted from a blood sample after informed consent was obtained from the parents. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Tokushima University. To screen multiple EDS genes and other known disease-associated genes, we first performed TES for the proband by using a TruSight One Sequencing Panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and MiSeq benchtop sequencer (Illumina) with our pipeline for NGS data analysis, as described previously. To identify presumably pathogenic single-nucleotide variants, we excluded minor sequence variants with relatively high-allele frequencies, i.e., >0.01, included in the 1000 Genomes Project database (), NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500, ), Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD, ) and Integrative Japanese Genome Variation Database (iJGVD, ). The detection of copy-number variations using TES data with a resolution of a single exon to several exons, depending on the exon size, was performed as described previously. These analyses identified a mono-allelic, missense mutation, NM_000393.3(COL5A2_v001):c.682G>A, in exon 9 of , which resulted in a Gly to Arg substitution at codon 228 [NM_000393.3(COL5A2_i001):p.(Gly228Arg)]. This result was confirmed by using Sanger sequencing and was not found in the parents (). Primer sequences are available upon request. This mutation is not present in human genome variation databases, such as dbSNP138, 1000 Genomes Project, ESP6500, HGVD and iJGVD, or in disease-causing mutation databases, such as the Human Gene Mutation Database Professional 2016.1 (HGMD, ), Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD, https://eds.gene.le.ac.uk/home.php?select_db=COL5A2) and ClinVar (). No other potentially pathogenic single-nucleotide variants or CNAs were detected in the genes possibly responsible for EDS or other related diseases. Through analysis using LJB23 databases for non-synonymous variant annotation in ANNOVAR (), this mutation was predicted to damage protein function, i.e., SIFT score=0, PolyPhen-2 score=1 and MutationTaster score=1. The presence of Gly at every third residue (Gly-X-Y) is considered to be essential for the formation of the characteristic collagen triple helix (). Furthermore, Arg is one of the destabilizing residues observed in the Gly position of the Gly-X-Y repeating pattern in the collagen triple helix, and its presence may cause a range of heritable connective tissue disorders. In the HGMD 2016.1 and LOVD databases, the replacement of one Gly in the (Gly-X-Y) repeat by Arg was reported in four out of five (80%) and five out of seven (71%) missense mutation cases with EDS, respectively. The results of the molecular diagnosis suggested that this is a mutation responsible for EDS, and the patient was diagnosed with cEDS. In cEDS, more than 100 distinct mutations have been described, but only 19 and 24 distinct mutations are reported in the HGMD professional 2016.1 and LOVD databases, respectively. Although mutations are scattered throughout the gene, most mutations are located within the triple-helix domain. Defects in are most commonly null mutations consisting of either nonsense, frameshift or splice-site mutations that generate a premature termination codon (PTC). These PTCs encode transcripts that cause rapid degradation through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and consequently reduce production of type V collagen In contrast, nearly all of the mutations reported to date represent structural mutations, including missense or in-frame exon-skipping splice mutations, thus resulting in the production of mutant α2(V)-chains that probably incorporate into collagen molecules and interfere with the formation of heterotrimers. Secreted mutant heterotrimers are predicted to exert a dominant negative effect that causes functional haploinsufficiency. Because no heterozygous null-allele mutations have been reported, it is possible that null-allele mutations result in no clinical phenotype of cEDS. Although similar observations were reported in and in other connective tissue disorders, the sample size of mutations needs to be increased to conclude this hypothesis. No clear genotype–phenotype correlations for type V collagen defects have emerged in patients with cEDS. The large inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variabilities in cEDS and the possibility of the presence of a null allele in individuals with only minor symptoms of cEDS are also known. It has been reported that 20% of patients with cEDS who fulfilled all three criteria presented with severe progressive kyphoscoliosis, whereas none of the patients who fulfilled only two criteria presented with this phenotype. Here, however, the patient fulfilled only two major criteria of the Villefranche nosology and showed progressive kyphoscoliosis. Compared with mutation carriers, mutation carriers have been reported to fall within the more severe end of the phenotypic spectrum of cEDS, although no difference in severity has been noted in patients carrying a null mutation in one allele compared with patients carrying a structural mutation in or . Studies involving an increased number of patients with mutations are needed to clarify the genotype–phenotype correlations for type V collagen defects in patients with cEDS.

b764778c-ef3b-45c4-9e5b-f270af2826c1,"Clinical improvement in patients with orthostatic intolerance after treatment with bisoprolol and fludrocortisone , –() is the development of disabling symptoms upon assuming an upright posture that are relieved partially by resuming the supine position. Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is an orthostatic intolerance syndrome characterized by palpitations because of excessive orthostatic sinus tachycardia, lightheadedness, tremor, and near-syncope. Patients usually undergo extensive medical, cardiac, endocrine, neurologic, and psychiatric evaluation, which usually fails to identify a specific abnormality. The authors investigated the autonomic and hemodynamic profile of patients with POTS and the effectiveness of bisoprolol and fludrocortisone. The authors evaluated 11 female patients with POTS before and after medical treatment with a cardioselective bisoprolol β-blocker or fludrocortisone, or both, and 11 age-matched control patients. Variability of heart rate and systolic blood pressure was assessed by fast Fourier transform, and spontaneous baroreceptor gain was assessed by use of the temporal sequences slope and α index. Modelflow was used to quantify hemodynamics. Symptoms in all patients improved greatly after medication. The autonomic and hemodynamic impairment observed in patients with POTS, particularly after orthostatic stress, is treated effectively with bisoprolol or fludrocortisone or both. These results need further confirmation in a controlled double-blind study. Proper medical treatment improves dramatically the clinical and autonomic-hemodynamic disturbances observed in patients with POTS. The data support the hypothesis that POTS is the result of a hyperadrenergic activation or hypovolemia during orthostasis. This is a preview of subscription content, to check access.

POTS is a form of orthostatic intolerance, the development of symptoms that come on when standing up from a reclining position, and that may be relieved by sitting or lying back down. The primary symptom of an orthostatic intolerance is lightheadedness, fainting and an uncomfortable, rapid increase in heartbeat. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Menu What is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a condition that affects circulation (blood flow). It involves the autonomic nervous system (which automatically controls and regulates vital bodily functions) and sympathetic nervous system (which activates the fight or flight response). POTS is a form of orthostatic intolerance, the development of symptoms that come on when standing up from a reclining position, and that may be relieved by sitting or lying back down. The primary symptom of an orthostatic intolerance is lightheadedness, fainting and an uncomfortable, rapid increase in heartbeat. Heart rate and blood pressure work together to keep the blood flowing at a healthy pace, no matter what position the body is in. People with POTS cannot coordinate the balancing act of blood vessel squeeze and heart rate response. This means the blood pressure cannot be kept steady and stable. Each case of POTS is different. POTS patients may see symptoms come and go over a period of years. In most cases, with proper adjustments in diet, medications and physical activity, a person with POTS will see an improvement in quality of life. Also, if an underlying cause is found and is treated, POTS symptoms may subside. There are various forms of POTS. The most common are: : Peripheral denervation (loss of nerve supply) leads to poor blood vessel muscles, especially in the legs and core body. : Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. : Reduced blood volume can lead to POTS. Low blood volume can cause similar symptoms that may overlap in neuropathic and hyperadrenergic POTS. The majority of POTS patients are women ages 13-50 years old. About 450,000 people suffer from POTS in the United States. Patients may develop POTS after a viral illness, serious infections, medical illness, pregnancy and trauma such as head injury. The condition may develop as aftermath of a significant illness (especially associated with hospitalization and prolonged immobilization). POTS may develop in those who have had a recent history of mononucleosis. People with certain autoimmune conditions such as Sjogren’s syndrome and celiac disease can be at higher risk. Sjogren’s can be evaluated by blood testing, dry eye test, lip biopsy and rheumatology consult. Celiac disease can be tested through blood work, gastroenterology consult, and if needed biopsies of the small intestines. What are the symptoms of (POTS)? POTS symptoms can be uncomfortable and frightening experiences. Patients with POTS usually suffer from two or more of the many symptoms listed below. Not all patients with POTS will have all these symptoms. Dizziness/lightheadedness especially in standing up, prolonged standing in one position, or long walks. Headaches and body pain/aches (may feel flu-like); neck pain. Insomnia and frequent awakenings from sleep, chest pain and racing heart rate during sleep, excessive sweating. Shakiness/tremors especially with adrenaline surges. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 06/02/2017. National Institutes of Health.

What Causes Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? Who Gets Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Diagnosed? How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Treated? What Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder that can make someone feel faint or dizzy. It happens when the autonomic nervous system (ANS) doesn't work as it should. The autonomic nervous system is the body's ""autopilot"" system, controlling things like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. The autonomic nervous system problems seen in POTS (also called postural tachycardia syndrome) can affect children and adults. Symptoms vary from mild to disabling. What Happens in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? The autonomic nervous system keeps blood pressure at the right level for the brain no matter what position a person is in — standing (vertical), lying flat on the back (called supine), and sitting or reclining (called recumbent). Usually when a person stands, the nerves of the autonomic nervous system tell blood vessels in the lower body to constrict (tighten). The tightening vessels work against gravity to keep blood from collecting in the legs. This automatic response makes sure the brain has enough blood flow to work well. If there is not enough blood flow to the brain, a person may feel lightheaded or pass out every time they stand. In POTS, the autonomic nervous system doesn't work in the usual way, so the blood vessels don't tighten enough to make sure there is enough blood flow to the brain. To try to keep enough blood flowing to the brain, the autonomic nervous system makes the beat a lot faster instead. What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS is named for an unusual jump in the heart's beating speed that happens when a person stands. Other symptoms that can happen with POTS include: heart palpitations (feeling the heart beat or race) lightheadedness (almost passing out; vision tunnels or goes gray or dark) Most POTS symptoms happen only when standing or changing to a standing position. But these may happen without standing: sweating without a cause (such as exercise or warm weather) What Causes Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS might first be noticed after a viral infection or an injury. But it's hard to tell if one of these caused POTS or just happened around the same time that POTS became a problem. Research to learn more about the cause of POTS is underway. Who Gets Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS affects more girls than boys, and is more common when one or both parents had POTS. It often begins in the early or mid-teens. How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Diagnosed? There's no single test to diagnose POTS. Doctors start by doing a complete physical exam and taking a . POTS causes a heart rate increase of 40 or more beats per minute within 10 minutes of when someone moves from a supine (lying down) position to a standing one. The heart rate goes up dramatically, with little if any drop in blood pressure. Doctors can measure this easily. Sometimes, doctors do a ""tilt-table test."" In this test, a person is strapped to a table, then tilted from a supine (lying on the back) position into a standing position while heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. Doctors also make sure the problem isn't due to anything besides the autonomic nervous system. Depending on the symptoms, tests might be done on other parts of the body. These might check the blood, heart, brain, eyes, ears, kidneys, muscles, nerves, hormones, digestive tract, and more. Typically, a diagnosis of POTS is confirmed when symptoms have lasted for several months and no other causes are found. If someone has POTS, the medical team will look for reasons that the autonomic nervous system doesn't respond normally to standing. Finding an answer can help treatments work well. How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Treated? POTS is a chronic (long-term) problem. So doctors try to prevent and manage the things that cause it. That way, a child or teen doesn't have to take medicines for a long time.  a slow increase in exercise, starting with seated, reclined, or horizontal exercises (such as rowing, recumbent bicycling, and swimming) raising the head of the bed so some pressure stays in the blood vessels in the legs during sleep psychological counseling to help manage stress and choices that trigger symptoms The autonomic nervous system is involved in many body functions, so managing all the symptoms related to it can be hard. Sometimes, patients try a few different treatments to find what works well without unpleasant side effects. Multiple doctor's visits may be needed to find the best combination of treatments that improve symptoms. POTS symptoms usually improve over time. Often, they'll completely disappear as kids grow. If a clear and treatable cause is corrected, the symptoms are likely to go away more quickly. Note: All information is for educational purposes only.

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome Type III and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome hypermobility type): Clinical description and natural history Brad Tinkle, Marco Castori, Britta Berglund, Helen Cohen, Rodney Grahame, Hanadi Kazkaz, The hypermobile type of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is likely the most common hereditary disorder of connective tissue. It has been described largely in those with musculoskeletal complaints including joint hypermobility, joint subluxations/dislocations, as well as skin and soft tissue manifestations. Many patients report activity-related pain and some go on to have daily pain. Two undifferentiated syndromes have been used to describe these manifestations—joint hypermobility syndrome and hEDS. Both are clinical diagnoses in the absence of other causation. Current medical literature further complicates differentiation and describes multiple associated symptoms and disorders. The current EDS nosology combines these two entities into the hypermobile type of EDS. Herein, we review and summarize the literature as a better clinical description of this type of connective tissue disorder.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type is associated with rheumatic diseases Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type is associated with rheumatic diseases , Article number:  () We retrospectively analyzed electronic medical records of patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome hypermobility type (HEDS), including demographic information, workup, rheumatological diagnoses in order to determine its association with rheumatological conditions. HEDS Patients were stratified according to level of workup received (no additional work (physical exam only) = NWU, limited workup = LWU, comprehensive workup = CWU)). HEDS patients were predominantly female (21:4, F:M). The percentage of patients with at least one rheumatological condition was significantly correlated with level of workup (NWU, 9.2%; LWU, 33.3%, CWU, 67.1%; p-value < 0.0001). The HLA-B27 antigen was more prevalent (p-value < 2.2 × 10) in the CWU HEDS patients (23.9%) than in the general population of the United States (6.1%). HEDS with CWU were associated with more rheumatological conditions (i.e. psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia) than those with NWU or LWU. In conclusion, HEDS is associated with complicated rheumatological conditions, which are uncovered by comprehensive workup. These conditions require different clinical management strategies than HEDS, and left untreated could contribute to the pain or even physical disability (i.e. joint erosions) in HEDS patients. While the mechanisms underlying these associations are unknown, it is important that all HEDS patients receive adequate workup to ensure a complete clinical understanding for the best care strategy possible. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a heterogeneous group of congenital connective tissue disorders thought to be caused by mutations in genes coding for collagen proteins (i.e. ) associated with collagen processing (i.e. ), or for extracellular matrix components (i.e. ). Tissue fragility is the unifying feature among the six subtypes, though the degree to which specific tissues are affected varies tremendously among subtypes. The hypermobility type of EDS (HEDS, also known as EDS Type III) is largely characterized by extreme joint laxity and soft, velvety skin. Joint hypermobility is most pronounced in childhood, and individuals with joint hypermobility are colloquially known as being “double jointed”. Afflicted individuals are often treated as a curiosity and may even find their increased flexibility a boon in athletic endeavors. Subjects with HEDS first seek medical attention due to persistent back pain and joint pain without an obvious inciting cause. Although they are often dismissed as the ‘benign’ type of EDS, the symptoms of HEDS vary tremendously between affected individuals and impose a significant negative impact on their quality of life. Due to joint instability, HEDS patients suffer from frequent joint stress and injury, leading to chronic arthralgia, soft-tissue rheumatism (i.e. tendonitis, bursitis, epicondylitis), and myalgia; many also suffer from frequent subluxations and dislocations. Due to the ubiquity of connective tissue, patients are often afflicted with a plethora of non-musculoskeletal symptoms, such as dysautonomia (i.e. positional orthostatic tachycardia, chronic fatigue, etc.), abnormal proprioception, headaches, and gastrointestinal dysmotility, which may lead to nutritional deficits. Many of those with HEDS also suffer from mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. To date, the genetic basis of HEDS has not been elucidated and molecular diagnosis is not possible. HEDS patients may see multiple subspecialists without realizing a connection between their joint symptoms and multi-systemic involvement of the disease; they are often dismissed as hypochrondriacs, and report feelings of isolation from the lack of diagnosis. Perhaps due to a lack of gravitas surrounding the HEDS diagnosis, management of the disease varies among practitioners, and clinical workup does not often extend beyond the joint and skin examination. This practice may lead to missed diagnoses and failure to properly personalize management strategies for individual patients. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether HEDS patients are predisposed to rheumatological conditions. The present study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, USA and performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. This study was qualified and approved for exemption from a patient consent requirement by the Institutional Review Board based on the requirements for de-identification. All patients depicted in photographs were consented prior to taking photographs, and every reasonable effort was made to ensure that the photographs were taken in an un-identifiable manner. A list of patients with a diagnosis of HEDS was generated by the data research management at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, a large, regional tertiary care center serving populations mainly in the states of New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, upstate New York, and Vermont. We performed a retrospective study of these patients at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center between July 2009 and June 2015. Once the subjects were identified, detailed chart review of electronic medical records was performed to confirm a diagnosis of HEDS (see next paragraph). Demographic information recorded includes age of diagnosis of HEDS, gender, any rheumatological conditions such as autoimmune diseases, non-autoimmune conditions (i.e. fibromyalgia), structural defects, serological workup, laboratory findings, radiographic studies, or any other diagnostic workup. Subjects were further sorted into the categories of “no rheumatological workup” (i.e. physical examination only), “limited workup” (i.e. only checking one or two laboratory markers, such as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and/or rheumatoid factor (RF)), or “comprehensive workup” (detailed serological markers, radiographic studies, etc.) after a diagnosis of HEDS was made. For all patients, a clinical diagnosis of HEDS was made based on the Brighton criteria (), a refined set of guidelines that takes into consideration hypermobility, as determined by the time-tested Beighton score (), as well as symptoms of musculoskeletal abnormalities such as arthralgia, soft tissue lesions, etc.. Typical clinical features of a HEDS patient can be seen in . We used the chi-square test to compare the number of patients with rheumatological conditions in each workup group. Additionally, we used chi-square analysis to compare the female to male ratio of HEDS patients diagnosed in either the rheumatology or genetics clinic to that of their respective overall patient populations. Because our patient population was mostly female, we then used a logistical regression model to obtain an adjusted p-value using gender and age as confounders. We calculated the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the prevalence of each rheumatological condition based on a binomial distribution model. We used sign test to calculate the prevalence of the HLA-B27 antigen in our population versus the general population. In our supplementary studies, we compared the prevalence of each rheumatic condition in our patient population with that of the general population, we used the sign test to calculate the p-value. In cases where the prevalence estimate in our data did not fall into the prevalence estimation range for the general population, we calculated a conservative two-sided p-value by comparing our estimate with the closer, extreme range value using sign test. We identified 379 confirmed cases of HEDS in the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (). These patients were predominantly evaluated in the Rheumatology Clinic (53.3%) or Genetics Clinic (43.8%) for their musculoskeletal complaints, i.e. neck pain, back pain, or multiple joint pain. Only 2.9% of patients received a diagnosis of HEDS from a physician outside of these two clinics. Of these confirmed HEDS patients, 320 (84.4%) were female, and 59 (15.6%) were male. It is well-established that many rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are more common in women. To ensure that the preponderance of female HEDS patients was not due to a sampling bias from the largely female patient population in the Rheumatology clinic, we compared the ratio of female to male HEDS patients with that of the overall patient population in both the Rheumatology and Genetics clinics (). While the general patient population of the Rheumatology clinic was biased towards females (66.9% female, 33.1% male), the female to male ratio of HEDS patients diagnosed at the Rheumatology Clinic was even more skewed (89.6% female, 10.4% male, p < 0.0001). Though the female to male ratio of the overall patient population of the Genetics clinic is 1:1 (50.1% female, 49.9% male), the HEDS patients diagnosed by this clinic were predominantly female as well (78.3% female, 21.7% male, p < 0.0001). Statistical analysis confirmed that the female predominance among HEDS patients was not a result of sampling bias (). Next, we classified patients according to the level of workup these HEDS patients received (). Most patients (240 total) received only a physical examination with no additional workup after a diagnosis of HEDS was made, and were categorized as “no workup” (NWU). Among this group, 21 patients (8.8%) were found to have at least one rheumatological condition in addition to HEDS. A total of 51 patients had limited serological or radiographic studies performed on their spine or joints in addition to the physical examination after a diagnosis of HEDS was made, and were classified as “limited workup” (LWU) patients. Significantly more patients (17, or 33.3%) in the LWU group were found to have at least one rheumatological diagnosis as compared to the NWU patients (adjusted p-value < 0.0001). The remaining 88 patients received a comprehensive workup (CWU), with detailed serological and radiographic studies, after a diagnosis of HEDS was made. Significantly more CWU patients (59, or 67.1%) had at least one rheumatological condition as compared to either the LWU or NWU groups (adjusted p-value < 0.0001). Additionally, patients in the CWU group tended to have more additional diagnoses than patients in either the LWU or NWU groups (); while only a very small percentage of NWU and LWU patients had two additional diagnoses (0.4 and 3.9%, respectively), 21.6% of CWU patients had two additional diagnoses. Furthermore, none of the patients in either the NWU or LWU groups had more than two additional diagnoses, but 12.5% of the CWU presented with three and 2.3% presented with four additional conditions following serological with or without radiographic studies. Next, we quantified the number of patients who tested positive for serological markers of inflammation or autoimmunity (), such as ANA, RF, or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA); however, it is difficult to determine the significance of these findings because not all patients in the limited workup group were tested for all of these markers. Interestingly, we found that 21 of the patients in the comprehensive workup group (23.9%) were tested positive for HLA-B27 (). A previous study found that the overall prevalence of the HLA-B27 antigen in the general population of the United States, was 6.1%. Based on this observation, the prevalence of HLA-B27 in our patient population who received comprehensive workup was significantly higher than that of the general population (p-value = 2.2 × 10). Next, we catalogued all of the rheumatological conditions seen in our HEDS patients among all the different workup groups. These categories included structural defects (), non-inflammatory conditions (), and inflammatory conditions (). Of the 40 different conditions listed, ten were diagnosed solely on clinical grounds such as structural/physical abnormalities (club feet, developmental delay, occulocutaneous albinism type 1, pectus carinatum, and pectus excavatum) or physical examination (costochondritis, erythromelaliga, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, and Raynaud’s phenomenon); the majority of the conditions require further diagnostic workup, including serological studies (i.e. C3 hypocomplementemia), radiographic studies (i.e. inflammatory arthritis with erosive disease), or skin biopsy (i.e. small fiber sensory neuropathy). The five most common conditions were fibromyalgia (22 cases) and psoriasis (22 cases), followed by ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (11 cases), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (11 cases), and then RA (9 cases). Interestingly, 27.3% of PsA patients and 33% of RA patients (both seronegative and seropositive) were diagnosed with advanced erosive disease, and without radiographic studies, these patients would have been missed solely based on physical examination. Of all the inflammatory conditions, only psoriasis and Kawasaki disease were diagnosed in the NWU group, as these two conditions require only physical examination for diagnosis. Although a limited workup allowed for six more inflammatory conditions to be diagnosed as compared to the NWU group, there were still ten fewer conditions diagnosed in the LWU than in the CWU group, which may be accounted for by the fact that these conditions require extensive serological and radiographic studies to diagnose. In an attempt to further quantitate the impact of HEDS on the prevalence of these rheumatological conditions, the prevalence of each rheumatological condition in our patient population was compared to the prevalence of these conditions in the general population, though such comparison does have the potential to produce a sampling bias of these subjects (). Only the patients in the CWU group were examined because, by definition, the patients in other groups did not receive a sufficient workup to rule out the possibility of rheumatic diseases. We found cases of nine different structural defects (), three non-inflammatory diseases (), and nineteen inflammatory diseases (), for a total of 31 different rheumatalogical conditions among CWU patients. The prevalence for ten of these conditions in the general population cannot be identified (), either because these conditions are too rare or because epidemiological data do not exist. Among the remaining conditions, 15 were significantly more prevalent in our CWU patient population than in the general population (), including club foot deformity, hereditary angioedema, primary hypogammaglobulemia, fibromyalgia, erythromelalgia, psoriasis, PsA, AS, RA, inflammatory eye disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, SLE, Crohn’s disease, pernicious anemia, and TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Fever Syndrome (TRAPS). HEDS has been viewed historically as somewhat benign in the medical field. However, recent studies found that HEDS patients suffer from a constellation of debilitating symptoms: migraine headaches, chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, functional gastrointestinal disorders, etc. Now, for the first time, we have shown that HEDS is associated with a number of rheumatological conditions, both inflammatory and non-inflammatory. Like many rheumatic diseases, such as RA or SLE, our HEDS patient population was predominantly female (84.4%). To ensure that the preponderance of female HEDS patients in the present study was not due to a sampling bias from the largely female patient population in the Rheumatology clinic, we examined the female to male ratio of HEDS patients in both the Rheumatology and Genetics clinics, and compared this to the gender ratio of the general patient population in each clinic. While Rheumatology patients were predictably predominantly female (66.9% female, 33.1% male), HEDS patients in the Rheumatology clinic were even more heavily affected by a female bias (89.6% female, 10.4% male). Furthermore, the vast majority of HEDS patients in the Genetics clinic were female (78.3% female, 21.7% male), despite a 1:1 female to male ratio in the overall patient population of the Genetics clinic. Although HEDS is considered to be an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance, a very similar female to male ratio (89% female, 11% male) has also been reported in an Italian HEDS cohort. A number of explanations, including differences in musculature, sex hormones, and pain perception between men and women have been proposed as potential explanations for the bias; however, as discussed previously, the genetic causes of HEDS remain largely unknown. Without a definitive genetic basis, any explanation of the strong female bias remains speculative. Further investigation into the genetic mutations that lead to HEDS is required in order to determine whether it could be an X-linked disease. Additionally, our data show that HEDS patients with back pain, joint pain, and joint laxity were more likely to be diagnosed with at least one rheumatological condition when they received comprehensive serological and radiographic workup for their musculoskeletal complaints in addition to a physical examination (67.1%). When the patients did not receive further workup (NWU) once a diagnosis of HEDS was made, any additional rheumatological diagnosis was made entirely based on physical examination, i.e. psoriasis, fibromyalgia, Raynaud’s phenomenon. Even a limited workup (LWU) revealed significantly more rheumatological conditions among HEDS patients than a simple physical exam (i.e. NWU) did. For example, radiographic studies of HEDS patients further revealed advanced inflammatory arthritis with the presence of joint erosions at the time of workup in the CWU group (27% of patients with PsA, 33.3% of patients with RA; ). Therefore, a more comprehensive workup tended to unveil a more complex clinical picture than a purely physical examination in these patients: nearly 15% of patients who had a comprehensive workup were diagnosed with three or four rheumatological conditions. None in the limited (LWU) or no workup (NWU) groups were found to have more than two rheumatologic diseases for their musculoskeletal complaints. Our findings indicate that a more complex clinical picture may emerge from complaints of back pain, joint pain, and joint laxity following comprehensive serological studies (with or without radiographic studies) than a “straightforward” HEDS diagnosis. Arthralgia is a predominant chief complaint that might lead to a diagnosis of HEDS patients. Similarly, arthralgia is also a major complaint in many rheumatological conditions (i.e. PsA, RA, etc.); yet additional studies are often required to rule out these conditions that cause joint pain. Therefore, our findings strongly support the adoption of comprehensive workup for all HEDS patients as a standard clinical practice. It is important to note that although the finding of back pain and arthralgia is an overlapping complaint between HEDS and other conditions such as seronegative spondyloarthropathies and fibromyalgia, distinctions were made among them based on well-defined clinical criteria and diagnostic findings to ensure accurate diagnoses during medical record review. For example, in our patient cohort, seronegative spondyloarthropathies were distinguished from HEDS based on established diagnostic criteria. In the case of PsA, psoriasis was noted for all patients in our cohort, and additional imaging studies were used to further characterize the diagnosis (i.e. inflammation with or without joint erosions). Analogously, all AS patients in our cohort tested positive for the HLA-B27 antigen in conjunction with supporting physical examination and radiographic findings. Other seronegative spondyloarthropathy entities also required radiographic/MRI findings of inflammation to confer diagnoses. Thus, although arthralgia is a shared complaint among different disease entities, the use of established clinical criteria and diagnostic findings minimizes ambiguity or uncertainty in each diagnosis. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia specified that a patient must present with at least 11 out of 18 specified tender points, widespread pain index ≥7, and a score of ≥5 on a symptom severity scale that includes fatigue, waking unrefreshed, cognitive symptoms, and somatic symptoms (i.e. myalgia, numbness/tingling, tinnitus, etc.). Hypermobile joints are not part of the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, and their presence should lead to consideration of HEDS as a potential additional diagnosis. Thus, a distinction can be made between fibromyalgia-related and HEDS-related complaints (i.e. trigger point tenderness versus Brighton criteria). Nevertheless, any clinical diagnosis is subject to inter-observer variation when more than one clinician is involved in providing care to the patients; therefore, further clinical studies are warranted to verify our findings. We found that several structural deformities or deficiencies (i.e. club foot, hereditary angioedema, primary hypogammaglobulemia), non-inflammatory diseases (fibromyalgia, erythromelaglia), and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases (psoriasis, PsA, AS, RA, inflammatory eye disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, SLE, Crohn’s disease, pernicious anemia, and TRAPS) were significantly more prevalent in the CWU HEDS population than in the general population of the US. Our analysis of disease prevalence only included CWU patients, as by definition the LWU and NWU patients did not receive sufficient workup to exclude the possibility of additional rheumatological diagnoses (). However, our statistical analysis does have the potential to produce a sampling bias. While we confirmed our hypothesis that a number of rheumatological conditions are associated with HEDS, the mechanisms underlying these increased risks are currently unknown, as very little is known about the molecular cause of HEDS. Furthermore, each of these rheumatological conditions has a different underlying disease mechanism; it is currently unknown how one genetic disorder as seen in HEDS could increase the risks of multiple rheumatological conditions. Future studies investigating the genetic and biochemical underpinnings of this congenital disorder are needed to elucidate possible links between HEDS and rheumatological conditions. : Rodgers, K.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a genetic condition that mainly affects the joints, skin and walls of the blood vessels. People with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or EDS, have very loose, hypermobile joints. Their skin is stretchy and fragile. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can’t be treated, but the symptoms can usually be managed. There are many different . All of them involve extremely flexible joints and fragile skin that bruises and stretches easily. Some find their joints are so flexible that they have frequent dislocations, and this often leads to pain in the joints. Some people with EDS have distinctive facial features such as a thin nose, thin upper lip, large eyes and ears without lobes. Your doctor will assess your symptoms and medical history to diagnose Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A genetic test might be done to confirm the diagnosis. If you have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, you will need to be careful when doing activities that can put stress on your joints and increase the risk of injury, such as contact sports. There is no specific treatment for EDS, but symptoms can be managed through: physical therapy, such as exercises or physical braces to keep joints as stable and strong as possible If you have EDS, you may see a range of health professionals to help you manage your condition, including , , , rheumatologists and .

A cohort of 17 patients with kyphoscoliotic Ehlers–Danlos syndrome caused by biallelic mutations in : expansion of the clinical and mutational spectrum and description of the natural history A cohort of 17 patients with kyphoscoliotic Ehlers–Danlos syndrome caused by biallelic mutations in : expansion of the clinical and mutational spectrum and description of the natural history , –() In 2012 we reported in six individuals a clinical condition almost indistinguishable from -kyphoscoliotic Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (-kEDS), caused by biallelic mutations in , and characterized by progressive kyphoscoliosis, myopathy, and hearing loss in addition to connective tissue abnormalities such as joint hypermobility and hyperelastic skin. FKBP14 is an ER-resident protein belonging to the family of FK506-binding peptidyl-prolyl – isomerases (PPIases); it catalyzes the folding of type III collagen and interacts with type III, type VI, and type X collagens. Only nine affected individuals have been reported to date. We report on a cohort of 17 individuals with -kEDS and the follow-up of three previously reported patients, and provide an extensive overview of the disorder and its natural history based on clinical, biochemical, and molecular genetics data. Based on the frequency of the clinical features of 23 patients from the present and previous cohorts, we define major and minor features of -kEDS. We show that myopathy is confirmed by histology and muscle imaging only in some patients, and that hearing impairment is predominantly sensorineural and may not be present in all individuals. Our data further support the extensive clinical overlap with -kEDS and show that vascular complications are rare manifestations of -kEDS. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises a heterogeneous spectrum of monogenic conditions with multisystemic and variable clinical manifestations affecting primarily the skin, ligaments and joints, blood vessels, and internal organs. Symptoms are usually present in early childhood and the clinical spectrum varies from mild skin and joint hyperlaxity to intermediate and severe physical disability and life-threatening complications. To date, the 1997 Villefranche classification of EDS has recognized six types based on clinical phenotype, inheritance pattern, and underlying biochemical and molecular defect(s). Among them, the kyphoscoliotic type of EDS (MIM 225400) was recognized as one distinct type based on the following characteristic clinical features: severe muscular hypotonia at birth; generalized joint laxity; kyphoscoliosis at birth, which is progressive; scleral fragility; and rupture of the ocular globe. The disorder, which is currently called by the 2017 International Nosology of EDS -kyphoscoliotic EDS (-kEDS), is caused by the deficiency of the collagen-modifying enzyme procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1 or LH1, lysyl hydroxylase 1), which leads to an abnormal pattern of urinary pyridinoline crosslinks and thus to an increased ratio of lysyl-pyridinoline to hydroxylysyl-pyridinolines. Recently, individuals with a clinical phenotype almost indistinguishable from -kEDS but with a normal ratio of total urinary lysyl-pyridinoline and hydroxylysyl-pyridinolines, and causative biallelic nonsense variants in (MIM 614557), have been reported as a new condition, expanding the increasing genetic heterogeneity of EDS conditions. The first six affected individuals were reported to have muscle hypotonia at birth, progressive scoliosis, joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, gross motor developmental delay, myopathy, and sensorineural hearing impairment. Vascular complications such as dissections and occlusions in medium-sized vessels, and tortuosity of the arterial tree have been recently described in two further patients, expanding the clinical spectrum of -kEDS. Because of severe early-onset muscle hypotonia and delayed motor development, children with -kEDS usually undergo extensive neuromuscular workup in the neonatal period. Light and electron microscopic studies of muscle biopsies showed mild to moderate histological abnormalities and focal myofibrillar rearrangements and Z-line anomalies, respectively, albeit without a specific recognizable pattern. Furthermore, muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are indicative of fatty degeneration of muscle tissue, which is a typical feature of myopathies and muscular dystrophies. Primary myopathies caused by mutations in collagen such as the type VI (COL6) collagenopathy Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (MIM 254090) may show substantial connective-tissue involvement including kyphoscoliosis, joint hypermobility, joint contractures, and abnormal scar formation; however, skin hyperextensibility is absent and motor function does not improve with age. Hence, the -kEDS and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy are major differential diagnoses to -kEDS. encodes for FKBP14 (alias FKBP22; Q9NWM8) a 22 kDa protein that belongs to the FK506-binding protein (FKBP)-family of peptidyl-prolyl – isomerases (PPIases). The protein catalyzes the folding of type III collagen and interacts with type III, type VI, and type X collagens, thus helping to explain the broad phenotype observed in the patients characterized so far. Up to now only nine patients have been reported with this ultrarare connective tissue disorder. Here we report on the clinical, biochemical, and molecular findings of an additional 17 individuals from 15 unrelated families diagnosed with -kEDS. These individuals currently represent the largest cohort of -kEDS and thus allow an in-depth characterization of the clinical features also including the natural history. In comparison to the clinical features reported so far, the characteristic features are emphasized and the clinical presentation is refined. The molecular data include two newly identified nonsense variants, and the hitherto first FKBP14 p.Met48Lys missense variant. The pathogenicity of this mutation is supported by conservation analysis, prediction software, and its mapping on the available crystal structure of the protein. This finding suggests that complete or partial loss of function of FKBP14 is the crucial pathological mechanism of this disorder. Clinical information was obtained through a questionnaire that was sent to each involved center and subsequently analyzed centrally. Clinical examinations were in most cases performed by geneticists, neurologists, or pediatricians. In several cases an initially suspected diagnosis of a neuromuscular disorder could be excluded by neuromuscular workup, while in others, the differential diagnosis of -kEDS could be ruled out by urinary pyridinoline analysis. For all studies, informed consent of the patients or their parents, in accordance with requirements of the local ethics committees of the referring physicians, was obtained. Total urinary pyridinoline crosslinks, lysyl pyridinoline and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline, were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography as described. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using standard procedures. For 14 of 17 patients, mutation analysis of the coding region and the flanking intron–exon boundaries of (RefSeq accession number NG_032173.1 (genomic) and NM_017946.3 (mRNA)) was performed by polymerase chain reaction and direct Sanger sequencing as previously described. For transcript analysis, total RNA was extracted from fibroblasts of P5/FIV and cDNA synthesis and polymerase chain reaction were performed according to standard protocols. Targeted exome sequencing using SureSelectXT (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to analyze the coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of a panel of genes associated with kyphoscoliosis (B4GALT7, CHST14, FKBP14, PLOD1, PRDM5, RIN2, SLC39A13, and ). Mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Nucleotide numbering starts with + 1, which corresponds to the first ATG translation initiation codon at position 294 of the reference sequence NM_017946.3, whereas amino acid residues are numbered from the first methionine residue of the reference sequence NP_060416.1 Mapping of the FKBP14 Met48Lys missense variant onto the crystal structure The methionine residue 48 (Met48), which was found to be mutated to lysine (Lys) in one patient, was mapped onto the 1.9-Å resolution crystal structure of human peptidyl-prolyl – isomerase FKBP14 (Protein Data Bank, 4MSP) using MolSoft MolBrowser 3.8-5. Clinical and genetic findings of selected patients based either on newly recognized clinical features or new pathogenic variants The disease-causing variants identified in the patient cohort are mapped onto the FKBP14 protein structure and shown in online. Clinical and genetic findings of selected patients are listed in Patient 2/FII () is a 9-year-old girl, born to consanguineous first-cousin parents of Iranian origin, who presented at birth with severe congenital hypotonia. She showed bilateral clubfoot; motor developmental delay; severe muscle weakness with a positive Gowers’ sign; progressive severe scoliosis that required surgical intervention; severe joint hypermobility of fingers, wrists, and toes; soft skin; easy bruising; normal hearing; nasal speech; and dysarthria. Independent walking was achieved at the age of 7 years. Sequencing of revealed a novel homozygous c.143 T>A substitution in exon 1 causing a p.(Met48Lys) mutation. Both parents were carriers of this variant. This missense mutation is not reported in the browser of the Exome Aggregation Consortium () and it is likely to be disease-causing according to the prediction software SIFT and Mutation Taster, or potentially benign according to PolyPhen2. The amino acid residue Met48 is conserved from human to birds (BLASTP search). Mapping of Met48 on the three-dimensional structure of FKBP14 (PDB 4MSP) reveals that the amino acid is localized near the putative PPIase active site amino acids tyrosine 52 (Y52), isoleucine 75 (I75), tryptophan 88 (W88), and phenylalanine 127 (F127) (). P5/FIV is the first child of healthy consanguineous first-cousin parents of Pakistani origin. He was born by emergency Cesarean section for fetal bradycardia, following spontaneous rupture of membranes and premature labor at 31 weeks gestation. On clinical examination he was noted to have a very wide cleft palate, mild micrognathia, and a large anterior fontanel. He had clenched hands with bilateral single palmar creases, overlapping fingers, and tightly adducted thumbs; mild flexion contractures of the elbows and knees; and bilateral talipes equinovarus, with prominent heels and left-sided developmental dysplasia and dislocation of the hip. He also had a large umbilical hernia and right inguinal hernia. He was breathing spontaneously at birth, but at the age of 3 days, he required intubation and mechanical ventilation. A tracheostomy was inserted because of upper airway obstruction and he was ventilated for 6 months. The tracheostomy was removed at the age of 7 years. He had gastroesophageal reflux and required long-term nasogastric feeding followed by insertion of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and fundoplication at the age of 2 years. He had motor delay and first sat unsupported at the age of 12 months and walked at the age of 3 years. On examination at the age of 2 years 6 months, the limb contractures had resolved, and he had marked generalized joint laxity and poor muscle bulk. His skin was soft and velvety, but not hyperextensible. There was hypertrichosis of the arms, legs, and at the base of the spine. He had long fingers. There was pectus carinatum and kyphoscoliosis. Due to bilateral sensorineural hearing loss he received a cochlear implant in the right ear at age 6 years. P6/FIV is the 4-year-old brother of P5/FIV. Talipes and polyhydramnios were noted antenatally. He was born by emergency Cesarean section at 38 weeks gestation and required intubation and ventilation on the first day of life. He was floppy at birth and had clenched hands and overlapping fingers. He was noted to have micrognathia, but not cleft palate. He passed his neonatal hearing screen. On examination, at the age of 7 months, he had mild hypertrichosis and esotropia. There was marked, generalized joint hypermobility and poor muscle bulk. He had “criss-cross” markings on his palms and soles. He also had a small mouth and deep-set eyes. He developed gastroesophageal reflux and required nasojejunal feeding and fundoplication. He had repeated hospital admissions during infancy for respiratory tract infections and has nocturnal ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure overnight. He had surgery for severe kyphoscoliosis at the age of 2.5 years. He had motor delay and sat unaided at the age of 2 years. At the age of 4 years he can stand and walks with support, only. His most recent hearing test showed moderate conductive hearing loss and hypermobile tympanic membranes. Sanger sequencing confirmed that both siblings are homozygous for the c.197 + 5_197 + 8del mutation in intron 1 of . Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers of the mutation. Transcript analysis on total RNA extracted from cultured fibroblasts of P5/FIV revealed that the identified deletion of 4 nucleotides in intron 1 of the genomic sequence of leads to the insertion of 17 nucleotides in the transcript of FKBP14 in between exons 1 and 2 and to a new open reading frame from c.198 on and a p. His67* premature termination codon (CAC >TAA). This 11-month-old boy presented with micrognathia and clenched hands on antenatal ultrasound. Postnatally he was found to have hypotonia, Pierre Robin sequence, camptodactyly of his second and third fingers bilaterally, and bilateral positional talipes equinovarus. After delivery he was transferred to the neonatal unit due to problems maintaining his saturations. He was initially managed with a nasopharyngeal airway and was fed by nasogastric tube due to concerns about his poor gag reflex. Oral feeding has subsequently been introduced. Newborn screening suggested a mild sensorineural loss on the left but more recent audiology shows normal bone conduction and a moderate hearing loss of 40 dB due to a middle ear effusion. An echocardiogram at a month of age showed a pseudo bicuspid valve, small muscular ventricular septal defect, normal cardiac function, and dilatation of the ascending aorta. A later echocardiogram at 10 months in addition showed a small atrial septal defect and aortic dilatation with a score of + 3.75 just beyond the tubular junction. At 9 months he was noted to have a mild thoracolumbar scoliosis to the left, which was confirmed on X-ray. On examination he was hypotonic and had just gained head control. He was not yet able to sit. The skin was hyperextensible with no evidence of scarring and no bruises. Next-generation sequencing for a set of selected genes (ACTA2, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, EFEMP2, FBN1, FBN2, FKBP14, FLNA, HNRNPK, MED12, MYH11, MYLK, NOTCH1, PRKG1, SKI, SLC2A10, SMAD3, SMAD4, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1 and ) identified the common mutation c.362dupC p.(Glu122Argfs*7) in . The parents were heterozygous for the identified variant. Biochemical, neuromuscular, and laboratory investigations () The results of laboratory, biochemical, and neuromuscular analyses are summarized in . Follow-up and additional findings in three previously published patients () The previously reported clinical features of patients P1, P2, and P6, along with additional findings at follow-up, are summarized in . At the age of 50 years P2 of the original publication developed an extracranial dissection of the right internal carotid artery (). The event occurred during a respiratory infection with intense coughing. The lesion was located just above the carotid artery bifurcation with formation of a pseudoaneurysm extending to the base of the skull. No cerebral infarction occurred and treatment was nonsurgical. Investigations further revealed elongation and increased tortuosity of the extracranial cervical vessels, dilatation of the ascending aorta, and mild mitral and pulmonary valve insufficiency. Echocardiography showed normal systolic and diastolic ventricular function and no signs of cardiomyopathy. Repeat MRI angiography after 9 months showed no residual pseudoaneurysm of the carotid artery but a small pseudoaneurysm of the right vertebral artery. Because of progressive scoliosis, patient P6 underwent a spinal MRI at age 4 years, which revealed an atlantoaxial subluxation with dens dislocation and myelocompression (). Consecutively, the craniocervical junction was surgically stabilized with dorsal instrumentation. Neurological complications did not occur and at last follow-up at the age of 9 years she was in a stable neurological condition. At age 16 years, patient P1 presented with exacerbation of the kyphoscoliosis with severe thoracic deformity resulting in restrictive lung disease. A dorsal thoracolumbar distraction spondylodesis was performed at the age of 17 years after preoperative treatment with halo and sling traction. Subsequent to surgery a height gain of 9 cm was documented, and a considerable improvement of pulmonary function (increase in forced vital capacity from 47 to 66%) and endurance was achieved. Echocardiography performed at the age of 19 years showed diameters of the aortic root and the ascending aorta at the upper normal limit ( score 1.8) without irregularities of the wall. Echocardiography control and cardiac MRI at the age of 21 years showed a slight increase of the diameters, now above the upper normal limit ( score 2.2). -kyphoscoliotic EDS (-kEDS), caused by biallelic mutations in , represents one of the differential diagnoses of -kyphoscoliotic EDS (-kEDS, EDS VIA). In the first description six genetically proven and one likely affected individual were reported with this ultrarare connective-tissue disease. Meanwhile, three additional patients have been delineated, showing that the phenotypic spectrum may be broader than initially anticipated in the original publication, and raising the risk for a life-threatening cardiovascular phenotype. Based on our results, as summarized in , the major diagnostic criteria are (i) severe generalized hypotonia at birth with marked muscle weakness that improves in infancy, and delayed gross motor milestones; (ii) early-onset progressive (kypho)scoliosis; (iii) joint hypermobility without pronounced contractures; (iv) foot deformities; and (v) normal or decreased ratio of lysyl pyridinoline to hydroxylysyl pyridinoline in urine. Minor criteria include (i) hyperelastic skin with follicular hyperkeratosis, easy bruising, and occasional abnormal scarring; (ii) myopathy as seen clinically by reduced strength and endurance and confirmed in some patients by histology and muscle imaging; and (iii) hearing impairment that is predominantly sensorineural and may not be present in all individuals. This information was seminal to the redraft of the 2017 International Nosology of EDS. Occasional features underlying systemic connective-tissue involvement are aortic rupture and arterial dissection, subdural hygroma (potentially due to subdural bleeding or spontaneous intracranial hypotension), insufficiency of cardiac valves, bluish sclerae, bladder diverticula, inguinal or umbilical herniae, and premature rupture of membranes. We now add the clinical, biochemical, and molecular description of 17 additional patients, and describe new clinical features uncovered in three patients, originally published in 2012. This observational data emphasizes the clinical features, allowing for the definition of major and minor diagnostic criteria and adds insight into the clinical variability of the disease. It is certainly of note that the molecular diagnosis in the majority of the patients was achieved by direct Sanger sequencing of due to the strong suggestive clinical features. The risk of vascular complications in -kEDS was initially suspected based on the history of aortic rupture in the 12-year-old sibling of a proven affected patient (P2). She had shared characteristic clinical features with her similarly affected sister but had died prior to molecular testing. The follow-up in her sister at the age of 50 years revealed an internal carotid artery dissection. This finding strongly supports the suspicion of a vascular phenotype of -kEDS; vascular complications including a dissection of the celiac artery at age 41 years and a hypogastric artery pseudoaneurysm rupture at age 6 years were described recently. Therefore awareness for possible serious vascular complications in different age groups in patients with -kEDS should be raised, and vascular screening already starting at pediatric age should be included into the surveillance of these patients. Clinical follow-up of the initial cohort revealed a new skeletal feature in one patient. Symptomatic atlantoaxial subluxation with dens dislocation and myelocompression requiring a posterior occipitocervical fixation was found in P6 at age 4 years. Asymptomatic atlantoaxial instability was recently reported in a 6-year-old patient, but not in any other patient known so far, although not all had radiological investigations aimed to investigate this feature. Occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility and instability has been described in other types of EDS, in particular in the classic, hypermobile, and vascular type. In the vast majority of the patients of this cohort the hands have a normal appearance (). Limb contractures were not observed in the initial patient group and the three single patients delineated subsequently. However, the cohort presented here includes seven patients with prominent congenital contractures of fingers, wrist, elbows, or knees. Although the natural history of the contractures cannot be predicted yet, amelioration was documented in half of the affected, whereas two remained symptomatic at the age of 9 and 15 years, respectively. More pronounced contractures are a feature of the musculocontractural type of EDS and the collagen VI–related myopathies in which they are often progressive. Furthermore, extension deficit of the elbow/congenital flexion contractures are nosology criteria for the Marfan. Midline defects of the palate or lips are only sporadically described in EDS. However, bifid uvula and cleft palate, which are frequently found in Loeys–Dietz syndrome, have been observed in -kEDS patients. A cleft of the soft palate was observed in two patients of the first patient group, and a bifid uvula in the patient described by Dordoni et al. In the actual patient cohort, cleft palate, defined as bifid uvula with submucous cleft palate or wide cleft palate, was found in five patients. Therefore, these observations raise the question of whether Marfan spectrum disorders, in particular Loeys–Dietz syndrome, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of -kEDS. However, cleft palate might also occur secondary to micrognathia and retrogenia as described in three of the five patients with cleft palate in the actual cohort (P4/FIII, P5/FIV, and P17/FIV). Hearing impairment, in particular sensorineural hearing loss, was initially described as a characteristic clinical feature of the disorder based on the findings of the initial cohort. Extended descriptions of additional patients indicate that this feature might be less prominent as initially suggested, as 41% currently present with sensorineural hearing impairment. However, in 18% of the patients of the present cohort, conductive hearing loss was diagnosed. Therefore, hearing impairment, although less common than previously considered, still represents a diagnostic feature of -kEDS. This can manifest at birth or in early infancy, or even later in life. We should point out that the mainly younger age of the patients in this cohort might represent a limitation of our study in regard to the frequency of hearing impairment. The majority of the patients in this cohort presented with congenital hypotonia and weakness, which improved during childhood. All had delayed motor developmental and reduced muscle strength, and the age of unassisted walking was delayed in all, ranging from 2 to 7 years. Nerve conduction measured in 10 patients was normal in all. Unspecific myopathic changes were found on muscle biopsies and/or electromyography in five patients, whereas muscle biopsy and/or electromyography in six patients were normal. In one patient a repeated electromyography showed an improvement of the myopathic features, and in another patient who presented repeatedly with myopathic alterations at ages 3 months and 1 year, a third electromyography was normal at age 8 years. Creatine kinase was normal and thus not to be used as a discriminating biomarker, from Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich myopathy. However, Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy have distinct patterns of muscle involvement on MRI, which have not been seen in -kEDS. Muscle MRI was performed in three patients and revealed mild atrophy of the rectus femoris, and mild hypertrophy of the vastus medialis in one of them. The clinical symptoms suggesting a myopathy are most likely caused by secondary effects of the connective alterations in and around muscle, with secondary effects on muscle fibers themselves, as is in fact the case in the COL6-related dystrophies, and thus not due to a primary myofiber involvement. However, in contrast to the COL6-related dystrophies, in -kEDS this matrix abnormality does not appear to result in progressive muscle degeneration. Similar neuromuscular findings are also seen in other EDS types in particular in -kEDS (EDS VIA). The natural course of the neuromuscular phenotype is yet to be defined. Reduced motor function and fatigue in adulthood was only reported in two adult patients and might represent an age-dependent feature in the natural course of -kEDS. Mild intellectual disability and/or learning difficulties have been documented in the siblings of family III and in patient P14/XII. However, in absence of additional data, we should consider that impaired cognitive development in these patients might have a different genetic cause due to parental consanguinity. The management of patients affected with -kEDS, with focus on the musculoskeletal, the cardiovascular, and the hearing systems, and the molecular genetic confirmation of the diagnosis, should follow the guidelines of the 2017 International Nosology of EDS. Ishikawa and Bächinger recently published evidence supporting the involvement of FKBP14, alias FKBP22, in the molecular ensemble for type III, type VI, and type X collagen maturation, showing that the protein interacts with these types of collagens. Remarkably, mutations in type III and type VI collagens are the genetic hallmark of the vascular type of EDS (vEDS) and of COL6-related dystrophies, respectively. Therefore, the clinical features of vascular abnormalities and myopathy documented in the affected individuals clearly correlates with the interaction of FKBP14 with type III and VI collagens. Complete or partial loss of function of FKBP14 as the crucial disease mechanism of the disorder is suggested by mapping of the first identified missense variant p.(Met48Lys) onto the protein crystal structure (). The p.Met48Lys variant maps near the potential PPIase active site of the FKBP domain. Replacement of the hydrophobic methionine by the positively charged lysine may selectively impair the PPIase activity without affecting chaperone function. In summary, the review of the present patient cohort, the follow-up of three patients from our initial publication as well as the comparison with all published cases, reveals a quite consistent clinical presentation of the disorder and allows us to speculate on major and minor clinical criteria. In contrast to the broader clinical spectrum of phenotypic presentation in -kEDS, -kEDS thus far presents with a less pronounced phenotypical variability. Vascular complications in adulthood should be considered as a disease-related feature, and their possible occurrence in childhood urges cardiovascular investigations in the routine assessment and follow-up of these patients. Hearing impairment, either conductive or sensorineural, might manifest later in life or remain subclinical, thus requiring periodic investigations. Motor developmental delay and reduced motor strength are common neuromuscular features in childhood, and a decline of motor function in adulthood seems to represent an age-dependent feature in the natural course of -deficient EDS.

She had a history of recurrent joint dislocations since childhood and orthopedic procedures on several joints. When she was younger, she could rest her palms on the floor in a standing position while flexing the trunk forward with knees fully extended. On physical examination, the patient was in no acute distress other than pain in her elbow. She could touch her forearm with passive flexion of her right thumb. Hyperelasticity of the skin was noted.       Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? The answer is B: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This syndrome encompasses a group of distinct inherited connective tissue disorders. Marked skin hyperelasticity, widened cutaneous atrophic scars, and generalized joint hypermobility are features of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Easy bruising, subcutaneous spheroids, and molluscoid pseudotumors may also occur. In the vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the skin is thin and translucent with visible underlying vessels, but not hyperelastic. Possible complications of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome include aortic dissection, rupture, and aneurysms. Other forms of the syndrome are hypermobile, kyphoscoliotic, arthrochalasic, cardiovalvular, myopathic, periodontal, musculocontractural, dermatosparactic, and brittle cornea syndrome. Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition, whereas the other forms are autosomal dominant. Management of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is multidisciplinary, involving cardiologists, rheumatologists, orthopedic and plastic surgeons, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. Management should include avoidance of contact sports, as well as counseling the patient about healthy lifestyle choices and providing information to the family and school or employer about precautions and emergency medical treatment. Cutis laxa is characterized by redundant, sagging, inelastic skin. It may be inherited or acquired. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive pattern. Multiple organs may be involved in the inherited forms. Elastoderma is a rare skin condition presenting as localized skin laxity and decreased recoil of stretched skin. Areas of lax, wrinkled skin occur on the neck, elbows, and knees. It typically occurs in young adults. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a genetic disorder affecting the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system. Papules and plaques form on the flexor surfaces, and the skin becomes lax and inelastic. Ocular signs include neovascularization, retinal hemorrhages, and central vision loss. Claudication, coronary and cerebrovascular disease, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage may also occur.  Enlarge     Print Redundant, sagging, inelastic skin; may be inherited or acquired Skin hyperelasticity, widened cutaneous atrophic scars, generalized joint hypermobility, easy bruising, subcutaneous spheroids, molluscoid pseudotumors Localized skin laxity and decreased recoil of stretched skin; areas of lax, wrinkled skin on the neck, elbows, and knees Papules and plaques on the flexor surfaces; lax and inelastic skin; ocular signs such as neovascularization, retinal hemorrhages, and central vision loss; claudication; coronary and cerebrovascular disease, gastrointestinal hemorrhage Redundant, sagging, inelastic skin; may be inherited or acquired Skin hyperelasticity, widened cutaneous atrophic scars, generalized joint hypermobility, easy bruising, subcutaneous spheroids, molluscoid pseudotumors Localized skin laxity and decreased recoil of stretched skin; areas of lax, wrinkled skin on the neck, elbows, and knees Papules and plaques on the flexor surfaces; lax and inelastic skin; ocular signs such as neovascularization, retinal hemorrhages, and central vision loss; claudication; coronary and cerebrovascular disease, gastrointestinal hemorrhage Choose a single article, issue, or full-access subscription.

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome — codes and concepts Dermatorrhexis with dermatochalasis and arthrochalasis Classification and types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 398114001, 83470009, 20766005, 30652003, 17025000, 67202007, 25606004, 719096006, 4170004, 50869007, 59399004, 83586000, 71322004 Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited disorders that involve a defect in or and structure [1]. This results in: The global frequency of EDS is about 1 in 5000. EDS may occur in males and females of all races and usually first becomes apparent in childhood and young adult life. EDS has dominant and inheritance patterns. The disease occurs when only one copy of an abnormal is required to cause a condition. There is a 50% chance that an offspring will inherit the abnormal gene from an affected parent. The autosomal recessive disease requires two copies of an abnormal gene to cause disease; therefore, a child of two parents is at 25% and 50% risk of the disease and being the carrier of a disease, respectively. Under the 2017 International Classification for Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, there are thirteen , classified according to the clinical features, inheritance pattern, and genetic defects. Each is a distinct disorder that ‘runs true’ in a family. This means that members of a family affected by EDS will share the same features. Some cases do not fit neatly into a known type of EDS, and a patient may show features of more than one type. Clinical and their severity can vary significantly, even within the same family. Hypermobile EDS is the most common subtype of EDS (MIM 130020), followed by classical EDS (MIM 130000) and EDS (MIM 130050). The other types of EDS are very rare. [view table in a new tab] [2,3] Collagen is one of the main building blocks of the body. It is a that is widely found in the structure of many tissues and organs of the body. Several types of collagen exist, each with differing properties. Collagen can provide strength and firm support, it can be elastic to allow movement, or it can be used to bind things together. A genetic defect can cause reduced amounts of collagen, collagen disorganisation (collagen is usually organised into bundles), and alterations in the size and shape of collagen. The depends on how collagen  has been affected. For example, vascular EDS is caused by decreased or absent synthesis of type III collagen. There are some types of EDS that are a result of other disorders and its components (such as glycosaminoglycans) and of defects in processing. What are the clinical features of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome? Signs and symptoms differ in type and severity between the different types of EDS. Below is a summary of EDS clinical features based on systems. Hypermobility — the joints bend more than usual. The fingers are most often affected, but all joints can be involved. or joint dislocations or subluxations may occur particularly in shoulders, hips and knees. Congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot) — a of the foot where one or both feet are rotated inwards and downwards. Congenital or early-onset kyphoscoliosis — an abnormal curvature of the spine. Arachnodactyly — abnormally long and slender fingers and toes Congenital or mild, to later-onset of and gross motor delay Skin hyperextensibility — it is easy to pull the skin away from the body, and once released, it retracts to its original state. Thin and skin with visible underlying blood vessels. Skin — the skin easily splits and tears. Bruising and may arise after trivial injuries and can be seen at sites not prone to . Prematurely aged appearance of thin wrinkled skin particularly on hands and feet. scars — wounds heal very slowly resulting in gaping fish-mouth or cigarette-paper scars. make the bridge of the nose appear wide. Molluscoid pseudotumours — these are small spongy lumps 2–3 cm in diameter over pressure points such as the knees and elbows. spheroids — calcified fat lobules which are a result of insufficient blood supply. — small, firm lumps just below the skin surface most often appearing on the arms and shins. Wide scarring in patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Keratoglobus — the protrusion and thinning of the cornea Heart murmur (mitral valve prolapse) and weakened walls of intestines, , and , which may rupture — loss of consciousness, palpitation, dizziness, chest pain, and shortness of breath Postural orthostatic syndrome (POTS) — fast heartbeats, which particularly occur on postural change or standing Recurrent — these can be the initial presentation of EDS. What are the complications of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome? Possible complications of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome include: Suspicion of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome should lead to a careful history and examination. Major and minor criteria have been developed for each of the 13  [3]. The definite diagnosis of a specific variant requires tissue and molecular genetic analysis due to the variety of molecular defects and clinical overlap between . Detailed personal and family history of muscle, , cutaneous, dental, cardiac, and respiratory conditions. Full skin examination — assess for hyperextensibility of the skin and abnormal scarring. The Beighton — assess for hypermobility of a joint, in which a score of 5 or more indicates joint hypermobility. for , , and electron When suspecting kyphoscoliotic EDS, a urine sample is taken to measure the ratio of lysyl-pyridinoline to hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline cross-links  Molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis, except in the case of hypermobile EDS, which has an unknown genetic basis and so is a clinical diagnosis which must meet all the clinical criteria. What is the for Ehlers–Danlos syndrome? Management guidelines depend on the . Take preventative measures against serious and life-threatening complications. Patients should consider wearing a MedicAlert bracelet to communicate their EDS status. All patients with EDS should be referred for genetic counselling and appropriate specialists. Children may benefit from protective pads and bandages. Contact sports or activities that will raise pressure (like playing the trumpet) should be avoided to prevent undue trauma. The patient may benefit from low-resistance exercise and physiotherapy. Consider calcium and vitamin D supplementation to optimise bone density. Provide psychological support following the diagnosis. Patients should wear a medical warning bracelet inscribed 'type of EDS'. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been used to reduce bruising. Surgery should be carried out with caution given the risk of vascular complications. Wounds should be carefully closed via sutures without tension. Deep stitches are recommended; leave superficial stitches for extended periods of time to allow healing. Obstetrical follow-up throughout pregnancy is recommended due to the risk of bleeding disorders and vascular, surgical and complications. Women with EDS have an increased risk of premature labour, postpartum , bladder and uterine prolapse, abdominal hernias, and wound dehiscence. There are no existing obstetric management guidelines for EDS given the extensive ranges of possible implications and severity of each ; thus, patients are managed based on a case-by-case basis. The patient should have regular blood pressure monitoring and disease screening to reduce the risk of bleeding and vascular complications. Non- screening — , () scan, , and () may be performed to identify potential complications. Invasive screening procedures should be considered with care. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) bone density scans should be performed every few years. Patients with kEDS should have an eye check regularly, as they are at risk of eye complications. What is the outcome for patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome? The of patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome varies widely even within the same . The majority of patients have a normal life expectancy and cognitive function. Individuals with vascular EDS may have a shorter life expectancy and are at higher risk of sudden death due to internal organ and major vessel rupture. [Sponsored content] Sobey G.

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome — codes and concepts Dermatorrhexis with dermatochalasis and arthrochalasis Classification and types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 398114001, 83470009, 20766005, 30652003, 17025000, 67202007, 25606004, 719096006, 4170004, 50869007, 59399004, 83586000, 71322004 Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited disorders that involve a defect in or and structure [1]. This results in: The global frequency of EDS is about 1 in 5000. EDS may occur in males and females of all races and usually first becomes apparent in childhood and young adult life. EDS has dominant and inheritance patterns. The disease occurs when only one copy of an abnormal is required to cause a condition. There is a 50% chance that an offspring will inherit the abnormal gene from an affected parent. The autosomal recessive disease requires two copies of an abnormal gene to cause disease; therefore, a child of two parents is at 25% and 50% risk of the disease and being the carrier of a disease, respectively. Under the 2017 International Classification for Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, there are thirteen , classified according to the clinical features, inheritance pattern, and genetic defects. Each is a distinct disorder that ‘runs true’ in a family. This means that members of a family affected by EDS will share the same features. Some cases do not fit neatly into a known type of EDS, and a patient may show features of more than one type. Clinical and their severity can vary significantly, even within the same family. Hypermobile EDS is the most common subtype of EDS (MIM 130020), followed by classical EDS (MIM 130000) and EDS (MIM 130050). The other types of EDS are very rare. [view table in a new tab] [2,3] Collagen is one of the main building blocks of the body. It is a that is widely found in the structure of many tissues and organs of the body. Several types of collagen exist, each with differing properties. Collagen can provide strength and firm support, it can be elastic to allow movement, or it can be used to bind things together. A genetic defect can cause reduced amounts of collagen, collagen disorganisation (collagen is usually organised into bundles), and alterations in the size and shape of collagen. The depends on how collagen  has been affected. For example, vascular EDS is caused by decreased or absent synthesis of type III collagen. There are some types of EDS that are a result of other disorders and its components (such as glycosaminoglycans) and of defects in processing. What are the clinical features of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome? Signs and symptoms differ in type and severity between the different types of EDS. Below is a summary of EDS clinical features based on systems. Hypermobility — the joints bend more than usual. The fingers are most often affected, but all joints can be involved. or joint dislocations or subluxations may occur particularly in shoulders, hips and knees. Congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot) — a of the foot where one or both feet are rotated inwards and downwards. Congenital or early-onset kyphoscoliosis — an abnormal curvature of the spine. Arachnodactyly — abnormally long and slender fingers and toes Congenital or mild, to later-onset of and gross motor delay Skin hyperextensibility — it is easy to pull the skin away from the body, and once released, it retracts to its original state. Thin and skin with visible underlying blood vessels. Skin — the skin easily splits and tears. Bruising and may arise after trivial injuries and can be seen at sites not prone to . Prematurely aged appearance of thin wrinkled skin particularly on hands and feet. scars — wounds heal very slowly resulting in gaping fish-mouth or cigarette-paper scars. make the bridge of the nose appear wide. Molluscoid pseudotumours — these are small spongy lumps 2–3 cm in diameter over pressure points such as the knees and elbows. spheroids — calcified fat lobules which are a result of insufficient blood supply. — small, firm lumps just below the skin surface most often appearing on the arms and shins. Wide scarring in patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Keratoglobus — the protrusion and thinning of the cornea Heart murmur (mitral valve prolapse) and weakened walls of intestines, , and , which may rupture — loss of consciousness, palpitation, dizziness, chest pain, and shortness of breath Postural orthostatic syndrome (POTS) — fast heartbeats, which particularly occur on postural change or standing Recurrent — these can be the initial presentation of EDS. What are the complications of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome? Possible complications of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome include: Suspicion of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome should lead to a careful history and examination. Major and minor criteria have been developed for each of the 13  [3]. The definite diagnosis of a specific variant requires tissue and molecular genetic analysis due to the variety of molecular defects and clinical overlap between . Detailed personal and family history of muscle, , cutaneous, dental, cardiac, and respiratory conditions. Full skin examination — assess for hyperextensibility of the skin and abnormal scarring. The Beighton — assess for hypermobility of a joint, in which a score of 5 or more indicates joint hypermobility. for , , and electron When suspecting kyphoscoliotic EDS, a urine sample is taken to measure the ratio of lysyl-pyridinoline to hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline cross-links  Molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis, except in the case of hypermobile EDS, which has an unknown genetic basis and so is a clinical diagnosis which must meet all the clinical criteria. What is the for Ehlers–Danlos syndrome? Management guidelines depend on the . Take preventative measures against serious and life-threatening complications. Patients should consider wearing a MedicAlert bracelet to communicate their EDS status. All patients with EDS should be referred for genetic counselling and appropriate specialists. Children may benefit from protective pads and bandages. Contact sports or activities that will raise pressure (like playing the trumpet) should be avoided to prevent undue trauma. The patient may benefit from low-resistance exercise and physiotherapy. Consider calcium and vitamin D supplementation to optimise bone density. Provide psychological support following the diagnosis. Patients should wear a medical warning bracelet inscribed 'type of EDS'. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been used to reduce bruising. Surgery should be carried out with caution given the risk of vascular complications. Wounds should be carefully closed via sutures without tension. Deep stitches are recommended; leave superficial stitches for extended periods of time to allow healing. Obstetrical follow-up throughout pregnancy is recommended due to the risk of bleeding disorders and vascular, surgical and complications. Women with EDS have an increased risk of premature labour, postpartum , bladder and uterine prolapse, abdominal hernias, and wound dehiscence. There are no existing obstetric management guidelines for EDS given the extensive ranges of possible implications and severity of each ; thus, patients are managed based on a case-by-case basis. The patient should have regular blood pressure monitoring and disease screening to reduce the risk of bleeding and vascular complications. Non- screening — , () scan, , and () may be performed to identify potential complications. Invasive screening procedures should be considered with care. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) bone density scans should be performed every few years. Patients with kEDS should have an eye check regularly, as they are at risk of eye complications. What is the outcome for patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome? The of patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome varies widely even within the same . The majority of patients have a normal life expectancy and cognitive function. Individuals with vascular EDS may have a shorter life expectancy and are at higher risk of sudden death due to internal organ and major vessel rupture. [Sponsored content] Sobey G.

Subtypes of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome — codes and concepts 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes 398114001, 83470009, 20766005, 30652003, 17025000, 67202007, 25606004, 55711009, 50869007, 59399004, 83586000, 71322004 The 2017 international classification of Ehlers–Danlos syndromes Specific subtypes of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), or Ehlers–Danlos syndromes, are described below [1,2]. They include: Musculocontractural Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (mcEDS) Wide scarring in patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The inheritance pattern of cEDS is dominant. The affected in cEDS are  (MIM 130000), , (MIM 130010), and affecting Type V and Type I . 50% of patients diagnosed with cEDS have a (ie, neither parent is affected). The severity varies significantly, even within the same family. Vascular may include spontaneous dissection or rupture of medium-sized . Typically, patients with cEDS have marked skin hyperextensibility, widened scars, and joint hypermobility. Other features of cEDS are (particularly noticeable on shins and backs of hands), spheroids (calcified fat lobules after losing their blood supply), and molluscoid pseudotumours (thickened fleshy skin /scars over the knees and elbows). Typical electron findings are 'collagen flowers' or 'cauliflowers' due to abnormal fibrillogenesis. Complications of cEDS are heart valve , aorta dilatation, and dissection The inheritance pattern of clEDS is . The affected in clEDS is affecting the Tenascin XB (MIM 606408) Patients with clEDS have generalised joint hypermobility, hyperextensible, soft and velvety skin, and severe bruising. The inheritance pattern of cvEDS is autosomal recessive. The affected gene in cvEDS is affecting the protein Type I collagen (MIM 225320) Patients with cvEDS present with minor signs of EDS but have severe aortic defect/cardiac valve involvement requiring surgical intervention. The inheritance pattern of vEDS is . The affected genes in vEDS are affecting Type III collagen and  affecting Type 1 collagen (MIM 130050) 50% of patients diagnosed with vEDS have a mutation (ie, neither parent is affected). The subtle or absent clinical features of vEDS in some patients make this subtype difficult to diagnose, with sudden death in the ages 30s or 40s being the only presenting feature. vEDS can be identified at birth if there are noticeable clubfoot or hip dislocation. Features of vEDS are severe bruising, thin skin, and characteristic facial appearance (taut and hollow cheeks, thin lips and nose, and prominent eyes). Complications of vEDS are dissection (including aorta), rupture (including bowel rupture, with sigmoid colon the commonest site), and obstetric complications (uterine rupture, massive postpartum ). The inheritance pattern of hEDS is autosomal dominant. The affected gene in hEDS is unknown (MIM 130020). Patients with hEDS are not prone to life-threatening complications, but its effects can be debilitating. Features of hEDS are generalised joint hypermobility, spine hypermobility, and frequent joint dislocations or subluxations (shoulder, patella or temporomandibular joint). Complications of hEDS are aortic root dilatation, (postural orthostatic syndrome), severe joint pain, , and premature .  The inheritance pattern of aEDS is autosomal dominant. The affected genes in aEDS are and affecting Type I collagen (MIM 130060). As the word describes, arthro- means joint, and -chalasia means relaxation; the mutation results in abnormal weak collagen. Patients with aEDS have a lifelong risk for dislocation of multiple major joints. Features of aEDS are , severe generalised joint hypermobility, hip dislocation, and osteopenia. The inheritance pattern of dEDS is autosomal recessive. The affected gene in dEDS is  affecting the protein ADAMTS-2 (MIM 225410). Sparaxis is derived from a Greek word which means 'to tear'. Features of dEDS are severe skin fragility, lax redundant skin, delayed closure of the fontanelles, blue , fragility, and post-natal growth retardation resulting in short stature. There are characteristic 'hieroglyphic ' on of the skin. The inheritance pattern of kEDS is autosomal recessive. The affected genes in dEDS are affecting the protein LH1 (MIM 225400), and affecting the protein FKBP22 (MIM 614557). Gene result in a deficiency of lysylhydroxylase, which is a collagen-modifying important for forming crosslinks between collagen trimers to increase collagen strength. kEDS is characterised by early-onset kyphoscoliosis, hypotonia, gross motor delay, blue sclerae with raised intraocular pressure, generalised joint hypermobility, and easy bruising. The inheritance pattern of BCS is autosomal recessive. The affected genes in dEDS are affecting the protein PRDM5 (MIM 614170) and affecting ZNF469 (MIM 229200). Patients with BCS have a thin and fragile cornea that can spontaneously or after minor . The features of BCS are thin cornea, keratoconus, blue sclerae, risk of globe rupture, retinal detachment, and high myopia (nearsightedness). The inheritance pattern of spEDS is autosomal recessive. The affected genes in spEDS are affecting the protein beta4GalT7 (MIM 130070), affecting beta3GalT6 (MIM 615349), and affecting ZIP13 (MIM 612350). The features of spEDS are short stature, hypotonia, limb-bowing, osteopenia, and hyperextensible, thin, doughy skin. Musculocontractural Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (mcEDS) The inheritance pattern of mcEDS is autosomal recessive. The affected genes in mcEDS are affecting the protein D4ST1 (MIM 601776) and  affecting DSE (MIM 615539). The features of mcEDS are congenital resulting in club foot, dislocations, adducted (clasped) thumbs in infancy, hyperextensible skin, easy bruising, fragile skin, and atrophic scars. The inheritance patterns of mEDS can be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. The affected gene in mEDS is affecting Type XII collagen (MIM 616471).  Muscle weakness present in infancy and childhood tends to improve until young adulthood, with some deterioration after the age of about 40.  The inheritance pattern of pEDS is autosomal dominant.

You may be prescribed thigh-high . These stockings help push the blood up from the legs to reduce POTS symptoms. You should obtain a blood pressure monitor to . Blood pressure monitors may be purchased at most drug stores, online or at a medical supply store. Have your blood pressure monitor checked at your doctor’s office to make sure your machine’s readings correlate with your doctor’s blood pressure readings. Although the heart is healthy in most POTS patients, you may be evaluated to enter a . This exercise template uses the cardiac rehab model to recondition and help improve health and control POTS. Some of the best data for treating POTS comes from cardiac rehab. Increase sodium in your diet to 3,000 mg to 10,000 mg per day. Drink 2-2.5 liters per day of fluids. Water is a good choice. Sports drinks may be used, but watch calories and if you have food sensitivities to these drinks’ ingredients. Small and frequent meals are better tolerated and reduce POTS symptoms. Diet with high fiber and complex carbohydrates may help reduce blood glucose (sugar) spikes and lessen POTS symptoms. Keep your nutrition balanced with protein, vegetables, dairy and fruits. Plan meals as POTS patients may occasionally not have stamina for grocery shopping and preparing meals. Plan meals when your energy is at its peak. If possible, make it a family plan to prepare food and share grocery shopping responsibilities. Don’t over-rely on processed foods. Processed foods are easy to prepare and are appealing when one has reduced energy, but usually have less nutritional value. Beneficial salty snacks may include chicken or beef broth, vegetable broth, pickles, olives, salted fish like sardines/anchovies and nuts. Don’t over-rely on snack chips and crackers for salt. Plan grocery store shopping using a list to make sure you pick up healthy food choices and POTS care (hydration and salty supplements). If your stamina is reduced have someone help you shop, carry and put away your groceries. Health conditions can be costly. Do your best not to compromise nutrition and food choices to save money. You may need a dietary and nutrition consult ordered by your doctor to help you with your diet. This consult can be especially helpful for those with celiac and other dietary sensitivities. Often in early phase of POTS patients don't like how their bodies feel and look. Be careful of fad diets or diet supplements for weight loss. Taking and writing down your vital information (blood pressure and pulse) can give you insight and better control over your POTS, and helps your doctor fine tune your treatment. Check blood pressure and pulse at the same time daily (in the morning and after dinner). It’s very helpful to do this for the first few months of your diagnosis. Also check blood pressure and pulse when you aren't feeling well. Measuring heart rate can give you insight as you deal with POTS. Other facts about heart rate and POTS: A normal heart rate is between 60 to 100 beats per minute. A fast heart rate over 100 beats per minute can be a condition called tachycardia. A slow heart rate under 60 beats per minute is called bradycardia. Blood pressure is the pressure of the blood in the blood vessels in the circulatory system. Blood pressure is related to the heart beating and the diameter and elasticity of the artery walls. Blood pressure has two components, systolic and diastolic. Blood pressure is recorded as systolic/diastolic. For example, a blood pressure reading of 120/80 represents the systolic number as 120 and the diastolic number as 80. The systolic refers to the amount of pressure in the arteries during the contraction of your heart muscles (heart beats). The diastolic refers to the blood pressure between heart beats. Normal blood pressure is between is 90-120 for systolic and 60-80 for diastolic. Many patients will have stable blood pressure readings since the adrenergic response to keep heart rate increased will reduce blood pressure drops. POTS patients can have moments of hypertension with the systolic over 140 or diastolic over 85. If hypertension occurs in many readings, inform your POTS specialist of these consistent readings of hypertension. Low blood pressure is below 90/60. Blood pressure logging that reveal low blood pressure readings can be helpful for POTS treatment. Exercise and physical activity are key to managing POTS. Here are important things to know as you undergo an exercise program such as cardiac rehab, as well as other physical activities. Talk with your healthcare provider for specific instructions on these exercises. involve contracting your muscles without actually moving your body. Isometrics squeeze the muscle and push the blood back toward the heart. They are simple to do and can be done lying in bed or seated in a comfortable chair. It's a good idea to do these in bed before getting up to prepare your body for sitting and standing. . Go from lying to sitting on the edge of the bed. Stay there for several minutes, allowing the body to naturally adjust to the change in position. Once you are standing, pause and wait before walking to allow blood pressure to adjust again. If you feel lightheaded at any point, wait for a few minutes in that position to see if it resolves. If not, then return to the prior position as your body isn't adjusting properly. SLOWLY is the key. . Count how many steps you can do without inducing symptoms. These steps are your initial baseline. Start with walking once a day and go a little further in time, distance or by adding steps. If you feel good, add a second walk in the day. A simple strategy for counting steps is to do 100- 300 steps per awakening hour during the day. Fitness trackers can monitor steps and distance easily. Every week or every few weeks add more steps to your daily total. with focusing on breathing may help reduce POTS symptoms. As you do better with your POTS, more fitness and exercise regimens may be started. Try to maintain a typical sleep schedule. Go to bed consistently at a certain time and set a consistent time to wake up. The best sleep hygiene and good rest comes from staying consistent with your sleep schedule every day. Even if you had a poor night of sleep, try to get up at your regular time. A consistent sleep schedule, even with a bad night’s sleep, helps you feel better in the long term. Excessive daytime napping may make nighttime sleep less restful. Be aware of POTS symptoms of chest pain, sweating, restlessness and racing heart rate during bedtime. These symptoms interfere with sleep quality and may have to be addressed by your POTS specialist Avoid excessive television viewing or use of tablet/smartphone/computer in bed. These technologies can interfere with sleep quality. Raise the head of your bed 6-10 inches to help alleviate POTS symptoms. The entire bed must be at an angle. Raising the head of the bed will reduce urine formation overnight and increase fluid volume in your circulation in the morning. This may help you wake up more easily. Make sure the temperature is ideal in your bedroom to help you get proper rest. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 06/02/2017. National Institutes of Health.

Dr. Jaeger was my father’s physician last year. He was amazing. What is being done to inform doctors about this condition? There are a lot of misdiagnoses. Before we met doctor Jaeger, one Dr. told my father he was lazy. She would make him try to sit up for long periods even as his BP was plummeting. Dr. Jaeger has my father on a medication combination that enables him to function normally, he is driving again, and cooking. This time last year, he could not sit up without almost passing out. We thank God for using you, Dr. Jaeger. Glad he's doing well! This week, I understand that there is currently a large campaign to inform doctors and others about autonomic dysfunction - including webchats like this one. Hello. I would like to pose the same question. What is being done to educate the rest of the medical community to this condition? This condition is very misdiagnosed. Excellent question. I think it's that autonomic realm is becoming more commonly understood that helps makes diagnosis more common. In teaching of medical students in the Neurology rotation here at Cleveland Clinic, I spend time reinforcing when someone has global symptoms to think autonomic. We are living in a time where this understanding of the autonomic system role in health and disease, there is more research, time and effort into autonomic dysautonomia. I am hopeful. My second question is about genetics and POTS.  I have a twin sister and a younger brother who have POTS as well and I've heard that there is some research being done about a genetic link and POTS.  Do you know what genetic link that is? I also got tested for EDS and don't have that. Lastly, I have an upcoming appointment with a rheumatologist which I was told to look for my underlying condition such as an autoimmune disorder which is commonly linked to POTS. Do you have any advice on what I should mention in that appointment as it relates to POTS? Thank you so much! :) So genetics can be relevant, we do see in the joint heart mobility syndromes like EDS and Marfan's increased incidence of POTS. I personally am following a family of 12 relatives with POTS and yet we still do not know the mechanism of why they share this health issue. Migraines can have a genetic component and migraine patients can have an increased incidence of POTS and migraine can be a genetic condition. The question about autoimmune is common autoimmune syndromes can be Celiac, Sjogren's, the ganglionic receptor antibody. Sjogren's has a 15-20% occurrence in POTS patients and the conventional blood test might be negative for neurological Sjogren's. If we have a concern of Sjogren's we will do a dry eye test and a lip biopsy in our POTS patients. Hello, I've had POTS for some time now that has become very severe and cannot be treated with any of the medications used for this condition. I have developed some neurological issues and have RBD (REM behavior disorder). The POTS specialist here diagnosed me with Shy Drager, now known as MSA (Multiple System Atrophy). My primary doctor and I aren't so sure, or perhaps don't want to believe, I have something fatal. How do I know for certain if it is POTS or is MSA? Do I just have to wait and see if MSA symptoms progress and death is imminent or is there another way? I have read that POTS patients with RBD can later in life likely develop MSA. Is this also true? Thank you for your time. This is a great question. Generally MSA can be ascertained by careful neurologic exam looking for Parkinson's findings on exam. Also brain MRI may show atrophy in the cerebellum or brain stem area. Generally MSA will not have the tachycardia of POTS. The important thing is there are some autoimmune neurologic conditions that can cause stiffness and POTS; like the anti-GAD syndrome. I can't really explain it, but i have been having problems down my left side. It started off as I got up, my whole left side would clench up and it would be like I needed to drag it along, and now it is happening a lot.  Sat down, stood still, or moving around.   Now recently, three days ago, on the left foot where I have been having these problems I have got really bad pain going across my foot and on my ankle and a little up my leg. I don't know what this could be, can you help? I think this is very important to address with a very detailed neurologic evaluation. There are conditions that can share autonomic dysfunction and failure to control even one side of the body. My son was just diagnosed with Dysautonomia, and pots, the doctors have told us the seizures he just started experiencing are not a part of the Dysautonomia. I hear of others experiencing similar events. What if anything can be done to help the seizures if they are not epilepsy? The school wants to know before they will let him back in school. So it's important to ask the doctors if there are any joint or shared diagnoses that could cause seizures. In addition, it's very important to log the frequency of these seizure events. The frequency may help determine if there's a need for more potential monitoring (epilepsy monitoring). In addition, there is a term called convulsive syncope where people can look like they are having a seizure where there is really an autonomic response. Even epilepsy monitoring can demonstrate that these are not seizures and might be a window by heart rate and blood pressure monitoring that this might be autonomic dysfunction as a cause of these events. I have been diagnosed with POTS for three yrs. now, but doctors still can't figure out or stop the seizures I go into, a lot of times when my blood pressure drops. Is this something that is fairly common; and will I have to struggle through this the rest of my life? There are not any doctors in my area with much knowledge on POTS. There is a term called convulsive syncope that can look like seizures when the cause is really autonomic dysfunction. With my patients I will want to see their blood pressure logs. If the blood pressure is low I will often use medication and other care to help raise the blood pressure to reduce these events. It's important to make sure you've had evaluation for seizures also, usually with EEG, and neurologic consultation. I have confirmed sarcoidosis in remission and diagnosed with an atrial tachycardia. I dropped 15 lb. in two weeks, developed OI, syncope, worsening GI issues, neuropathy in my hands and feet, loss of dexterity. Stress and activity make it worse, excitement makes me shake uncontrollably. I was tested for every disease known to cause these symptoms. My GI results showed no issues causing my symptoms. I was tilt table and QSART tested twice, both were normal. We captured a 30+ spike in heart rate when standing resulting in near syncope. My docs (Mayo) now suspect POTS or other autonomic dysfunction. A CDP and DVA test, noted functionally impaired DVA with significant loss of visual acuity with right/left head movements. I've made lifestyle changes, salt increases, leg compression, all seem to be helping. Can I have POTS and pass those tests? What other tests am I missing? What should we pursue with the DVA results, my ophthalmologist didn't know? If it's not POTS, what else could it be? I have seen autonomic dysfunction or POTS develop after sarcoidosis. We can see autonomic dysfunction or POTS develop as a secondary response to a chronic health disease. And besides treating the chronic health issue, treating the POTS is one of the best paths to better health. You can have POTS and pass those tests, one additional test to ask is if you should be tested for small fiber neuropathy related to sarcoidosis and POTS. In addition with all your wellness lifestyle for POTS, cardiac rehab and potential medicines may help your POTS function better. With autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy AAG is it progressive? If the antibodies are treated will your symptoms improve or resolve or stay the same?  Do the antibodies do permanent damage to your autonomic system? #2 since the majority of Dysautonomia patients are female, what role does hormones play and can hormone replacement help symptoms? This is an excellent question. We generally use how someone is doing clinically more so than the antibody levels to tell how someone is doing. Some of my patients who are doing well may have persistent antibody levels. The antibodies represent a potential autoimmune factor. In addition, some of these autoimmune conditions that you mentioned we may also use IVIGG or plasma exchange. As for the hormones, we are still learning its role in this condition. We do know women will do worse around their menses. Can symptoms wax and wane or change over time? For example, can there be periods in your life where prolonged standing or sitting at a computer can trigger tachycardia/presyncope and other times in your life only affected by low blood pressure and narrow pulse pressures with no tachycardia. Fluctuations of symptoms are very common. They may have periods of quiescence, a relative control of symptoms, and seemingly or suddenly the symptoms return inexplicably. It's hard to predict, know when this will happen, or know what triggers this. We try to determine what might be the various triggers without autonomic testing, hemodynamic assessments and ambulatory monitors. I have been Diagnosed with POTS some days the symptoms are sever and then I have days where I feel ""normal"" is this how it works or have I been misdiagnosed? People with POTS can have good days and bad days. This does not discount the diagnosis. I encourage my patients to keep a daily log from 1 to 10 in terms of how they're doing. 10 is the worst, 1 is the best. This log can trend how someone is improving or doing worse. Also, the logging might give insight to triggers that are occurring in one's life to cause more bad days than good days. I hope for you to have more better days. Sleep is a huge problem for me; I find my symptoms significantly worse when I wake up from sleep or a nap. Why is this and how can I manage this? With autonomic dysfunction, especially POTS, sleep can be a big problem. One aspect is from immobilization, blood pooling occurs. Some patients will wear compression stockings at bed and keep their head elevated at 30 degrees. I often will prescribe a medication if there is nighttime tachycardia that does occur with POTS, like beta blocker. Often some patients will need to use a neuropathic medicine to help with some of the body pains and neuropathic symptoms at nighttime. Many of my POTS patients have very shallow, fragmented poor sleep. I find working to improve sleep often helps the daytime symptoms to be better controlled. What can be done to manage the nausea that can be experienced with POTS and/or Dysautonomia? We have tried Zofran, and that only works for less than 1 hour. Great question! The question I wonder is, has anyone medically evaluated for gastric motility disorder like gastroparesis that can cause these symptoms? I have actually sometimes used neuropathic medications to help these symptoms over typical anti-nausea medicine. Hello, I have not been dx with POTS, but with autonomic imbalance. I have been having problems with my heart rate and BP increasing, chronic fatigue, nausea, headaches, and problems, itching, blurred vision when BP is slightly elevated, tingling on mainly the left side of my body, frequent urination, which is better, when my BP is normal. I've been informed that it is mostly anxiety. This has been doing on for about 3 years. I'm sorry that you're struggling, but autonomic imbalance is just one of the general names ascribed to the category of dysautonomia. The names and nomenclature are influx and are frequently changing. However, many patients have symptoms on various parts of the spectrum, like you describe. Because many doctors do not understand the autonomic nervous system, there is frequent tendency to label it as anxiety or hyper vigilance. Certainly, ongoing autonomic disorders can trigger anxiety, probably appropriately, but what is needed for you is a thorough evaluation of your autonomic nervous system. There is usually good therapies, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic that alleviate symptoms. I started having odd fluctuations in my body temp in the 90's when I was about 26yrs old. I was diagnosed with FUO and told that ""It will either go away on its own or I may have it forever."" hmmm. 10 years later I began having random episodes of Tachycardia, less than 180bpm with few if any bothersome symptoms and was diagnosed with SVT. My Neurologist at CC just diagnosed it as POTS since I had an episode upon standing in his office. (diagnosed with NDPH ODDLY enough 10 years after the Tachycardia) The Tachycardia can start upon standing OR while just sitting still. Is that Truly POTS?? I STILL have the crazy fluctuations in body temp but just assumed it was the FUO that hasn't gone away. Could the 2 conditions actually be related?? One other interesting thing, I had a sleep study done and they noted that when I changed positions in bed, my temp would spike up. These Symptoms can be ""Irritating"" but not life altering. (I don't take Rx for SVT's because I'm usually asymptomatic). Temperature intolerance is extremely common in autonomic disorders, but abnormalities in temperature particularly recurrent fevers would not be a common feature of POTS, and suggests another type of underlying disorder, either endocrinologic or underlying covert infection. I have had severe pain in the front of both thighs when standing and walking for 4 years. After seeing many specialists and having every test, I had a tilt table test and consult with an autonomic doctor. He said I didn't have POTS because my heart rate didn't increase >30 pts. but said I had venous pooling and atypical presentation. My thighs also turn red when I stand/walk. Midodrine and herbs such as Butcher's broom didn't help, and compression stockings help a little. Another doctor at Johns Hopkins told me thigh pain is not usually associated with POTS and orthostatic intolerance. My BP and HR increase, and I feel jittery, shaky, and lightheaded when standing a few minutes. Could the thigh pain be part of an orthostatic problem, and should I continue to pursue this by seeing another autonomic doctor, or is it likely something unrelated that they haven't found yet? I am a 48-y-old female. Any doctors you recommend in the northern Virginia area? Thanks for your help! Sometimes I will repeat the tilt table test for those patients I still have a concern for autonomic dysfunction. What I also try to study is the heart rate response through the tilt table and not the heart rate response of 30 beats over baseline at the 10 minute head of bed elevated interval. Midodrine might not be the only medicine to use for autonomic dysfunction. We do see body pain in people with autonomic dysfunction as blood pools or if there is underlying small fiber neuropathy. I think it's essential and excellent that you are trying to monitor your blood pressure heart rate with your symptoms. Also you should be doing your blood pressure at least daily at a standard time besides when you feel at your worst. This logging of vitals helps me understand my patient's physiology to better help them. Besides Pain Management are there any other treatments for autonomic disorders? Specifically lower leg spasms and hot/ cold sensitivities. Again, a great question! This question raises diagnosis that these symptoms can often be tied into neuropathy and this neuropathy is usually a small fiber that can be diagnosed with qsart or skin nerve biopsy . Often for my patients with these symptoms, I will do a comprehensive blood panel for typical autoimmune conditions and neurologic autoantibodies. Is there a connection between POTS and neuropathic pain? We can see small fiber neuropathy in POTS that can cause this pain. Also blood pooling can cause much body pain. Could POTS cause EXTREME pain in my toes? Like the sensation of an open wound being dragged thru sand & glass? Could it also be responsible for my legs having the sensation of ""falling asleep""? Lastly, how do we speak to our own doctors without sounding like whiney crazy people? How do I get my Dr. to listen/understand? This is an important question that we can see small fiber neuropathy in POTS, about 20% occurrence. In addition, blood pooling can cause these symptoms. The blood pooling and these symptoms might occur when persons are more immobilized through the day from sitting or lying down. In small fiber neuropathy, we use QSART or skin nerve biopsy for diagnosis. Can pain be a symptom from POTS ? How does a person advocate for Themselves during a flare and when should a person go to the hospital for symptoms. Most of us when we go just get a saline iv if that much and are kicked out with a ""there is nothing more I can do everything looks fine even though you don't feel fine"" Looking forward for your input Pain is very typical. The cause can be blood pooling. For a subset, they may have small fiber neuropathy. We really try to work with our POTS patients to make their care as outpatient care when possible. Monitoring vitals of blood pressure and pulse daily and when you feel bad it may be insightful to tailor therapy to help you do better. Hello, I was diagnosed with Neurocardiogenic Syncope 6 years ago and had a pacemaker inserted. About 3 years ago I started having Ocular migraines a few times per month where part of my vision is blocked from 15 to 45 minutes. Is this an autonomic issue or another neurological problem? Also, are there any new drugs, supplements or special diets that can help the symptoms of Dysautonomia? Thank you. Great question. We do see Sjogren's and Celiac as being tied into POTS and gut issues. Testing that is sometimes helpful are any studies for gastro motility. Your gut is a big neuromuscular structure and can be impacted by autonomic dysfunction. And we do see abdominal pain with POTS as blood pools from abdominal skeletal muscles and not impacting the gut itself. Many of my POTS patients need lifestyle and medications to help gut function. I have horrible migraines with days of vomiting for which Zofran and all the others don't help. Many medications make my body feel like I should not have taken these medications. In the ER I try to just get fluid support and some IV for nausea but they are always pushing strong medications for the pain. Any suggestions for pain medications that are safe for dysautonomia? Migraines history can be a risk factor for POTS. Also, headaches and migraines can be common symptoms for POTs and dysautonomia in a young person. Often I find treating dysautonomia helps to reduce the headaches and migraines. Another consideration is that we use Botox injections for migraine prevention and reduction especially when the patient meets FDA criteria. After 13 years of SVTs and 2 ablations I was recently diagnosed with ""dysautonomia"". Besides the usual constellation of day time symptoms I battle with I have a major problem with tachycardia during sleep that nobody can figure out. I will sometimes wake during the FIRST hour of sleep with a heart rate of 140-160. It has been this way for years and never once happened further into my sleep. It isn't nightmares because a few times I started to wake slightly right before it started, a few times I remember rolling over from my stomach before it started. The episodes are terrifying and can last 20 minutes (after them I'm cold with chattering teeth, shaky and, of course, up for hours). I recently had a CAT scan and head MRI that was normal as well as an hour long EEG (I was supposed to fall asleep during but couldn't) and was told they could find nothing. Depending upon the type of ablations that you've had, you may have developed an inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Your doctors could test you for this with ambulatory monitors, assessments of neurologic and autonomic function as well as possible therapies like beta blockers or ivabradine. Without further information, it's impossible to say exactly what's happening, but we would certainly be happy to see you. Is A-Fib common with POTS? My POTS seem to get worse as I get older (presently 75) is this common? Atrial Fibrillation is very common in your age group, and not very common in POTS. In general, POTS in your age group is fairly uncommon as well; therefore, your doctors may consider other types of autonomic problems. My POTS symptoms act up with a vehicle moves when first starting out on a drive. Fine sitting down in the car, then just rolling out of the driveway makes my heart rate jump up. Is the nervous system confused? Why is driving/riding in a car different from other motions or activities? Four other POTS patients tell me they have similar experiences. Thanks! :) POTS patients frequently have concomitant vestibular/inner ear issues as well as motion sickness, which manifests in a variety of different symptoms. There is very good testing to determine if you have a vestibular component accompanying autonomic dysfunction, including specific neurologic testing of the inner ear function. Cleveland Clinic has several specialists in this, including a group who sees patients with vertigo, dizziness, and POTS. Why is pots causing me to regularly feel dizzy? Particularly after I stop walking or I am standing still even when my blood pressure is normal. People can feel very dizzy or light headed even when the blood pressure is normal. I would try to check your pulse also. I would try to keep a daily log of how frequently you feel this symptom. With my own patients I will also use how severe or impacted their daily life with medicine, life tips and maybe even use cardiac rehabilitation. My 14-year-old great grandson has been having what he calls ""his eyes go black"" episodes, and he becomes unsteady on his feet. He passed out once just for a moment or two; his eyes were glassy and pupils were dilated. Now when his eyes go black, his ears fill up with a feeling of being underwater. The doctor said it could be Dysautonomia and he has an appointment with a cardiologist next week. Can you help me understand what may be causing this and what can be done. He is now having these episodes more frequently (they actually started over a year ago). Actually what's happening is when people are fainting or near fainting they will have reduction of blood flow to their head. There is no brain injury from this. As a neurologist, I will often see people who come to us presenting with syncope without symptoms and we've had many patients report to us many symptoms and phenomena and strange body symptoms as their blood pressure and body fluctuate without having complete fainting. I have hypertension, pulmonary hypertension and A-fib. (Otherwise, I'm just fine!) I take Avapro, Imdur, Coumadin, Atenolol, Digoxin, Norvasc and Lasix 20. I have told my cardiologist that I have the symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and orthostatic hypotension. He told me to drink more water. (I don't drink enough.) I already know to change position slowly. Is there anything else I can do? Inner ear testing was negative. Orthostatic hypotension is extremely common and challenging. When people have the combination of high blood pressure with a tendency for blood pressure to fall when they stand, then there are specific medicines that can be used to help both extremes. There are many mechanisms responsible for this and diagnostic autonomic testing can usually reveal the mechanism. Certainly, augmentation of fluids is helpful, also other things to discuss with your doctor are inclining the head of the bed, exercise program, compression socks, and medications to prevent the falls in blood pressure without increasing or causing hypertension. I have large swings in blood pressure. Generally, my Systolic varies from 125 to 185, Diastolic varies from 62 to 80, heart rate usually around 60. I feel fine with these numbers. However, I also have episodes of very low blood pressure (pressure of 80/40) when my heart pounds hard and faster and I feel I am going to pass out. Actually I don't feel well when the Systolic goes below 130. I've been taking Amlodipine Besylate 2.5 mg daily and wonder if I should continue to do so. The episodes of extremely low blood pressure and feeling faint can happen any time I feel some anxiety, after I've eaten a satisfying meal rather than a light snack, or after walking up a flight of stairs. Is there any way to avoid such drastic drops in blood pressure? Swings or lability of blood pressure is very common in patients with autonomic disorders. You may discuss alternatives to amlodipine with your physician. There are other medicines that can be used to avoid much marked swings. Be sure to utilize compression socks, regular exercise, etc. If okay with your physicians, as this can certainly help. Beta blockers may be a better option for your hypertension, as they may avoid both the highs and the lows. But definitely discuss with your physician, or we'd be happy to see you here as well. My blood pressure is usually about 85/55, but sometimes when I exercise, it either goes down a bit, leading to a very fatigued feeling after a short period of exercise, or I develop a very wide pulse pressure, with a reading like 145/41. This causes me to feel like I am going to faint. How should I approach exercise with these difficulties? If exercise has been prescribed by your doctors to help, you didn't mention what type, but you probably should concentrate on non-gravitational exercises; exercises done while sitting or lying down, which tends to avoid the marked fluctuations or drop in blood pressure that can happen with some exercise. Be sure to ask your doctor about using custom fitted compression socks, particularly during exercising, augmentation of fluid and salt, if appropriate. If you are having chronic low blood pressure, you should undergo evaluation to determine the cause. This could include, blood volume measurements, autonomic testing, as well as endocrine testing. I have been diagnosed with autonomic dysfunction with low blood volume. I also have and have always had low blood pressure. I am trying to figure out spells I get that are not like low BP syncope. With these episodes I get weak and feel like my body is shutting down. Once, when I got to the ER I urinated so much the nurse couldn't figure out what was happening. Sometimes I will shake or feel like I am trying to walk against a great force before I collapse. Any insight? Low blood pressure and low blood volume can cause many symptoms in the body than just fainting. In neurology, we see that much body pain, weakness and headaches from low blood pressure and low blood volume. It's essential to daily monitor your blood pressure once or twice a day. If my patient has low blood pressure I will use medicine to try and decrease the blood pressure and these symptoms. I have a daughter who has ""Global Dysautonomia with POTS."" She is a patient of Dr. Moodley MD, Pediatric Neurology at your facility. She has had vision changes, hearing loss, facial swelling and dysphagia all on the right side since being diagnosed in March 2015. She has a NG tube and is starting vital stim this week on her throat. I am very overwhelmed with the many specialists she has. Is there one physician that could really help me understand everything she has going on? Is there anything else I can do besides treat the symptoms? Thank you so much. I look forward to your session in November!! Christine This is a very valid question. Dr. Moodley is a wonderful physician. Many patients with POTS have so many specialists that we do have on our floor S3 a large POTS population with opportunity for shared medical appointments and even potential office nurse or physician visits. It's a constant balance to know what POTS is and what is not POTS medically. If a person has been diagnosed with POTS and is symptomatic on a daily basis but does not take any prescription meds for the condition, is there any reason to maintain follow-up appointments with a doctor who treats POTS? Are there any annual tests or screenings that are recommended, such as cardiac evaluations? Usually, in my practice, patients will get a complete autonomic and cardiac evaluation on the initial visit and then, will usually start with the non-pharmacologic and later during follow up visits, medications or new therapies may be added. In addition, the condition does seem to change in character from time to time and certainly, monitoring for new symptoms or concerns may be appropriate. After being diagnosed with non-length dependent small fiber neuropathy, I was worked up at Cleveland Clinic for Dysautonomia. I had a normal TST and was told to cancel my QSART. I failed my tilt table test with Dr. Shields in six minutes. HR up 38 beats/min. and still rising. BP mostly unchanged except fluctuating systolic hypotension. Diagnosis of Cardiovascular Dysautonomia, Cardiovascular Adrenergic Dysfunction. Differential was POTS however cardiovagal findings suggest more widespread disorder. My questions 1) what widespread disorder? 2) why do or not do QSART? Thanks for your consideration of these questions. We often consider a thermoregulatory sweat test to be the best test to pick up a disseminated or widespread small fiber or autonomic neuropathy, therefore the QSART would not be needed. There are many conditions associated with vagal abnormalities. You should discuss these with the doctors who did the initial evaluations. In rehabilitation/physiotherapy: what is the exact goal you're trying to meet to help with POTS - is it all about gaining more muscle strength (to help pump your blood around) and if so: what if you're not able to gain more muscle (due to polyneuropathy or other muscular disorders)? The model of rehab that we like to use is a cardiac rehab model over conventional rehab to gently recondition the body using energy expenditure and pulse rate settings. Most POTS patients need very gradual increasing strength and conditioning since too rapid increased of exercise or rehab can actually work against the POTS patients. How effective is the ""Levine Protocol"" in helping POTS patients? The Levine Protocol also called POTS rehab or non-gravitational exercise program has been extremely helpful in many patients struggling with recurrent symptoms related to autonomic dysfunction. We have introduced this program in our cardiac rehab program and modified it, and are now treating several hundred patients on a regular basis. The results from clinical trials done several years ago have been quite impressive on improving symptoms and quality of life, and our own experience has been similar. The patients undergo rigorous initial evaluation with an exercise program and test and participate in so-called non-gravitational exercises; for example, recumbent bike, rowing machine, nustep, and aqua therapy if available, under a supervised, monitored, individualized, progressing at their own ability. How much does stress play a role in POTS symptoms worsening? Are PVCs common with POTS patients? If you have PVCS along with POTS, is a high salt intake still recommended? Stress is a common occurrence in all of our lives, and can certainly make symptoms more difficult to handle. Increasing adrenaline levels or sympathetic nervous system activation can certainly worsen tachycardia heart rates. In addition, PVCs are extremely common in general and certainly may be exacerbated through the same symptoms. As long as the cardiac function structure is normal and there is no hypertension, in general, high salt should not exacerbate the PVCs. However, high salt may lead to intermittent elevation of blood pressure, which can certainly trigger more PVCs. Is it possible to be diagnosed with POTS based on an in-office sit to stand test, then show no symptoms during a tilt table test? The doctor had diagnosed my young adult daughter with POTS saying she went up 30 bpm, (later said he wrote down 20 bpm), and did a TTT just to see if it was a certain type of POTS. But when she did not have the heart increase much or faint during the TTT, he said he didn't know if she had POTS or not but it didn't matter anyway because she needs to find the underlying cause anyway. Do you agree? Also, we have found it nearly impossible to find doctors that have heard of, know how to diagnose, or treat POTS. Those that do have new patients waiting up to a year, and some stop taking new patients. It is frustrating and almost impossible to find a doctor nearby when patients can't travel or take off work. Is this being taught in medical schools now, and do you see more doctors looking to specialize in this field? What do we do? It is unusual to have ""orthostatic tachycardia"" at the bedside, but have a normal TTT. Although, I have seen it occasionally and it remains a mystery. Certainly, patients can have daily fluctuation in their Tilt Table responses. Probably would be worthwhile to do further autonomic investigation, particularly since she still has intermittent high heart rates. It can be very frustrating to find physicians familiar with these autonomic problems, although, it appears that they are becoming increasingly prevalent as evidenced by the number of patients writing in today. The estimated incidents is about a million patients right now, and yes, new doctors in medical schools are learning about the autonomic disorders as well as ongoing research being done in multiple institutions. What are the indications that a POTS patient should have their Total Blood Volume tested? What information can a patient give to their doctors to help them understand the need for the test? Particularly for older female POTS patients who have had POTS long-term. (In early 50s with POTS for almost 45 years.) Our patients typically undergo a blood volume test routinely as that may be the root of their problem with unexpected low blood volume. Blood volume studies are available at about 200 facilities in the US in most major institutions, secondary, and tertiary care centers. It can be extremely helpful to guide therapy if significant low blood volume is found, including treatment with blood volume expanders and investigations of causes of low blood volume. We also perform other cardiac and hemodynamic testing to look at blood volume distribution during postural stress that is unique to Cleveland Clinic, called a radionuclide hemodynamic study, which was developed for patients with autonomic disorders. My daughter is just getting a Dysautonomia diagnosis. What is the treatment for this disease? Excellent question. Dysautonomia is a very general term, you should ask your physician for a more detailed diagnosis, like POTS for example. For treatment, we try to figure out what might have led to dysautonomia. We will use certain medications, a cardiac rehab model and autonomic life tips to help people function and do better. I have a new diagnosis of Dysautonomia and am taking Midodrine. Is this a medication I will be on the rest of my life? Also, I have three lesions in my brain. Does this have anything to do with the Dysautonomia??? Great question. You may not need to be on this medicine the rest of your life. I will use this medicine often to get people feeling better initially. As we layer in further diagnostic cause of Dysautonomia, cardiac rehab model and other life tips for Dysautonomia.

This low blood pressure (also called postural hypotension) can make you feel dizzy or faint. Symptoms usually improve by changing your medications or how you move into an upright position. What is orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure)? Orthostatic hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand from a seated or prone (lying down) position. You may feel dizzy or even faint. Orthostatic means an upright posture. Hypotension is low blood pressure. The condition is also called postural hypotension. measures the force of blood against artery walls as the heart pumps blood through the body’s . Blood pressure includes two measurements.

Along with a drop in blood pressure, POTS causes a heart rate increase of 30 to 40 beats per minute within 10 minutes of standing. POTS is less common than orthostatic hypotension. When you’re seated or lying down, blood from veins in your legs flows easily to the heart. When you stand up, blood in your lower extremities has a harder time reaching your heart. There’s less blood available for your heart to send to organs and muscles. As a result, blood pressure temporarily drops. Orthostatic hypotension happens more frequently — and with more severe symptoms — in the mornings. That’s because blood pressure is at its lowest in the morning. Some people don’t experience any symptoms from orthostatic hypotension. Others find that hot temperatures (from the weather, a or even a hot tub or shower) make symptoms worse. The main sign of orthostatic hypotension is or lightheadedness when you stand. You should feel better when you sit or lie down. Some people (syncope).

There’s less blood available for your heart to send to organs and muscles. As a result, blood pressure temporarily drops. Orthostatic hypotension happens more frequently — and with more severe symptoms — in the mornings. That’s because blood pressure is at its lowest in the morning. Some people don’t experience any symptoms from orthostatic hypotension. Others find that hot temperatures (from the weather, a or even a hot tub or shower) make symptoms worse. The main sign of orthostatic hypotension is or lightheadedness when you stand. You should feel better when you sit or lie down. Some people (syncope).

This low blood pressure (also called postural hypotension) can make you feel dizzy or faint. Symptoms usually improve by changing your medications or how you move into an upright position. What is orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure)? Orthostatic hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand from a seated or prone (lying down) position. You may feel dizzy or even faint. Orthostatic means an upright posture. Hypotension is low blood pressure. The condition is also called postural hypotension. measures the force of blood against artery walls as the heart pumps blood through the body’s . Blood pressure includes two measurements. Each is calculated in millimeters of mercury (mmHg): Arterial pressure when the heart beats and fills arteries with blood. Arterial pressure when the heart is at rest or between beats. Your healthcare provider records blood pressure as systolic over diastolic. Healthy blood pressure for most people is below 120/80 mmHg. A reading below 90/60 mmHg is considered . Healthcare providers define orthostatic hypotension based on individual blood pressure. You have orthostatic hypotension if your blood pressure drops more than 20 mmHg in systolic pressure and 10 mmHg in diastolic pressure within three minutes of standing up. Anyone can get orthostatic hypotension. The condition becomes more common as you age.

Abstract Abstract Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing when compared with blood pressure from the sitting or supine position. It results from an inadequate physiologic response to postural changes in blood pressure. Orthostatic hypotension may be acute or chronic, as well as symptomatic or asymptomatic. Common symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, palpitations, and headache. Less common symptoms include syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, and neck and shoulder pain. Causes include dehydration or blood loss; disorders of the neurologic, cardiovascular, or endocrine systems; and several classes of medications. Evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension begins by identifying reversible causes and underlying associated medical conditions. Head-up tilt-table testing can aid in confirming a diagnosis of suspected orthostatic hypotension when standard orthostatic vital signs are nondiagnostic; it also can aid in assessing treatment response in patients with an autonomic disorder. Goals of treatment involve improving hypotension without excessive supine hypertension, relieving orthostatic symptoms, and improving standing time. Treatment includes correcting reversible causes and discontinuing responsible medications, when possible. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be offered to all patients. For patients who do not respond adequately to nonpharmacologic treatment, fludrocortisone, midodrine, and pyridostigmine are pharmacologic therapies proven to be beneficial. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing compared with blood pressure from the sitting or supine position. Alternatively, the diagnosis can be made by head-up tilt-table testing at an angle of at least 60 degrees. Orthostatic hypotension is often found in older patients and in those who are frail. It is present in up to 20 percent of patients older than 65 years. In one study, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension was 18 percent in patients older than 65 years, but only 2 percent of these patients were symptomatic. In the absence of volume depletion, younger patients with orthostatic hypotension usually have chronic autonomic failure. A related problem, postprandial hypotension, is common in older patients and those with autonomic dysfunction. In postprandial hypotension, there is a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg within 75 minutes of a meal.  Enlarge     Print Consider head-up tilt-table testing in patients with symptoms of orthostatic hypotension despite normal vital signs, or in patients who are unable to stand for orthostatic vital sign measurements.

Abstract A normal hemodynamic response to changes in posture requires normal function of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems. Standing results in blood pooling of approximately 500 to 1,000 mL in the lower extremities and splanchnic circulation. This initiates an increase in sympathetic outflow, which increases peripheral vascular resistance, venous return, and cardiac output, thereby limiting the decrease in blood pressure. These compensatory mechanisms result in a decrease in systolic blood pressure (5 to 10 mm Hg), an increase in diastolic blood pressure (5 to 10 mm Hg), and an increase in pulse rate (10 to 25 beats per minute). However, orthostatic hypotension may result if there is inadequate intravascular volume, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, decreased venous return, or inability to increase cardiac output in response to postural changes. Decreased cerebral perfusion produces the neurologic symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Abstract Orthostatic hypotension may be acute or chronic. Patients may present with light-headedness, blurred vision, dizziness, weakness, and fatigue, or with syncope (in the acute care setting). Less commonly, they may present with neck and shoulder pain, orthostatic dyspnea, and chest pain.  outlines the differential diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension, which may be caused by a number of things, including dehydration, blood loss, medication, or a disorder of the neurologic, cardiovascular, or endocrine system.  Evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension begins by identifying reversible causes and underlying associated medical conditions. lists historical features that suggest a specific diagnosis in the patient with orthostatic hypotension. In addition to assessing for symptoms of orthostasis, the physician should elicit symptoms of autonomic dysfunction involving the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems.  Enlarge     Print  Enlarge     Print Historical Clues to Diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension Abnormal uterine bleeding, fatigue, rectal bleeding Amaurosis fugax, aphasia, dysarthria, unilateral sensory and motor symptoms Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, pericarditis Relapsing neurologic symptoms in various anatomic locations Historical Clues to Diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension Abnormal uterine bleeding, fatigue, rectal bleeding Amaurosis fugax, aphasia, dysarthria, unilateral sensory and motor symptoms Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, pericarditis Relapsing neurologic symptoms in various anatomic locations Key physical examination findings in the evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension are listed in . A detailed assessment of the motor nervous system should be performed to evaluate for signs of Parkinson disease, as well as cerebellar ataxia. Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured in the supine position and repeated after the patient has been standing for three minutes. As many as two-thirds of patients with orthostatic hypotension may go undetected if blood pressure is not measured while supine. However, a retrospective review of 730 patients found that orthostatic vital signs had poor test characteristics (positive predictive value = 61.7 percent; negative predictive value = 50.2 percent) when compared with tilt-table testing for the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. Head-up tilt-table testing should be ordered if there is a high index of suspicion for orthostatic hypotension despite normal orthostatic vital signs, and it may be considered in patients who are unable to stand for orthostatic vital sign measurements.  Enlarge     Print Physical Examination Clues to Diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension Cogwheel rigidity, festinating gait, lack of truncal rotation while turning, masked facies Confusion, dry mucous membranes, dry tongue, longitudinal tongue furrows, speech difficulty, sunken eyes, upper body weakness Study of 55 patients 61 to 98 years of age in emergency care setting found these findings highly reliable Decreased libido, impotence in men; urinary retention and incontinence in women Dependent lower extremity edema, stasis dermatitis Right-sided congestive heart failure, venous insufficiency Physical Examination Clues to Diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension Cogwheel rigidity, festinating gait, lack of truncal rotation while turning, masked facies Confusion, dry mucous membranes, dry tongue, longitudinal tongue furrows, speech difficulty, sunken eyes, upper body weakness Study of 55 patients 61 to 98 years of age in emergency care setting found these findings highly reliable Decreased libido, impotence in men; urinary retention and incontinence in women Dependent lower extremity edema, stasis dermatitis Right-sided congestive heart failure, venous insufficiency A description of head-up tilt-table testing and its indications are outlined in , and shows a patient undergoing the testing. The procedure is generally considered safe, but serious adverse events such as syncope and arrhythmias have been reported. All staff involved in performing tilt-table testing should be trained in advanced cardiac life support, and resuscitation equipment should be readily available.  Four common abnormal patterns can be seen in response to tilt-table testing . The test may be useful in distinguishing orthostatic hypotension from other disorders that can present with symptoms of orthostasis, such as neurocardiogenic syncope. Sensitivity of tilt-table testing for diagnosing neurocardiogenic syncope is as high as 65 percent, and specificity is as high as 100 percent.  Enlarge     Print Indications and Procedure for Head-Up Tilt-Table Testing High probability of orthostatic hypotension despite an initial negative evaluation (e.g., Parkinson disease) Patients with significant motor impairment that precludes them from having standing vital signs obtained Monitor the course of an autonomic disorder and its response to therapy Perform tilt-table testing in a quiet room with a temperature of 68°F to 75°F (20°C to 24°C). The patient should rest while supine for five minutes before testing is started. Heart rate should be measured continuously and an automated device should measure blood pressure at regular intervals. The table should be slowly elevated to an angle between 60 to 80 degrees for three minutes. The test is considered positive if systolic blood pressure falls 20 mm Hg below baseline or if diastolic blood pressure falls 10 mm Hg below baseline. If symptoms occur during testing, the patient should be returned to the supine position immediately.

In older patients, a report of dizziness upon standing may not correlate with the finding of orthostatic hypotension. A prospective study of older women found that use of anxiolytics or sleeping aids once weekly and cigarette smoking were more closely associated with postural dizziness without orthostatic hypotension than with a finding of orthostatic hypotension on tilt-table testing. In patients with Parkinson disease, classic symptoms of orthostatic hypotension are not reliably present in those who have autonomic dysfunction. A study of 50 patients with Parkinson disease found that only one-half of the patients who developed orthostatic hypotension during tilt-table testing were symptomatic. The study also found that patients with Parkinson disease who undergo tilt-table testing may need to be tested for longer than the recommended three minutes because only nine of 20 patients who developed orthostatic hypotension did so within three minutes. Extending the test to 11 minutes resulted in 15 of 20 patients being diagnosed, whereas 29 minutes was necessary to detect orthostatic hypotension in all patients. In acute care settings , syncope may be the initial presentation of orthostatic hypotension. A prospective study of 611 patients presenting to an emergency department following a syncopal episode found that 24 percent had orthostatic hypotension. Patients with syncope should be admitted if they have known cardiovascular disease, associated chest pain, an abnormal electrocardiogram, suspected pulmonary embolism, or new cardiovascular or neurologic findings on examination.       Orthostatic Hypotension Evaluation: Acute Care Setting Algorithm for the evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension in the acute care setting.

For patients without loss of consciousness, or those who are not considered at high cardiac or neurologic risk despite syncope, the evaluation shifts to rapidly identifying and treating reversible causes.

They may be more likely to present with undifferentiated descriptions of dizziness as a symptom. If possible, potentially contributing medications should be discontinued and the patient reevaluated. If orthostatic hypotension persists, laboratory testing for underlying causes should include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, vitamin B level, and morning cortisol .  Orthostatic hypotension is often neurogenic in patients whose history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not suggest another cause. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess for possible etiologies of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension . If the cause still is not apparent, autonomic testing may be indicated.

Adapted from Freeman R. Clinical practice. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. N Engl J Med. . Abstract Acute orthostatic hypotension generally resolves with treatment of the underlying cause. In patients with chronic orthostatic hypotension, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments may be beneficial. All patients with chronic orthostatic hypotension should be educated about their diagnosis and goals of treatment, which include improving orthostatic blood pressure without excessive supine hypertension, improving standing time, and relieving orthostatic symptoms. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be offered to all patients initially. If potentially contributing medications cannot be discontinued, then patients should be instructed to take them at bedtime when possible, particularly antihypertensives. Patients should avoid large carbohydrate-rich meals (to prevent postprandial hypotension), limit alcohol intake, and ensure adequate hydration. Patients should be encouraged to keep a symptom diary and avoid identified precipitating factors. Older patients should consume a minimum of 1.25 to 2.50 L of fluid per day to balance expected 24-hour urine losses. Water boluses (one 480-mL glass of tap water in one study and two 250-mL glasses of water in rapid succession in another study) have been shown to increase standing systolic blood pressure by more than 20 mm Hg for approximately two hours. Sodium may be supplemented by adding extra salt to food or taking 0.5- to 1.0-g salt tablets. A 24-hour urine sodium level can aid in treatment. Patients with a value of less than 170 mmol per 24 hours should be placed on 1 to 2 g of supplemental sodium three times a day and be reevaluated in one to two weeks, with the goal of raising urine sodium to between 150 and 200 mEq. Patients on sodium supplementation should be monitored for weight gain and edema. Lower-extremity and abdominal binders may be beneficial. A randomized, single-blind controlled study using tilt-table testing demonstrated effective management of orthostatic hypotension by application of lower-limb compression bandages. An exercise program focused on improving conditioning and teaching physical maneuvers to avoid orthostatic hypotension has proven to be beneficial. Patients should actively stand with legs crossed, with or without leaning forward. Squatting has been used to alleviate symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Other maneuvers include isometric exercises involving the arms, legs, and abdominal muscles during positional changes or prolonged standing. Toe raises, thigh contractions, and bending over at the waist are recommended. In patients who do not respond adequately to nonpharmacologic therapy for orthostatic hypotension, medication may be indicated. . Fludrocortisone, which is a synthetic mineralocorticoid, is considered first-line therapy for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. Dosing should be titrated within the therapeutic range until symptoms are relieved, or until the patient develops peripheral edema or has a weight gain of 4 to 8 lb (1.8 to 3.6 kg). Adverse effects include headache, supine hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Hypokalemia, which is dose-dependent and can appear within one to two weeks of treatment, may occur. In one study, hypokalemia developed in 24 percent of participants taking fludrocortisone, with a mean onset of eight months. . Midodrine, a peripheral selective alpha-1-adrenergic agonist, significantly increases standing systolic blood pressure and improves symptoms in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Patients should not take the last dose after 6:00 p.m. to avoid supine hypertension. Adverse effects include piloerection, pruritus, and paresthesia. Its use is contra-indicated in patients with coronary heart disease, urinary retention, thyrotoxicosis, or acute renal failure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a recommendation to withdraw midodrine from the market because of a lack of post-approval effectiveness data. Continued approval of the drug is currently under review. Its use generally should be restricted to subspecialists. It is believed to have a synergistic effect when combined with fludrocortisone. . Pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that improves neurotransmission at acetylcholine-mediated neurons of the autonomic nervous system. In a double-blind crossover study, patients were randomized to groups receiving 60 mg of pyridostigmine; 60 mg of pyridostigmine with 2.5 mg of midodrine; 60 mg of pyridostigmine with 5 mg of midodrine; or placebo. Compared with the placebo group, treatment groups demonstrated a decreased drop in standing diastolic blood pressure without worsening supine hypertension. Adverse effects include loose stools, diaphoresis, hypersalivation, and fasciculations. outlines nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options for the management of orthostatic hypotension.  Enlarge     Print Physical maneuvers (e.g., squatting, bending at waist) Sodium supplementation (up to 1 to 2 g three times per day) Starting dosage of 0.1 mg per day, titrate in increments of 0.1 mg per week, maximum dosage of 1 mg per day Hypokalemia, headache, supine hypertension, congestive heart failure, edema Systemic fungal infections, hypersensitivity to drug class Starting dosage of 2.5 mg three times per day, titrate with 2.5-mg increments weekly until maximum dosage of 10 mg three times per day Supine hypertension, piloerection, pruritus, paresthesia Acute renal failure, severe heart disease, urinary retention, thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma 2.5 mg: $112 ($140) for 100† 5 mg: $200 ($256) for 100* 10 mg: $291 ($616) for 100† Starting dosage of 30 mg two to three times per day, titrate to 60 mg three times per day Cholinergic effects, including loose stools, diaphoresis, hypersalivation, fasciculations Hypersensitivity to pyridostigmine or bromides, mechanical intestinal or urinary obstruction *—Estimated retail price based on information obtained at (accessed April 20, 2011).

The chapter then examines in turn the evidence on fatigue, post-exertional malaise (PEM), sleep-related symptoms, neurocognitive manifestations, and orthostatic intolerance and autonomic dysfunction in ME/CFS. One of the most significant challenges to achieving a better understanding of ME/CFS results from the methodological limitations of the current research base. Issues related to external and internal validity and to reliability frequently have led to inconsistent results across studies, as well as other shortcomings. Despite these limitations, however, the committee was able to glean evidence of symptoms, signs, and objective measures for ME/CFS. The evidence with respect to major symptoms and manifestations is presented in this chapter, while that related to other symptoms and manifestations and to pediatric ME/CFS is reviewed in and , respectively. This review of the evidence serves as the basis for the committee’s proposed diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, which are presented in . Studies on ME/CFS used different inclusion criteria and different sources of ME/CFS patients and control participants. The end result is het- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. erogeneity in both patient and control cohorts, creating an unclear picture of the symptoms and signs of the disorder and its outcomes. Findings are based on samples with a large majority of middle-aged women (late 40s to early 50s) who are Caucasian and of higher educational status, perhaps limiting the generalizability of the studies. Very few studies focused on other population subsets, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, or included ethnic and racial minority patients. Some studies recruited patients from specialized ME/CFS treatment centers, while others used community-based samples. These different sampling methods may result in patient groups that differ in demographic characteristics and symptom type and severity. Furthermore, those most severely affected by ME/CFS may be bedridden or homebound and may not have been included in any of these studies (Wiborg et al., 2010). Thus, there are selection biases in the studies’ sample composition. Some limitations also stem from issues regarding the case definitions or diagnostic criteria used in the studies (see for a review). Although a strong majority of studies used the Fukuda definition, a small number used various other definitions, thus complicating comparisons of the results. A major limitation of the Fukuda and other ME/CFS case definitions is their polythetic diagnostic criteria. Thus, two patients could have very little symptom overlap yet both be diagnosed with ME/CFS. Therefore, there is potential heterogeneity within and across patient samples in the literature that cannot be assessed because of the lack of reporting of symptom prevalence in most studies (Jason et al., 2012b). This problem is inherent in the study of any illness with polythetic diagnostic criteria. Finally, because most studies used the Fukuda definition to select cases, it is not possible to fully assess the evidence for the other diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. In many cases, studies lacked properly matched controls to account for confounders. The majority of published studies compared a small number of ME/CFS patients with healthy controls. Control groups including people with other illnesses, sedentary individuals, or people who meet different case definitions of ME/CFS have not commonly been used. Because almost all controls were healthy and most were physically active, the findings from those studies do not shed light on which symptoms and signs distinguish ME/CFS from other disorders with some overlapping symptoms. Some contradictory findings may also be due to the use of various scales, instruments, and measures for symptoms, some of which are imprecise, not comprehensive, or not validated. ME/CFS symptoms were derived mainly from patient self-reports, which raises questions about the internal validity of the study results. Moreover, relatively few studies were ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. longitudinal, so little light has been shed on the natural history of ME/CFS (Jason et al., 2011b). There also were few studies of the early stages of the illness. This is understandable given that the diagnosis can be made only after 6 months of symptoms (see and below), but nevertheless is a barrier to understanding the natural history of the illness. A lack of replication and validation in many studies limits the ability to assess the study findings critically. Few attempts have been made to follow up on or replicate intriguing findings in the literature to date. The dictionary definition of fatigue as a noun is “weariness from bodily or mental exertion.” Fatigue is not typically considered a disease but is commonly used in medicine to represent a broad spectrum of tiredness, from the physical, cognitive, or emotional feeling at the end of a long day to the emotional or physical toll of acute, chronic, or terminal illness (Gambert, 2005). Fatigue is one of the most common and nonspecific presenting complaints in primary care. Unfortunately, the word “fatigue” does not convey information about the cause, severity, or chronicity of fatigue or its impact on functionality. Although fatigue is a common experience, it has no unique physiological explanations or objective markers. A broad range of physical, medical, and mental health conditions and stressors may result in the complaint of fatigue (Matthews et al., 1991). Aging alone is associated with a gradual increase in fatigue and reduction in functional capacity for a variety of reasons (National Institute on Aging, 2007). Although overlap exists, fatigue usually can be distinguished from somnolence (also called drowsiness or sleepiness), which often is attributed to deprivation of sleep, primary sleep disorders, or sedating medications (Hossain et al., 2005). Thus, clinicians are challenged to integrate the subjective and objective evidence that can help identify the neurologic, malignant, infectious, inflammatory, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, endocrinologic, physical deconditioning, pharmacologic, or mental health factors that may underlie the presenting complaint of fatigue. (Note that a complete discussion of the differential diagnosis of fatigue is beyond the scope of this report.) Patients with ME/CFS almost always suffer from fatigue, and the importance of the symptom is illustrated by its central role in most of the ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. case criteria developed to date (see ). Regardless of what criteria are used, however, ME/CFS patients often have a level of fatigue that is more profound, more devastating, and longer lasting than that observed in patients with other fatiguing disorders. In addition, fatigue in ME/CFS is not the result of ongoing exertion, not lifelong, and not particularly responsive to rest (Jason and Taylor, 2002). Patients describe their fatigue as “exhaustion, weakness, a lack of energy, feeling drained, an inability to stand for even a few minutes, an inability to walk even a few blocks without exhaustion, and an inability to sustain an activity for any significant length of time” (FDA, 2013, p. 7). Some of the more extreme examples include “too exhausted to change clothes more than every 7-10 days”; “exhaustion to the point that speaking is not possible”; and “exertion of daily toileting, particularly bowel movements, sends me back to bed struggling for breath and feeling like I just climbed a mountain.” A few patients describe a “tired but wired” feeling (FDA, 2013, p. 14). Numerous efforts have been made to measure the nature and extent of fatigue in this population (Furst, 1999; Whitehead, 2009). Some patients improve, but most continue to experience some level of fatigue, physical and/or mental, ranging from mild to profound (Wilson et al., 1994). Jason and colleagues (2009) found that those with ME/CFS frequently report the occurrence of several distinct fatigue states that may diverge from commonplace perceptions of fatigue among the general population. They examined dimensions of fatigue in ME/CFS using a unique 22-item ME/CFS Fatigue Types Questionnaire administered to 130 patients and 251 healthy controls. Factor analysis demonstrated a five-factor structure of fatigue for ME/CFS patients and a one-factor solution for controls. The five types of fatigue that differentiated ME/CFS patients from controls were postexertional, wired, brain fog, energy, and flu-like fatigue (Jason et al., 2009, 2010a), clearly showing the complex nature of fatigue in ME/CFS. Earlier efforts to assess fatigue were made (Jason et al., 2011a), among others, by Chalder and colleagues (1993), who developed the Fatigue Scale; by Ray and colleagues (1992), who created the Profile of Fatigue-Related Symptoms; by Smets and colleagues (1995), who developed the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20); and by Krupp and colleagues (1989), who developed the Fatigue Severity Scale. Regarding the duration of fatigue, the Fukuda definition and the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) require 6 months for a diagnosis of ME/CFS. This 6-month requirement is supported by Nisenbaum and colleagues (1998), who showed that unexplained fatigue lasting for more than 6 months was related to symptoms included in the ME/CFS case definitions and that most other causes of similar fatigue do not last beyond 6 months. In their review of 39 measures of fatigue, Whitehead and colleagues (2009) found that although some measures were better than others, none ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. were ideal. Most measures have insufficient sensitivity and specificity to encompass all of the various and important aspects of fatigue in ME/CFS (Jason et al., 2011a). In addition, health care providers should note that a single assessment of fatigue severity may not provide a full understanding of the patterns of fatigue presenting over 1 day in ME/CFS patients (Jason and Brown, 2013). Fatigue may be most relevant when assessed relative to its impact on function. However, disability caused by fatigue may not reflect the levels of fatigue a patient is experiencing. For instance, despite feeling extremely fatigued, a person may continue working to survive economically and stop only when functionally impaired (Jason and Brown, 2013). provides additional examples and rates of functional impairment due to ME/CFS symptoms. In general, patients with ME/CFS experience a marked decrease in function across an array of domains, frequently attributed, at least in part, to their fatigue (Komaroff et al., 1996a). Efforts have been made to assess the impact of the disease on patients’ function, but most such efforts have been research based. One of the more commonly used tools in medical research as well as in ME/CFS studies is the Short Form 36-Item Questionnaire (SF-36) of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) (McHorney et al., 1993; Ware, 2002), a standardized and validated 36-item patient-report questionnaire with eight principal components or subscales used to determine the impact of illness on functionality. Early studies used this tool to distinguish ME/CFS from major depression, multiple sclerosis, acute infectious mononucleosis, hypertension, congestive heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, unexplained chronic fatigue, and healthy controls (Buchwald et al., 1996; Komaroff et al., 1996a). The VT (vitality) subscale of the MOS SF-36, for example, a questionnaire used to assess function, is thought to reflect both mental and physical function (McHorney et al., 1993) and includes the sum of four questions about having a lot of energy, being full of life/pep, feeling worn out, or feeling tired, with higher scores reflecting greater vitality (Ware, 2002). VT scores are consistently much lower in ME/CFS patients with and without comorbidities than in healthy controls and patients with other chronic illnesses, including fibromyalgia. Examples of mean VT scores on the MOS SF-36 from various published studies for the general population and those with ME/CFS and other chronic fatiguing illnesses are summarized in to demonstrate the profoundly low scores for ME/CFS compared with the other conditions. Several of the studies in the table do not specify the scoring algorithm (raw versus normalized t score) for the MOS SF-36, ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Mean VT Score on the MOS SF-36 for ME/CFS Versus Other Fatigue Conditions NOTES: CHF NYHA III = congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III; FM = fibromyalgia; HC = healthy control; HD = hemodialysis; HepC = chronic hepatitis C (without cirrhosis); MCS = multiple chemical sensitivity; MD = major depression; MSD 4+ = at least 4 musculoskeletal diseases; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; SSc = scleroderma/systemic sclerosis; VT = vitality subscale of the MOS SF-36. so that bias may exist in comparing VT scores across the studies. However, this bias is unlikely to explain the clear differences seen between the ME/CFS and non-ME/CFS groups in . While Jason and Brown (2013) demonstrated that the VT scores of ME/CFS patients ranged from 15 to 25 depending on subtyping strategies, other domains often are affected as well. Nacul and colleagues (2011a) found that scores on the role-physical (RP) subscale of the SF-36 were even more affected than scores on the VT subscale (version 2) but that all domains were impaired, with mental health being the best preserved. Jason and colleagues (2011c) found that impairments in VT, social functioning, and RP had the greatest sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients who met the Fukuda definition of ME/CFS. In one early study, all eight subscores of the SF-36 were lower in ME/CFS patients than in the general population and other disease comparison controls, with the exception of the mental health and role-emotional subscales in the controls with major depression (Komaroff et al., 1996a). It should be noted that, while widely used in research, the SF-36 may not be well suited to general clinical use because of user fees and the gen- The RP subscale combines the scores of four questions related to physical activity.

Brown and Jason, 2007; Buchwald et al., 1996; Jason and Brown, 2013; Komaroff et al., 1996a eral process of having to submit test results to the sponsor for scoring. The RAND-36 is an alternative version that is freely accessible, but it has a complex scoring algorithm (RAND, 1984). Fatigue, chronic fatigue, and particularly the impact of fatigue on function should be assessed in making a diagnosis of ME/CFS. Health care providers may use a range of questions and instruments to evaluate fatigue and its impact on function in these patients (see , ). However, ME/CFS should not be considered merely a point on the fatigue spectrum or as being simply about fatigue. Experienced clinicians and researchers, as well as patients and their supporters, have emphasized for years that this complex illness presentation entails much more than the chronic presence of fatigue. Other factors, such as orthostatic intolerance, widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, along with secondary anxiety and depression, contribute to the burden imposed by fatigue in this illness. The challenge in understanding this acquired chronic debility, unfortunately named “chronic fatigue syndrome” for more than two decades, will be to unravel those complexities. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. There is sufficient evidence that fatigue in ME/CFS is profound, not the result of ongoing excessive exertion, and not substantially alleviated by rest. This fatigue results in a substantial reduction or impairment in the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities and persists for more than 6 months. PEM is an exacerbation of some or all of an individual’s ME/CFS symptoms that occurs after physical or cognitive exertion and leads to a reduction in functional ability (Carruthers et al., 2003). As described by patients and supported by research, PEM is more than fatigue following a stressor. Patients may describe it as a post-exertional “crash,” “exhaustion,” “flare-up,” “collapse,” “debility,” or “setback.” PEM exacerbates a patient’s baseline symptoms and, in addition to fatigue and functional impairment (Peterson et al., 1994), may result in flu-like symptoms (e.g., sore throat, tender lymph nodes, feverishness) (VanNess et al., 2010); pain (e.g., headaches, generalized muscle/joint aches) (Meeus et al., 2014; Van Oosterwijck et al., 2010); cognitive dysfunction (e.g., difficulty with comprehension, impaired short-term memory, prolonged processing time) (LaManca et al., 1998; Ocon et al., 2012; VanNess et al., 2010); nausea/gastrointestinal discomfort; weakness/instability; lightheadedness/vertigo; sensory changes (e.g., tingling skin, increased sensitivity to noise) (VanNess et al., 2010); depression/anxiety; sleep disturbances (e.g., trouble falling or staying asleep, hypersomnia, unrefreshing sleep) (Davenport et al., 2011a); and difficulty recovering capacity after physical exertion (Davenport et al., 2011a,b). In some cases, patients experience new symptoms as part of the PEM response. The following quote reflects the breadth and severity of symptoms associated with PEM in these patients: when I do any activity that goes beyond what I can do—I literally collapse—my body is in major pain, it hurts to lay in bed, it hurts to think, I can’t hardly talk—I can’t find the words, I feel my insides are at war. My autonomic system is so out of whack! I can’t see farsighted and glasses won’t help—only rest. My GI system is so messed up. Any food hurts it. I tried everything from elimination diets to all the GI meds. Nothing is working. My body jerks. The list goes on. There are days that I just want to cry because I can’t take care of myself—I need help. But, I have no help Personal communication; public comments submitted to the IOM Committee on the Diagnostic Criteria for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for meeting 1, 2014.

I am sorry that I am not dying in the short-term, but I am living life waiting to die because no one takes this disease seriously. The types and thresholds of triggers of PEM, its onset, and its duration may vary among individuals and over the course of illness. PEM may occur after physical (Bazelmans et al., 2005; Davenport et al., 2011b; Nijs et al., 2010) or cognitive exertion (Arroll et al., 2014; Cockshell and Mathias, 2014; Smith et al., 1999). Patients also have described other potential triggers, such as emotional distress (Davenport et al., 2011a), physical trauma, decreased sleep quantity/quality, infection, and standing or sitting up for an extended period (FDA, 2013; Ocon et al., 2012). The type, severity, and duration of symptoms may be unexpected or seem out of proportion to the initiating trigger, which may be as mild as talking on the phone or being at the computer (Spotila, 2010). Patients report that PEM can be severe enough to render them bedridden (FDA, 2013). Although PEM may begin immediately following a trigger, patients report that symptom exacerbation often may develop hours or days after the trigger has ceased or resolved. Likewise, some studies have shown that PEM may occur quickly, within 30 minutes of exertion (Blackwood et al., 1998), while others have found that patients may experience a worsening of symptoms 1 to 7 days after exertion (Nijs et al., 2010; Sorensen et al., 2003; Van Oosterwijck et al., 2010; White et al., 2010; Yoshiuchi et al., 2007). The delayed onset and functional impairment associated with PEM also is supported by actigraphy data. ME/CFS participants enrolled in a walking program designed to increase their steps by about 30 percent daily were able to reach this goal initially, but after 4 to 10 days their steps decreased precipitously (Black and McCully, 2005). PEM is unpredictable in duration, potentially lasting hours, days, weeks, and even months (FDA, 2013; Nijs et al., 2010).

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. tests, ME/CFS patients experience greater fatigue compared with healthy controls (Bazelmans et al., 2005; LaManca et al., 1999b), and their fatigue and other symptoms last much longer relative to healthy active (Bazelmans et al., 2005) and sedentary controls (Davenport et al., 2011a,b; LaManca et al., 1999b; VanNess et al., 2010). In several studies, healthy controls declared themselves recovered within 24 to 48 hours after physical or cognitive exertion, whereas fewer than 31 percent of ME/CFS subjects had returned to their prestressor baseline state by this time, and as many as 60 percent were still experiencing multiple symptoms after 1 week (Cockshell and Mathias, 2014; Davenport et al., 2011b; VanNess et al., 2010). The prevalence of PEM among ME/CFS patients as diagnosed by existing criteria varies from 69 to 100 percent (Chu et al., 2013; De Becker et al., 2001; Jason et al., 2011b; Kerr et al., 2010; Nacul et al., 2011b; Vermeulen and Scholte, 2003; Zhang et al., 2010). In a longitudinal study that followed a random, community-based sample for 10 years, 100 percent of participants fulfilling the Fukuda definition reported PEM as a symptom at some point during their illness (Jason et al., 2011b), even though the Fukuda definition does not require PEM for diagnosis. Prevalence estimates of PEM vary for two major reasons: (1) some studies use ME/CFS case definitions that require PEM, while others list it as an optional symptom; and (2) the way PEM is defined, operationalized, or queried for can affect how patients interpret the concept of PEM and whether they endorse it (Jason et al., 1999, 2004, 2014). The prevalence of PEM in healthy control subjects is considerably lower than in ME/CFS patients, ranging from 4 to 8 percent (Hawk et al., 2006b; Jason et al., 2011b; Kerr et al., 2010; Komaroff et al., 1996b; Zhang et al., 2010). Jason and colleagues (2013b) found that a greater percentage of ME/CFS patients than healthy controls experienced PEM symptoms (see ). After moderate thresholds for frequency and severity were applied, the percentage of controls who endorsed PEM decreased further, from 7 to 19 percent to 2 to 7 percent. Thus, applying increased severity or frequency thresholds for PEM may assist in identifying patients with ME/CFS (Hawk et al., 2006b). A few studies that compared ME/CFS with other diseases found that, although PEM was experienced by 19 to 20 percent of subjects with major Jason and colleagues (2013b) compared 236 ME/CFS patients with 86 healthy controls who completed the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, rating the frequency and severity of 54 symptoms. Patient data were obtained from the SolveCFS BioBank, which includes patients diagnosed by a licensed physician using either the Fukuda definition or the CCC.

One study found that 64 percent of patients with major depressive disorder experienced PEM, but the authors did not describe how PEM was assessed (Zhang et al., 2010). As mentioned earlier, these prevalence estimates may vary depending on how PEM was defined and queried for, and thus they need to be interpreted with caution. PEM can be assessed subjectively by clinical history. It also can be assessed by standardized symptom questionnaires specific to ME/CFS and by comparison of self-reported symptoms and objective measures (such as functional impairment) before and after exertion or other types of stressors. Instruments and tools for individually assessing various symptoms exacerbated by PEM triggers are discussed in other sections of this chapter. This section is focused on questionnaires and objective tests used to determine whether a patient experiences PEM. Self-report questionnaires currently ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. are the more readily available way to assess whether a patient experiences PEM. Objective testing for PEM generally is costly and not easily accessible, and it may worsen the patient’s condition (Diamond, 2007; Nijs et al., 2010). Standardized symptom questionnaires with self-report items used to assess PEM include the CFS Medical Questionnaire (Komaroff et al., 1996c), CFS Screening Questionnaire (Jason et al., 1997), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Symptom Inventory (SI) (CDC, 2005), ME/CFS Fatigue Types Questionnaire (MFTQ) (Jason et al., 2009), and DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DePaul Research Team, 2010). These questionnaires, which include items designed to measure the presence, duration, frequency, or severity of PEM, were developed from patient input to query specifically about PEM, and some were tested for psychometric properties (Hawk et al., 2006b; Wagner et al., 2005). However, they have been used primarily for subject recruitment in research, for comparison of diagnoses in research protocols, or for epidemiological assessments. Use of a standardized instrument is critical to measuring PEM accurately because slight differences in wording on various self-report items have been shown to change the prevalence of PEM in the same group of patients (Jason et al., in press); thus, how one asks about PEM can influence the responses. As indicated earlier in this chapter, individual experiences of PEM may vary widely in terms of triggers, onset, duration, severity, impairment, and symptoms that are exacerbated. For example, patients for whom normal daily activities, such as unloading the dishwasher, trigger PEM may not engage in exercise. Thus, an item that asks about fatigue after exercise will not capture these patients’ experiences with PEM. Similarly, responses to this item will not indicate PEM in patients who experience symptom exacerbation after cognitive exertion (Jason et al., in press). Thus, development of a sufficiently inclusive but probing clinical instrument is essential. Emerging evidence for objective indicators that may help us understand the presentation of PEM in ME/CFS patients centers on the two commonly reported domains in the PEM complex: recovery after physical exertion and cognitive function. Objective assessment of cognitive function is discussed in the section on neurocognitive manifestations later in this chapter. One common characteristic of PEM is delayed ability to return to prior levels of physical capacity after physical exertion. One way to have them demonstrate this delayed lack of recovery in patients with ME/CFS is to ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. have them perform two cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) separated by 24 hours—the first to assess current level of function and elicit illness relapse (CPET 1) and the second to measure changes in exercise capacity due to the challenge (CPET 2) (Keller et al., 2014; Snell et al., 2013; Vermeulen et al., 2010). However, the committee emphasizes that the CPET is not required to diagnose patients with ME/CFS. Further, this test carries substantial risk for these patients as it may worsen their condition (Nijs et al., 2010; VanNess et al., 2010). The CPET is used clinically to assess exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption or VOmax) and predict outcomes in cardiac patients. VOmax measured during repeated CPETs is both reliable (test-retest difference < 7 percent) (Katch et al., 1982; Taylor et al., 1955; Weltman et al., 1990) and reproducible (r > 0.95-0.99) (Balady et al., 2010; Bruce et al., 1973; Taylor et al., 1955). Several studies have found that, despite meeting objective indicators of maximal effort during both CPETs, ME/CFS patients have significantly lower results on CPET 2 than on CPET 1 on one or more of the following parameters: VOmax (Keller et al., 2014; VanNess et al., 2007; Vermeulen et al., 2010), VO at ventilatory threshold (Keller et al., 2014), and maximal workload or workload at ventilatory threshold (Keller et al., 2014; Snell et al., 2013). These findings support the 2-day CPET protocol as an objective indicator that physical exertion may decrease subsequent function in some ME/CFS patients. By contrast, a single CPET may be insufficient to document the abnormal response of ME/CFS patients to exercise (Keller et al., 2014; Snell et al., 2013). Although some ME/CFS subjects show very low VOmax results on a single CPET, others may show results similar to or only slightly lower than those of healthy sedentary controls (Cook et al., 2012; De Becker et al., 2000; Farquhar et al., 2002; Inbar et al., 2001; Sargent et al., 2002; VanNess et al., 2007). Thus, the functional capacity of a patient may be erroneously overestimated and decreased values attributed only to deconditioning. Repeating the CPET will guard against such misperceptions given that deconditioned but healthy persons are able to replicate their results, even if low, on the second CPET. The committee conducted a targeted literature search to identify research comparing self-reported or objectively assessed PEM in ME/CFS subjects and in those without the illness. The methodology used is described in . The findings from the literature are described below, but there are several limitations to consider when interpreting the evidence base, as described at the beginning of this chapter. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Many studies found that fatigue increased and was prolonged after a physical stressor to a greater extent in ME/CFS patients than in healthy or sedentary controls. Findings of increased fatigue were consistent across different types of physical stressors, including subsequent maximal exercise tests (Davenport et al., 2011a,b), single maximal exercise tests (Bazelmans et al., 2005; Kishi et al., 2013; LaManca et al., 1998, 1999b, 2001; Meyer et al., 2013; Togo et al., 2010; VanNess et al., 2010), and other physical stressors (Black et al., 2005; Gibson et al., 1993; Nijs et al., 2010). When studies differentiated between mental and physical fatigue, both were found to have worsened in ME/CFS patients (Light et al., 2009, 2012; White et al., 2010, 2012). As noted earlier, cognitive exertion also may trigger increased mental and physical fatigue in ME/CFS patients (Arroll et al., 2014; Cockshell and Mathias, 2014). Mental fatigue tracks closely with physical fatigue (Light et al., 2009, 2012; Meyer et al., 2013; White et al., 2012). Subjected to a 3-hour standardized neuropsychological battery, healthy subjects experienced mental fatigue during and up to 3 hours after testing but recovered full mental energy, on average, by 7 hours posttest. In contrast, at 24 hours posttest, ME/CFS subjects continued to experience significant mental fatigue and did not return to their pretest mental energy levels for an average of 57 hours (Cockshell and Mathias, 2014). Exacerbation of Cognitive Symptoms Following Exertion or Orthostatic Challenge Although cognitive problems are common in ME/CFS patients, few studies have examined the effect of exertion on cognitive function. Some studies have demonstrated that a physical or orthostatic stressor may cause exacerbation of cognitive symptoms, including difficulty with concentration (Nijs et al., 2010); deficits in the speed of information processing (LaManca et al., 1998); and other self-reported cognitive problems (Meyer et al., 2013; VanNess et al., 2010). Studies also have shown decreased cognitive performance, such as on tests of focused and sustained attention, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the Stroop test, and the N-back task (Blackwood et al., 1998; LaManca et al., 2001; Ocon et al., 2012). Findings of other studies, however, suggest that cognitive problems do not worsen after physical exertion (Claypoole et al., 2001; Cook et al., 2005; Yoshiuchi et al., 2007). Cognitive exertion also may trigger cognitive symptoms (Capuron et al., 2006; Ocon et al., 2012). For example, one study asked ME/CFS subjects and healthy controls to complete computerized tests of memory, at- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. tention, and psychomotor function and found that as the tests progressed, the performance of the ME/CFS subjects worsened significantly more than that of controls (Smith et al., 1999). On the other hand, the findings of some studies suggest that cognitive exertion alone may not necessarily trigger cognitive problems (LaManca et al., 1998; Marshall et al., 1997). These inconsistent results may be attributable to variations in subject selection, exercise testing procedures, and cognitive testing, which inhibit direct comparisons among studies. Many studies have demonstrated that pain is increased and prolonged after a physical stressor in ME/CFS subjects compared with healthy or sedentary controls. Similar to the evidence base for fatigue, reports of increased pain among ME/CFS subjects are consistent across maximal exercise tests (Davenport et al., 2011a,b; VanNess et al., 2010) and other physical stressors (Black et al., 2005; Nijs et al., 2010). In at least two studies, though, the increase in pain after exertion among ME/CFS subjects was not statistically significant compared with controls (Bazelmans et al., 2005; Kishi et al., 2013). In addition to the strong evidence demonstrating post-exertional effects on fatigue status, cognitive function, and pain, evidence is mounting for other symptoms and outcomes, albeit from a lesser number of studies to date. After an exercise stressor, ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls demonstrated delayed recovery of muscle function and pH (Jones et al., 2010, 2012; Paul et al., 1999), increased depression or mood disturbances (Arroll et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2013), inappropriate autonomic responses (Cordero et al., 1996; LaManca et al., 2001), and amplification of problems with sleep (Davenport et al., 2011a,b; Kishi et al., 2013; Togo et al., 2010). Further studies confirming the different expression of genes (Light et al., 2009, 2012; Meyer et al., 2013; White et al., 2012) and immune biomarkers (Maes et al., 2012; Nijs et al., 2010, 2014; Sorensen et al., 2003; White et al., 2010) in patients with ME/CFS in response to physical exertion may help us to better understanding the pathophysiology of PEM. The existence of PEM can help physicians confirm a diagnosis of ME/CFS earlier rather than only after extensive exclusion of other conditions. Several studies have found that PEM best distinguishes ME/CFS from idio- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. pathic chronic fatigue (Baraniuk et al., 2013; Jason et al., 2002a) and may help distinguish it from other fatiguing conditions with a lower frequency of PEM, such as multiple sclerosis and major depressive disorder (Hawk et al., 2006a; Komaroff et al., 1996b). Further, PEM may be an important prognostic indicator because its continued presence or increased duration predicts a poorer outcome for ME/CFS patients (Taylor et al., 2002). PEM is a worsening of a patient’s symptoms and function after exposure to physical or cognitive stressors that were normally tolerated before disease onset. Subjective reports of PEM and prolonged recovery are supported by objective evidence, including failure to normally reproduce exercise test results (2-day CPET) and impaired cognitive function. These objective indices track strongly with the presence, severity, and duration of PEM. Patients’ experience of PEM varies, and some patients may have adapted their lifestyle and activity level to avoid triggering symptoms. As a result, health care providers should ask a range of questions (see , ) to determine whether PEM is present. Minimally, patients should be asked to describe baseline symptoms, the effects of physical or cognitive exertion, the time needed to recover to the pre-exertion state, and how they have limited their activities to avoid these effects. If the patient is unable to answer these questions clearly, health care providers may also ask the patient to track symptoms, activities, and rest in a diary—for example, in order to identify PEM patterns. There is sufficient evidence that PEM is a primary feature that helps distinguish ME/CFS from other conditions. Patients with ME/CFS frequently experience sleep-related problems such as insomnia, sleep disturbances, unrefreshing sleep, and nonrestorative sleep (FDA, 2013; Fossey et al., 2004). These symptoms are included in all existing ME/CFS case definitions and diagnostic criteria (see ). Unrefreshing sleep, or feeling as tired upon waking as before going to bed, is among the most common symptoms reported by ME/CFS patients, and only a small percentage of patients diagnosed with ME/CFS fail to report some type of sleep dysfunction (Carruthers et al., 2003; IACFS/ME, 2014; Jason et al., 2013b). This section summarizes the evidence on sleep-related signs and symptoms in ME/CFS reviewed by the committee to determine ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. whether such symptoms should be a component of its recommended diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. ME/CFS patients are more likely than healthy controls to experience sleep-related symptoms occurring at least half of the time and of at least moderate severity (see ) (Jason et al., 2013b). Although sleep-related symptoms also are reported by healthy persons and by chronically fatigued persons who do not fulfill ME/CFS criteria, a greater percentage of people fulfilling ME/CFS criteria report unrefreshing sleep, sleep disturbances, and difficulties falling asleep or waking up early in the morning (Komaroff et al., 1996a; Krupp et al., 1993; Nisenbaum et al., 2004) relative to these other groups. Sleep-related complaints may change throughout the course of the illness. For example, one study found that in the first few months of the illness, ME/CFS patients complain of hypersomnia, but as the disease progresses, they have trouble staying asleep (Morriss et al., 1997). A cross-sectional study of randomly selected patients found that sleep-related symptoms may become less frequent over the course of the illness (Nisenbaum et al., Percentage of ME/CFS patients and healthy controls reporting sleep-related symptoms of at least moderate severity that occurred at least half of the time during the past 6 months. NOTE: All patients fulfilled the Fukuda definition for CFS. SOURCE: Jason et al., 2013b. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. 2003); however, this may be due to behavioral adaptation or changes in sleep medication. Sleep-related symptoms are listed differently in the various diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS (see ), and there is conflicting evidence on whether ME/CFS patients fulfilling different diagnostic criteria experience sleep-related symptoms differently. Those fulfilling the CCC reported significantly worse (in terms of frequency and severity, p < 0.05) unrefreshing sleep (Jason et al., 2012a, 2013a) and more difficulty falling asleep (Jason et al., 2012a) relative to those fulfilling the Fukuda definition. Similarly, another BOX 4-1 Sleep-Related Symptoms in Case Definitions and Diagnostic Criteria for ME/CFS 1994 Fukuda Case Definition of CFS (Fukuda et al., 1994) Unrefreshing sleep is a minor criterion (not required). Sleep apnea and narcolepsy are exclusionary conditions (as they are conditions that explain chronic fatigue). Canadian Consensus Criteria for ME/CFS (Carruthers et al., 2003, p. 16) Sleep dysfunction, including unrefreshing sleep or sleep quantity or rhythm disturbances such as reversed or chaotic diurnal sleep rhythms, is a required criterion for diagnosis. “Loss of the deeper phases of sleep is especially characteristic, with frequent awakenings, and loss of restorative feelings in the morning. Restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder often accompany sleep disturbance.” “It is important to rule out treatable sleep disorders such as upper airway resistance syndrome, obstructive and central sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome.” 2011 International Consensus Criteria for ME (Carruthers et al., 2011, p. 330) Sleep disturbance is a minor criterion (not required), which includes – disturbed sleep patterns, such as insomnia, prolonged sleep including naps, sleeping most of the day and being awake most of the night, frequent awakenings, awaking much earlier than before illness onset, and vivid dreams/nightmares; and – unrefreshing sleep, such as awakening feeling exhausted regardless of duration of sleep and daytime sleepiness. “Sleep disturbances are typically expressed by prolonged sleep, sometimes extreme, in the acute phase and often evolve into marked sleep reversal in the chronic stage.” ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. study found that patients fulfilling the International Consensus Criteria for ME (ME-ICC) reported significantly worse symptom scores for unrefreshing sleep, need to nap during each day, difficulty falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep relative to those fulfilling the Fukuda definition (Brown et al., 2013). In contrast to these results, however, are those from two other studies. One study found that more patients fulfilling the Fukuda definition reported greater difficulty staying asleep than those fulfilling the CCC (Jason et al., 2004), while a second study reported no significant differences in sleep-related symptom scores between patients fulfilling the Fukuda definition and those fulfilling the ME-ICC (Jason et al., 2014). Regardless, it is clear that all the major diagnostic criteria include sleep-related symptoms. Chronic fatigue may be caused by sleep disorders; thus, most diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS require ruling out primary or treatable sleep disorders before a diagnosis of ME/CFS can be made (see ). Sleep apnea—whether obstructive, central, or undefined—is an exclusionary condition in several criteria, but there is less consistency regarding whether other sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy or the spectrum of obstructive or central sleep disorders, truly exclude ME/CFS (Carruthers et al., 2003; Fukuda et al., 1994; Jason et al., 2010b; NICE, 2007). Some researchers have noted that the inclusion of unrefreshing or nonrestorative sleep as a case-defining symptom, combined with listing sleep disorders as exclusionary conditions, may confuse the diagnosis and management of ME/CFS (Mariman et al., 2012; Unger et al., 2004). Taking a careful history of sleep complaints can help a clinician identify whether objective testing of patients with such complaints is indicated. As noted above, sleep-related symptoms may change over time in ME/CFS patients, and it is possible for sleep disorders to develop over the course of the illness (Morriss et al., 1997; Nisenbaum et al., 2003; Reeves et al., 2006). Furthermore, it is plausible that the development of other symptoms, such as pain or headache, over time may cause or contribute to sleep disorders, or that the development of a primary sleep disorder leads to widespread pain. Also, many ME/CFS patients are prescribed medications that may improve or worsen sleep-related symptoms (Armitage, 1999; Foral et al., 2011; Kierlin and Littner, 2011; Trivedi et al., 1999). Patients reporting symptoms of primary sleep disorders should be thoroughly evaluated to identify or rule out these conditions, as diagnosis and treatment of primary sleep disorders may be effective in reducing or relieving such symptoms (Qanneta, 2013; Reeves et al., 2006). Identifying insomnia in some patients may be useful therapeutically because techniques known to alleviate insomnia have been shown to be effective in fibromy- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. algia, a comorbid condition occurring in some ME/CFS patients (Edinger et al., 2005). Several questionnaires exist with which to capture patient-reported sleep symptoms and assess the subjective quality of sleep or sleep-related symptoms, although readily accessible clinical tools are not easy to find. The DePaul Symptom Questionnaire includes several items that can be used to assess the frequency and severity of symptoms that indicate sleep dysfunction in ME/CFS patients (DePaul Research Team, 2010). The Sleep Assessment Questionnaire also has been found to describe sleep abnormalities experienced by ME/CFS patients (Unger et al., 2004). And although not developed specifically for ME/CFS, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a validated tool for assessing subjective sleep quality (Buysse et al., 1989). It is important to consider frequency and severity thresholds when assessing subjective sleep complaints. In a study using the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, for example, 65 percent of healthy controls reported unrefreshing sleep that occurred with mild severity at least a little of the time, yet only 16 percent of healthy controls reported unrefreshing sleep that occurred with moderate severity at least half of the time (Jason et al., 2013b). The percentages of ME/CFS patients reporting unrefreshing sleep at the same thresholds were 99 and 92 percent, respectively. Complaints of sleepiness or fatigue so severe as to result in a substantial decrease in activity often lead to referral to a sleep laboratory for evaluation of underlying sleep pathology. Polysomnography (PSG), the continuous monitoring of variables that define sleep states and stages, is a type of sleep study used to diagnose sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy (Kasper et al., 2005; Kushida et al., 2005). Sleepiness usually is the driving symptom for referral for PSG, yet many ME/CFS patients do not undergo sleep studies because they report being fatigued rather than being sleepy (Spitzer and Broadman, 2010a). And although PSG can be useful for diagnosing primary sleep disorders that are often comorbid with ME/CFS, many ME/CFS patients have normal sleep studies despite complaining of nonrestorative sleep (Reeves et al., 2006). Recently, new ways of assessing sleep quality have emerged and have been applied to assess these abnormalities in ME/CFS patients. The classic method for assessing sleep is to record the electroencephalogram (EEG) of a patient every 30 seconds to determine the stage of sleep (Kushida et al., 2005). In contrast, one new method uses the actual waveform of the EEG and determines power at different frequencies (Armitage et al., 2007; Duffy et al., 2011). Another new approach assesses transitions between sleep stages and determines the probability of occurrence of each transition (Kishi et al., 2008). PSG requires spending the night in a sleep laboratory, which limits its ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. use to those who are willing and able to travel to the laboratory for testing. PSG also may be less accessible in nonurban areas or too costly to include in a routine assessment (Oliveira et al., 2014; Rosen et al., 2012). However, home-based recording is a possibility. Moreover, the development of ambulatory monitoring methods, such as wrist actigraphy, may increase access to these diagnostic tests (Blackman et al., 2010; Corral-Penafiel et al., 2013; Libman et al., 2009). However, this method has been normed only for healthy people (Marino et al., 2013), and its use in people with sleep problems still needs to be validated. And, of course, wrist actigraphy cannot be used to evaluate patients for conditions such as sleep apnea (Morgenthaler et al., 2007). The committee conducted a targeted literature search to identify research comparing self-reported or objectively assessed sleep-related symptoms and signs in ME/CFS subjects and in those without the illness. Details of the search methodology are described in . The findings from the literature are described below, but there are several limitations to consider when interpreting the evidence base, in addition to those discussed earlier. In general, the design and implementation of these studies was highly heterogeneous. Most articles document case-control studies in which symptoms or signs were compared in groups of subjects with and without ME/CFS. Most studies used healthy controls as a comparison group, and several compared twin pairs in which one twin was diagnosed with ME/CFS and the other was healthy. Fewer studies used controls affected by other illnesses. The studies assessed varied outcomes of interest. Self-reported symptoms were assessed with many different questionnaires and scales. Several studies used PSG, but many used different testing protocols or diagnostic thresholds for sleep disorders. As with other literature on ME/CFS, the use of different diagnostic criteria for patient selection limits comparisons across studies. In particular, because of the variations in diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, some studies excluded patients with primary sleep disorders, while others included them. The following subsections describe in turn the evidence for primary sleep disorders in patients with ME/CFS and the evidence for sleep abnormalities in patients with ME/CFS that do not have primary sleep disorders. Note that for many studies, it was unclear whether ME/CFS patients with sleep disorders were included or excluded; these studies are not discussed below. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Many of the sleep-related symptoms reported by ME/CFS patients—difficulty falling asleep, frequent or sustained awakenings, early-morning awakenings, and nonrestorative or unrefreshing sleep (persistent sleepiness despite sleep of adequate duration)—are types of insomnia (Kasper et al., 2005; Watson et al., 2003). Insomnia can have many causes, including other sleep disorders, such as sensory motor disorders (restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder), narcolepsy, and sleep disordered breathing (SDB). SDB constitutes a spectrum of breathing problems during sleep that range from subtle changes in the pattern of breathing to more severe snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. These disorders may result in multiple arousals during sleep, which can produce the daytime symptoms of sleepiness or fatigue (Cowan et al., 2014). Primary sleep disorders are fairly common in ME/CFS patients, with prevalence ranging from 19 to 69 percent (Creti et al., 2010; Gotts et al., 2013; Le Bon et al., 2000; Reeves et al., 2006). Studies have found sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome to be present in 13 to 65 percent of patients, followed by periodic limb movement disorder (4 to 25 percent), narcolepsy (5 to 7 percent), and restless leg syndrome (4 percent) (Creti et al., 2010; Gotts et al., 2013; Le Bon et al., 2000; Reeves et al., 2006). Effective treatments are available for many of these sleep disorders, but there is little evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing the sleep-related symptoms of ME/CFS aside from those caused by the sleep disorder. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a common treatment for SDB, and while it has been shown to reduce fatigue and sleepiness in people with obstructive sleep apnea (Tomfohr et al., 2011), reports of its improving ME/CFS symptoms are limited (Qanneta, 2014). One study of CPAP treatment in ME/CFS patients with sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), a condition within the spectrum of SDB, found no difference in sleep-related symptoms between patients who were and were not compliant with the CPAP treatment. Further, there were no significant differences in symptoms, quality of life, or activity levels between ME/CFS patients with and without SAHS (Libman et al., 2009). One inference from these few studies is that sleep disorders can be considered an exclusionary diagnosis for ME/CFS only if treatment of the sleep disorder cures the ME/CFS symptoms. Some researchers have suggested that sleep disorders should be considered comorbid conditions rather than exclusionary criteria for a diagnosis of ME/CFS (Jackson and Bruck, 2012; Libman et al., 2009). Studies comparing clinical presentation in ME/CFS patients with and without sleep disorders have found no differences between the two groups (Le Bon et al., 2000; Libman et al., 2009), ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. but greater functional impairment has been reported in ME/CFS patients with some sleep disorders (Morriss et al., 1993). Studies that included ME/CFS patients with sleep disorders have found other objective abnormalities during sleep studies. One study found mean sleep latency to be greater in ME/CFS patients than in healthy controls (Bailes et al., 2006). Another found that ME/CFS patients spent less total time than controls in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (Whelton et al., 1992). And in another study, ME/CFS patients compared with controls experienced significantly lower sleep efficiency—the ratio between sleep time and total recording time—and significantly more time awake after falling asleep (Morriss et al., 1993); these results have been replicated (Togo et al., 2008). The studies described below excluded ME/CFS subjects that had previously been diagnosed with a sleep disorder. The authors of most of these studies explicitly describe their exclusion criteria, but studies also are included below if they selected participants that fulfilled the Fukuda definition for CFS, because sleep apnea and narcolepsy are exclusionary conditions. The selection criteria also may have differed in other ways (e.g., medication status), and the study designs (e.g., the type of control group) may have varied as well. Most of these studies found that ME/CFS patients without sleep disorders reported significantly more subjective sleep complaints than controls, but as described later, many failed to find major differences in objective measures of sleep (Majer et al., 2007; Reeves et al., 2006; Watson et al., 2004). More ME/CFS patients than controls reported unrefreshing sleep (Majer et al., 2007; Reeves et al., 2006) and problems sleeping (Majer et al., 2007). Self-reported sleep quality was significantly worse in ME/CFS patients than in healthy controls as measured by the PSQI (Le Bon et al., 2012; Neu et al., 2007, 2011; Rahman et al., 2011) and other questionnaires (Majer et al., 2007; Watson et al., 2004). PSQI sleep quality scores, however, were not associated with objective measures of sleep quality (Neu et al., 2007). ME/CFS patients also reported significantly more fatigue and sleepiness than healthy controls (Le Bon et al., 2012). A number of studies have compared sleep parameters measured through PSG in ME/CFS patients and healthy controls; however, comparisons across studies are difficult to make because of the use of various case definitions and methods of measurement. One study examined pairs of twins in which one twin had ME/CFS and the other was healthy. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Compared with the healthy twins, the twins with ME/CFS reported more subjective complaints of insomnia, but objective measures of sleep were “remarkably similar” (Watson et al., 2003). Other studies generally have found only minor objective differences between ME/CFS patients and suitable comparison groups (Armitage et al., 2009; Majer et al., 2007; Neu et al., 2007; Reeves et al., 2006) or differences that were not statistically significant (Ball et al., 2004; Le Bon et al., 2007; Sharpley et al., 1997). These studies found that ME/CFS patients had decreased total sleep time, resulting in decreased sleep efficiency and less time spent in deep sleep, with some evidence for disturbed sleep in the form of more arousals and longer periods of being awake after sleep onset. There is growing evidence that ME/CFS patients experience abnormal sleep continuation compared with healthy controls. In one study, ME/CFS patients had higher levels of microarousal, despite the study’s exclusion of sleep disorders normally associated with microarousals (Neu et al., 2008). A study of sleep transitions also found that ME/CFS patients were more likely than normal controls to awaken during sleep, especially during the later hours of sleep (Kishi et al., 2008). The use of stratification strategies may help. One study stratified on sleep latency and sleep time to propose different sleep phenotypes (Gotts et al., 2013). Another stratified patients according to whether they felt more or less sleepy the morning after versus the night before the sleep study (Togo et al., 2008). The patients who reported feeling less sleepy had normal PSG, while those who reported feeling more sleepy showed evidence of more disrupted sleep. Also, in a follow-up study conducted after subjects had performed a stress test, patients who reported being less sleepy after a night of sleep had normal PSG, while those who reported feeling more sleepy were the group with sleep disruption (Togo et al., 2010). Multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) may be used to measure objective daytime sleepiness, which is characteristic of narcolepsy. Subjects are asked to nap, and the time it takes them to fall asleep—latency to nap—is measured several times during the day and averaged to determine a mean sleep latency for naps (Johns, 2000). A shortened latency to nap is indicative of increased sleepiness. One group of researchers found shortened latency to nap in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls (Neu et al., 2008; Watson et al., 2004), while others have failed to find significant differences (Majer et al., 2007; Reeves et al., 2006). The results of these studies suggest that narcolepsy is not a significant factor in ME/CFS. Supporting that conclusion is one study reporting an opposite result after a night of sleep deprivation. While one would expect this manipulation to result in short sleep latencies, the researchers found that one-third of the patients had difficulty falling asleep (Nakamura et al., 2010b). Such an outcome is consistent with the idea that the sleep disruption of some ME/CFS patients may reflect ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. a problem with sleep initiation and maintenance. It is important to note that MSLT can be used reliably to diagnose narcolepsy only when patients are in a stable state off potentially sedating medications (Thorpy, 1992). To study more homogeneous groups of patients, some researchers have examined sleep characteristics in different subgroups of ME/CFS patients. As an example, ME/CFS patients who also had postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) were found to have reduced daytime hypersomnolence compared with those without POTS (Lewis et al., 2013). Chronic pain is a common factor in sleep disorders resulting from a medical condition (Fishbain et al., 2010). A frequent cause of chronic widespread pain is fibromyalgia (FM)—a diagnosis that has substantial overlap with ME/CFS (Ciccone and Natelson, 2003). Several studies have compared evidence in ME/CFS patients with FM (CFS+FM) and those without FM (CFS only). In one study, FM was less frequent among ME/CFS patients with objective sleepiness as measured by short MSLT (< 10 minutes) (Le Bon et al., 2000). Some studies have found no differences in sleep parameters as measured through PSG between CFS+FM and CFS-only patients (Fischler et al., 1997; Spitzer and Broadman, 2010a,b). A study examining sleep-stage dynamics found differences between CFS+FM and CFS-only groups in transition probabilities and rates among sleep stages (Kishi et al., 2011). In CFS-only patients, the probability of transition from REM sleep to awake was significantly greater than in healthy controls. CFS+FM patients experienced significantly greater probabilities and rates of transition from waking, REM sleep, and S1 to S2, as well as greater probabilities and rates of transition from slow wave sleep (SWS) to waking and S1. Thus, CFS-only patients differed from those with CFS+FM. Another study found evidence of increased IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that may contribute to disrupted sleep, during the sleep of CFS-only but not CFS+FM patients (Nakamura et al., 2010a); however, the magnitude of the difference was small. The role of cytokines in regulating sleep in ME/CFS remains a research question. Standard sleep studies are not substantially abnormal in people with ME/CFS. Several studies have found differences in sleep architecture in subsets of people with ME/CFS and in people with ME/CFS compared with healthy controls (Whelton et al., 1992), yet the current evidence base is not Fischler and colleagues (1997) did not exclude sleep disorders. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. strong enough to identify ME/CFS-specific sleep pathology. It is clear, however, that people with ME/CFS universally report experiencing unrefreshing sleep, and further research will be important to determine whether there is a specific sleep abnormality common to ME/CFS patients or a heterogeneity of abnormalities that may define subsets of ME/CFS patients. In several case definitions and diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, primary treatable sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy are listed as exclusionary criteria for an ME/CFS diagnosis. However, there is evidence to suggest that primary sleep disorders should be considered important comorbid conditions in the differential diagnosis and that sleep complaints are complex. Further, there is little evidence that treatment of primary sleep disorders improves ME/CFS symptoms rather than simply reduces symptoms of the comorbid disorder. Despite the absence of an objective alteration in sleep architecture, the data are strong that the complaint of unrefreshing sleep is universal among patients with ME/CFS when questions about sleep specifically address this issue. While PSG is not required to diagnose ME/CFS, its use to screen for treatable sleep disorders when indicated is appropriate. Diagnosis of a primary sleep disorder does not rule out a diagnosis of ME/CFS. Description of Neurocognitive Manifestations in ME/CFS Impairments in cognitive functioning are one of the most frequently reported symptoms of ME/CFS. Patients describe these symptoms as debilitating and as affecting function as much as the physical symptoms that accompany this disease. During a survey of ME/CFS patients, descriptions of neurocognitive manifestations included, among others, “brain fog,” “confusion,” disorientation,” “hard to concentrate, can’t focus,” “inability to process information,” “inability to multitask,” and “short-term memory loss” (FDA, 2013). The short-term memory problems of ME/CFS patients include difficulty remembering something they just read. Patients usually report slowed information processing and impaired psychomotor functioning in more general terms as overall mental fatigue or slowed thinking (Constant et al., 2011; Larun and Malterud, 2007). In more severe cases, patients have difficulty completing tasks that require sustained attention and report problems performing even relatively simple activities such as watching television (FDA, 2013). Studies of the exact nature of neurocognitive deficits reported by patients with ME/CFS have shown that some patients meeting various current criteria for ME/CFS have different or ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. more severe impairments than others, but also that self-reported severity of impairments is not always associated with severity based on objective measures (Cockshell and Mathias, 2013). Prevalence of Neurocognitive Manifestations in ME/CFS Patients Estimates of the prevalence of neurocognitive manifestations in ME/CFS patients vary as a result of the different definitions used in research and the assessment of these manifestations using patient reports. The 2003 CCC, 2010 Revised CCC, and 2011 ME-ICC require the presence of neurological/cognitive manifestations for a diagnosis of ME/CFS, while the 1994 Fukuda definition and 2007 British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guidelines do not. Moreover, these various case definitions and diagnostic criteria are inconsistent in the manifestations or symptoms listed for this category. For instance, the Fukuda definition includes only “impaired memory or concentration” as one optional criterion, while the CCC requires the presence of two or more difficulties from a more extensive list of cognitive (confusion, impairment of concentration and short-term memory consolidation, disorientation, difficulty with information processing) or neurologic (perceptual and sensory disturbances, ataxia, muscle weakness, and fasciculations) manifestations. A study conducted in Belgium in a population of patients with chronic fatigue found a prevalence of 93 percent for attention deficit, 85.6 percent for memory disturbance, and 75.5 percent for difficulties with words for those fulfilling the Fukuda definition (De Becker et al., 2001). When applying frequency and severity scores of at least 2, Jason and colleagues (2013b) found that a greater percentage of ME/CFS patients than healthy controls reported neurocognitive symptoms of at least moderate severity that occurred at least half of the time (see ). Assessment of Neurocognitive Manifestations in ME/CFS Measurement of cognitive functioning is a challenge for researchers. While theoretical distinctions often are made among areas of cognition, such as memory, attention, and motor functioning, there presently are no “pure” measures that can directly test different areas of cognition individually rather than in the aggregate. Thus, while results of a specific neuropsychological test may be interpreted as evidence of a particular cognitive deficit, such as poor working memory, it is likely that any given test is actually measuring multiple aspects of cognitive function simultaneously. Additionally, an important distinction must be made between objective measures of cognitive deficits, which measure participants’ performance on cognitively demanding tasks, and subjective measures of cognitive func- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations.""

NOTE: All patients fulfilled the Fukuda definition for CFS. SOURCE: Jason et al., 2013b. tioning that ask individuals to report cognitive difficulties they encounter in their daily lives. Both objective and subjective measures are important in understanding ME/CFS, but in the following discussion of evidence on the neurocognitive characteristics of ME/CFS, the committee has chosen to focus primarily on objective tests that may provide some indication of the cognitive processes and possible causal mechanisms involved in ME/CFS. It is worth noting, however, that from the clinical perspective, neuropsychological testing has shown significant overlap between ME/CFS and control populations, and that self-report of cognitive issues offers a more reliable means of discriminating between these two groups (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). Most studies focused on memory impairments test patients’ working memory (the ability to retain and make use of information in the short term) as measured by a range of neuropsychological tests. Researchers also divide memory tasks into various categories based on whether a task requires immediate (also related to working memory), short-term, or long-term memory; remembering something that has already happened (retrospective memory); or remembering to do something in the future (prospective memory). Tasks are divided as well by the type of content that is recalled (verbal or visual memory) (Attree et al., 2014; DeLuca et ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. al., 1995). Subjective measures used for memory testing include a range of different assessments, such as the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire, the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, or self-observation using a structured diary (Attree et al., 2014; Knoop et al., 2007). A meta-analysis of studies of cognitive functioning by Cockshell and Mathias (2010) found that the majority of objective tests used to assess memory function in ME/CFS asked participants to remember either verbal or written word lists, while some tested visual memory by having participants reproduce a complex figure from memory or remember visual patterns. Examples of verbal tests reported in the meta-analysis include the Selective Reminding Test, the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), and the California Verbal Learning Test. Tests of visual memory reviewed included, among others, the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure and the Pattern Recognition Test. Some tests included both verbal and visual components and fell in both categories. In addition, researchers use the n-back procedure to investigate the neurologic substrates of the working memory processes. The n-back task is a continuous performance measure whereby the subject is presented with stimulus sequences (i.e., visual, auditory, and olfactory) and is required to indicate when the current stimulus matches the one presented in “n” trials previously. This task requires the subject to maintain, update, and manipulate information and therefore is considered a demanding task. The n usually varies from 1 to 3. The responses of the n-back task can be correlated with neuroimaging reports of the activation of several brain regions (Owen et al., 2005). In the neuropsychological literature, attempts are made to distinguish between information processing speed (as measured by reaction time) and motor speed (movement time or tests of fine motor speed [e.g., finger tapping test]). Recent studies assessing psychomotor functioning in ME/CFS have separated these components, but together these tests evaluate reaction time as part of the motor component (Schrijvers et al., 2009; Van Den Eede et al., 2011). The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), the Attention Network Test (ANT), the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), and similar measures or testing batteries are used to assess attention deficits and reaction times. Reaction times on these tests frequently are used to judge information processing speed independent of motor speed (Majer et al., 2008; Michiels and Cluydts, 2001). Impairment in psychomotor functioning is demonstrated by both increased simple reaction time, in which subjects respond to a verbal or visual stimulus, and choice reaction time, which measures length of time responding to a stimulus involving multiple potential options (Den Eede et al., 2011). The PASAT and ANT can additionally be used to assess slowed information processing (Davis and Claypoole, 1997; Togo et al., 2013).

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Evidence for Neurocognitive Manifestations in ME/CFS The committee conducted a targeted literature search to identify research papers comparing the presence of neurocognitive manifestations in ME/CFS cases versus controls. The researchers assessed presentation of neurocognitive impairments either by self-report questionnaires or by objective testing using neurocognitive test batteries. The committee’s targeted search was limited to the past 10 years because of the large number of results but considered older research that was reviewed and cited in the introduction or discussion of more recent literature. The approach the committee used to review the literature is described in . The findings of the targeted literature review are presented below, with the caveats regarding the research base described at the beginning of this chapter. The literature shows with some consistency that neurocognitive problems such as memory impairment, slowed information processing, attention deficits, and impaired psychomotor function are highly prevalent in ME/CFS patients, as discussed in this section. Slowed information processing is the neurocognitive symptom of ME/CFS most consistently reported in objective neuropsychological testing, with evidence from twin studies showing that individuals with ME/CFS tend to process information more slowly than healthy individuals with similar intellectual abilities (Claypoole et al., 2007; Mahurin et al., 2004; Togo et al., 2013). Numerous papers both support and refute the existence of memory impairment in individuals with ME/CFS. Studies that do report impairment show a wide range in the measured severity of memory problems, with small to moderate and significant deficits in memory having been found for a range of cognitive tests, but not all (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; Constant et al., 2011; Dickson et al., 2009; Majer et al., 2008). A large number of studies also have found impaired attention (Capuron et al., 2006; Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; Constant et al., 2011; Dickson et al., 2009; Hou et al., 2008, 2014; Hutchinson and Badham, 2013) and slowed reaction and movement times in people with ME/CFS (Den Eede et al., 2011; Majer et al., 2008; Schrijvers et al., 2009). Comparisons with other illnesses, such as sleep apnea and depression, suggest that psychomotor impairment in ME/CFS may be less severe than in those other illnesses (Neu et al., 2011; Schrijvers et al., 2009). In objective neuropsychological testing, individuals meeting criteria for ME/CFS have displayed deficits in working memory compared with healthy controls. These patients have been found to be impaired on tests that assess working memory over a sustained period of time (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; DeLuca et al., 2004b). Attree and colleagues (2009) found ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. that ME/CFS patients rated themselves as more forgetful than controls on both prospective and retrospective memory. However, objective memory impairment was limited to retrospective not prospective memory in these patients. Michiels and colleagues (1996) found that reduced verbal and visual memory was the most consistent finding in individuals with ME/CFS compared with normal controls. With regard to verbal memory, moderate to large deficits were found on tests of list learning, including immediate recall, delayed recall, and recognition, while nonverbal memory for complex figures and spatial location was not impaired (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). Numerous studies provide evidence that verbal memory impairment (often measured using the California Verbal Learning Test) likely is associated with ME/CFS (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). However, because of the methodological weaknesses in much ME/CFS research, particularly the comparison of mean scores on neuropsychological tests rather than reporting of the number of impaired individuals, it is difficult to determine whether this impairment is characteristic of the illness or present only in a subset of patients (Vercoulen et al., 1998). ME/CFS patients compared with controls perform significantly worse on free-recall retrospective memory. Research findings offer some support for the deficient acquisition hypothesis, which proposes that retrospective memory deficits in ME/CFS patients are attributable to difficulties with encoding information due to slower information processing (impaired delayed recall) (Attree et al., 2009). This interpretation appears to be supported by findings that the verbal memory problems of these patients stem from delayed acquisition of information rather than inaccuracy in recall (DeLuca et al., 2004a). Furthermore, in studies of working memory, researchers have found that difficulties emerge only when ME/CFS subjects are required to perform time-dependent tasks (DeLuca et al., 2004a; Togo et al., 2013), implying that ME/CFS patients’ cognitive processes may be slower than but not otherwise different from those of healthy control patients. Memory impairment does appear to distinguish ME/CFS from such psychiatric disorders as depression and anxiety. The majority of studies examining severity of cognitive impairment, including memory problems, failed to find a relationship between such impairment and depression, even though ME/CFS patients have high rates of depression (Busichio et al., 2004; DeLuca et al., 1995; Short et al., 2002). In studies that divided ME/CFS patients according to whether they had a comorbid psychiatric condition, those without such a comorbidity showed more severe memory impairment (DeLuca et al., 2004b; Tiersky et al., 2003). It is less clear whether memory impairment may distinguish ME/CFS from other fatiguing illnesses. However, mental fatigue is an important correlate of working memory in ME/CFS patients, with a population-based sample of these patients showing a clear association between subjec- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. tive complaints of mental fatigue and objective measurements of memory (Capuron et al., 2006). Patients with ME/CFS who specifically reported mental fatigue were found to show significant impairment of working memory in the task of sustained attention/vigilance (a spatial working memory task of the CANTAB), suggesting higher cognitive fatigability (Capuron et al., 2006). Cognitive impairment in ME/CFS patients with mental fatigue was not attributable to mood disorders or psychotropic medication (Capuron et al., 2006). Slowed information processing appears to be one of the most easily distinguishable features of ME/CFS (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010, 2013; Michiels and Cluydts, 2001; Tiersky et al., 1997). Despite some contradictory evidence, a large number of papers have emerged supporting the idea that individuals with ME/CFS often display slowed information processing (Claypoole et al., 2007; DeLuca et al., 2004a; Togo et al., 2013). Positive evidence is provided by twin-control studies in which individuals with ME/CFS were compared with their twins who did not have the illness. These studies frequently revealed similar premorbid intellectual functioning (Claypoole et al., 2007; Mahurin et al., 2004) and no differences in content-dependent untimed testing, but significant differences in time-dependent tasks (Mahurin et al., 2004). Multiple studies have found that individuals with ME/CFS perform poorly compared with controls only in time-dependent tasks, with ME/CFS subjects showing no impairment in accuracy of information processing when given as much time as necessary to complete a task (DeLuca et al., 2004a; Mahurin et al., 2004). Also, in a meta-analysis of research studies, measures of both simple (reaction time task) and complex (PASAT) information processing speed showed moderate to large significant impairments in persons with ME/CFS compared with healthy controls (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). As with memory impairment, ME/CFS patients without psychiatric comorbidity show greater delays in information processing. Moreover, some evidence suggests that slower information processing is not related to reduced effort, depression, anxiety, fatigue, or sleep problems, nor is it dependent on slowed motor functioning, psychological status, number or severity of ME/CFS symptoms, or overall functioning (Cockshell and Mathias, 2012, 2013). Researchers in the field consider this symptom to be a possible cause of other neurocognitive impairments, including difficulties with attention and memory (DeLuca et al., 2004a; Togo et al., 2013). For that reason, it may be useful to compare ME/CFS patients with this symptom with other control groups (e.g., besides those with depression), as slowed information processing speed has also been identified in other ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. clinical groups, such as patients with multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury (DeLuca and Kalmar, 2008). Considerable evidence shows that reduced attention is associated with ME/CFS (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; Constant et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2014), although some research indicates that attentional deficits may be due to reduced information processing speed (Cockshell and Mathias, 2013). Cognition has been found to be weaker among patients with ME/CFS, who demonstrated an impaired ability to maintain attention and alertness (Constant et al., 2011). Several studies also have shown impairments in executive attention relative to healthy controls, with ME/CFS patients demonstrating greater difficulty concentrating on a particular element when confronted with potential distractions (Hou et al., 2014; Hutchinson and Badham, 2013). Some studies have confirmed the presence of objective impairments of attention in patients with ME/CFS compared with controls (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; Hou et al., 2014). Differences have remained after patients showing low effort have been removed, suggesting that the differences cannot be explained by lack of effort (Constant et al., 2011). Some studies have demonstrated that ME/CFS patients display greater attentional bias toward linguistic and pictorial health-related threat stimuli (i.e., any factor that represents a danger to one’s health) (Hou et al., 2008, 2014). Other studies have failed to find attentional bias but have found greater mood volatility with rumination (Martin and Alexeeva, 2010), suggesting variability in the ability of ME/CFS patients to control and sustain attention. It is unclear whether this symptom can be used to distinguish ME/CFS from other disorders. Doing so would be difficult given that depression and anxiety can cause similar problems with attention (Moffoot et al., 1994) and have high comorbidity with ME/CFS (Attree et al., 2014). However, executive attention may be an option for distinguishing among subsets of the ME/CFS population, given some evidence of variability of this symptom in people with the illness (Hou et al., 2014). Studies of executive attention in children have shown that changes in the surface area of the anterior cingulate cortex account for a significant proportion of the variance in functioning on a test of cognitive control, suggesting that structural differences in this region of the brain could be a biomarker of conditions such as ME/CFS (Fjell et al., 2012). Deficits in patients may lead to poor activation or reduced connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex. Exploring this possibility could further the effort to identify biomarkers of the disorder. More research comparing attentional deficits in fatiguing disorders and psychiatric conditions is necessary for this question to be answered. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. The literature offers conflicting evidence for the presence of impaired psychomotor function in ME/CFS patients. Some studies have found no difference in motor coordination and motor speed between ME/CFS patients and controls (reaction time test) (Cockshell and Mathias, 2013). Moreover, a meta-analysis found that fine motor speed was not impaired in subjects with ME/CFS (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). However, there are significant differences in the movement time of reaction time tests between people with ME/CFS and healthy controls (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). These findings suggest that information processing deficits contributed to the noted deficits in the movement time of reaction time tasks, which reportedly are not pure measures of motor speed (Smith and Carew, 1987; Vercoulen et al., 1998). Moreover, because fine motor speed was not found to be impaired in persons with ME/CFS, motor functioning is unlikely to be the primary cause of slower reaction times. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of more recent studies previously mentioned (Schrijvers et al., 2009; Van Den Eede et al., 2011) that reaction time but not movement time was impaired in ME/CFS patients. On the other hand, considerable evidence that this symptom is associated with ME/CFS has been published (Davey et al., 2001; Lawrie et al., 2000; Marshall et al., 1997; Michiels et al., 1996). Results from a population-based study confirm and quantify alterations in motor speed in ME/CFS patients that are independent of psychiatric disorders or medication usage (Majer et al., 2008). In this study, ME/CFS patients recruited from the general population presented motor slowing after the researchers controlled for level of depressive symptoms. ME/CFS subjects also exhibited decreased motor speed, demonstrated by slower response times on the movement component of simple and choice reaction time tasks, a finding suggesting that these are primary features of cognitive changes in ME/CFS patients. The consistency of these results may provide clues to the involvement of neural circuits (i.e., basal ganglia) in ME/CFS. Further evidence of slowed psychomotor functioning is provided by twin-control studies in which individuals with ME/CFS were compared with their twins who did not have the illness (Claypoole et al., 2007; Mahurin et al., 2004). Studies of the brain in relation to ME/CFS have been performed for two purposes: to document any possible objective finding in ME/CFS and to develop diagnostic criteria for the disease. While in general these studies have been small (most with fewer than 20 patients with ME/CFS, usually fulfilling the Fukuda definition), most have shown statistically significant differ- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. ences between patients with the condition and controls using a wide range of technologies and in a variety of brain regions. One study found that ME/CFS patients had 8 percent less gray matter relative to healthy controls, and that this difference was correlated with lower levels of physical activity (De Lange et al., 2005). Puri and colleagues (2012) found similar losses of both white and gray matter in patients with ME/CFS. Another study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy for ME/CFS patients increased prefrontal cortical volume after 16 sessions, suggesting that changes in brain volume and structure associated with the illness may be reversible with treatment (De Lange et al., 2008). However, the authors do not indicate whether such changes cause or result from neurocognitive symptoms of ME/CFS. Recently, Nakatomi and colleagues (2014) found evidence of neuroinflammation in a small group of ME/CFS patients. While this was a small study (patients = 9, healthy controls = 10), it showed a significant increase in activated microglia or astrocytes using positron emission tomography (PET) in patients compared with controls. This study also found a positive correlation between activated microglia or astrocytes in the amygdala, thalamus, and midbrain and the cognitive impairment score of these subjects. The involvement of microglia could point to connectivity issues similar to those proposed with respect to the role of the anterior cingulate in maintaining attention. Spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed midbrain white matter and gray matter volume changes in these patients at fatigue onset, which the authors found to be consistent with an insult to the midbrain affecting multiple feedback control loops (Barnden et al., 2011). In other brain studies, Yamamoto and colleagues (2003) used PET scanning to show that serotonin transporters were significantly reduced in the rostral subdivision of the anterior cingulate in ME/CFS patients. Functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to show an association between the subjective feeling of mental fatigue and brain responses during fatiguing cognition (Cook et al., 2007); reduced basal ganglia activation (caudate and globus pallidus) also may contribute to fatigue (Unger et al., 2012). Murrough and colleagues (2010) found increased ventricular lactate in ME/CFS patients based on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imaging. The same group later found further evidence that increased oxidative stress may play a role in ME/CFS pathophysiology (Shungu et al., 2012). In another study, ME/CFS patients who were not medicated were reliably differentiated from healthy controls and those with depression using EEG spectral coherence (Duffy et al., 2011). Some studies have found reduced activity in ME/CFS patients in regions of the brain associated with working memory during completion of a working memory task (Caseras et al., 2006), while others have found that individuals with ME/CFS appear to use more of their brain during working memory tasks (Lange et al., 2005). In addition, increased activation ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. has been seen by fMRI in ME/CFS patients in the occipito-parietal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus, with decreased activation seen in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices (Caseras et al., 2008). Findings suggest that ME/CFS patients require additional neural resources (more activation) to achieve the same level of behavioral performance as controls on the PASAT and other neuropsychological tests (Cook et al., 2007; Schmaling et al., 2003). During high-demand tasks, ME/CFS patients showed reduced activation in dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, showing differences only at the neurophysiological level. ME/CFS patients activated a large cluster in the right inferior/medial temporal cortex while undergoing 3-back condition testing—probably a compensatory strategy when working memory is dysfunctional or saturated as a result of ME/CFS (Caseras et al., 2006). Results are similar to those found in sleep-deprived healthy adults, so these findings could also be the consequence of sleep deprivation in ME/CFS patients (Caseras et al., 2006). These objective findings based on multiple technologies support the concept that ME/CFS patients, at least those meeting Fukuda definition, have objective brain differences from healthy controls. However, the varying locations of these findings make insights into etiology and possible treatments less clear, and subsets of patients have not yet been defined. Exacerbation of Cognitive Symptoms Following Exertion Evidence on the effect of exertion on cognitive function was provided earlier in the section on PEM. Collectively, the studies reviewed here support the notion that ME/CFS patients present with neurocognitive impairment. Slowed information processing, demonstrated by objective neuropsychological testing and potentially related to problems with white matter integrity, is one of the strongest neurocognitive indicators in support of a diagnosis of ME/CFS, particularly if there is evidence of normal functioning on untimed tests and impaired functioning on time-dependent tasks. The greater severity of memory and other neurocognitive deficits in ME/CFS patients without psychiatric comorbidity suggests that these deficits may be a distinguishing feature of the disease, or at the very least a means of defining subgroups within the ME/CFS population. Confirming the presence of this symptom using objective neuropsychological testing would support diagnosis of ME/CFS and possibly support diagnosis of a specific subset of ME/CFS patients, but it is not necessary for the diagnosis. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. The presence of attention deficits or impaired psychomotor function could support diagnosis of ME/CFS or potentially a subset of the ME/CFS population, but only in combination with other neurocognitive impairments. There is sufficient evidence that slowed information processing is common in patients with ME/CFS, and a growing body of evidence shows that it may play a central role in overall neurocognitive impairment associated with the disease. Such a deficit may be responsible for the disability that results in loss of employment and loss of functional capacity in social environments. Orthostatic intolerance is defined as a clinical condition in which symptoms worsen upon assuming and maintaining upright posture and are ameliorated (although not necessarily abolished) by recumbency (Gerrity et al., 2002; Low et al., 2009). Symptoms in orthostatic intolerance syndromes are those caused primarily by (1) cerebral underperfusion (such as lightheadedness, near-syncope or syncope, impaired concentration, headaches, and dimming or blurring of vision), or (2) sympathetic nervous system activation (such as forceful beating of the heart, palpitations, tremulousness, and chest pain) (Low et al., 2009). Other common signs and symptoms of orthostatic intolerance are fatigue, a feeling of weakness, intolerance of low-impact exercise, nausea, abdominal pain, facial pallor, nervousness, and shortness of breath (Kanjwal et al., 2003; Legge et al., 2008; Raj, 2013). Orthostatic intolerance can occur as an isolated syndrome or in association with a variety of other comorbid disorders, including ME/CFS (Benarroch, 2012). The most prevalent forms of orthostatic intolerance in the general population, as well as among those with ME/CFS, are POTS and neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), with delayed variants of orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia also being seen. Some individuals simply have low tolerance for upright posture without evidence of these objective circulatory changes (Bush et al., 2000; Rowe and Calkins, 1998). Symptoms that occur upon assuming or maintaining upright posture are among the most commonly reported clinical features of ME/CFS. In surveys of ME/CFS patients, along with dizziness, a drop in blood pressure, spatial disorientation, and fainting, many participants “reported an inability to stand for even a few minutes” (FDA, 2013, p. 7). Some indi- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. viduals described to the committee having difficulty standing, eating, and showering. Orthostatic symptoms also are a component of PEM: “[A crash is] not just the physical pain or it’s not just the head pain, it’s also more cognitive impairment, more orthostatic intolerance, more neurological issues … they’re very interrelated” (FDA, 2013, p. 8) (see the earlier section on PEM for more detail). The symptoms and triggers for orthostatic intolerance syndromes are similar regardless of the associated diagnoses, although severity typically is greater in those with ME/CFS and POTS than in those with POTS alone (Okamoto et al., 2012a; Stewart et al., 1999). Orthostatic intolerance can begin acutely following a viral illness (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997), other infections (Kanjwal et al., 2011), pregnancy, or trauma, or it can have an insidious onset (Raj, 2013). It is made worse by deconditioning (Parsaik et al., 2012). Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance often are exacerbated by prolonged periods of upright posture; low-impact exercise; exposure to warm environments; and, less commonly, meals. Circumstances in daily life that can act as triggers include standing in line, shopping, hot showers or baths, hot weather, overheated rooms, and even prolonged quiet sitting (Raj, 2013; Schondorf et al., 1999). Some patients with orthostatic intolerance feel somewhat better and more energized while exercising, but they often are much worse afterward, especially if they are standing in the “cool-down” period (Calkins et al., 1995). Women with orthostatic intolerance can have worse symptoms during their menstrual periods (Low et al., 2009). Prevalence of Orthostatic Intolerance and Autonomic Dysfunction in ME/CFS Patients The committee’s literature review identified six research articles in which orthostatic and autonomic symptoms are reported. The prevalence of orthostatic symptoms in ME/CFS varies widely in these publications, but in all of them is higher in ME/CFS subjects than in controls (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; Miwa, 2014; Newton et al., 2007; Poole et al., 2000; Soetekouw et al., 1999; Timmers et al., 2002). The study by Bou-Holaigah and colleagues (1995) included 23 U.S. adolescents and adults with ME/CFS, 96 percent of whom reported lightheadedness, 96 percent nausea, 83 percent diaphoresis, 78 percent abdominal discomfort, 78 percent blurred vision, and 43 percent prior syncope. Orthostatic stresses reported as exacerbating fatigue included a hot shower (78 percent), prolonged standing (78 percent), a warm environment (74 percent), and episodes of lightheadedness (43 percent).

Those with ME/CFS had significantly higher rates of increased perspiration (57 percent versus 13 percent), decreased salivation (24 percent versus 3 percent), dysphagia (24 percent versus 0 percent), and constipation (22 percent versus 3 percent). Poole and colleagues (2000) evaluated 21 monozygotic twins discordant for CFS. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in the week before head-up tilt testing were graded on a 0 (none) to 5 (severe) scale. The CFS twins had significantly more severe dizziness (1.4 versus 0), lightheadedness (1.4 versus 0.3), nausea (0.6 versus 0), abdominal discomfort (0.7 versus 0.3), sweating (1.3 versus 0.4), chest pain (0.7 versus 0.3), and shortness of breath (0.8 versus 0.2). In a study of 36 Dutch adults with ME/CFS and 36 healthy controls, 28 percent of ME/CFS adults but no controls reported symptoms related to or avoidance of prolonged standing (Timmers et al., 2002). Newton and colleagues (2007) examined autonomic symptoms as measured by the detailed Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS) questionnaire in 40 British adults with ME/CFS and 40 controls. The ME/CFS adults had significantly higher scores on domains assessing orthostatic tolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, gastrointestinal, pupillomotor, and sleep problems, as well as higher total scores (mean [standard deviation] score 43.7 [16.6] versus 12.1 [10.2]; p < 0.0001). Finally, among 40 Japanese adults with ME/CFS, 28 (70 percent) reported symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, defined as the following symptoms while standing: disabling fatigue, dizziness, diminished concentration, tremulousness, sweating, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, palpitations, and nausea (Miwa, 2014). The above variability in symptom reporting is related in part to the methods and comprehensiveness of the ascertainment for orthostatic intolerance, but also to temporal changes. While some older studies refer to autonomic and circulatory abnormalities in those with neuromyasthenia (MacLean et al., 1944), papers drawing attention to orthostatic intolerance in ME/CFS did not appear until 1995 (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; Rowe et al., 1995), the year after the Fukuda definition was published. As an example of the temporal changes in reporting, in a summary of clinical experience, Komaroff and Buchwald (1991) estimated that dizziness was present in 30-50 percent of patients. In a study published a decade later, Jason and colleagues (2002b) reported dizziness in 47 percent of adults with ME/CFS, 21 percent of those with depression, and 9 percent of nonfatigued participants. And Nacul and colleagues (2011b) reported a prevalence of “intolerance to be on your feet” of 61 percent among 265 ME/CFS subjects in England. A second source of variability in prevalence reports is the way in which orthostatic intolerance are classified. In the non-ME/CFS litera- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. ture on orthostatic intolerance, symptoms of cerebral underperfusion (e.g., cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating) were attributed to the circulatory dysfunction (Low et al., 2009). In the ME/CFS literature, those problems often are reported as independent symptoms. While orthostatic stress was reported to cause worse fatigue and cognitive function in those with ME/CFS as compared with those without ME/CFS (Stewart et al., 2012; Streeten and Anderson, 1992), it is impossible to determine which component of the overall ME/CFS symptom complex is due to the circulatory disorder or to some other aspect of ME/CFS physiology. Few studies specified the postures in which people reported triggering of their ME/CFS symptoms, and few distinguished orthostatic headaches or orthostatic cognitive difficulties from general causes of these symptoms. The dilemma is illustrated by the prevalence of symptoms documented by Nacul and colleagues (2011b): 61 percent of British adult ME/CFS patients reported intolerance of being on their feet, but 94 percent also reported memory or concentration problems, 82 percent difficulty thinking, 72 percent intolerance to exercise, 66 percent sweatiness/cold hands and feet, and 65 percent headaches. How many of these other symptoms were related to orthostatic stress is impossible to discern from the paper. The Fukuda definition of CFS includes no mention of disorders in the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure in the differential diagnosis or management of ME/CFS symptoms (Fukuda et al., 1994). In the 2003 CCC, the diagnosis of ME/CFS can be made if—in addition to an illness of at least 6 months’ duration characterized by fatigue, PEM, sleep dysfunction, pain, and neurologic or cognitive manifestations—the individual also has one symptom from two of three of the following categories: autonomic manifestations, neuroendocrine manifestations, and immune manifestations. These categories are not mutually exclusive, but autonomic manifestations include the following: orthostatic intolerance, NMH, POTS, delayed postural hypotension, lightheadedness, extreme pallor, nausea and irritable bowel syndrome, urinary frequency and bladder dysfunction, palpitations with or without cardiac arrhythmias, and exertional dyspnea (Carruthers et al., 2003). In contrast, the NICE guidelines devote very little attention to circulatory dysfunction either in the differential diagnosis of fatigue as a symptom of ME/CFS or as a comorbid condition. The NICE guidelines recommend against performing a tilt table test routinely to aid in making a diagnosis of ME/CFS, but they do not comment on the potential utility of head-up tilt or standing tests for diagnosing comorbid orthostatic intolerance (NICE, 2007). The 2011 ME-ICC criteria list orthostatic intolerance as one of several qualifying abnormalities under the rubric of energy production/transportation impairments (Carruthers et al., 2011).

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Assessment of Orthostatic Intolerance and Autonomic Dysfunction in ME/CFS When querying for orthostatic intolerance, clinicians should pose questions about the frequency and severity of lightheadedness, near-fainting (presyncope), syncope, sweating, palpitations, chest pain, orthostatic dyspnea, and related symptoms when individuals are sitting or standing for prolonged periods of time. Chronic fatigue, difficulty concentrating, exercise intolerance, nausea, and tremulousness are common across a variety of forms of orthostatic intolerance. Not all individuals report lightheadedness; some simply report feeling unwell when upright and they avoid these situations. Questions with a high yield include asking how individuals feel in the following circumstances: while waiting in line, at receptions, in choir, while shopping or at the mall, while sitting still for long periods, and when exposed to warm/stressful circumstances (e.g., summer weather; after hot showers, baths, and saunas; after episodes of fear, pain, or exposure to blood) (Grubb, 2005; Raj, 2013; Thieben et al., 2007). Several questionnaires are validated for use in adults with autonomic dysfunction or orthostatic intolerance syndromes, but they have not been evaluated specifically among those with ME/CFS. They include the Orthostatic Grading Scale (OGS) (Schrezenmaier et al., 2005); the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) (Kaufmann et al., 2012); and a series of questionnaires developed at the Mayo Clinic, beginning with the 169-item Autonomic Symptom Profile (ASP) (Suarez et al., 1999), followed by the 84-question COMPASS. The COMPASS has been further abbreviated to a 31-item questionnaire (COMPASS 31) (Sletten et al., 2012). Orthostatic vital signs—measured by taking heart rate and blood pressure in supine, sitting, and standing positions—often are measured within 2 minutes or less, and thus are insufficient to identify most forms of chronic orthostatic intolerance. Prolonged testing of at least 10 minutes usually is needed for a sufficient orthostatic challenge. Two forms of prolonged orthostatic testing (standing test and upright tilt test) are commonly employed (see ). The recommended duration of upright posture for detecting POTS is 10 minutes (Raj, 2013). Although neurally mediated hypotension can occur within the first 10 minutes of upright posture, an orthostatic ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. This test can be performed in any clinic. The individual lies supine for 5 minutes to yield a steady baseline, then stands quietly, leaning against a wall, for 10 minutes. The individual is instructed to avoid moving, shifting his or her weight, or engaging in leg and other muscle contraction maneuvers. Symptoms such as fatigue, lightheadedness, nausea, warmth, shortness of breath, headache, pain, and impaired concentration/mental fogginess are recorded on a 0-10 scale while the individual is supine and every 1-2 minutes while he/she is standing. Individuals also are encouraged to report changes in symptoms as they occur. Heart rate and blood pressure recordings are made every 1-2 minutes. The test must be observed because of the potential for syncope and injury. The standing test, while helpful in some cases, is not a substitute for prolonged head-up tilt testing, and has limited ability to identify those with neurally mediated hypotension, most of whom develop hypotension beyond the 10-minute duration of a typical standing test. The head-up tilt table test requires specialized equipment. The individual lies supine on the tilt table for 5-15 minutes. The table is then brought upright, usually to 70 degrees, for 10 to 60 minutes (usually 45 minutes if the goal is to evaluate for neurally mediated hypotension). Patient movement is discouraged. Heart rate is monitored continuously, and blood pressure is measured either continuously, using beat-to-beat measurements, or every 1-2 minutes for the first 10 minutes upright and every 5 minutes thereafter. Symptom reports usually are elicited every 2 minutes for the first 10 minutes upright and every 5 minutes thereafter, and recorded whenever major changes are reported by the individual. Passive tilt testing provokes a larger heart rate change in those with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) than does active standing beyond 5 minutes of upright posture (Plash et al., 2013). During prolonged head-up tilt, a variety of pharmacological agents, including isoproterenol and nitroglycerine, are employed to provoke syncope. However, these challenges can lead to abnormal tests in some healthy individuals, so they must be interpreted with caution, as is described elsewhere (Moya et al., 2009). Moreover, head-up tilt testing is no longer thought to be necessary to diagnose all forms of neurally mediated syncope (Moya et al., 2009). stress of more than 10 minutes of upright posture more commonly is required (Benditt et al., 1991). The median time to develop hypotension among adults with ME/CFS is 30 minutes in some studies (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). Among those with ME/CFS, orthostatic symptoms during ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. tilt testing emerge within minutes, long before hemodynamic changes are documented (Razumovsky et al., 2003). Some investigators prefer to simulate orthostatic stress using lower-body negative pressure (LBNP), but these methods are used mainly in research settings (Wyller et al., 2008). Other methods used to capture physiological changes during upright tilt include transcranial Doppler ultrasound to measure cerebral blood flow velocity, capnography to measure expired CO, and near infrared spectroscopy to measure changes in cerebral tissue oxygenation (Naschitz et al., 2000; Ocon et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2002). Clinicians who evaluate those with orthostatic intolerance recognize that individuals with ME/CFS can develop an exacerbation of their typical symptoms not just during the head-up tilt test but for several days afterward. The committee’s literature search did not identify any publications describing this observation more formally, although administration of 1 liter of normal saline following the tilt test to reverse the post-tilt test exacerbation in symptoms is part of the tilt testing protocol in some centers (Rowe et al., 2001). Intravenous saline has been shown to improve orthostatic tolerance and to modify autonomic tone in those with neurally mediated syncope (Burklow et al., 1999) and after experimental prolonged bed rest (Takenaka et al., 2002). Evidence for Orthostatic Intolerance and Autonomic Abnormalities in ME/CFS This section examines the evidence for orthostatic intolerance and autonomic abnormalities in adults with ME/CFS. The methodology used for the committee’s literature review is described in . A full search for all forms of autonomic dysfunction (e.g., bladder dysfunction, gastrointestinal motility disorders) was not conducted. Instead, the committee elected to focus on circulatory abnormalities, as these are the most frequently reported autonomic abnormalities in ME/CFS. The most common forms of orthostatic intolerance are described in . Several studies reviewed were conducted by the same group of investigators. When it was not possible to ascertain from the description of the study methods whether the data were for independent study populations or some of the same patients on more than one occasion, the committee chose to select the most representative (or largest) of the studies for each group. The studies reviewed vary widely on several methodological variables, notably in the following categories: patient characteristics (age, duration of ME/CFS, severity of ME/CFS, the ME/CFS case definition used, whether subjects were selected based on autonomic symptoms, referral biases, whether ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. the testing was performed on patients seeking clinical care or those participating in a research study); preparation for the test (medications allowed, prior sodium intake, duration of pretest fast); the type of orthostatic testing (active standing, standing while leaning against a wall, head-up tilt table) and, with tilt testing, the protocol used (e.g., angle of the tilt table, time of day for the study, ambient room temperature, degree of movement permitted); criteria for abnormal response to orthostatic stress (earlier studies tended to report only rates of NMH, without reporting rates of BOX 4-3 Common Orthostatic Intolerance Syndromes POTS is defined by a heart rate increase between the supine position and 10 minutes of standing of more than 30 beats per minute (bpm) for adults or 40 bpm for adolescents, or a heart rate that reaches 120 bpm or higher over the first 10 minutes of upright posture in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. A diagnosis of POTS requires that the change in heart rate also be accompanied by characteristic orthostatic symptoms that include lightheadedness, blurred vision, headaches, difficulty concentrating, diaphoresis, nausea, palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath (Freeman et al., 2011). NMH refers to a reflex drop in blood pressure that occurs during upright posture, and is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of 25 mm Hg (compared with supine blood pressure) during standing or upright tilt table testing. It usually is preceded by orthostatic symptoms of lightheadedness, nausea, pallor, and warmth and accompanied at the time of hypotension by a slowing of the heart rate (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). NMH sometimes is termed “neurocardiogenic syncope,” “vasodepressor syncope,” or “vaso-vagal syncope” (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). OH involves an immediate and sustained drop of at least 20 mm Hg in systolic or 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure in the first 3 minutes of standing or upright tilt (Freeman et al., 2011). This is uncommon in ME/CFS, but a delayed form of OH has been recognized in ME/CFS patients, in which blood pressure changes occur after 3 minutes upright (Moya et al., 2009; Streeten and Anderson, 1992). ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. POTS, and studies employing less than 10 minutes of orthostatic stress reported rates of POTS, as these tests were not sufficiently prolonged to be able to exclude NMH). These methodological factors contributed to the variability in rates of orthostatic intolerance reported in the various studies. The literature search identified 14 studies of prolonged orthostatic testing in which adults with ME/CFS were compared with healthy controls (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; De Lorenzo et al., 1997; Duprez et al., 1998; Hollingsworth et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2005; LaManca et al., 1999a; Naschitz et al., 2000, 2002; Poole et al., 2000; Razumovsky et al., 2003; Schondorf et al., 1999; Streeten et al., 2000; Timmers et al., 2002; Yataco et al., 1997), as well as three studies of subjects with ME/CFS without controls (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997; Reynolds et al., 2013; Rowe et al., 2001). None of the studies with controls and only one of the three studies without controls (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997) recruited participants based on the presence of autonomic symptoms. Of the 14 studies with healthy controls in which orthostatic testing lasted longer than 10 minutes, only 2 did not report a higher prevalence of either POTS or NMH among those with ME/CFS compared with controls (Duprez et al., 1998; Jones et al., 2005). The rates of reported abnormalities ranged from 0 percent (Duprez et al., 1998) to 96 percent (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). The median proportion with hemodynamic abnormalities during the first 30-45 minutes upright in these studies was 37 percent in ME/CFS versus 7.5 percent in controls. In the three additional studies without controls, the reported rates of orthostatic intolerance ranged from 11 to 66 percent of adults with ME/CFS. This number needs to be interpreted with caution given the varying durations of orthostatic stress (ranging from 20 to 60 minutes) and other methodological differences in testing. The literature search identified seven studies with brief durations of orthostatic stress (2-10 minutes) (De Becker et al., 1998; Freeman and Komaroff, 1997; Hoad et al., 2008; Miwa, 2014; Natelson et al., 2007; Soetekouw et al., 1999; Winkler et al., 2004). The samples sizes ranged from 20 to 62 subjects with ME/CFS (median N = 37). Two studies used head-up tilt testing and five active standing as the orthostatic stressor. The prevalence of orthostatic intolerance was not documented in two studies in which the main focus was formal autonomic testing (De Becker et al., 1998; Soetekouw et al., 1999). In all of the remaining studies, the prevalence of POTS was numerically higher in adults ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. with ME/CFS than in controls (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997; Hoad et al., 2008; Miwa, 2014; Natelson et al., 2007; Winkler et al., 2004). Combining the data from these studies, the overall prevalence of POTS was 27 percent in adults with ME/CFS and 4.2 percent in healthy controls. The range of orthostatic abnormalities (including POTS, hypotension, and hypocapnia) in these studies with brief orthostatic testing varied widely—from 14 to 67 percent—in individual studies, reflecting differences in study measures, subject selection, and duration of orthostatic stress. The literature review identified five studies reporting orthostatic or ME/CFS symptoms following standing or tilt table testing. Upright posture was associated with provocation of fatigue symptoms and higher rates of lightheadedness, nausea, and warmth in 55-100 percent of subjects with ME/CFS (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; Hollingsworth et al., 2010; Naschitz et al., 2000; Streeten et al., 2000). For example, during the first 45 minutes of head-up tilt, 100 percent of 23 ME/CFS participants reported worse fatigue, 91 percent lightheadedness, 91 percent increased warmth, 73 percent nausea, and 18 percent diaphoresis. Controls made no reports of similar symptoms (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). One small study found a normalization of heart rate and blood pressure changes and improvement in ME/CFS symptoms after the acute application of a 45-mm Hg external compression device while subjects continued to stand (Streeten et al., 2000). In a study of 64 British adults with ME/CFS, 6 participants were unable to tolerate head-up tilt because of weakness. Of the remaining 58 with ME/CFS, 32 (55 percent) were symptomatic during the test, compared with 17/64 (27 percent) healthy controls. The types of symptoms were not specified (Hollingsworth et al., 2010). Research also has shown that the severity of orthostatic symptoms may predict the functional status of those with ME/CFS (Costigan et al., 2010). Open (nonblinded) treatment studies of ME/CFS subjects found improvement in function after increased sodium intake or pharmacological treatment of orthostatic intolerance (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; De Lorenzo et al., 1997; Kawamura et al., 2003; Naschitz et al., 2004). However, randomized trials of fludrocortisone failed to confirm the efficacy of this treatment in adults as monotherapy or combined with hydrocortisone (Blockmans et al., 2003; Peterson et al., 1998; Rowe et al., 2001). More formal autonomic testing—using such measures as the cold pressor test, heart rate responses to deep breathing, handgrip tests, the Valsalva ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. maneuver, and quantitative sudomotor axon reflex tests—has not been conducted as extensively as have tests of the heart rate and blood pressure response to orthostatic stress. The majority of studies reporting the Valsalva ratio found no differences between ME/CFS and control groups (De Becker et al., 1998; Schondorf et al., 1999; Soetekouw et al., 1999; Winkler et al., 2004). Measures of heart rate variability have been used to examine the effects of autonomic tone on the heart noninvasively. ME/CFS is associated with enhanced sympathetic nervous system tone and reduced parasympathetic tone at baseline (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997; Frith et al., 2012; Sisto et al., 1995), in response to cognitive and orthostatic challenges (Beaumont et al., 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2003; Yataco et al., 1997), after walking (Cordero et al., 1996), and during sleep (Boneva et al., 2007; Rahman et al., 2011; Togo and Natelson, 2013; Yamaguti et al., 2013). Ambulatory blood pressure measurements in subjects with ME/CFS have had conflicting results. One study found significantly lower systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure in ME/CFS patients compared with controls, and a second found nighttime hypotension in ME/CFS patients (Newton et al., 2009; Van de Luit et al., 1998). Duprez and colleagues (1998), however, found no differences in daytime or nighttime blood pressure in ME/CFS patients. Of interest, although blood pressure did not differ in that study, there were significant differences in heart rate between ME/CFS cases and healthy controls throughout the 24-hour period. Studies measuring blood volume have found lower values in ME/CFS subjects than in controls. Hurwitz and colleagues (2010) found a total blood volume deficit of 15.1 percent in ME/CFS patients compared with controls. Streeten and Bell (1998) identified low red blood cell mass in 16 of 19 patients with ME/CFS and an overall total lower blood volume in 63 percent of ME/CFS patients. Okamoto and colleagues (2012b) identified a 10.4 percent lower total blood volume in subjects with ME/CFS and POTS compared with controls studied at the same center. Hurwitz and colleagues (2010) confirmed a lower cardiac index in ME/CFS patients (due to a 10.2 percent lower stroke index compared with sedentary and nonsedentary controls) and a cardiac contractility deficit of 25.1 percent. In a series of studies possibly involving some of the same patients, a high prevalence of orthostatic intolerance, associated with smaller heart on cardiothoracic ratios, was found in ME/CFS patients (Miwa, 2014; Miwa and Fujita, 2008, 2009, 2011). Hollingsworth and colleagues (2010) found a greater left ventricular work index with standing in ME/CFS patients compared with controls, suggesting that when the patients were standing, their hearts were working harder. These findings were associated ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. with the presentation of symptoms with standing in 95 percent of ME/CFS patients. Three studies examined orthostatic hypocapnia in subjects with CFS. Naschitz and colleagues (2000) found that end-tidal CO was similar for ME/CFS patients and controls when supine, consistent with the absence of hyperventilation at baseline, but end-tidal CO was lower for the ME/CFS subjects during upright tilt testing. These results were confirmed by Razumovsky and colleagues (2003) during prolonged head-up tilt testing and by Natelson and colleagues (2007) during 8 minutes of active standing. Three studies examined abnormalities in peripheral blood flow in ME/CFS patients using different physiologic or pharmacologic challenges. ME/CFS patients had abnormally prolonged vasodilation in response to transdermally applied acetylcholine (Khan et al., 2003), reduced oxygen delivery to muscles after exercise and after cuff ischemia (McCully and Natelson, 1999), and a strikingly increased venous contractile sensitivity to infused epinephrine (Streeten, 2001). These studies have yet to be replicated. Overlap of ME/CFS with Other Conditions Associated with Orthostatic Intolerance A small number of studies have examined the prevalence of ME/CFS symptoms in those diagnosed with POTS (Okamoto et al., 2012b) or vasovagal syncope (Kenny and Graham, 2001; Legge et al., 2008). Okamoto and colleagues (2012b) examined the prevalence of the ME/CFS symptoms of the Fukuda definition among those with POTS who did not satisfy the criteria for ME/CFS, comparing this group with those who had POTS together with ME/CFS. Those with POTS alone often reported an elevated prevalence of severe fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, impaired memory or concentration, muscle pain, and post-exertional fatigue, although they did not have a sufficient number of symptoms to satisfy the Fukuda definition. By definition, the prevalence of Fukuda symptoms was higher in ME/CFS subjects who also had POTS than in those with POTS alone, but the pattern of symptoms was similar between the two groups (Okamoto et al., 2012b). A high prevalence of hypotension and tachycardia is seen in FM, which, as noted earlier, is a clinical condition often comorbid with ME/CFS. Sym- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. pathetic predominance of heart rate variability also is seen in FM studies (Martinez-Lavin, 2007; Martinez-Martinez et al., 2014). The prevalence of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and joint hypermobility is higher in ME/CFS patients than in healthy controls (Barron et al., 2002; Rowe et al., 1999). Studies also confirm high rates of fatigue as well as orthostatic and autonomic symptoms in those with hypermobility (Gazit et al., 2003) and the hypermobile form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (De Wandele et al., 2014a,b). There is consistent evidence that upright posture is associated with a worsening of ME/CFS symptoms, as well as the onset of other symptoms such as lightheadedness, nausea, and palpitations. While there is variability in the reported prevalence of orthostatic intolerance in ME/CFS, heart rate and blood pressure abnormalities during standing or head-up tilt testing are more common in those with ME/CFS than in those without ME/CFS. Heart rate variability analyses demonstrate a sympathetic predominance of autonomic tone in those with ME/CFS, including during sleep. Sufficient evidence indicates a high prevalence of orthostatic intolerance in ME/CFS, as measured by objective heart rate and blood pressure abnormalities during standing or head-up tilt testing or by patient-reported exacerbation of orthostatic symptoms with standing in day-to-day life. These findings indicate that orthostatic intolerance is a common and clinically important finding in ME/CFS. Armitage, R. 1999.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are serious, debilitating conditions that affect millions of people in the United States and around the world. ME/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment. 3 Current Case Definitions and Diagnostic Criteria, Terminology, and Symptom Constructs and Clusters 4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations 5 Review of the Evidence on Other ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations Appendix D: Questionnaires and Tools That May Be Useful for Assessing ME/CFS Symptoms Appendix E: Biographical Sketches of Committee Members, Consultants, and Staff You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

(Learn how and when to remove this template message) of a 29-year-old female with sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 125 bpm (also colloquially known as or ) is an elevated characterized by an increase in the rate of electrical impulses arising from the . In adults, sinus tachycardia is defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats/min (bpm). The normal resting heart rate is 60–100 bpm in an average male adult and 60-90 bpm in an average female adult. Normal heart rate varies with age, from infants having faster heart rates (110-150 bpm) and the elderly having slower heart rates. Sinus tachycardia is a normal response to physical exercise, when the heart rate increases to meet the body's higher demand for energy and oxygen, but sinus tachycardia can also indicate a health problem. Thus, sinus tachycardia is a medical finding that can be either physiological or . is often asymptomatic. It is often a resulting symptom of a primary disease state and can be an indication of the severity of a disease. If the heart rate is too high, may fall due to the markedly reduced ventricular filling time. Rapid rates, though they may be compensating for elsewhere, increase myocardial oxygen demand and reduce coronary blood flow, thus precipitating an ischemic heart or valvular disease. Sinus tachycardia accompanying a may be indicative of . Sinus is usually a response to physiological stress, such as , or an increased tone with increased release, such as stress, fright, flight, and anger. Other causes include: Intake of such as , , , , or Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy Sinus tachycardia is usually apparent on an , but if the heart rate is above 140 bpm the may be difficult to distinguish from the previous and one may confuse it with a or with a 2:1 block. Ways to distinguish the three are: (such as carotid sinus massage or Valsalva's maneuver) to slow the rate and identification of P waves administer AV blockers (e.g., , ) to identify with 2:1 block : Upright, in leads I, II and aVL, and negative in lead aVR; In inappropriate sinus tachycardia (also known as chronic nonparoxysmal sinus tachycardia), patients have an elevated resting heart rate and/or exaggerated heart rate in response to exercise. These patients have no apparent heart disease or other causes of sinus tachycardia. IST is thought to be due to abnormal autonomic control. Main article: Usually, in women with no heart problems, this syndrome is characterized by normal resting heart rate but exaggerated postural sinus tachycardia with or without orthostatic hypotension. Treatment for physiologic sinus tachycardia involves treating the underlying causes of the tachycardia response. may be used to decrease tachycardia in patients with certain conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and rate-related angina. In patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia, careful titration of beta-blockers, salt loading, and hydration typically reduce symptoms. Patients who are unresponsive to such treatment can undergo to potentially repair the sinus node. Sinus tachycardia can present in more than a third of the patients with but this usually decreases over time. Patients with sustained sinus tachycardia reflects a larger infarct that are more anterior with prominent left ventricular dysfunction, associated with high mortality and morbidity. Tachycardia in the presence of AMI can reduce coronary blood flow and increase myocardial oxygen demand, aggravating the situation. Beta-blockers can be used to slow the rate, but most patients are usually already treated with beta-blockers as a routine regimen for AMI. are useful if the cause is sympathetic overactivity. If the cause is due to decreased vagal activity, it is usually hard to treat and one may consider . In this context, the adjectives and are opposites. Crawford, Michael H., ed. (2017). (5th ed.).
