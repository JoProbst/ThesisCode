dc235da3-fec1-4305-8ae1-7dc2d3c9ed75,"The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment with a long-term, is crucial for most patients with MS, since disease activity and damage continues within the CNS even when no new symptoms are present. When a patient begins a treatment regimen early in his or her disease course, disease activity is slowed. This not only reduces the number and severity of symptom flare-ups, as well as delays the progression of the disease (and possibly delays any related disability), but also reduces the number of active lesions that appear on an MRI. A 21-year prospective study of individuals (with relapsing-remitting MS) who began therapy early in the disease found that they experienced a longer lifespan than those who did not begin treatment as early. Of those who didn’t start treatment early, MS-related pulmonary infection was the most common cause of mortality over the 21-year period. Previously, all but one* of the approved treatments were only available for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) – largely for those with RRMS – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS had been approved for these two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication had been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Additionally, in 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. While these are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS, the FDA is allowing some of the previously approved DMTs to add active SPMS to their indications. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). *In 2000, Novantrone® (mitoxantrone), given via IV infusion, was approved for RRMS, SPMS, and worsening RRMS. However, side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT that is also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. Research (including many clinical trials) is ongoing at a rigorous pace to find additional treatments for all forms of MS. Mylan’s generic version of Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate injection) Three generic versions of Gilenya® (fingolimod) capsules; while approved, these are not yet available Tecfidera® (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) Getting early treatment and staying on one of the long-term DMTs for MS may also delay the rate of conversion from RRMS to . As noted earlier, this form of MS that follows RRMS exhibits a steady worsening, with or without relapses (or flare-ups). If flare-ups do occur, they usually do not remit fully. As mentioned in the previous section, without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of more than 20 brand-name and generic DMTs since the first treatment became available in 1993, those taking a DMT experience a reduced or delayed conversion rate. For more information on long-term treatments for MS and how to select the treatment that is right for you, please see MSAA’s . Individuals who experience a more steady progression of the disease from the onset, without periodic relapses and remissions, may be diagnosed with . To date, only one disease-modifying therapy (Ocrevus) has been approved for the long-term treatment of this form of MS, although many experimental medications are being studied with PPMS in clinical trials. | Additional Evaluative Tools for Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosing Multiple Sclerosis and Evaluating Disease Activity MSAA is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 22-1912812.Copyright ©2020 Multiple Sclerosis Association of America.Reproduction of material from any mymsaa.org pages without written permission is strictly prohibited.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-0.029083212837576866,2
d1fce3b2-ac1f-4100-888f-a875e8f603eb,"Link Between Stress And Multiple Sclerosis Attacks A new study that combined results of previously published research findings suggests that acute attacks of multiple sclerosis may be associated with stressful life events. The study, appearing in the British Medical Journal and funded in part through National MS Society postdoctoral fellowships, is a “meta-analysis” (which statistically combines findings) of previously published studies of the topic of stress and MS. Background:Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that targets the brain and spinal cord. In its most common form (“relapsing-remitting MS”), neurological symptoms of the disease come and go in the form of acute attacks followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. It is still not known what causes MS, or what triggers relapses, although upper respiratory infections have been linked to relapses in some individuals. Although there have been many studies examining a possible link between stress and MS, conclusions have been controversial. This is because stress has many different meanings and has been defined and studied in many different ways that are hard to compare. Moreover, studies of stress and the long-term course of MS are lacking.  Researchers use poop samples to establish baselines for stress, reproduction in gray whales Cannabis use dampens physiological response to stress in female rats MIPT researchers use zebrafish to study chronic stress The Study: David Mohr, PhD, and colleagues (University of California at San Francisco) searched the medical literature for studies from 1965 to February 2003 that contained the terms “stress,” “trauma,” and “multiple sclerosis.” The investigators independently reviewed the papers, analyzing methods, statistics, and outcomes. They excluded studies that focused solely on physical trauma or medical conditions, and also excluded studies that did not provide adequate details of methods and outcomes. National MS Society-funded postdoctoral fellows Laura Julian, PhD, and Darcy Cox, PsyD, contributed to the analysis.  The authors included 14 studies that met their screening criteria, including studies that looked at MS relapses after diagnosis as well as initial MS attacks. In 13 out of 14 studies, the authors noted a significant increase in the likelihood of MS relapse following stressful life events, such as marital problems or financial difficulties. In one study however, stress was followed by a reduction in relapses. The authors conclude that these studies indicate a modest association between stressful events and MS relapses, but also note the limitations of their study. The quality of the studies they reviewed varied, and the authors of those studies did not always consider or report other factors (such as upper respiratory infections) that might have triggered relapses. Furthermore, the association between stress and relapse was not consistent among patients, or even in one individual over time.

d359081e-c45f-455e-ac2a-bfceab3db4b5,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer While we all know “MS” stands for “multiple sclerosis,” with so much exciting research reported in this edition of “What’s New in MS Research,” we can almost imagine that “MS” could also refer to the quest for “multiple solutions” in MS. Although a great deal of the research looks to further understand the biology, easing the symptoms, and slowing or stopping the physical damage of MS, the studies and other information presented here are very encouraging – and they are only a small sample of the vast array of research under way around the world. Most of the clinical trials and other studies featured in this issue of “What’s New in MS Research” are drawn from virtual presentations given at the September 2020 joint meeting of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). That meeting, held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was a forum for laboratory scientists and clinical investigators to share their findings from literally thousands of research efforts. As reflected in the reports that follow, those inquiries touch upon everything from enhancing the diagnosis of MS and better understanding its course, to evaluating the effectiveness and safety of approved disease-modifying therapies, investigational agents, and other types of interventions. Impact of Vumerity on brain-volume change: Encouraging interim findings People with relapsing MS who took the oral disease-modifying therapy Vumerity (diroximel fumarate) for up to two years had changes (reductions) in brain volume that approach those seen in people who do not have MS. That’s the encouraging finding from interim results of a study examining the long-term impact of the medication, which the FDA approved in October 2019. The study, EVOLVE-MS-1, is an ongoing, open-label Phase 3 investigation. Analysis of data on 365 patients who had taken Vumerity for a median of 96 weeks showed that their average percent of brain volume change (PBVC) was -0.36 from baseline to Week 48 and -0.35 from Week 48 to Week 96. Meanwhile, the estimated proportion of patients who were free of confirmed disability progression was 94.3% at Week 48 and 90.7% at Week 96. The proportions of patients with no evidence of disease activity at Week 48 and Week 96 were 44.7% and 25.2%, respectively. The study’s authors noted, “Interim findings from the ongoing EVOLVE-MS-1 study demonstrate that yearly PBVC in [Vumerity]-treated patients approached the rate observed in healthy adults.” Newly approved DMT shows efficacy in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients In August, Kesimpta (ofatumumab) became the first self-administered targeted B-cell therapy approved by the FDA to treat relapsing forms of MS. A recent analysis of data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I/II trials that led to that approval provide insights into the efficacy and risk profile of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in newly diagnosed patients who had not received any prior disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for their MS. The analysis involved 615 patients with a median age of 36 years who typically had been diagnosed within a year of starting either Kesimpta, or the comparison agent Aubagio (teriflunomide), in the Phase III trials. Compared to Aubagio, the study found that Kesimpta reduced the annual relapse rate (ARR) by 50.3%. It also reduced six-month confirmed disability worsening by 46%, and the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a year by 82.0%. The study’s authors noted that these findings in newly diagnosed patients who had not received prior DMTs were consistent with results for the overall study population. Assessing the long-term impact of Mayzent in secondary-progressive MS Mayzent (siponimod) is an oral DMT approved by the FDA in March 2019 as a treatment for both relapsing and active secondary-progressive MS (aSPMS). In the EXPAND trial that led to its approval, the medication reduced worsening of both clinical disability and cognition at the six-month mark in people with aSPMS. New data show that those benefits may continue for up to five years. An analysis assessed long-term outcomes in 582 people with aSPMS, comparing those who had received Mayzent throughout the EXPAND trial and its open-label extension (Continuous Group), with those who had been on placebo during the main trial and then switched to Mayzent during the extension (Switch Group). Median time to confirmed disability progression over any six-month period was 48 months for the Switch Group, but was not reached for the Continuous Group. Similarly, the risk of confirmed cognitive worsening over any six-month period was reduced by 33% in the Continuous Group vs. the Switch Group, a statistically significant difference. The annual relapse rate (ARR) was also significantly reduced in the Continuous Group relative to the Switch Group. The study’s authors concluded, “Long-term data analyses in the Continuous versus Switch groups showed that siponimod treatment effects on disability, cognitive processing speed, and relapse outcomes in patients with active SPMS are sustained for up to 5 years, and highlight the value of early treatment initiation.” Arnold D, et al.

Sustained reduction of disability and cognitive decline with long-term siponimod treatment in patients with active SPMS: EXPAND data up to 5 years. ECTRIMS 2020 [P0238]. Evaluating the impact of ponesimod on brain volume and other measures Ponesimod is an oral medication in late stages of investigation for treatment of relapsing forms of MS. It belongs to a class of medications called sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 modulators. The class also includes FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as Gilenya (fingolimod) and Mayzent (siponimod). The Phase III OPTIMUM study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ponesimod relative to the approved DMT Aubagio (teriflunomide) over two years of treatment. The study included 985 patients. Analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and other data from the trial showed that patients in the ponesimod group had less change in brain volume than those taking Aubagio and fewer new or enlarging T2 lesions seen on MRI per year. Further, at week 108 of treatment, 28.2% of patients receiving ponesimod had no evidence of disease activity as assessed by three measures (NEDA-3), compared to 18.3% of people taking Aubagio. Evobrutinib shows two-year reduction in relapse rate Evobrutinib is an investigational medication that belongs to a class of medications known as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or BTKIs. Its developers note that it has a dual mode of action, targeting B cells and myeloid cells, both of which play a role in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In a recent Phase II trial involving people with relapsing MS, evobrutinib significantly reduced T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI compared to placebo at Week 24, and showed continued efficacy through Week 48. Patients who participated in that trial were eligible to join an open-label extension study that tracked clinical relapse rates and other measures. The extension included both people who had received various doses of evobrutinib in the Phase II trial and those who had received placebo. All participants in the extension study received evobrutinib. Among 148 patients who completed 108 weeks of treatment, those who had been on the highest dose of evobrutinib in the main trial had an annualized relapse rate of 0.12, which was roughly one-third that of the 0.31 rate for patients who received placebo in the main trial before switching to evobrutinib in the open-label period. Similarly, the estimated time to relapse in the higher-dose evobrutinib patients was almost three times longer than that of patients who started on placebo. For all of the remarkable progress that has been made in expanding treatment options for MS, there also are periodic reminders that drug development is a difficult and complex process that offers no guarantees of success. One such reminder came a few weeks ago, when Biogen noted in its third-quarter report that it will discontinue development of its investigational agent opicinumab. The medication, which is also known as anti-LINGO-1 and BIIB033, is an antibody that was thought to promote repair of the myelin sheath that protects nerves. Damage to that sheath is the hallmark of MS. The agent has been studied in a number of Phase II studies, including RENEW, SYNERGY, and the AFFINITY trial, which was scheduled to run until 2022. Unfortunately, the latter trial did not meet primary or secondary endpoints, so development of opicinumab was discontinued. Kappos L, et al.

Two of those studies are summarized below. Neurofilament light, or NfL, is a protein found in axons, the component of neurons that facilitates transmission of electrical impulses. When neurons are damaged, as occurs in MS and other diseases, the protein is released, eventually reaching the blood, or serum. Researchers seeking biomarkers that can help correctly identify MS and provide clues to its future course have focused in recent years on the sNfL chain, with generally encouraging results. In a multi-center, prospective study, investigators looked for an association between sNfL levels and the diagnosis of MS, MRI parameters, and treatment decisions. The study, which involved 814 patients, found that: Patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) had lower sNfL levels than those with MS, a finding that may help clinicians distinguish between the two conditions. sNfL levels correlated with the number of clinical relapses a person experienced and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions seen on MRI. Patients who received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in the first two years after diagnosis had higher baseline sNfL levels than patients who did not receive a DMT, suggesting that they may have presented with more pronounced symptoms. Further, sNfL levels measured over four years reflected treatment decisions, supporting the idea that those levels are a marker of disease status. The study’s authors concluded that evaluating sNfL levels may both enhance diagnosis and help guide decisions about initial treatment. A second study found that sNfL levels obtained in the early stages of MS can predict how patients are likely to fare as much as 15 years later. Drawing on long-term data from the BENEFIT study examining use of interferon beta-1b in people with MS, researchers found that patients with baseline sNfL values above the 90th percentile were almost 2.5 times more likely than people with lower sNfL concentrations to have an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4 or greater 15 years later. An EDSS score of 4 indicates that although fully ambulatory and self-sufficient, an individual is experiencing significant disability. One less headache for people with MS who also suffer from migraines It could be intuitive to think – or at least to worry – that a history of migraines would not bode well for the course of MS, but researchers have found that this isn’t necessarily the case. Those investigators analyzed data on 2,017 people with MS, including 336 people who had reported experiencing migraines. The people who reported migraines tended to be younger than the other patients, and were more likely to also have a history of anxiety, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea. However, they were less likely than the other study subjects to have severe disability (5.4% of those with migraine vs. 12.0% of those without, a statistically significant difference), and did not show differences in walking speed, manual dexterity, cognitive processing speed, relapse rates, or rate of new brain-lesion development. While the investigators cautioned that the evidence gathered to date on migraine and MS is conflicting, and that further studies are needed, their findings nonetheless offer reassurance to people who may have feared that migraine headaches would somehow contribute to or be associated with a more-difficult MS course. Different types of MS impact quality of life similarly Depression, pain, and walking difficulty are the symptoms that have the greatest impact on quality of life for people with MS, regardless of which form of the condition they have. This is the main finding to emerge from a study examining how 13 different MS symptoms affected health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 1,985 people with MS. Although the study subjects were stratified by MS phenotype, such as relapsing-remitting MS, secondary-progressive MS, and primary-progressive MS, the investigators found that depression, pain, and problems with walking were the main contributors to a reduced quality of life across and among the different subgroups. “Reducing these symptoms may have the largest impact on improving HRQoL in all MS phenotypes of people with MS,” they said.

An MS trial focused exclusively on minority patients In keeping with efforts to address long-standing inequities in society as a whole and within the healthcare system, a new trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the disease-modifying therapy Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) in people with relapsing forms of MS who are of African ancestry or Hispanic and Latino ethnicity. In previewing the trial, researchers noted that minority patients with MS tend to have greater disease severity and faster progression than Caucasians, but are significantly under-represented in clinical trials, “owing to poor access and cultural, economic and other participation barriers.” They added that while large-scale clinical trials of Ocrevus showed that the B cell-targeting anti-CD20 therapy reduced rates of disease activity and progression in both relapsing MS and primary-progressive MS, minority participation in those studies was less than 10%. By contrast, the researchers said, the single-arm Phase IV study, called CHIMES, is an industry-sponsored collaborative approach designed to meet the needs of patients of African or Hispanic ancestry. The study’s primary endpoint will be disease activity, defined by the proportion of patients free of protocol-defined events such as relapses, at one year. Study subjects will be eligible to participate in a second-year extension that will assess disease progression and biomarker endpoints. One-third of the patients will take part in a sub-study evaluating cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. The researchers noted, “Findings from CHIMES are expected to improve current understanding of MS disease biology, treatment response and clinical trial participation among [African ancestry and Hispanic ancestry] patients with MS, with the ultimate goals of increasing high-quality standard of care to traditionally underserved populations and enhancing equality through clinical research.” Examining MS relapse rates during – and after – pregnancy A new study has bolstered prior findings that MS relapses tend to decrease during pregnancy and then increase again in the early postpartum period. The analysis assessed information on 119 women who became pregnant while they were patients at the University of California San Francisco Multiple Sclerosis Center during the period 2005 to 2018. For the 146 live-birth pregnancies that the study subjects had, the pre-pregnancy annual relapse rate (ARR) was 0.33. That rate decreased during pregnancy to 0.10 but then increased to 0.61 by three months after delivery. (Both changes were statistically significant.) Another key finding: Women who exclusively breastfed their babies for at least three months after delivery had a significantly reduced likelihood of having a relapse. Identifying indicators of long-term disability in children with MS Children and adolescents who have optic nerve, brainstem, or spinal cord lesions when they are diagnosed with MS are at greater risk for long-term disability than other pediatric MS patients. That was one of the major findings to emerge from a study of 123 young people followed for an average of nine years after diagnosis. Researchers found that optic nerve involvement at baseline predicted a shorter time to first relapse and 10-year disability worsening. Brainstem lesions at baseline also were predictive of 10-year disability worsening, as well as of a higher 10-year Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. The number of cervical spinal cord lesions at diagnosis also helped identify patients likely to have higher EDSS scores 10 years after diagnosis. Several other clinical and imaging features seen in the first three years after diagnosis, including number of relapses in the first year and detection of at least two lesions seen on MRI within two years, also provided reliable information on long-term disease course. The study’s investigators noted, “Accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first two years of disease has proven to represent a powerful tool for counseling [pediatric] patients about long-term prognosis and personalizing treatment strategies.” Williams M, et al.

Comparing stem cell transplantation with disease-modifying therapies Encouraging results from small- and medium-sized studies have generated considerable interest in treating multiple sclerosis with stem cell therapy, but important questions remain about the long-term outcomes of the treatment strategy, as well as about how it compares with current disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The StarMS study will examine that last issue: the safety and efficacy of stem cell transplantation relative to DMTs. Funded by the British government, the study will involve 198 people with relapsing-remitting MS. One half of the study participants will receive stem cells that have been taken from their body, treated, and then re-infused after the patient undergoes immunosuppression. This approach is designed to “reboot” the immune system. The other half of the participants will receive one of two DMTs, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) or Lemtrada (alemtuzumab). The primary endpoint of the study will be the rate of patients achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), based on clinical and imaging assessments, over a two-year follow-up period. Allowing time for full patient enrollment, results are expected in about four years. Study investigators note, “The StarMS trial has the potential to provide definitive data on the comparative efficacy of aHSCT [autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation] versus highly efficacious DMTs, help improve patient outcomes, and impact national and international guidelines.” Might administering microscopic crystals to people with MS prove to be the gold standard – literally – for repairing the nerve-sheath damage that drives MS? Clene Nanomedicine, a biopharmaceutical company based in Salt Lake City, Utah, is pursuing the answer to that question as it develops CNM-Au8, a concentrated, aqueous suspension of clean-surfaced faceted gold nanocrystals that act catalytically to support intracellular biological reactions. The agent is being investigated as a potential treatment not only for MS, but also for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and potentially other neurological conditions. Studies in animals indicate that CNM-Au8 has both remyelination and neuroprotective effects, the Company notes. Clene Nanotechnologies adds that Phase I studies in healthy human volunteers have demonstrated the safety of CNM-Au8. As a next step in the research process, the Company organized the REPAIR-MS and REPAIR-PD studies. The Phase II, single-center, open-label, imaging studies are examining the brain metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who have been diagnosed with MS in the past 15 years (REPAIR-MS) or who have been diagnosed with PD in the past three years (REPAIR-PD). Study participants take either a 15 or 30 mg orally delivered dose of the nanocrystal suspension each morning. Study participants undergo sophisticated brain imaging scanning to assess key bioenergetic brain metabolites at baseline, prior to administration of CNM-Au8, and at the end of the study. The objective is to show that CNM-Au8 engages with targeted central nervous system biomarkers related to bioenergetics and neuronal metabolism in people with MS and PD. The study is taking place at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Survey finds that one in five people with MS are using cannabis for symptom relief Roughly one-third of people with MS have looked to cannabis at least once for relief of spasticity or pain, or to help with sleep, and 20% currently are taking cannabis to ease MS symptoms. Those were the main findings of a recent online survey conducted by the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis, or NARCOMS, a voluntary self-report registry for people with MS. NARCOMS researchers invited 6,934 registry participants to complete the survey. Forty-seven percent – or 3,249 people – responded. The participants had an average age of 61.2 years and a mean age at MS symptom onset of 31.2 years. Current users were more likely than past users to be male, and also were likely to be somewhat younger. More than 60% of the respondents reported moderate to severe spasticity, pain, and sleep problems. Phase III study examines cannabinoid agent for MS spasticity Americans who look to cannabis-based agents for relief of MS symptoms may have a new treatment option – one already offered in more than two dozen other countries – available to them in the years just ahead. GW Pharmaceuticals and its United States subsidiary, Greenwich Biosciences, on November 3, 2019 announced the initiation of the first United States Phase III clinical trial studying nabiximols for MS-associated spasticity. Nabiximols, which are known as Sativex outside of the United States, are approved for treatment of MS spasticity in more than 25 countries. GW Pharmaceuticals, which focuses on the development and commercialization of cannabinoid prescription medicines, said that nabiximols is a complex botanical medicine formulated from extracts of the cannabis plant. It is administered as an oral spray. The company noted that three European Phase III clinical studies showed that nabiximols was well-tolerated and provided continued reductions in patient-reported spasticity in people with MS. The new Phase III trial is one of five pivotal studies planned for nabiximols in MS spasticity, with the remaining studies on track to begin later this year or in 2021. The company said that it expects that a positive result in any one of the five studies will enable submission of an application for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the agent, potentially as early as mid-2021. The Phase III, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of nabiximols for spasm frequency over a 12-week period. It is expected to enroll 446 participants. Evaluating the long-term impact of therapeutic plasma exchange Therapeutic plasma exchange – the removal and replacement of the plasma component of a person’s blood through the use of a special machine – is an option sometimes employed when high-dose steroid therapy isn’t effective in treating an MS relapse. A recent study examined the impact of the treatment strategy over 12, 18, and 24 months, and sought to identify whether certain patient characteristics or disease features were associated with a better response to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Researchers analyzed data on 24 people with relapsing-remitting MS who received steroids followed by TPE and 43 patients who received steroids only. Patients in the two groups were matched for age, sex, disease duration, and disability level at the time of the relapse. Good response to treatment was defined as a reduction of at least 50% in one’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Initial EDSS scores in the two groups were similar. While two-thirds of the people receiving TPE initially had a good response to the treatment, the researchers found no significant differences between their EDSS scores and those of the steroid-only patients at 12, 18, or 24 months of follow-up. Further, preliminary analysis did not identify any patient characteristics or disease features associated with a favorable response to TPE. Although the study did not identify an added long-term benefit from following high-dose steroids with TPE, the fact that most TPE recipients had a good initial response to the therapy is encouraging news, especially considering that up to one-quarter of people experiencing a relapse do not obtain sufficient improvement from steroids alone. Can taking aspirin as a warm-up help avoid overheating during exercise? In addition to the time pressures and other deterrents to regular exercise that all people face, many people with MS also have to cope with the exertion-induced overheating that is a frequent feature of multiple sclerosis. A new study is examining whether taking aspirin before working out can help remove that MS-specific obstacle to maintaining an exercise routine. ASPIRE is a large-scale, double-blind randomized controlled trial that will compare the effects of aspirin with those of acetaminophen (generic version of the brand name Tylenol) and placebo in 60 people with MS. Each study participant will engage in three maximal exercise tests, with the evaluations scheduled at one-week intervals. A study subject will take 650 mg of aspirin before one test, a standard dose of acetaminophen before another session, and placebo prior to the third session. The study’s two main endpoints are time to exhaustion and change in body temperature from the pre-exercise period to the immediate post-exercise period. Study organizers note that a pilot trial showed that aspirin pre-treatment increased exercise time and reduced the post-exercise increase in body temperature by 56% in people with MS who experience overheating on exertion.

N2 - The genetic variant rs72824905-G (minor allele) in the PLCG2 gene was previously associated with a reduced Alzheimer’s disease risk (AD). The role of PLCG2 in immune system signaling suggests it may also protect against other neurodegenerative diseases and possibly associates with longevity. We studied the effect of the rs72824905-G on seven neurodegenerative diseases and longevity, using 53,627 patients, 3,516 long-lived individuals and 149,290 study-matched controls. We replicated the association of rs72824905-G with reduced AD risk and we found an association with reduced risk of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We did not find evidence for an effect on Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) risks, despite adequate sample sizes. Conversely, the rs72824905-G allele was associated with increased likelihood of longevity. By-proxy analyses in the UK Biobank supported the associations with both dementia and longevity. Concluding, rs72824905-G has a protective effect against multiple neurodegenerative diseases indicating shared aspects of disease etiology. Our findings merit studying the PLCγ2 pathway as drug-target.

It occurs due to the combination of genetic susceptibility and can also occur due to low vitamin levels, virus, and environmental factors. The Multiple Sclerosis Foundation estimates that more than 400,000 people in the United States and about 2.5 million people around the world have Multiple Sclerosis. No large epidemiological studies have been reported from India but calculations based on hospital data in the 1970 s suggested an approximate prevalence rate of only 0.17 to 1.33 per 100,000 in different parts of India. Increased awareness and the rise in the number of neurologists and availability of MRI has led the current estimates to about 7 to 10 per 100,000. As there are many Indians who still do not have access to adequate medical facilities especially in the rural sector, there can be a rise in the figures mentioned too. As per hospital-based studies within India, an increase in the incidence of Multiple Sclerosis from 1.58% to 2.54% has been noted in the last decade.

With the help cellular therapy, utilising the various properties of stem cells, Multiple Sclerosis can be treated. In autologous cell-based therapy, stem cells from the patient s own body are transplanted, which resets the immune system. A patient suffering from Multiple Sclerosis is often treated with immune-suppressive drugs and monoclonal antibodies. But, these agents are associated with side effects with long-term use and are not entirely effective in managing symptoms. Autologous stem cells are neuroprotective and also have other paracrine properties by which patients of Multiple Sclerosis can benefit. The immunomodulatory properties of the stem cells help reduce damage in the central nervous system of patients with Multiple Sclerosis. It also helps in regeneration of the injured nerves, said Dr Pradeep Mahajan, Regenerative Medicine researcher at StemRx Bioscience Solutions Pvt. Ltd. The time taken to heal varies from patient to patient and can go from 2 months to 1 year. There are various ways to administer the back into the body, the route depending on the condition and requirement of the patient. In neurological conditions, the appropriate route of administration would be the one which facilitates cell delivery into the brain.

Dr. Luanne Metz (University of Calgary) and colleagues across Canada tested minocycline against placebo in 142 people with CIS. After 6 months, those taking twice daily minocycline had a 28% reduced risk of developing definite MS, compared to those taking placebo, and also had reduced disease activity detected on MRI scans. The risk reduction is similar to what has been reported with other disease modifying treatments in CIS trials. These benefits were not sustained at 24 months. In addition to its bacteria-killing action, minocycline has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. The most common side effects were rash, dizziness and tooth discoloration. Minocycline carries several warnings including that it is not to be taken during pregnancy.

0dca2b8d-fb18-4f31-89ac-206ba885d9f7,"Rehabilitation interventions in multiple sclerosis: an overview , –() Multiple sclerosis is a complex, heterogeneous disease associated with long-term disability. Despite the availability of advanced disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies that may decrease activity and progression of disease and alleviate complaints to a certain extent, there is still a need for comprehensive rehabilitation interventions in order to reduce sequels and symptoms of the disease on personal activities and social participation to achieve the highest possible independence and the best quality of life. Timing and setting of rehabilitation interventions should be selected individually depending on disease phase, functional deficits, personal requirements, as well as specific goals. In addition, limitations and disease-specific characteristics that may influence rehabilitation outcome should be noted. Rehabilitation interventions should be considered early for maintaining functional capacity and reducing risk for losing important abilities or independence. Due to gradual failure of adaptive compensatory mechanisms along the course of disease, benefits of rehabilitation interventions are generally higher in earlier phases of MS. Inpatient and outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial in improving disability, participation and quality of life despite progression of the disease. Good evidence exists for different specific interventions improving physical and cognitive performance. Other important issues responsible for beneficial effects of comprehensive rehabilitation in MS include education, instruction, and information of patients and caregivers. Comprehensive assessment of health domains in MS patients using standardized framework and common language for describing the impact of disease at different levels, using International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) core sets may increase the knowledge of needs of these patients for more efficient and adapted rehabilitation interventions meeting these individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS. ICF core sets may increase the knowledge of more efficient and adapted rehabilitation measures meeting more properly individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS.

e040706c-e80a-4333-9649-d34897998cf4,"Medically reviewed by — — is a neurodegenerative and inflammatory immune condition that causes problems throughout the body. It’s caused by a breakdown of the protective cover (myelin sheath) around the nerves. This makes it hard for the to communicate to the rest of the body. The exact cause of MS is still unknown, but doctors do understand the long-term effects and symptoms of MS. Read on to learn more about the effects of MS on your body. According to the , tend to show up in adults 20 to 40 years of age. Women are also diagnosed with MS at least as men. MS is thought to be an autoimmune disease and a progressive neurodegenerative condition. However, and there’s currently no cure, only treatments to manage the symptoms. What we do know is that it affects the nervous system and gradually impacts the whole body. The body’s immune cells attack healthy nerve tissue over time, affecting the body’s internal systems to respond healthily. Most of the problems described above are primary symptoms associated with MS. This means that they’re directly caused by the nerve damage resulting from attacks to the myelin sheath. Some primary symptoms can be treated directly by trying to slow the nerve damage and prevent MS attacks. However, once nerve damage exists, secondary symptoms can arise. Secondary MS symptoms are common complications of primary MS symptoms. Examples include that result from weak bladder muscles, or a loss of muscle tone that results from an inability to walk. Secondary symptoms can often be treated effectively, but treating the source of the problem can prevent them altogether. As the disease progresses, MS will inevitably cause some secondary symptoms. Secondary symptoms can often be well-managed with medication, physical adaptation, therapy, and creativity. When someone has MS, their body’s immune system slowly attacks its own myelin sheath, which is composed of the cells that surround and protect the nervous system including the spinal cord and brain. When these cells are damaged, the nerves are exposed and the brain has difficulty sending signals to the rest of the body. The disconnection between the brain and the organs, muscles, tissues, and cells served by the damaged nerves causes symptoms such as: and other changes in the brain can be a direct result of MS or an indirect result from the difficulty of coping with the condition. In , nerve damage can cause tremors, seizures, and cognitive problems that closely resemble other neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia. are often the first sign of MS for many people. Double vision, blurriness, pain, and problems seeing contrast can begin suddenly and affect one or both eyes. In many cases, vision problems are temporary or self-limiting, and likely result from nerve inflammation or fatigue of the eye muscles. Although some people with MS experience permanent vision problems, most cases are mild and can be effectively treated with steroids and other short-term treatments. Rarely, people with MS may experience hearing loss or deafness caused by damage to the brainstem. These types of hearing problems usually resolve on their own, but can be permanent in some cases. According to the , up to 40 percent of people with MS have speech problems. These include: Such effects often occur during relapses or times of . Other speech problems can include changes in voice pitch or quality, nasality, and hoarseness or breathiness. Speech problems can be caused by breathing difficulties that are brought on by weak or damaged nerves that control muscles in the chest. Difficulty controlling the muscles involved in breathing can begin early in the disease and worsen as MS progresses. This is a dangerous yet rare complication of MS that often can be improved through work with a respiratory therapist. Swallowing problems are less common than speech difficulties, but can be far more serious. They may occur when nerve damage weakens muscles and hinders the body’s ability to control the muscles involved in swallowing. When , food or drink can be inhaled into the lungs and increase your risk for infections, such as . Coughing and choking when eating and drinking can be signs of swallowing problems and should be evaluated immediately. Speech or language therapists can often help with trouble speaking and swallowing. Many people with MS experience effects to their limbs. Damage to the myelin sheath often results in pain, tingling, and numbness of the arms and legs. Problems with hand-eye coordination, , , and gait may occur when the brain has trouble sending signals to the nerves and muscles. These effects may start slowly and then worsen as nerve damage progresses. Many people with MS first feel “pins and needles” and have difficulty with coordination or fine motor skills. Over time, limb control and ease of walking may become disrupted. In these cases, canes, wheelchairs, and other assistive technologies can aid in muscle control and strength. People with MS are at higher risk of developing due to common MS treatments (steroids) and inactivity. Weakened bones can make individuals with MS susceptible to fractures and breaks. Although conditions like osteoporosis can be prevented or slowed through physical activity, diet, or supplementation, weak bones can make MS balance and coordination problems even riskier. A growing body of evidence suggests that may play an important role in the development of MS. Although its exact impact on individuals with MS isn’t yet well understood, is vital to skeletal health and immune system health. MS is thought to be an immune-mediated disease. This means that the body’s immune system attacks healthy nerve tissue, which causes nerve damage throughout the entire body. Immune system activity seems to result in the inflammation responsible for many MS symptoms. Some symptoms may flare up during an episode of immune system activity and then resolve when the episode or “attack” ends. Some research is investigating whether suppressing the immune system with medication will slow the progress of MS. Other therapies try to target particular immune cells to prevent them from attacking the nerves. However, may make people more vulnerable to infection. Some nutrient deficiencies may affect immune health and worsen MS symptoms. However, most MS physicians only recommend when a specific nutrient deficiency is present. One common recommendation is a — this also helps prevent osteoporosis. and bowel functions commonly occur in MS. Such issues can include: In some cases, diet and physical therapy or self-care strategies can reduce the impact of these problems on daily life. Other times, medications or more intense intervention may be necessary. The use of a catheter may occasionally be necessary. This is because nerve damage affects how much urine those with MS can comfortably hold in the bladder. This can result in spastic bladder infections, , or . These problems can make urination painful and very frequent, even overnight or when there’s little urine in the bladder. Most people can effectively manage bladder and bowel problems and avoid complications. However, serious infections or hygiene problems may arise if these problems are left untreated or unmanaged. Discuss any bladder or bowel issues and treatment options with your doctor. MS doesn’t directly impact the reproductive system or fertility. In fact, many women find that offers a nice reprieve from MS symptoms. However, the reports that 2-4 out of 10 women will experience a relapse during the postpartum period. However, , such as difficulty experiencing arousal or orgasm, is common in people with MS. This can be caused by nerve damage or by MS-related emotional problems such as depression or low self-esteem. Fatigue, pain, and other MS symptoms can make sexual intimacy awkward or unappealing. However, in many cases, sexual problems can be addressed successfully through medication, over-the-counter aids (such as lubricant), or a bit of advanced planning. Circulatory system problems are rarely caused by MS, although weak chest muscles can lead to shallow breathing and low oxygen supply. However, lack of activity due to depression, difficulty using muscles, and a preoccupation with treating other problems may prevent people with MS from focusing on the risk of cardiovascular disease. A study published in the journal found that women with MS have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular problems such as heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. However, physical therapy and regular physical activity may help alleviate MS symptoms and reduce cardiovascular risk. While there’s no cure for multiple sclerosis, a wide variety of medications, herbal remedies, and dietary supplements may help alleviate symptoms. can also modify the disease by preventing its progression and overall effects on your body. MS affects everyone differently. Each person experiences a unique set of symptoms and responds to treatments individually. Therefore, you and your doctors should customize your treatment regimen to address your MS symptoms specifically and alter it as the disease progresses or relapses. A carefully designed treatment plan can help make MS more manageable.

e139a568-75c8-4518-be5e-f675f0ad865e,"Study identifies determinants of unemployment in individuals with multiple sclerosis Lauren Strober, PhD, at Kessler Foundation recently published results of the first prospective study of employment and multiple sclerosis (MS). Dr. Strober compared two groups of individuals with MS - those 'at risk' and 'not at risk' for unemployment, examining the influences of multiple factors on the likelihood of staying in the workplace. The article, ""Determinants of unemployment in multiple sclerosis (MS): The role of disease measures, person-specific factors, and engagement in positive health-related behaviors"" was epublished on September 2, 2020 by . Multiple sclerosis affects people aged 20 to 50 years, comprising the peak working years. More than 90% are in the workforce at the time of their diagnosis, but on average, only 30% to 45% are employed after diagnosis. Unemployment has a negative impact on individuals and their families, as well as on society, in terms of lost productivity. Researchers receive $651,997 funding to study memory dysfunction in MS Novel compound appears to protect myelin and nerve fibers Anti-inflammatory therapy helps slow progression of multiple sclerosis in a preclinical model Moreover, there are several physical and mental health ""costs"" associated with one becoming unemployed. Examining the factors that contribute to individuals with MS leaving the workforce is essential to identifying people at risk, and finding ways to help them maintain employment. For this prospective study, 252 individuals with MS aged 20 to 64, who were working full- or part-time, were recruited through the national and local chapters of the National MS Society. A survey administered at the outset of the study identified 67 participants at risk for unemployment, defined as considering reducing their hours or leaving their jobs in the near future. The 'at risk' and 'not at risk' groups were compared by disease measures, person-specific factors, and health-related behaviors. Individuals at risk tended to have progressive disease, more fatigue, poorer coping mechanisms, and less MS self-. They were also less likely to report engaging in positive behaviors such as healthful diets, exercise, and social and intellectual activities."" Dr. Lauren Strober, senior research scientist in the Center for Neuropsychology and Neuroscience Research at Kessler Foundation ""Risk of unemployment is highest during the first three to five years after diagnosis, so we need to be able to intervene early to prevent job losses, and their subsequent impact on physical and mental health, as well as on personal and family finances. This study points to factors related to risk of unemployment that may be amenable to early intervention,"" said Dr. Strober.

6e125cf4-1af5-42e5-9d00-a311c55b14fa,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain and spinal cord. MS is unpredictable. It can range from benign to disabling. Some people with MS may be mildly affected. Others may lose the ability to write, speak, or walk. Many things may cause MS, including viruses, autoimmune disorders, environmental factors, and genetic factors. But all of the possible causes share a common feature. The body's immune system attacks its own nervous tissue. In MS, the immune system attacks the layer of protein called myelin that surrounds the nerve fibers in the central nervous system. Myelin insulates the electrical signals the nervous system uses to communicate. When this insulation is destroyed, communication is interrupted. Parts of the nervous system become permanently damaged. Symptoms of MS are erratic. They may be mild or severe. They may last a short or long time. They may appear in various combinations, depending on the part of the nervous system affected. Throughout the course of the illness, you may have any or all of these symptoms: Spasticity (involuntary increased tone of muscles leading to stiffness and spasms) Fatigue (may be triggered by physical activity, may ease with rest, or may be constant and persistent) MS may also cause cognitive effects. The effects may be mild. They are often found only after thorough testing. They may include problems with: The symptoms of MS may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Your healthcare provider will do a thorough medical history and a physical exam as the first steps toward diagnosis of MS. You will be asked about all of your symptoms, how often they occur and how long they last. You will likely have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. This test can detect the unique scars in the central nervous system. In some cases, you may need lab tests or a lumbar puncture to confirm the diagnosis. There is no cure for MS. But there are disease-modifying therapies available that can slow the progression of the disease and improve symptoms. These include: There are also treatments to help manage symptoms, treat flare-ups or relapses, improve your function and safety, and provide much needed emotional support. The following Fortunately, pregnancy does not appear to speed up the course or worsen the effects of MS. Several studies suggest that MS is less likely to flare up late in pregnancy. But there is a slightly higher risk right after pregnancy. The disabling effects of the disease may make it physically hard to carry a pregnancy. Muscle weakness and coordination problems may increase the likelihood for falls. Fatigue may worsen. Wheelchair dependence may increase the risk for urinary tract infections. There is no evidence that MS causes infertility. Studies have shown that pregnancy, delivery, and rate of birth defects are not majorly different in women with MS compared with those without MS.  Many of the medicines used to treat MS may have adverse effects on a fetus. It is important to talk with your healthcare provider if you are thinking about pregnancy or if you become pregnant. Your healthcare provider will discuss the risks and benefits of the various medicines with you, including any possible effects on your baby and your MS. During pregnancy, you will need close monitoring to keep track of the disease and the health of the fetus. You may need more frequent prenatal visits. There is no established treatment that alters the course of MS. But you may be given medicines such as steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs. Consult your healthcare provider for more information. Supportive treatment and rehabilitation for MS are especially important during pregnancy. Rehab varies depending on your symptoms. But it may help with the following: Using assistive devices (for example, canes, braces, and walkers) Setting an appropriate exercise program to promote muscle strength, endurance, and control Improving communication skills if you have trouble speaking because of weakness or lack of coordination of face and tongue muscles Adapting the home environment for safety and usability During labor, you may not have pelvic sensation, and you may not feel pain with contractions. This may also make it hard to tell when labor starts. Delivery of the baby may be harder if you have MS. While labor itself is not affected, MS can affect the muscles and nerves needed for pushing. For this reason, you may need a cesarean section or delivery with the help of forceps or vacuum. Call your healthcare provider if you have several of the classic symptoms of MS so that treatment can begin right away. If you have MS and want to get pregnant, discuss the benefits and risks of a pregnancy with your MS specialist before becoming pregnant. If you are pregnant and have MS, tell your healthcare provider as soon as possible. Key points about multiple sclerosis during pregnancy There is no cure for MS. But there are many ways to help slow the progression of the disease and manage symptoms. With MS, you may have long periods of remission of your symptoms. Pregnancy is not ruled out just because you have MS. Pregnancy doesn't seem to speed up or worsen MS. MS can make carrying a pregnancy harder. It may also make labor and delivery more difficult. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider: Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-0.7760151028633118,14
40e8434b-6d63-4fa4-8eac-8e45445404ad,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Study Evaluates Real-World Safety of Interferons in MS Study Evaluates Real-World Safety of Interferons in MS SUMMARY Researchers in Canada looked at real-world safety experiences related to the use of interferons in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Earlier studies have established the benefits of interferon treatment for relapsing forms of MS. Results confirmed some previously identified side effects, and also uncovered a possible increase in the likelihood of stroke (a 1.8-fold increase). However, the incidence of stroke overall was less than 5% over 8 years of follow-up, regardless of whether a person had taken interferons. The team also found a decrease in the likelihood of bronchitis and upper respiratory infections. These findings do not prove that interferons cause stroke or the other adverse events, but only indicate that those who experienced these events were more likely to have been exposed to interferons than those who did not experience them. “We still feel that overall, these drugs have an acceptable safety profile, but research like this enables healthcare professionals and patients to have a better insight into the risk-benefit profile of these medications,” noted lead investigator Dr. Helen Tremlett (University of British Columbia). The study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health and the National MS Society (USA), was published early online in .  DETAILS Forms of interferon beta have been used as since the first – Betaseron® (interferon beta-1b) – was introduced in the U.S. in 1993, followed by Avonex® and Rebif® (interferon beta-1a). The original clinical trials showed benefits, leading to their approval. The trials also identified some potential side effects such as flu-like symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, injection-site reactions, and reductions in blood levels of immune cells (leukopenia, lymphopenia). However, clinical trials usually last only a few years, so it takes real-world use to fully understand the safety of therapies in the general population of people with MS.     To understand the real-world safety experiences related to interferons, researchers across Canada including Helen Tremlett, PhD, and Hilda de Jong, PhD (University of British Columbia) analyzed health data from the British Columbia MS database and other sources. They investigated health outcomes for people with relapsing-remitting MS who had been prescribed interferon beta between 1995 and 2004. The average length of follow-up was 8 years. Of 2,485 people included in the study, 1,031 had been treated with an interferon.  The researchers compared their outcomes with people with MS who were not taking interferons.   Previously reported side effects such as migraine headache, leukopenia and lymphopenia, were confirmed. This study also uncovered a possible increase in the likelihood of stroke (a 1.8-fold increase), but the incidence of stroke overall was less than 5% over 8 years of follow-up, regardless of whether a person had taken interferons. The team also reported a decrease in the likelihood of bronchitis and upper respiratory infections. In this study the previously reported risk of depression was increased by 1.3, but only during the first two years of interferon therapy.   The researchers note that they were not able to take into account all other potential contributors to the individuals’ health outcomes, including health behaviors, adherence to medication, family history and lifestyle factors.  The study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health and the National MS Society (USA), was published early online in .   This study provides important real-world data related to health outcomes in people who had been treated with interferons for relapsing-remitting MS. These findings do not prove that interferons cause stroke or the other adverse events, but only indicate that those who experienced these events were more likely to have been exposed to interferons than those who did not experience them. Alternate explanations might be that one or more risk factors for any of the adverse events make it more likely for people to be on an interferon. This study was focused on real-world safety experience. Earlier studies have established the benefits of interferon treatment for relapsing forms of MS.   In a comment about their findings, project leader Dr. Helen Tremlett noted, “We still feel that overall, these drugs have an acceptable safety profile, but research like this enables healthcare professionals and patients to have a better insight into the risk-benefit profile of these medications.”   Early and ongoing treatment with disease-modifying therapy is supported by the MS Coalition, which includes the National MS Society.    Betaseron is a registered trademark of Bayer Avonex is a registered trademark of Biogen, Inc.

4d32ce6f-a506-4c83-9a63-dd864eacf8fe,"Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Comprehensive Review Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Comprehensive Review , –() Numerous observational studies have suggested that there is a correlation between the level of serum vitamin D and MS risk and disease activity. To explore this hypothesis, a literature search of large, prospective, observation studies, epidemiological studies, and studies using new approaches such as Mendelian randomization was conducted. Available data and ongoing research included in this review suggest that the level of serum vitamin D affects the risk of developing MS and also modifies disease activity in MS patients. Newer Mendelian randomization analyses suggest there is a causal relationship between low vitamin D level and the risk of MS. Post-hoc evaluations from two phase 3 studies, BENEFIT and BEYOND, support the findings of observational trials. Study limitations identified in this review recognize the need for larger controlled clinical trials to establish vitamin D supplementation as the standard of care for MS patients. Though there is increasing evidence indicating that lower vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk of MS and with greater clinical and brain MRI activity in established MS, the impact of vitamin D supplementation on MS activity remains inadequately investigated. Knowledge of the widespread effects of vitamin D on skeletal and non-skeletal functions, including immune functions, has developed considerably over the past 3 decades. Higher levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced risk for developing multiple sclerosis (MS), and with reduced clinical activity in established MS, including decreased risk of relapse and reduction in disease activity on brain MRI [, ]. Vitamin D supplementation may diminish the risk of MS in the general population, as well as in children of mothers supplemented before and during pregnancy []. In the information that follows, we will summarize the available data on vitamin D, with a focus on vitamin D’s effects on the risk of onset of MS and on the disease course of MS. Sources, Metabolism, and Biological Functions of Vitamin D Vitamin D is a lipid-soluble vitamin, but acts like a hormone. Unlike a vitamin, which is an essential organic compound that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be ingested, vitamin D can be synthesized []. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]VD), also known as calcitriol (Fig. ) [] has chemical similarities to typical hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and cortisol []. The main sources of vitamin D are sunlight, diet, and supplementation (Fig. ) []. UVB in the 290–315-nm range photolyses 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to form pre-vitamin D3, which then isomerizes to vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol []. Foods rich in vitamin D include fatty fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel), cod liver oil, egg yolk, and shiitake mushrooms. The plant form of vitamin D is called vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol []. Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol are also available from fortified foods (e.g., milk, cereal, some orange juice, and cheeses) and vitamin supplements. Relative to sun exposure, diet is a poor source of vitamin D, providing only 40–400 IU per food serving, whereas whole-body UVB exposure for 20 min for a light-skinned person during the summer months will produce upwards of 10,000 IU of vitamin D [, ]. However, UVB exposure and vitamin D production through the skin may be reduced with increased skin pigmentation, age, use of sunscreen, and environmental factors such as winter season, high latitude, pollution, cloud cover, and ozone levels []. For instance, sun exposure during most of the winter at latitudes above ~ 33° North (e.g., Atlanta, GA, USA; Casablanca, Morocco) and below ~ 33 degrees South (e.g., Santiago, Chile; New South Wales, Australia; Southern Cape of Africa) provides minimal, if any, vitamin D production []. Both forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol, and ergocalciferol are biologically inactive and undergo an enzymatic transformation in the liver to 25(OH)D (calcidiol). Stimulated by parathyroid hormone, 25(OH)D goes through a second hydroxylation in the kidney or other tissues to 1,25(OH)VD (also known as calcitriol if derived from vitamin D3), which is the active metabolite (Figs.  and ) [, ]. 1,25(OH)VD has a half-life of several hours, while 25(OH)D has a relatively long half-life (20–60 days), and thus more accurately exemplifies the overall vitamin D stores in the body. This supports the standard practice of measuring 25(OH)D in serum, and represents an integrated measure of vitamin D derived from both UVB exposure and diet. As a side note, most assays that evaluate 25(OH)D do not discriminate between the original forms of vitamin D (vitamin D3 or D2). However, the latter is usually a minor component because natural sources of ergocalciferol are scarce, and ergocalciferol is more rapidly catabolized than cholecalciferol []. The active metabolite 1,25(OH)VD is released into the bloodstream and transported in the blood. It binds to the vitamin D binding protein in blood and on the surface of target tissues. 1,25(OH)VD mediates its biological effects by binding to intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR), which then recruits cofactors to form a transcriptional complex that binds to vitamin D response elements []. This association regulates the expression of at least 500 genes that drive a variety of physical functions []. The VDR is found in almost all human tissues, not just those participating in the classic actions of vitamin D, such as bone, gut, and kidney. The non-classic actions of VDR can be allocated to three main categories: regulation of hormone secretion, regulation of immune function, and regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation []. Vitamin D deficiency has been classically attributed to bone health. In the early 1900s, rickets, a consequence of vitamin D deficiency, was very common among children in industrialized cities, and observations were made that sunlight exposure or cod liver oil may help to prevent this condition []. Other musculoskeletal consequences of vitamin D deficiency include secondary hyperparathyroidism, increased bone turnover, bone loss, and risk of low-trauma fractures. Today, we understand that VDR is widely distributed throughout the human body and involved in many biological functions. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with numerous diseases including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, infectious diseases, mental disorders, and autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, Crohn’s disease, and MS [, ]. These diseases are all linked to vitamin D levels that are sufficient to prevent rickets, but are still suboptimal. Curiously, as rickets is no longer a problem, one might assume that the vitamin D deficiency problem is also no longer an issue. However, now that we know that autoimmunity may be related to low vitamin D levels, and that the incidence of autoimmune diseases has increased, we must consider if there is a higher vitamin D threshold related to autoimmunity, or if the environment changed since the Industrial Revolution. Since multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered an autoimmune disease, it is of interest to review briefly the potential effects of vitamin D related to immune function. The active form of vitamin D plays an essential role in lymphocyte activation and proliferation, T-helper cell differentiation, tissue-specific lymphocyte homing, the production of specific antibody isotypes, and regulation of the immune response []. Targeted immune cell types include macrophages, dendritic cells, and T and B cells. Mora and colleagues (Fig. ) [] summarized the roles and effects of vitamin D on these immune cell types []: Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) constitutively express VDRs, whereas VDR expression in T cells is upregulated only after activation. In macrophages and monocytes, 1,25(OH)VD positively impacts its own effects by increasing the expression of VDR and the cytochrome P450 protein, CYP27B1. Certain Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signals also can increase the expression of VDRs. The active form of vitamin D induces monocyte proliferation and the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and cathelicidin (an antimicrobial peptide) by macrophages, contributing to innate immune responses to some bacteria. 1,25(OH)VD decreases DC maturation, inhibiting upregulation of the expression of MHC class II, CD40, CD80, and CD86. In addition, it decreases IL-12 production by DCs while inducing the production of IL-10. In T cells, 1,25(OH)VD reduces the production of IL-2, IL-17, and interferon-γ (IFNγ) and attenuates the cytotoxic activity and proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The active metabolite of vitamin D might also promote the development of forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory ( ) cells and IL-10-producing regulatory type 1 (TR1) cells. 1,25(OH)VD blocks B cell proliferation, plasma cell differentiation, and immunoglobulin production. Notable in the context of this review, many of the mechanisms of vitamin D on immune processes have similarities to mechanisms described for interferon-beta []. Definition of Vitamin D Deficiency and Targeted Levels of Vitamin D The clinical definition of vitamin D deficiency and what constitutes optimal levels has been the subject of debate. Two organizations, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Endocrine Society, have released separate recommendations regarding vitamin D requirements [, , ]. Blood levels of 25(OH)D as suggested by the IOM and the Endocrine Society and the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) by both organizations are provided in Table  [, , ]. The foundational basis for the recommendations by these two organizations are fundamentally different. The IOM guidelines based their recommendation on a population model and focused on bone health (calcium absorption, bone mineral density, and osteomalacia/rickets) aiming to prevent vitamin D deficiency in 97.5% of the general population. Based on the model applied, no evidence was found that a serum 25(OH)D concentration > 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) had beneficial effects at a population level. Therefore, the IOM concluded that the daily requirements for vitamin D were adequate to reach the “sufficient” 25(OH)D level of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and that these levels were generally attained by most of the population [, ]. Alternatively, the Endocrine Society concluded that a level of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) was not sufficient. The Endocrine Society based their recommendations on a medical model taking into consideration available evidence on skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, in addition to the few negative studies. Moreover, they took into consideration the low toxicity potential of vitamin D supplementation. In their view, serum 25(OH)D levels of ≥ 30 ng/mL (≥ 75 nmol/L) are “sufficient” for children and adults, levels of 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L) are “ideal” (considering assay variability), and levels of up to 100 ng/mL (250 nmol/L) could be considered “safe” [, ]. The Endocrine Society advocates for screening and corrective action for individuals at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Such individuals include African American and Hispanic children and adults; pregnant and lactating women; older adults with a history of falls or nontraumatic fractures; obese children and adults (BMI > 30 kg/m); and patients with musculoskeletal diseases, chronic kidney disease, hepatic failure, malabsorption syndromes, and some lymphomas []. Furthermore, the group recommends supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable-upper-limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances (Table ) [, , , ]. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D and the tolerable-upper-limit levels vary with age and under certain circumstances such as those involving pregnancy, obesity, or comorbidities. A daily dose of 600–800 IU should satisfy the requirements for optimal bone health [], but a higher intake (1000–2000 IU) is needed to achieve and maintain 25(OH)D levels > 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) []. Vitamin D supplements can be administered daily, weekly, monthly, or every 4 months to reach an adequate serum 25(OH)D concentration. For cases of extreme vitamin D deficiency, a bolus application of vitamin D has been proposed, but a steady-state serum 25(OH)D concentration is more likely to be maintained by more frequent, lower doses of vitamin D []. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is widely preferred over vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), as it has proven to be the more potent form of vitamin D in all primate species, including humans []. Vitamin D supplementation at doses of 1500–2000 IU/day for adults as suggested by the Endocrine Society appears to be well tolerated, with relatively minor concerns about toxicity for most patients []. Caution should be exercised in patients with impairment of renal function, cardiovascular diseases, chronic granuloma-forming disorders (sarcoidosis or tuberculosis), or chronic fungal infections. Some patients with lymphoma have activated macrophages that produce 1,25(OH)VD in an unregulated fashion. 1,25(OH)VD stimulates intestinal calcium absorption []. Without vitamin D, only 10–15% of dietary calcium and about 60% of phosphorus are absorbed. Vitamin D sufficiency enhances absorption of calcium by 30–40% and phosphorus by 80% [, , ]. Vitamin D intoxication is characterized by hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia and in the long term, can lead to soft tissue and vascular calcification and nephrolithiasis []. After review of available literature, the Endocrine Practice Guidelines Committee concluded that vitamin D toxicity is a rare event caused by inadvertent or intentional ingestion of excessively high amounts of vitamin D []. Concerns were expressed for people with 25(OH)D levels of 150 ng/mL (375 nmol/L) or higher, when daily doses of vitamin D exceed 10,000 IU or when high intake of vitamin D is combined with high intake of calcium. A dose-ranging study reported that 10,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 for 5 months in healthy men did not alter their serum calcium or their urinary calcium excretion, which is the most sensitive indicator for potential vitamin D intoxication []. However, there is a paucity of evidence supporting the use of higher levels of vitamin D over a prolonged time []. Safety findings in three studies conducted in patients with MS using doses of vitamin D above 10,000 IU/day are noteworthy. One open-label trial of vitamin D in patients with MS evaluated the safety of a dose-escalation protocol from 4000 to 40,000 IU/day (mean of 14,000 IU/day). Concomitantly, patients received 1200 mg of calcium per day . a control group (allowed up to 4000 IU/day of vitamin D and supplemental calcium if desired) over 1 year []. All calcium-related measures within and between groups were normal. Despite a mean peak 25(OH)D level of 165 ng/mL (413 nmol/L), no significant adverse events occurred. The safety results were in line with a previously conducted, smaller study in 12 patients with MS also using doses of up to 40,000 IU []. In the third study, 15 patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) were supplemented with 20,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 for 12 weeks []. The median vitamin D level increased from 50 nmol/L (range: 31–175 nmol/L) at week 0–380 nmol/L (range: 151–535 nmol/L) at week 12 ( < 0.001). All patients completed the observation period without side effects, hypercalcemia, or hypercalciuria []. There are cases in the literature in which exceptionally high doses (considerably above the daily upper limit of 10,000 IU) led to vitamin D toxicity: Bell and coworkers described a 67-year-old woman with vitamin D intoxication. Because of a compounding error by the pharmacy, the woman had taken 600,000 IU (rather than the intended 600 IU) of cholecalciferol daily for more than 3 years, leading to reversible hypercalcemia and partially reversible renal impairment []. Fragoso and colleagues reported considerable vitamin D toxicity in 21 MS patients who were exposed to levels ranging from 8000 IU/day to extremely high, supra-physiological doses of 150,000 IU/day (average 87,000 IU) []. In order to assess the correlation between vitamin D and MS, a literature search of large, prospective, observational studies, epidemiological studies, and studies using new approaches such as Mendelian randomization was conducted. This article is based on previously conducted studies, and as such, does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors. Since vitamin D was proposed as an important factor in MS development in the 1970s, numerous experimental and epidemiologic studies have been conducted to answer key questions such as Does vitamin D prevent MS? How does vitamin D impact MS activity? and Can vitamin D supplementation favorably alter the course of MS? Observational study data does suggest that adequate vitamin D levels may reduce the risk of MS and affect the course of the disease. However, study limitations restrict the extent to which inverse associations can be attributed to vitamin D, and additional studies are needed to further understand the nature of this association []. Epidemiologic studies substantiate that the prevalence of MS is greater at higher latitudes and tends to peak in areas with the lowest exposure to ultraviolet light [,,,,,]. Additionally, to some degree, diets rich in vitamin D-containing oily fish may offset this risk [, ]. In “historical” cohorts, the risk of MS decreased among people who migrate from higher to lower latitudes []. However, this latitudinal finding has appeared to decline in recent decades and may be linked to an increased trend towards avoiding sun exposure or staying indoors for longer portions of the day, even in warmer climates [, ]. An Australian case–control study examined whether leisure sun exposure, combined with 25(OH)D status impacts the risk of a first demyelinating event and whether this was related to a latitude gradient []. Independently, higher levels of sun exposure (past, recent, and cumulative), higher actinic skin damage and higher 25(OH)D levels were associated with significantly reduced risks of a demyelinating event. The investigators calculated that the differences in leisure sun exposure, serum 25(OH)D level, and skin type would additively account for a 32.4% increase in the incidence of first demyelinating events from the low to high latitude regions in Australia []. The independent association of sun exposure and MS risk suggests that UV light itself may influence MS risk. Partially supporting this is research that showed that experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) could be prevented in mice through whole-body irradiation with UV light []. However, this research did not discriminate between vitamin D-related and nonrelated effects of UV light. The research did note that in the Northern Hemisphere, significantly more people with MS are born in May (9.1%), when there is less sunlight during pregnancy than in November (8.5%), when there is an increased amount of sunlight []. Some argue that this is an artifact of more births during certain months [] though others disagree []. Using data from two large cohorts of the Nurses’ Health Study involving more than 187,000 women (including 300 who developed MS during the study), Munger and colleagues evaluated the association between calculated vitamin D intake from diet or supplements and the risk of developing MS []. Women who had a higher intake of dietary vitamin D (approximately 700 IU/day) had a 33% lower incidence of MS compared with those with lower intake. In addition, women who used vitamin D supplements (≥ 400 IU/day) had a 41% reduced risk of developing MS compared to non-users. Having higher levels of 25(OH)D (irrespective of dietary vitamin D intake) also seems to predict a lower risk of MS onset. Using a longitudinal study design, Munger and colleagues evaluated serum vitamin D levels derived from blood samples of seven million US military personnel. Those with 25(OH)D levels greater than 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) had a 62% lower chance of subsequently developing MS []. Vitamin D Levels During Pregnancy and MS Risk in Offspring The Finnish Maternity Cohort is a comprehensive registry, established in 1983, that includes more than 800,000 women and more than 1.5 million serum samples. This cohort also served as a basis for examining the association of vitamin D levels during pregnancy and MS risk []. One hundred ninety-three patients with a diagnosis of MS, whose mothers were captured in the registry and had an available serum sample from the pregnancy with the affected child, were matched with 326 controls. Vitamin D levels were low in both groups, but lower in the mothers of MS patients than in controls [34.6 nmol/L (13.9 ng/mL) vs. 37.5 nmol/L (15.0 ng/mL);  = 0.006]. Moreover, MS risk was 90% higher in the offspring of vitamin D-deficient mothers [25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L (12.0 ng/mL)] compared with offspring of mothers who were not vitamin D deficient [relative risk, 1.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.20–3.01;  = 0.006] []. These data suggest that insufficient vitamin D levels during pregnancy may increase the risk of MS []. The association between neonatal 25(OH)D status and risk of MS was examined in a large population-based case–control study using data from the nationwide Danish MS Registry and the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank (DNSB) []. Data from 521 patients with MS and 972 controls were investigated. The analysis by quintiles revealed individuals with the highest risk of MS were in the lowest quintile group of 25(OH)D (< 20.7 nmol/L), and individuals the lowest risk were in the highest quintile group (≥ 48.9 nmol/L); with an odds ratio for highest vs. lowest group of 0.53 (95% CI 0.36–0.78). Children born with 25(OH)D levels < 30 nmol/L seemed to be at an especially high risk of developing MS. The additional benefits of higher levels of 25(OH)D were less pronounced []. Studies Utilizing Mendelian Randomization to Measure MS Risk Data on vitamin D and risk of MS have been largely based on observational studies that measure an inverse association. However, MS is identified as the primary cause of low 25(OH)D) and thus cannot be excluded with these methods. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses use genetic associations to test the effects of biomarkers, such as 25(OH)D, on the risk of disease, because inherited alleles are not affected by most confounding variables or disease status [, ]. Thus, the possibility of confounding or reverse causation can largely be excluded. Three recent publications made use of this epidemiological approach. Mokry and colleagues applied genome-wide data on genetic variants that predicted blood 25(OH)D levels from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study to participants in the International MS Genetics Consortium study []. They found that a genetically determined decrease in blood 25(OH)D level predicted increased MS susceptibility. An increase of 25(OH)D levels by 50% decreased the odds of getting MS by approximately 50% [, ]. Similar findings were seen from MR analyses using data from two populations, a US administrative claim database and two population-based case–control studies from Sweden []. The third publication, from the Network of Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Centers, again investigated the US and Swedish datasets []. Genetic risk scores were used to estimate the causal association between low 25(OH)D levels and pediatric-onset MS. This data also supports independent and causal effects of decreased 25(OH)D levels on susceptibility to pediatric-onset MS []. Studies Contradicting the Association of Vitamin D Levels with MS Risk Ueda and colleagues investigated the link between vitamin D status at birth and risk of adult-onset MS in a population-based, multicenter, case–control study in Sweden []. The authors analyzed stored neonatal dried blood samples of 459 MS subjects and 663 controls (matched on sex, age, and residential area). There was no association between neonatal serum 25(OH)D quintiles and risk of MS as adults. When the findings were adjusted for confounding factors in early life (e.g., month of birth, latitude of birth, and breastfeeding), in adult life (e.g., sun exposure, intake of vitamin D-rich dairy products, fatty fish consumption, smoking, and body mass index at 20 years of age), ancestry, MS heredity, and socioeconomic group, results were not considerably affected []. Whether the study provided conclusive results was the subject of debate for two primary reasons: (1) blood samples at birth were not well preserved and may have been affected by substantial degradation of 25(OH)D; and (2) the range of 25(OH)D levels at birth was narrow and mostly low (mean = 29.7 nmol/L, median = 25.6, interquartile range = 17.0–38.4 nmol/L) []. Optic neuritis (ON) is a common first symptom of MS. Pihl-Jensen and coworkers conducted a cross-sectional study to assess whether 25(OH)D levels can predict later development of MS in acute ON by evaluating the differences in mean serum 25(OH)D levels between subjects with ON ( = 164) and those with MS ( = 948) []. Deseasonalized serum 25(OH)D levels of the ON onset group were used for statistical analyses. The majority (56.1%) of the patients had 25(OH)D levels below 50 nmol/L (mean 47.64 ± 21.48 nmol/L). There were no significant differences in 25(OH)D levels between ON subjects who developed MS and those who did not develop MS during the median follow-up time of 741 days ( = 0.279), indicating no statistically significant effect on the hazard of MS development. However, significant associations were found between 25(OH)D levels and elevated IgG index levels or CSF pleocytosis, both markers of inflammatory activity or risk of MS. The interpretation of the latter finding was difficult due to the risk of reverse causation. Although the role of using 25(OH)D levels as a predictor for the development of MS after acute ON could not be demonstrated, the study data do suggest that there may be a link between development of MS after acute ON. They also provide a rationale for additional research for a possible role of vitamin D in the early stages of MS []. Levels of Dietary Vitamin D Intake and Risk of MS–Implications for Public Health Whether a daily dose of vitamin D or a gestational dose of vitamin D per day is not yet proven []. Additionally, it is not known what level of serum 25(OH)D would prevent MS in a large majority of individuals. Most studies in this review reported 25(OH)D levels below 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) in a significant proportion of their investigated populations, which is below the healthy minimum level. Indicating that establishing a target in the general population general population, pregnant women, and their offspring to achieve the minimum levels of 25(OH)D may be considered an important goal for health (i.e., 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL), according to IOM [, ] or 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), according to the Endocrine Society) [, ]. Effects of Vitamin D Status and MS Disease Activity Understanding how existing vitamin D levels and vitamin D exposure affect clinical relapses and MS lesion activity is critically important to this review. As such, the findings from larger studies investigating these effects are summarized below. Impact of Vitamin D Levels on Disease Activity in RRMS: Observational Studies In a prospective longitudinal study from the Netherlands, 25(OH)D was measured every 8 weeks for a mean of 1.7 years in 73 patients with RRMS []. Fifty-eight patients experienced a total of 139 exacerbations during the study period. Relapse risk was significantly reduced in those with medium [50–100 nmol/L (20–40 ng/mL)] and high [> 100 nmol/L (> 40 ng/mL)] serum vitamin D levels (vs. < 50 mol/L or 20 ng/mL) compared to those with low levels []. For each doubling of serum vitamin D concentration from baseline of 10, 20, 30, MS relapse risk decreased by 27%. Although this suggests a beneficial effect of vitamin D on MS, it must be noted that there is also a possibility that conditions associated with MS relapse had an effect on serum vitamin D levels []. Incident rate ratios (RR) for relapse in relation to serum vitamin D levels were measured in a retrospective study of 110 patients with pediatric-onset MS []. After adjusting for several factors (age, gender, race, ethnicity, disease duration, and treatment), the authors found that every 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) increase in 25(OH)D level was associated with a 34% decrease in relapse risk. Similar findings were seen in a prospective cohort study from Tasmania, Australia, in a group of 145 adults with RRMS, in which 25(OH)D levels were measured twice a year for a period of 3 years []. For each 10 nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D level, there was an associated 12% lower risk of MS relapse. Adjustment for potential confounders, such as timing of the blood testing, did not affect the results. Most of the participants in this study (82%) were receiving immunomodulatory therapy. The authors concluded that raising 25(OH)D levels by 50 nmol/L could decrease the hazard of a relapse by up to 50% (Fig. ) []. The EPIC natural history study was a 5-year cohort study conducted at the University of California, San Francisco which sought to determine the associations between serum or plasma vitamin D levels and MRI activity in a group of 469 white, mostly non-Hispanic patients with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) []. Sixty-four percent received disease-modifying therapy within the previous 12 months. Vitamin D levels increased significantly during the study, especially for those patients using supplements. Only 9% of patients were taking vitamin D supplements at baseline, but 43% were taking them by year 5. Patients who reported using vitamin D supplements had an 8.7 ng/mL (21.75 nmo/L) higher vitamin D level, on average, compared with those who did not. Additionally, lower vitamin D levels were strongly associated with development of new T2 lesions and with contrast-enhancing lesions on brain MRI. Each additional 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) increment of 25(OH)D was associated with a 15% lower risk of new T2 lesions and a 32% lower risk of enhancing lesions (Fig. ) []. Higher vitamin D levels were associated with a lower (but not statistically significantly) risk of MS relapses. Findings from this study also showed strong “within-person” effects of vitamin D levels in individual patients with MS. The authors concluded that “individuals with CIS/RRMS with higher vitamin D levels are at much lower risk of the subsequent development of new lesions and of gadolinium (Gd+)-enhancing lesions on brain MRI, even after accounting for potential confounding factors” []. More recently, Mowry and colleagues examined the association of vitamin D levels with brain volume measures and new lesions in patients with CIS ( = 65) []. The scientific rationale for these data are based on the concept that brain volume is thought to reflect neurodegeneration better than classical MRI parameters such as T2 lesion load and Gd+-enhancing lesions []. Each 25-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D level was associated with 7.8-mL higher gray matter volume ( = 0.025). Higher levels of 25(OH)D also were associated with the composite endpoint of ≥ 3 new brain T2 lesions or ≥ 1 relapse within 1 year ( = 0.096). Despite the limitations of the small sample size, these findings suggest that higher vitamin D levels in CIS may slow neurodegeneration []. Lower vitamin D levels also correlate with other surrogates of MS disease activity, including lower odds of remaining relapse free in MS [], greater disability and disease severity in MS [, ,,], conversion from CIS to clinically definite MS (CDMS) [], and poorer nonverbal long-term memory performance []. These data were largely generated by observational studies that restrict the extent to which inverse associations can be attributed specifically to vitamin D. Properly designed and conducted clinical trials are needed to further define the nature of this association. Impact of Vitamin D Levels on Disease Activity Based on Post-Hoc Analyses from BENEFIT and BEYOND To our knowledge, no large randomized, double-blind, controlled, prospectively phase 3 trials have been conducted to study the impact of vitamin D levels on MS activity as a primary endpoint. However, in two phase 3 studies, the BENEFIT study [], and the BEYOND study [] post hoc analyses were conducted to investigate this potential link. The BENEFIT (Betaseron in Newly Emerging Multiple Sclerosis for Initial Treatment) study was a randomized trial originally designed to evaluate the impact of early versus delayed IFNB-1b treatment in patients with CIS [,,]. Patients with a first event suggestive of MS and a minimum of two clinically silent lesions on MRI were randomly assigned to receive interferon beta-1b (IFNB-1b) 250 μg ( = 292; early treatment) or placebo ( = 176; delayed treatment) subcutaneously every other day for 2 years or until diagnosis of CDMS, in which case they could switch to IFNB-1b therapy. All patients were then eligible to enter a prospective follow-up phase with open-label IFNB-1b for up to 5 years after randomization. Patients and study personnel remained unaware of initial treatment allocation throughout the study up to year 5. During the observation period, regular study visits were scheduled to collect clinical and MRI data, with visits at baseline and months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 []. A post hoc analyses aimed to determine whether vitamin D status [serum 25(OH)D levels] would predict disease activity and prognosis up to 5 years after the first attack in early-disease CIS patients []. Serum samples were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months and levels of 25(OH)D were measured (by ELISA). Of the 468 patients included in BENEFIT, 465 patients had at least one 25(OH)D measurement, 417 had two or more, 396 had three or more, and 303 had all four measurements. 25(OH)D levels were seasonally adjusted to obtain an estimate of long-term 25(OH)D status. To minimize the possibility that lower 25(OH)D levels were a consequence, rather than the cause, of MS severity, the cumulative average 25(OH)D levels at 12 months were related to the outcomes between 12 and 60 months or between 24 and 60 months (thereby allowing inserting a 1-year lag between 25[OH]D measurements and the assessment of MS activity or progression) []. Three sets of analyses were performed: (1) continuous 50-nmol/L (20-ng/mL) increments to determine the overall linear trend; (2) quintiles to explore the dose response; and (3) categorical analysis using ≥ 50 nmol/L versus < 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) []. Findings indicated that patient characteristics affected vitamin D levels. Those with higher (seasonally adjusted) 25(OH)D levels tended to be younger and to have a lower body mass index (BMI), a lower number of T2 lesions, and a higher brain volume at the CIS stage, but otherwise were similar to patients with lower levels of 25(OH)D []. Over the 5-year follow-up period, 81.3% (377 patients) converted to MS according to the McDonald 2001 criteria that include MRI lesions [] and 46.6% (216 patients) converted to CDMS based on exacerbations or progression alone. The hazard of conversion decreased with increasing serum 25(OH)D and mean serum 25(OH)D levels at 12 months predicted subsequent conversions to McDonald MS ( = 0.02) and CDMS ( = 0.05) []. An increasing serum 25(OH)D level was associated with a decreasing rate of new active lesions on MRI; this effect was particularly strong in patients with both 6- and 12-month serum 25(OH)D measurements. A 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) increment in average serum 25(OH)D levels within the first 12 months predicted a 57% lower rate of new active lesions (RR, 95% CI: 0.43 (0.26–0.70),  < 0.001) and a 57% lower relapse rate (RR (95% CI): 0.43 (0.20–0.92,  = 0.03). In evaluating the potential progression of MS on MRI, higher levels of serum 25(OH)D were associated with less T2 lesion volume accumulation over time. For a 50 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D, the relative decrease in T2 lesion volume was 20% per year ( < 0.001). Restricting results to patients with both 6-month and 12-month serum 25(OH)D measures, tended to strengthen results []. The dichotomous analysis of serum 25(OH)D levels (< 50 vs. ≥ 50 nmol/L) is shown in Fig.  []. For instance, the percentage loss of brain volume over time was lower in patients with 25(OH)D levels ≥ 50 nmol/L at the 12-month time point compared with those with serum 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L ( = 0.005). Although a 50 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D levels did not reach significance for a reduction in the average expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score ( = 0.11), patients with serum 25(OH)D levels ≥ 50 nmol/L had a significantly lower annualized change in EDSS score compared with those patients with serum 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L ( = 0.004) while on IFN-b-1b. Across all analyses, associations were generally stronger for MRI than for clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, “the latter were still remarkable considering the overall low rate of relapses (0.2 per year) and small EDSS score change (median change, 0.0) in BENEFIT” []. Strengths of the BENEFIT study included (1) its longitudinal design, (2) the exclusive recruitment of patients at the CIS stage, (3) the use of repeated serum 25(OH)D measurements, (4) the large number of patients, (5) standardized treatment (e.g., early vs. late IFNB-1b), and (6) rigorous clinical and MRI assessment of all patients during a 5-year period. Limitations of the study included (1) the fact that most patients were eventually treated with IFNB-1b and some crossed over during the 2 years of the study, and (2) while a clear dose response was observed for the most sensitive MRI outcomes, the effects did not reach a plateau level, and, therefore, serum 25(OH)D levels greater than the median 69 nmol/L could have had a greater effect. According to the authors, a low 25(OH)D level early in the disease course is a strong risk factor for long-term MS activity and progression in patients with early MS who were treated with IFNB-1b []. The BENEFIT cohort had an early treatment group and a delayed treatment group. The associations of 25(OH)D levels and MS activity were more pronounced for patients in the early treatment group than for those in the delayed treatment group (Table  [] and Fig.  []), although a test for interaction between 25(OH)D levels and treatment assignment was significant only for the time to CDMS ( = 0.04) []. These results suggest that early treatment with IFNB-1b may have an additive effect along with 25(OH)D to reduce disease severity and progression in both clinical and imaging outcomes. To explore the mechanistic rationale for the potential additive effects of 25(OH)D levels and early IFNB-1b treatment, Munger and colleagues conducted a global gene expression analysis in which expression profiles were measured at various time points among participants in the BENEFIT clinical trial []. The relationship between genes or gene sets expressed in association with 25(OH)D and those associated with MS activity was examined. The numbers of Gd+-enhancing lesions served as a marker of disease activity. A 50 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH) levels reduced the Gd+ lesion count by 55%. Adjusting for gender, age, treatment, and treatment − 25(OH)D interaction did not alter the significance of the findings. Gene expression in whole blood was studied in 295 individuals, evaluating approximately 19,000 genes. Reduced Gd+ lesion count was significantly associated with increased expression of 25(OH)D-related genes, an effect that was independent of IFNB-1b treatment. This effect was also noticed when looking at single genes that were associated with regulation of 25(OH)D levels. The authors hypothesized that there was an additive effect of 25(OH)D and IFNB-1bin reducing Gd+ lesion counts []. The second data set from randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials in MS was derived from the BEYOND (Betaseron Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose) study []. Compared with the BENEFIT study, the BEYOND study included patients with established MS (vs. patients with CIS) and was shorter in duration (2 vs. 5 years). It also included considerably more patients (1482 vs. 465) and was conducted in different geographical regions (North America, Western and Eastern Europe, Southern Hemisphere vs. Europe and Canada). BEYOND was a large, phase 3, prospective, multicenter, blinded, randomized clinical trial. Patients were monitored for at least 2 years. Clinical visits were scheduled every 3 months, and an MRI was performed at baseline and annually thereafter. A post hoc analysis assessed 25(OH)D levels and the subsequent MS disease course and disease progression as characterized by MRI and clinical endpoints []. Eligible patients for the vitamin D analyses included 1482 participants randomized to receive 250, or 500 μg of IFNB-1b with at least two measurements of 25(OH)D obtained 6 months apart. Serum 25(OH)D measurements were performed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. In longitudinal analyses, 25(OH)D was inversely correlated with the cumulative number of active lesions between baseline and the last MRI (average follow-up time, 2 years). A 50-nmol/L higher level of serum 25(OH)D was associated with a 31% lower rate of new lesions [relative rate (RR), 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55–0.86;  = 0.001]. This inverse association was also strong and significant in analyses restricted to patients with 25(OH)D levels > 50 nmol/L (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46–0.84;  = 0.002) and was consistent in each of the four geographic regions (Fig. ) []. The lowest rate of new lesions was observed among patients with 25(OH)D levels > 100 nmol/L (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37–0.78;  = 0.002). No significant associations were found between 25(OH)D levels and change in brain volume, relapse rates, or EDSS scores []. Strengths of this study include the large number of participants, the regionally diverse population with varying baseline characteristics, and the repeated measurements of 25(OH)D, which helped characterize patients’ long-term vitamin D status. The relatively short follow-up is the most important limitation of this study. This limited follow-up may explain the lack of association between serum 25(OH)D levels and measures of brain atrophy or clinical endpoints, both of which were modified by 25(OH)D in the longer BENEFIT study [, ]. Regarding targeted vitamin D levels, the authors stated: “Our observation of the lowest level of MS activity among patients with serum 25(OH)D levels above 100.0 nmol/L [40 ng/mL] is consistent with the results of a previous investigation in the US [], and suggests that the 25(OH)D levels in most patients with MS who are not receiving supplemental vitamin D may be suboptimal” []. Effects of Disease-Modifying Therapies on Vitamin D Levels in MS Patients MS disease activity may be additively affected by vitamin D and IFNB-1b []. This hypothesis is supported by investigations from the same researchers suggesting that processes regulated and triggered by 25(OH)D may be additively enhanced by IFNB-1b [], and independently by observations from Stewart and colleagues from the Menzies Research Institute in Tasmania []. In an observational cohort study, conducted in 178 patients with MS, vitamin D levels were measured every 6 months over an average of 2.2 years. Patients who took an interferon had significantly higher 25(OH)D levels than those who did not ( < 0.001). Each 10-nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D was associated with a 10% lower relapse rate. Interestingly, interferon treatment was protective only against relapse among persons with higher vitamin D levels. Among those with insufficient vitamin D, there was an increased risk of relapse despite interferon treatment. The investigators hypothesized that treatment with IFNB may increase serum vitamin D levels through enhanced responsiveness to sun exposure and recommended that persons being treated with IFNB should have vitamin D status monitored and maintained in the sufficiency range []. Also, noteworthy from these data, this group did not find similar associations for glatiramer acetate (GA) therapy and vitamin D. The notion of complementary or even synergistic effects of IFNB and vitamin D is further supported by observations from Rotstein and coworkers based on the CLIMB (Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of MS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital) cohort []. The CLIMB cohort is a prospective cohort study that began enrolling patients in 2000. The objective of the study was to determine whether 25(OH)D levels predicted new disease activity in MS patients treated with IFN-β ( = 96) or GA ( = 151). Separately, due to different selection criteria, a similar analysis was conducted for patients treated with fingolimod (FTY,  = 77). Serum 25(OH)D concentration was adjusted for season, and patients were divided into subgroups by 25(OH)D tertile. The primary study endpoint was ‘time to first inflammatory event’, defined as a combination of either first relapse or first Gd+ lesion, using a Cox model adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration. The results demonstrated higher 25(OH)D levels associated with a longer time to the combined first event in the IFNB subgroup [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.58;  = 0.012], but not in GA-treated participants (HR = 0.89;  = 0.50). For Gd+ lesions alone, there was a significant association observed in GA and IFNB subgroups, although the effect was more pronounced with IFNB (HR = 0.57;  = 0.039 vs. HR = 0.41;  = 0.022). No significant associations were found for relapses. There were some sampling difficulties in this cohort and, therefore, the results need to be interpreted with certain caution. For FTY, due to the mandated first-dose observation, samples were available for all patients. Higher 25(OH)D was associated with a longer time to the first event (HR = 0.48;  = 0.016) and with relapses (HR = 0.50;  = 0.046), but not with Gd+ lesions []. The large, prospective cohort and the prolonged follow-up times were strengths of this study, as well as the availability of two 25(OH)D measurements for the majority of patients. However, more regular 25(OH)D measurements would have been ideal and offered greater insights into study conclusions []. Studies Contradicting the Association of Vitamin D Levels with Disease Activity Contradictory to the aforementioned information are findings reported by researchers from Norway []. In this small prospective cohort study, 88 patients with RRMS were followed with regular MRI and 25(OH)D measurements during 6 months before and up to 18 months after initiation of IFNB. During the pre–IFNB treatment phase, higher levels of 25(OH)D were associated with reduced MRI activity; each 10-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D was associated with 12.7% ( = 0.037) lower odds for new T1 Gd + lesions, 11.7% ( = 0.044) lower odds for new T2 lesions, and 14.1% ( = 0.024) lower odds for combined unique activity. However, there was no association between 25(OH)D and disease activity after initiation of IFNB. With clinical measures, neither the occurrence of relapses nor EDSS progression was associated with 25(OH)D levels during both study phases. Strengths of the study were the prospective design and the frequent MRI and 25(OH)D assessments during the observation period. Limitations were the relatively short time on IFNB and the small number of participants, as well as the minimal 4 nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D levels following vitamin D supplementation. In the discussion of the study results, the authors expressed their surprise about the lack of an association between 25(OH)D levels and MRI after initiation of IFNB, “as there is no evidence suggesting that the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D are counteracted by IFNB or vice versa. A reasonable explanation is that IFNB reduced radiologic disease activity, leaving relatively little left to be reduced” by vitamin D []. When reviewing available data discussing the effects of vitamin D and MS, of key interest is whether vitamin D supplementation can favorably alter the course of MS. Unfortunately, current evidence does not offer consensus to answer this question. Studies with vitamin D alone or with vitamin D as an add-on to a disease-modifying therapy are conflicting [, ,,,,,,,,,,]. Although these studies are generally small, largely uncontrolled, and used highly variable doses of vitamin D, it can be noted that there are initial promising data arguing for vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS [, ,,,,,,]. Furthermore, recent investigations with immunological response markers suggest that vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS [], and lacking evidence of a treatment effect does not necessarily demonstrate proof of no effect. Studies Supporting the Benefit of Supplemental Vitamin D Researchers from Finland conducted a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with vitamin D3 as an add-on treatment to IFNB-1b in patients with MS. Thirty-four patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group (vitamin D, 20,000 IU/week vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and IFNB-1b) and 32 to the control group (placebo and IFNB-1b) []. The primary outcome measure was an MRI T2 burden of disease (BOD), which tended to increase more in the placebo group (median change of 287 mm) than in the vitamin D group (median change of 83 mm); however, the difference was not statistically significant ( = 0.105) (Fig. ) []. Results for other MRI outcomes were mixed. The number of T1 Gd+ lesions decreased in both groups ( = 0.002), but the change was significantly higher in the vitamin D group ( = 0.04). New/enlarging T2 lesions at the 12-month point trended higher in the placebo group, but the differences were not statistically significant ( = 0.286). The percentage of patients with MRI activity (12-month time point) trended lower in the vitamin D group, but these differences also did not reach significance ( = 0.322). While there was no significant difference in annual relapse rate demonstrated between groups, there was a tendency toward reduced disability accumulation as measured by EDSS ( = 0.071) and toward improved timed tandem walk ( = 0.076). There were no significant differences in adverse events between the groups. The authors concluded that larger randomized, controlled trials with more than 1 year of follow-up are warranted to confirm the promising MRI results and to fully address clinical outcomes []. A study by Burton and colleagues introduced earlier in this manuscript in the context of the safety profile of higher doses of vitamin D supplementation also offers insight into the role of vitamin D supplementation and the disease course of MS []. In this open-label, controlled trial, patients were randomized to a vitamin D treatment group ( = 25, escalation protocol 4000–40,000 IU/day, mean 14,000 IU/day) or to a control group ( = 24, received vitamin D3 4000 IU/day if desired). Despite the high doses of vitamin D, no significant adverse events occurred during the 52-week study period. The annualized relapse rate during the trial year was lower in the treatment group than in the control group (0.26 vs. 0.45;  = 0.09), and more patients in the treatment group remained relapse free. Additionally, the treated patients reported a persistent reduction in T-cell proliferation compared with controls, and treatment group patients appeared to have fewer relapse events and a persistent reduction in T-cell proliferation compared to controls. Study limitations included the use of supplementation or other agents in the control group, the small sample-size, and thus the limited power []. The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center prospectively gathered data in a cohort of 170 natalizumab-treated patients during winter 2009–2010 (baseline) with follow-up during the subsequent winter []. Patients with insufficient serum 25(OH)D levels (selected cut-off 50 nmol/L) at baseline were advised to take Vitamin D supplements according to Danish recommendations: 2000 IU for patients with levels between 25 and 50 nmol/L, 3000 IU for those with levels between 25 and 12.5 nmol/L and 4000 IU for those with levels below 12.5 nmol/L. 134 patients were included in the clinical data set. Of the 134 patients, 43 had taken vitamin D supplements due to vitamin D insufficiency (mean 25(OH)D levels: 34 nmol/L). Their levels increased significantly by 32.6 nmol/L (95% CI: 24.4–40.8 nmol/L,  < 0.0001) from baseline to follow-up. Moreover, a significant inverse relationship with the annualized relapse rate (ARR) was found: for each nmol/l increase in 25(OH)D, a 0.014 (95% CI − 0.026 to − 0.003) decrease in ARR was observed ( = 0.02). Overall, the data suggest that correcting vitamin D insufficiency by the means of vitamin D supplements in patients with MS may be beneficial []. Darwish and colleagues looked into the cognitive effects of vitamin D supplementation of patients with MS on IFNB []. At baseline, patients were stratified into a vitamin D-deficient group (25(OH)D levels < 25 ng/mL or 62.5 nmol/L,  = 39) and a vitamin D-sufficient group (25(OH)D levels > 35 ng/mL or 87.5 nmol/L). “Deficient” patients received 10,000 IU vitamin D3 daily for 3 months and reported a significant increase of 25(OH)D levels to 49.0 ± 14.6 ng/mL (122.5 ± 36.5 nmol/L). Additionally, after 3 months these “deficient” patients scored better on the Brief Visuospatial Memory test delayed recall (BVMT-DR,  = 0.02) and the montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA,  = 0.006), but not on the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) and Stroop. The authors concluded that the lack of significant change on the SDMR and Stroop testing was due to the short disease duration and the propensity for study participants to perform within normal ranges for these tests. Alternatively, “sufficient” patients continued their usual treatment that may have included vitamin D3 supplementation at various dosages. These patients reported 25(OH)D levels at 64.2 ± 18.7 ng/mL (160.5 ± 46.8 nmol/L) at study end. Sufficient 25(OH)D levels predicted better cognitive performance on the BVMT-DR at baseline and 3 months after adjusting for all measured confounding variables. Study limitations included a small study population ( = 88), short study duration (3 months), and a quarter of the patients not returning to the month 3 visit. The authors also described not allowing true control for other sources of vitamin D as other possible confounders, such as sun exposure and dietary vitamin D []. Only available in abstract format are the results of two studies which evaluated the benefits and risks associated with high-dose vitamin D supplementation in patients treated with IFNB-1a. Although both failed to demonstrate an effect on clinical parameters, their MRI results demonstrated positive results. SOLAR is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2 study. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients with a 25(OH)D serum level below 150 nmol/L were randomly assigned to cholecalciferol at a dose of 14,000 IU per day or placebo []. All patients received subcutaneous IFNB-1a. After recruitment delays, the study design was adjusted and the percentage of patients with “disease activity free” status (defined as no relapses, no EDSS progression, and no new Gd+ or T2 MRI lesions) at week 48 were introduced as a new primary endpoint. This endpoint was not met (37.2% for cholecalciferol group vs. 35.3% for placebo group,  = 0.912). Likewise, no differences between groups for other clinical parameters such as ARR or EDSS were found. However, results regarding the MRI parameters were promising with a significant 32% reduction in the number of new, combined, unique active lesions in the cholecalciferol group ( = 0.005). Furthermore, there was a trend toward more cholecalciferol recipients being free from new T1 hypointense lesions, which became significant in those aged 18–30 years. The short duration of the trial (48 weeks) and the relatively small sample size (229 patients) may have led to the lack of significance of the clinical outcomes. For comparisons, most randomized trials of new MS drugs recruited over 800 patients to be able to demonstrate a significant effect vs. placebo. Despite the large sizes, some were not able to show a significant effect on disability progression (e.g. CONFIRM study [] TRANSFORMS []). Additionally, these data are not placebo-controlled, but rather an active comparator. Also, the power analysis is not designed to assess a minor effect and would require > 10,000 patients. Likewise, the second study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study []. One hundred and twenty-nine patients ( = 129) were randomly assigned to receive 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol twice monthly (equivalent to a daily dose of 7143 IU) in addition to IFNB-1a over a 24-month period. Again, significant effects in favor of vitamin D supplementation were found for selected MRI parameters such as new or enlarged weighted T1 and T2 lesion, but no effect was found for clinical parameters []. A preliminary study from Iran conducted by Etemadifar and colleagues assessed the safety and efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in women with MS []. Fifteen pregnant women with confirmed MS and with serum 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) were randomly allocated to received 50,000 IU/week (daily dose of 7143 IU) vitamin D3 or routine care from 12 to 16 weeks of gestation until delivery. 25(OH)D levels increased significantly and no significant adverse events occurred. The women in the vitamin D group had significantly fewer relapses during pregnancy (0 vs. 5;  < 0.05), a tendency for fewer relapses up to 6 months after pregnancy (0 vs. 4; statistically nonsignificant), and a more stable EDSS than those without supplementation. The authors advocated for adding high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation during pregnancy to the routine care of women with MS. Study limitations included a small sample size, and conclusions are limited by the loss to follow-up of 37 out of 52 of the original baseline cohort []. The role of vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS was also evaluated by Jelinek and colleagues, with the authors taking a very different epidemiological approach []. This was an internet survey among 2301 patients with MS who self-reported data on geographical location, intentional sun exposure for health, supplementation with vitamin D, and other lifestyle variables, as well as self-reported doctor-diagnosed relapse rates and disability (Patient Determined Disease Steps). Survey participants were asked to respond to a health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used for comparisons, including multiple linear regression modeling. Nearly two thirds of respondents (64.6%) lived in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in developed countries. Most (82.3%) were female, with a median age of 45 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38–53 years) and a median time since diagnosis of 6 years (IQR: 3–12 years), with the majority (61.6%) having RRMS. More than 80% of the patients indicated that they took vitamin D supplements, mostly between 2000 and 5000 IU daily (Table ) [], and 67% reported intentional sun exposure to raise vitamin D levels. Unadjusted regression modeling incorporating deliberate sun exposure, latitude, and vitamin D supplementation showed strong associations between sun exposure and HRQoL. However, the effect disappeared when controlling for age, disability, physical activity, and fish consumption. In contrast, the associations between supplementation of vitamin D and HRQoL were maintained when adjusting for these variables, with a dose–response effect. The beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on HRQoL was considered to be of “clinically significant magnitude” []. Lower annualized relapse rates were significantly associated with taking vitamin D supplementation vs. not taking supplements. The dose taken seemed to be of less importance. No effect on disability was found for either supplementation or deliberate sun exposure, but an increase of latitude by 1° (farther from the equator) predicted increased odds of moderate or high disability []. The large data set may compensate for some of the limitations of this study design. Vitamin D supplementation (along with all other measures) was self-reported and not validated with blood tests. No validated tool exists for quantifying variables like deliberate sun exposure; in this study, the question required simply a yes/no answer []. Furthermore, there might be a selection bias in terms of the patients included, as respondents to such Internet surveys are patients who are typically very “engaged” with their situation and disease. Studies Contradicting the Benefit of Supplemental Vitamin D A study by Stein and colleagues is widely discussed among those not supporting vitamin D supplementation []. In this 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, patients were allocated to either high or low dose of vitamin D2. The high-dose regimen was 6000 IU twice daily, the low-dose regimen 1000 IU daily. Twenty-three patients were included (11 in the treatment arm, 12 in the control group). There were no significant differences between the groups on the two primary endpoints—cumulative number of new Gd+ lesions and change in the total volume of T2 lesions—nor were there differences on clinical outcome measures, such as number of relapses and effect on EDSS []. , in which the manuscript was published, ranked the study as providing class I evidence, but this rating is arguable. Although the study was double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized, the sample size was very small ( = 23). Moreover, there were withdrawals (two in the low-dose group, one in the high-dose group), and one patient from the low-dose group was partially excluded from MRI analyses due to brain surgery. Although the authors stated that the two groups were well matched, one patient (in the high-dose group) had 38 Gd+ lesions at baseline, while all other patients had between two and five Gd+ lesions at baseline. The low-dose group was, on average, 10.5 years older than the high-dose group; importantly, the number of exacerbations in MS declines over time, biasing the data in favor of the low-dose group. In addition, this study compared low-dose and high-dose vitamin D administration and did not utilize a concurrent control group of subjects that did not receive any supplemental vitamin D. Finally, even though vitamin D2 seems to be a less potent form of vitamin D than vitamin D3 in all primate species [], the 1000-IU/day regimen for the low-dose group is above what the IOM recommends in terms of daily intake [] and both groups may have benefited from vitamin D supplementation. In a 96-week, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with 20,000 IU/week of vitamin D (averaged to approximately 2800 IU/day) on bone mineral density in 35 MS patients, Kampman and colleagues found that consumption of vitamin D did not result in beneficial effects on the measured MS-related outcomes, which included annualized relapse rates. However, the study was not powered to address clinical outcomes []. The authors suggested that the low annualized relapse rate seen at baseline could have contributed to the absence of significant effects in this study. Study limitations included a small sample size ( = 68), which may be inadequate for assessing effects on clinical outcomes []. Furthermore, two studies from Iran did not find a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on clinical or MRI outcome measures in patients with RRMS. Shaygannejad and colleagues studied 50 patients in a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical trial []. The 25 patients in the treatment group received 4000 IU/day of vitamin D for the first 2 weeks and were thereafter escalated to 8000 IU/day in addition to their disease-modifying agent. The control group ( = 25) was treated with placebo combined with disease-modifying therapy. In a separate study, Mosayebi and colleagues evaluated the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation at a dose of 300,000 IU/month vs. placebo in a randomized, prospective study with 62 patients []. Over the 6-month observation period, no differences between groups on either EDSS or Gd+ lesion count were observed, but immune-inhibitory transforming growth factor beta and interleukin 10 were significantly higher in the vitamin D-supplemented group compared with placebo []. Several of the studies above were included in a meta-analysis conducted by James and colleagues evaluating the effect of vitamin D-related intervention trials on MS relapses []. The five studies [, ,,,] included 129 patients with high-dose vitamin D supplementations and 125 controls. Administered doses of vitamin D supplementations, study designs, patient populations, outcome parameters, and observation period were considerably variable among the assessed studies. Given these differences, the numerous limitations of each of these studies and the mixed reported study results, it is not surprising that the meta-analysis did not find a significant association between vitamin D treatment and the relative risk of relapse in MS []. In the view of the authors, “further larger and more prolonged studies…are merited” to better understand the role of vitamin D supplementation in MS []. Ongoing Studies Evaluating the Role of Supplemental Vitamin D in MS A search of recently initiated and ongoing clinical studies evaluating the role of supplemental vitamin D in MS revealed the following: The Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in Multiple Sclerosis (EVIDIMS) study (NCT01440062) [, ] is a German multicenter, stratified, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical phase 2 study. Eighty patients with CIS or MS whose disease courses were stable while taking IFNB-1b were randomized to receive either high-dose (on average, 10,200 IU/day) or low-dose (on average 200 IU/day) vitamin D3 for 18 months as a supplement. The primary outcome measure is the number of new T2 lesions. Secondary endpoints include additional MRI and optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters, clinical parameters, as well as cognition, fatigue, depression, and quality of life. Safety and tolerability of high-dose vitamin D supplementation are additional outcome measures. This study is ongoing, and results are expected in 2018 or 2019. The Vitamin D to Ameliorate Multiple Sclerosis (VIDAMS) study (NCT01490502) [88, 90] is a randomized, controlled, phase 3 study that aims to include 172 patients in the US. After a run-in phase of 1 month on GA, patients will be assigned to low-dose (600 IU/day) vs. high-dose (5000 IU/day) vitamin D3 as an add-on therapy to GA. This academic study is currently recruiting patients and will terminate in 2018 [, ]. Clinical and MRI parameters will also be evaluated. Evidence available to date suggests that the level of serum vitamin D affects the risk of developing MS and also modifies disease activity in MS patients. Until several years ago, evidence that higher levels of vitamin D are associated with favorable effects on MS risk and a reduction in MS activity was supported largely by observational studies. Limitations of these studies restricted confidence in a specific effect of vitamin D in MS. Newer data with Mendelian randomization analyses suggest there is a causal relationship between low vitamin D level and the risk of MS. Furthermore, post hoc evaluations from the phase 3 BENEFIT and BEYOND studies substantiate findings of observational trials. Across all trials, associations between 25(OH) levels and MS and its activity are generally stronger for MRI than for clinical outcomes, which may be due to the higher sensitivity of MRI compared to typical clinical parameters. Low or even insufficient 25(OH)D levels were common in many earlier cohorts. Patients in more recent studies have higher baseline vitamin D levels, potentially changing the immunopathology of MS and altering responses to some therapeutic drugs. In aggregate, studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for patients with MS and others. However, the study limitations identified in this review recognize the need for larger controlled clinical trials to establish vitamin D supplementation as the standard of care for MS patients. Though there is increasing evidence indicating that lower vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk of MS and greater clinical and brain MRI activity in established MS, the impact of vitamin D supplementation on MS activity remains inadequately investigated. There is no consensus on “sufficient” vitamin D levels. In the view of IOM, 25(OH)D levels greater than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) are sufficient. The Endocrine Society argues for 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) or higher, based on a medical model which takes into account skeletal and non-skeletal health. Numerous studies suggest that serum 25(OH)D levels of approximately 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) are the lower limit for controlling MRI and clinical activity in patients with MS. More research is needed to establish the recommended levels of vitamin D supplementation necessary to reduce the risk for MS and MS clinical activity. In conclusion, based on the data reviewed, identification and correction of vitamin D insufficiency with supplementation at recommended doses is a sensible clinical action/course/target/objective and one that provides a favorable risk–benefit profile for vitamin D for most patients with MS.

f09d394f-553e-45f1-adbb-8982bc85af7d,"| Extending Dosing Intervals Reduces Deadly Side Effect Risk from Popular Multiple Sclerosis Drug A New Study Led by NYU Langone Health Multiple Sclerosis Specialists Points to a New Way to Make an Existing Drug Safer for People with the Condition commonly prescribed  infusion medication linked to a rare but serious side effect is safer to use when dosing intervals are extended, according to a new study led by MS specialists NYU Langone Health. The new research showed that extending dosing of natalizumab from every 4 weeks to every 5 to 12 weeks significantly reduced the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection. The authors presented their findings February 2 at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2018 in San Diego. The findings could influence how neurologists prescribe the medication. “Neurologists have been looking for safer ways to administer natalizumab infusions to their patients, but there hasn’t been clear data on whether decreasing dosing frequency improves safety,” says first study author , assistant professor of neurology at NYU School of Medicine and an attending neurologist at NYU Langone’s . “Our safety findings are clinically and statistically significant, and we believe that extending the dosing schedule of natalizumab is practice changing and may save lives.” Natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent MS relapses, improve quality of life, and slow worsening disability. The medication is indicated to be prescribed in 300-milligram infusion doses every 4 weeks. Taking the medication longer than two years, however, may increase the risk for PML, which is caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). There have been 756 PML cases reported worldwide as of January 2018, with a global incidence rate of 4.19 per 1,000 PML cases in people treated with natalizumab. Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high. The new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent. Researchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and the tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions. The new study did not look at drug efficacy comparing extended to standard doses. However,  led by Dr. Zhovtis Ryerson’s group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication’s efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people. The authors are planning prospective efficacy studies of extended dose natalizumab. Natalizumab is manufactured by Biogen Idec and Elan, and sold under the name Tysabri. Biogen provided the researchers access to their data and statistical support. Other infusion disease-modifying therapies approved to treat MS include the drugs alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab. Oral and injectable medications are also prescribed. The study was carried out in collaboration with Biogen and academic collaborators from NYU School of Medicine’s , University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, and Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Clinic in Utah. In addition to Dr. Zhovtis Ryerson, , associate professor of neurology, , professor of population health and environmental medicine, and Xiaochun Li, PhD, research scientist of biostatistics, were co-authors at NYU Langone Health.

e40ccfd5-cae0-4aed-9c49-81247d8a1fb6,"The fact that symptoms flare-up and subside for many people with multiple sclerosis (MS), combined with the wide variety and unpredictability of symptoms, has made MS a difficult disease to recognize, define, and treat – right from the start. Since the late 1300s, individuals with a progressive illness suggestive of MS have been observed. It wasn’t until 1868 that the famous neurologist, , lectured on the features of MS and gave it a name. Charcot was a French scientist, instructor, and physician who is claimed by some to be the founder of modern neurology. He lived during the 1800s and Sigmund Freud was among the famous students he inspired. In addition to the many neurological disorders that he defined and treated, he was also known for his treatment of hysteria with hypnotism, which he believed was hereditary and caused by weaknesses in one’s neurological system. Jean-Martin Charcot was a french neurologist who defined and gave a name to multiple sclerosis in 1868. Throughout the 1800s and 1900s, hundreds of therapies were tried, without success, in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Deadly nightshade (a plant with poisonous fruit), arsenic, mercury, and the injection of malaria parasites, are just a few examples of the types of ineffective and even dangerous therapies that were once given to individuals with MS. In 1951, cortisone (a steroid) was first used to treat MS (also known as exacerbations, attacks, or symptom flare-ups). Cortisone was found to reduce the severity of the relapse and to shorten its duration, but it had no long-term effects on the disease. Presently, more than 20 brand-name and generic medications are now approved for relapsing forms of MS, with some recent approvals that include primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and “active” (with relapses still occurring) secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Research continues into other experimental medications for MS and more approvals are anticipated.

19e6ec2c-f9d6-4434-b197-27529922eeb7,"Retina's Thickness May Be Tied to Severity of MS, Study Suggests If true, it might be a useful tool to measure the effectiveness of treatments MONDAY, Oct. 1, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Using a high-tech imaging process to measure the thickness of the eye's retina may one day predict the progression of multiple sclerosis, a new study suggests. The finding might lead to better ways to judge the effectiveness of treatments because different parts of the retina seem to indicate different aspects of the disease and the toll it takes on different parts of the brain, the researchers said. The report was published online Oct. 1 in the . Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that attacks the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and optic nerves. Symptoms range from mild effects, such as numbness in the limbs, to severe, such as paralysis or blindness. ""In treating multiple sclerosis we have been tremendously successful in reducing the number of attacks,"" said Dr. Ari Green, assistant clinical director of the Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of an accompanying editorial in the journal. That's the inflammatory part of the disease, Green explained. ""We are very successful at treating inflammation in multiple sclerosis. We are less successful in being able to treat or reverse disability,"" he said. Methods that help speed up the testing of therapies are needed if progress in treating the disability caused by MS is going to happen, Green said. And because the retina is part of the central nervous system, it's like a window to the brain and can provide a lot of information about different areas of the brain, he explained. ""If we can figure out how to properly use this imaging [called optical coherence tomography] -- perhaps with other tests -- for predicting disability in multiple sclerosis, we could accelerate therapies that could make a difference in patients' lives,"" Green said. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. It switches images to electric signals and sends them through the optic nerve to the brain. For the new study, the researchers looked at the retinas of 84 patients with multiple sclerosis and compared them with 24 healthy people. ""The inner and outer retinal layer thickness, measured by optical coherence tomography, may reflect global and potentially distinct central nervous system processes in multiple sclerosis,"" said lead researcher Dr. Shiv Saidha, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University. These findings may not be associated with the condition of the eye, but rather with changes in the brain itself, he said. ""If confirmed, the implications of our study findings are that OCT [optical coherence tomography] -- a relatively inexpensive, non-invasive, well-tolerated, reproducible and easily repeatable investigation -- may be a complementary technique to MRI [magnetic resonance imaging], providing useful information regarding the global aspects of the multiple sclerosis disease process,"" Saidha said. The imaging technique may help researchers evaluate the effectiveness of new treatments because their impact might be reflected in changes in the retina, Saidha added. Green said the technique might also have similar potential for other brain diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. ""Everything we have tried to prevent neurodegeneration so far has failed,"" Green said. ""We don't have any treatments in that area that are of proven benefit the way we do in heart disease and cancer. So it's a huge unmet need to treat neurodegenerative disease.""

9be26756-2f1e-4545-aaa8-cef6a08d6097,"Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome). Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue.

AB - Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B 12 deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome). Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue. Five disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These treatments are partially effective in reducing exacerbations and may slow progression of disability.

54577771-adaf-4cdb-a0c1-bac3dd4075c4,"The first three long-term treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) became available in the early to mid 1990s and were dubbed the “A-B-C” drugs because of their brand names: , , and . These are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate, respectively. In 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved another interferon, (interferon beta-1a), for the long-term treatments of MS. This is the same drug as Avonex, but is injected differently and in more frequent and higher doses. In 2009, (interferon beta-1b) was also approved. This is the same medicinal product as Betaseron and is given in the same doses, but is marketed under a different brand name and by a different pharmaceutical company. In 2014, (peginterferon beta-1a) became the 11th DMT approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) – and the fifth interferon medication approved for MS. Plegridy is a pegylated version of interferon beta-1a. Pegylation is a chemical modification of a molecule (in this case the interferon beta-1a molecule) that extends its half-life, which refers to how long a drug stays active in the body before it is metabolized or eliminated. While Copaxone (noted earlier) was initially approved as a daily 20-mg injection, a 40-mg dose of Copaxone injected three-times weekly was approved by the FDA in 2014; physicians and their patients may choose either dose regimen. In April 2015, (glatiramer acetate injection) was approved as the 13th long-term treatment for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Glatopa is a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection), given at the original 20-mg daily dose, and as of February 2018, was also approved at the newer, 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. This is the first generic version of a disease-modifying therapy for MS to be approved by the FDA. In October 2017, was approved at both the 20-mg daily injected dose and the 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. All eight of these self-injected disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) listed above are approved by the FDA for treating either relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or all relapsing forms of MS. Some of these DMTs have also been approved for “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS), which refers to the initial symptom a patient reports prior to a diagnosis of MS. Each of these treatments is administered by self injection at one’s home, with the frequency of injections ranging from once daily to once every two weeks, depending on the drug prescribed. These therapies have been used for several years and research shows that many people are doing well on these medications for extended periods of time (some for more than 20 years). Most side effects (such as flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions) are manageable through various strategies and over-the-counter medications. Blood tests may be given periodically to monitor various items, such as liver enzymes, the number of red blood cells and white blood cells, and the possible development of neutralizing antibodies* (please see note below). In May 2016, (daclizumab) became the 14th disease-modifying therapy to be approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS (RMS) in adults. However, please note that this medication was voluntarily withdrawn from the marketplace in March 2018 by its manufacturers and is no longer available to the MS community. This voluntary withdrawal was due to new safety concerns, including several cases of inflammatory encephalitis and meningoencephalitis (both forms of brain inflammation) that were reported in Europe, as well as earlier issues with liver failure. As background information, this monoclonal antibody was self-administered subcutaneously (under-the-skin) once per month and had been shown to reduce the number of relapses as well as new or newly enhancing lesions, as compared to another approved MS medication and to placebo, in two separate studies. This medication carried safety risks, which included liver injury and immune conditions. The FDA stated that Zinbryta would only be used in patients who had an inadequate response to two or more MS drugs. Zinbryta had a boxed warning, was available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, and monthly liver-function tests were required. In August 2020, the FDA approved (ofatumumab) for adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), which includes clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary-progressive disease. Kesimpta is a B-cell therapy, which binds to and depletes B-cells shown to be associated with disease activity in MS. Typically this type of therapy is only available via infusion at a hospital or infusion center; however, Kesimpta is the first self-administered B-cell therapy for MS. It is given monthly via subcutaneous injection at one’s home. The approval of Kesimpta is based on results from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, in which Kesimpta demonstrated superiority over Aubagio (oral teriflunomide) in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR), three-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 and new or enlarging T2 lesions. The most common side effects of Kesimpta include upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), with symptoms that include sore throat, runny nose, and headache, as well as headache not related to a URTI. Other serious but less-common side effects can occur. In 2000 (prior to the approval of some of the medications mentioned above), (mitoxantrone) was approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of MS. This was the first drug indicated for RRMS, secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and worsening RRMS. Novantrone has been used for many years to treat cancer. It is given via intravenous infusion once every three months. Side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, patients must be closely monitored and are limited to a maximum of two to three years of treatment with this drug. Because of the potential risks and with the approval of more long-term treatments for MS, Novantrone is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Anyone taking Novantrone now or given Novantrone previously needs to have (as noted in this advisory), even if no longer receiving this medication. In 2004, (natalizumab), was approved for relapsing forms of MS. It is administered via intravenous infusion every four weeks. After its initial approval, Tysabri was temporarily suspended after two individuals (taking Tysabri in combination with Avonex) developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which if not discovered early, is an often-fatal viral infection of the brain. Since that time, Tysabri has been re-approved and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” In 2012, the FDA announced that three factors have been identified with increasing the risk of PML for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) being treated with Tysabri. These include: (1) the presence of JC virus antibodies (detected through a blood test); (2) previous treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, such as Novantrone, Imuran, or Cytoxan; and (3) the length of time an individual has been taking Tysabri – specifically beyond the two-year mark. More details are included in MSAA’s article, In November 2014, the FDA announced the approval of (alemtuzumab) for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This is the 12th DMT to be approved for the long-term treatment of MS, and the third intravenous medication for MS. Given for a course of five days via intravenous (IV) infusion and followed one year later by a second three-day course, Lemtrada has been approved as a second-line therapy. This classification refers to a drug that may only be prescribed when other FDA-approved treatments fail or are not tolerated well by a patient. Lemtrada should generally be prescribed for patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more of the disease-modifying therapies, because of the medication’s safety profile. Adverse events from Lemtrada can include infusion reactions to the medication, an increased risk of infection, emergent autoimmune diseases, and other serious conditions. For early detection and management of these risks, Lemtrada is only available through a restricted distribution program, the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). REMS ensures that prescriptions are only given through certified prescribers and that patients are enrolled in this important safety and monitoring program. In March 2017, (ocrelizumab) became the 15th FDA-approved treatment, notably for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS has been approved for two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication has been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Ocrevus is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target CD20-positive B cells. These are a specific type of immune cell that is an important contributor to the MS-disease process. The fact that Ocrevus targets B cells differentiates it from most of the previously approved disease-modifying therapies for MS, which target a different type of immune cell called “T cells.” Side effects can include infusion reactions and an increase in infections. Other rare adverse events, including cancer and PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but these risks are still being investigated. The eighth DMT for MS is (fingolimod), which was approved in September 2010. Pronounced as “Jil-EN-ee-ah,” this is the first oral drug available for the long-term treatment of MS. Until this time, all of the other approved treatments were given either via self injections at home or infusions at a medical facility. The approval of an oral treatment provides a more convenient and comfortable option to some individuals, particularly if they do not respond to or are unable to tolerate the other approved medications. As with the other treatments, Gilenya also has potential side effects and adverse events, including a temporary slowing of the heart rate, edema (swelling) behind the eye, and liver changes. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In May 2018, Gilenya became the first DMT also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. At this time, Gilenya is the only DMT approved for this patient population, referred to as “pediatric MS.” In December 2019, FDA approved the applications from three separate pharmaceutical companies for the first for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS in adult patients. While generic treatments carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved medication, this approval does not include the treatment of children and adolescents. Details on when these generic versions will be available to the MS community have not yet been announced. In September 2012, (oral teriflunomide) became the ninth FDA-approved DMT for relapsing forms of MS — and the second approved DMT that is taken orally. Aubagio has been approved in two dose levels: 7 mg and 14 mg. While the higher dose (14 mg) shows greater effectiveness, for individuals who may be more sensitive to the drug and experience greater side effects, the lower dose (7 mg) may be more appropriate. In October 2014, Phase III data was added to Aubagio’s label, noting that it may (1) reduce the relative risk of sustained disability progression (along with reducing the annual relapse rate) and (2) prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) in individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Common adverse events include headache, elevations in liver enzymes, hair thinning, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia (a condition that reduces the number of certain white blood cells that normally fight infection), and paresthesia (tingling, burning, or numbing sensation). More severe adverse events include the risk of severe liver injury and the risk of birth defects if used during pregnancy. (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) was approved by the FDA as a first-line therapy for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS in March 2013. This is the 10th DMT for the long-term treatment of MS. Tecfidera is administered in pill form orally and is the third oral DMT approved for MS. The approved dosage is 240 mg to be taken two times daily. Clinical trials with Tecfidera showed a reduction in relapse rate, a delay in progression of physical disability, and a slowing in the development of brain lesions, as compared to placebo. The most commonly reported side effects are flushing and gastrointestinal events, occurring more often at the beginning of treatment, and decreasing in frequency after the first one to two months on this medication. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In August 2020, the FDA awarded early approval of (dimethyl fumarate), an oral medication approved in 2013 for relapsing forms of MS in adults (as noted above). This is the first generic of any MS oral treatment available to individuals in the United States. Generic treatments have the same active ingredients and carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved (brand-name) medication. Inactive ingredients can differ with generic medications, and generic treatments are not required to conduct the same degree of rigorous clinical trials prior to approval. Mylan’s generic version of Tecfidera is given in the same dosage, with both 120-mg and 240-mg delayed-release capsules available. In March 2019, (siponimod) oral tablets became the 16th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval includes individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) – a form of MS where someone with RRMS advances to experiencing a more steady increase in disability, but relapses are still occurring. Taken by mouth once daily, Mayzent has been shown to reduce the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), slow the rate of brain volume loss, and reduce the annual relapse rate. Headache, high blood pressure, and changes in liver function tests were the most common adverse reactions reported. Patients taking Mayzent need to be monitored for changes in vision caused by macular edema, transient decreases in heart rate, decline in lung function, and changes in liver enzymes; women who could become pregnant should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping treatment. Also in March 2019, (cladribine) oral tablets became the 17th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval is for individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and for individuals with active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. This oral medication is given in two annual courses for a maximum of 20 days over two years; no treatment is needed for Years 3 and 4. Mavenclad has been shown to reduce disease activity in patients with relapsing MS, including disability progression, annualized relapse rate, and MRI activity. Potential adverse events include lymphopenia, a condition that causes abnormally low counts of white blood cells that play a role in fighting infection, and herpes zoster infection. Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of malignancy (cancer) and fetal harm. The most common adverse reactions include upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and decreased lymphocyte counts. In December 2019, the FDA approved (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This approval includes the treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This medication is taken by mouth twice daily. Vumerity is in the same class of MS therapy as Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but is believed to cause fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects – such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. (ozanimod) was approved in March 2020 for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). This once-daily oral medication is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and joins two other previously approved S1P receptor modulators: Gilenya (fingolimod) and Mayzent (siponimod). However, unlike the first two medications, Zeposia does not require a genetic test or label-based first-dose observation. In clinical trials, Zeposia was shown to have a significant effect on reducing the annual relapse rate (ARR) as well as the number of brain lesions, when compared to Avonex (interferon beta-1a). The most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory infection; elevated liver enzymes; orthostatic hypotension, which is a sudden drop in blood pressure when changing position; urinary tract infection; back pain; and high blood pressure. Warnings and precautions include an increased risk of infections, heart-rhythm issues, liver injury, fetal risk if pregnant while taking Zeposia, a decline in pulmonary (respiratory) function, and macular edema (swelling behind the eye). The launch date for Zeposia has not yet been announced. In April 2020, the FDA approved (monomethyl fumarate) delayed-release oral capsules to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Bafiertam is a “bioequivalent alternative” to Biogen’s Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), which means that the active ingredient and site of action do not differ significantly between the two medications. The therapeutic effect is assumed to be equivalent. Since a lower dose of Bafiertam is equivalent to Tecfidera, this may potentially lead to a reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. However, these side effects have not been evaluated in clinical trials in people with relapsing forms of MS. The launch date for Bafiertam has not yet been announced. Individuals are usually prescribed only one type of DMT during any one time period. Several large clinical trials have been conducted to study each of these drugs separately for their safety and effectiveness in MS. Although differences exist in study design and specific findings, trials generally showed these common results: Reduced the development of new areas of inflammation as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans Showed some evidence of delaying disease progression and/or disability Some may prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) for individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS refers to individuals who do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed with MS, but have experienced symptoms. The documented effectiveness of each of these drugs varies to some extent, and differences can be attributed to the type of the drug, dose and administration, as well as variations in study design. Stronger drugs may offer greater effectiveness but may also pose greater health risks. Additionally, the effectiveness and side effects of each drug may vary from one patient to another, so individuals need to consult with their physician to determine which treatment might be the best option for them. Each of the approved treatments has side effects that are usually manageable. At this time, Novantrone is the only drug that has a set limit of doses, which is necessary to avoid cardiotoxicity (heart damage). Tysabri increases the risk of PML (described above) and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” For early detection and management of potentially severe adverse events, Lemtrada is only available through the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). Patients beginning on Gilenya are monitored for changes in heart rate and are given baseline evaluations for any issues with the heart, lungs, liver, eyes and vision, as well as white-blood-cell count. The other drugs mentioned earlier appear safe provided the person taking the drug is not experiencing any adverse effects and blood tests continue to be normal. While no damage to the reproductive system or the fetus has been observed, these drugs are not recommended if a woman is pregnant or considering pregnancy during her treatment period. Male patients considering certain long-term treatments may want to discuss options for family planning with their doctor. Other treatments are sometimes used to try to slow MS disease progression when other therapies have been ineffective. Such treatments are approved by the FDA for other illnesses, but not specifically for the treatment of MS. These include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy, methotrexate, azathioprine (Imuran), and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). In 2014, the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition (MSC) published two papers detailing the current evidence that supports the FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The first paper was written for medical professionals. The second paper summarizes the information and has been written for members of the MS community. To view either of these papers, please go to the following links: For medical professionals (updated June 2019): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence For members of the MS community (updated March 2017): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence; SUMMARY *Additional information about interferons: Some individuals develop neutralizing antibodies (NABs) to the interferons (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, and Extavia), but their impact on the effectiveness of these medications has not been established. Many continue to do well on these drugs despite the presence of NABs. Others may have sub-optimal results even without NABs present. The MS Council and the American Academy of Neurology have concluded that the higher-dosed interferons are likely to be more effective than lower-dosed interferons. Several factors, however, must be considered when selecting one of these drugs, and this decision must be made on an individual basis under the guidance of a qualified physician. Please note that MSAA does not endorse or recommend any specific drug or treatment. Individuals are advised to consult with a physician about the potential benefits and risks of the different treatment therapies.

bf9bbc7b-35ca-4782-9551-75bade3d0089,"COVID-19 updates, including vaccine information, for our patients and visitors Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. The central nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The precise reason(s) for the inflammation that occurs in MS are not yet known, and this remains an active area of research. We do know that the inflammation damages both neurons and the myelin that insulates neuronal processes (called axons). The loss of myelin is a characteristic feature of MS and forms areas of scar tissue called sclerosis (also called plaques or lesions). When the myelin or nerve fiber is damaged, nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain and spinal cord are distorted or totally blocked. Whereas myelin is capable of partially regenerating with some recovery of nerve function, neurons and their processes (axons) are not able to regenerate once permanently damaged. Progressive or ongoing injury from MS can be measured precisely using an automated image analysis system developed by UC San Diego researchers. Major areas of research include finding ways to protect neurons from permanent injury (called neuroprotective therapy) and how to enhance myelin repair after partial injury. Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 50, although up to one third of patients will be diagnosed at younger or older ages. The initial symptoms of MS are highly variable and often go unrecognized, especially when less severe, as is often the case at the beginning of the disease. Symptoms may go away quickly or last for months. The  progression and severity of MS vary from person-to-person. Paresthesia (burning, prickling or “pins and needles” sensation Spasticity (involuntary muscle spasms and feelings of stiffness) Cognitive changes (may include difficulties with concentration, attention, memory and judgment) Although the subsequent course of MS is unpredictable and apt to changes, certain risk factors for more severe disease have been identified, helping us to make treatment decisions. An exacerbation, also called an attack, flare-up, or relapse, occurs when a person experiences new or worsening symptoms for at least 24 hours (usually more than 72 hours) in the absence of an explanation, such as fever or infection. Researchers believe that exacerbations are associated with the development of newly damaged areas in the brain. An attack of MS can range from mild to severe and last from several days, to several weeks or months. Severe attacks can interfere significantly with a person’s daily activities. There are several that can help reduce symptoms or facilitate recovery from an attack. Multiple sclerosis is considered part of the common, complex disorders, which means the disease is not determined by a single genetic cause. Complex disorders are known to involve numerous genes, non-genetic factors, and interactions between genes and environmental factors. Although there is an increased risk for MS in areas farthest from the equator and in Caucasians of northern European descent, MS is found in most regions of the world and in most ethnic groups. There are 350,000 to 500,000 people in the U.S. who have been diagnosed with MS, and over 2.5 million people living with the disease worldwide. Multiple sclerosis is more common in women, appearing two to three times higher than in men. This sex difference, however, disappears in patients with progressive onset of the disease.

4b887440-aa7f-4c16-bab2-2d3d5368a535,"/ Multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic central nervous system (CNS) disease which affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Even in the absence of symptoms, the disease is continuously active (causing brain damage) from early stages of MS. In recent times, MS prevalence rates in India have been revised from 1 case in every lakh to3 cases/100,000 people– compare this to US, where MS occurs in 1 per 1000 people. MS is anautoimmune disease because the MS patient’s immune system (body’s defence against infection) attacks a part of its own body – the nerve cell myelin sheath. The nervous system consists of billions of neurons (nerve cells) which relay messages within the brain and between the brain and other body parts. In a normal nervous system, nerves (bundles of nerve cells) pass messages amongst themselves at superfast speed. The axon (long arm of a nerve cell) is covered by the myelin sheath (multi-layered bands) with small gaps in between. The nerve impulses, that is, chemical signalsjump from gap-to-gap and rapidly spread the messages to surrounding nerve cells. MS is neurodegenerative because the damaged myelin sheath and oligodendrocytes (cells that produce myelin) delay communication between nerve cells resulting in inefficient functioning of various body systems. Demyelinating (without myelin sheath) nerve cells occurs in multiple areas of the brain and nervous system. Damaged portions of the axon undergo (develop hardened scars) A noteworthy feature of MS is the remissions (remyelination with improved symptoms) and relapses (further demyelination with worsened symptoms) cycle that occur over time. MS does not result from any particular lifestyle choice and is not contagious. A link between MS and autoimmune diseases and smoking has been reported. Several other viral and bacterial infections e.g., Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and childhood mumps, are considered as MS triggers. Sincevitamin D is important for proper immune function, low levels of this vitamin are considered as a potential cause of MS. Environmentally, strong associations exist between MS and geography (temperate and cold zones) and demographics(age, gender, and ethnicity). Genetics play a role in MS, though not hereditary, as there is increased risk of MS incidence among siblings. Scientists are investigating which genes are common within families affected by MS or in populations with high MS incidence rates. MS symptoms are variable, unpredictable, and appear in different patterns. Most common patterns are relapsing/remitting (symptoms come and go) and chronic progressive(symptoms continuously worsens). Depending on which part of the nervous system develops demyelination, the condition affects corresponding body systems.The first MS symptom, in nearly 50% patients, appears as double or blurred vision caused by optic neuritis (demyelination of nerves connected to the eyes). Loss of coordination (30% patients) and speech difficulties also occur frequently. Other common symptoms include - MRI(magnetic resonance imaging) scans of over 90% of MS patients show the presence oflesions (demyelinated and scarred areas). MRI scans along with the patient’s medical history plus neurological exam confirms MS diagnosis.Spinal taps(check spinal fluid for abnormalities) andEEG (measures brain electrical activity) help rule out other autoimmune conditions or infections (HIV or Lyme disease). High disease variability is a challenge for patients and neurologists It is difficult to predict the development course of MS which may be asymptomatic, mild or severe.In severe cases the patients lose their ability to write, speak or walk which drastically affects their daily lives. In a recent publication,(a Chennai-based Clinical Neurologist) commented that access plus cost of diagnostic tests and treatment arefor MS patients. For example, a MS patient in Chennai pays Rs. 70,000 monthly for drugs that require alternate day injections. In addition, there is minimal to zero insurance or disability compensation for patients who are unable to work as a result of their weakened physical, mental and emotional abilities. MS treatment options include disease-modifying drugsmethylprednisolone, interferons (Avonex, Betaseron), Copaxone and Rebif that provide symptom relief and slowdown the disease progressionto prevent relapses. Counselling, physical and occupational therapy help to cope with movement and behavioural symptoms. MS is not fatal but complications arising from a weak immune system, such as pneumonia, lower life expectancy by ten years in MS patients.  (US-based MS expert) during a Feb 2012 presentation, at The TS Srinivasan Institute, observed that MS prevalence in India is probably underestimated because of a lack of awareness amongst patients and neurologists. Dr. Rudick, also declared that MS treatment had progressed beyond the ABCR drugs (Avonex, Betaseron and Copaxone and Rebif) to personalised medicine such that several drug combinations could be used to possibly completely block multiple sclerosis disease (MS) activity. MS Society of India (MSSI) supports MS patients and caregivers MSSI (), found in 9 cities, offers useful advice, reading material, research updates, and community support.

It’s never too soon or too late to think about how to access high quality care. Knowing what to look for, where to find it, and how to work effectively with your doctor and other health professionals is essential to your health and quality of life.  While there is no way to predict with any certainty how an individual’s disease will progress, four basic MS disease courses (also called types or phenotypes) have been defined by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS in 2013: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive. In 2020, the same committee published a , highlighting the need for time framing the modifiers “activity” and “progression” and guidance for using the terms “worsening” or “progression” to describe the disease. Although not considered a course of MS,  has been used to classify those with abnormalities on MRI of the brain and/or spinal cord consistent with lesions of MS - not explained by another diagnosis - and who also have no past or current neurological symptoms or abnormalities found on neurological exam. Often these individuals have had an MRI because of other symptoms, such as headache, and were found to have lesions that appear similar to those seen in MS. A found a little over half of people with RIS go on to develop MS within ten years. There are no specific treatment guidelines for RIS and additional research is needed to further define what factors increase the likelihood that someone with RIS will develop MS. Monitoring of MRI and neurological symptoms, and neurological examination are generally recommended to quickly identify changes. If the diagnosis is MS, treatment can be started early. Research interest in RIS is high and , which could provide more guidance for monitoring and treatment. CIS is a first episode of neurologic symptoms caused by inflammation and in the central nervous system. The episode, which by definition must last for at least 24 hours, is characteristic of multiple sclerosis but does not yet meet the criteria for a because people who experience a CIS may or may not go on to develop MS. When CIS is accompanied by lesions on a brain MRI () that are similar to those seen in MS, the person has a high likelihood of a second episode of neurologic symptoms and diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS. When CIS is not accompanied by MS-like lesions on a brain MRI, the person has a much lower likelihood of developing MS. The make it possible to diagnose MS in a person with CIS who also has specific findings on brain MRI that provide evidence of an earlier episode of damage in a different location and indicate active inflammation in a region other than the one causing the current symptoms. As MRI technology improves, the diagnosis of MS will be made more quickly and easily. In the meantime, individuals with CIS who are considered at high risk for developing MS may now be treated with a that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose. Early treatment of CIS has been shown to delay onset of MS. RRMS – the most common disease course – is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). During remissions, all symptoms may disappear, or some symptoms may continue and become permanent. However, there is no apparent progression of the disease during the periods of remission. RRMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as (a confirmed increase in disability following a relapse) or . Approximately 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in RRMS over time; however each person's experience with RRMS will be unique. Following a relapse, the new symptoms may disappear without causing any increase in level of disability, or the new symptoms may partially disappear, resulting in an increase in disability. New lesions on MRI, as shown by the arrows, often occur as part of a relapse. However, new MRI lesions indicating MS activity may also occur without symptoms of which the person is aware.  SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Some people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified period of time) or, as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapses or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in SPMS over time; however each person's experience with SPMS will be unique. SPMS follows after relapsing-remitting MS. Disability gradually increases over time, with or without evidence of disease activity (relapses or changes on MRI). In SPMS, occasional relapses may occur, as well as periods of stability. PPMS is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. PPMS can be further characterized as either (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or . Approximately 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in PPMS over time; however each person's experience with PPMS will be unique. PPMS can have brief periods when the disease is stable, with or without a relapse or new MRI activity, as well as periods when increasing disability occurs with or without new relapses or lesions on MRI. There are more than a dozen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat all types of MS. Each drug has an indication from the FDA for the type of MS it can be used to treat.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) literally means “many scars,” which refers to the lesions that accumulate in the brain and spinal cord throughout the course of the disease. These scars, or lesions, consist mostly of dead nerve cells, whose axons have been denuded of the myelin sheaths that normally protect them and permit the conduction of nerve impulses. MS is a chronic, degenerative disease that usually begins in young adulthood and most visibly destroys muscular control, although many other brain functions are affected. Most people will live with MS for decades after their diagnosis. MS reduces life expectancy after onset (as measured by current diagnostic criteria) by only about 10-15 years, and about half of the patients survive 30 years or more from onset. THE CLINICAL PICTURE: SYMPTOMS, DISEASE COURSE, VARIATION, AND DIAGNOSIS MS, as defined by ongoing central nervous system (CNS) lesion formation and increasing cumulative damage, is now recognized as a disease that is active in most patients most of the time. Disease activity has reversible and irreversible sequelae; irreversible sequelae ultimately lead to progressive impairment and disability in most patients. MS takes a variety of forms, distinguished by the clinical pattern of disease activity (, ). Accumulated deficit can produce sustained worsening in both relapsing and progressive MS.

Varieties of MS Autopsy studies indicate there are individuals without any known clinical history who have neuropathologic changes typical of MS. It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of subclinical disease, but one recent review suggested asymptomatic MS might account for up to 25% of all cases. This is the major MS subtype. Approximately 85% of patients with a diagnosis of MS start out with relapsing MS. Overall, this subtype accounts for 55% of MS. Relapsing MS patients show a high rate of inflammatory lesion activity (gadolinium-enhancing lesions). This category represents a subset of relapsing patients who have few attacks and make an excellent recovery. They show minimal impairment and disability, even after 20-30 years. The proportion of MS patients with benign disease is controversial. Reasonable studies suggest 10-20% of people with MS fit into this category. This subtype accounts for 10% of MS. Patients show gradual worsening from onset, without disease attacks. These patients tend to be older and often present with a spinal cord dysfunction without obvious brain involvement. This subtype is the least likely to show inflammatory lesion activity on MRI (gadolinium-enhancing). Unlike the other subtypes of MS, men are as likely as women to develop primary progressive MS. This subtype accounts for 5% of MS. Patients show slow worsening from onset, with superimposed attacks. Recent studies suggest these patients are similar to primary progressive patients. This is the major progressive subtype and accounts for approximately 30% of MS. Relapsing MS patients usually transition to secondary progressive disease. They show gradual worsening, with or without superimposed relapses. Natural history studies of untreated relapsing MS indicate 50% of patients will be secondary progressive at 10 years and almost 90% by 25 years. This form of MS shows a lower rate of inflammatory lesion activity than relapsing MS, yet the total burden of disease continues to increase. This most likely reflects ongoing axonal loss. Also referred to as Marburg variant MS, this is the most severe form of MS. Significant disability develops much more rapidly than usual, over weeks to months. Pathologic changes are widespread and destructive. These cases are rare and generally occur in young people. This refers to patients who present with an isolated CNS syndrome (optic neuritis, incomplete transverse myelitis, brainstem or cerebellar lesion), which is often the first MS attack. Clinical, MRI, and CSF studies indicate that such patients with normal brain MRI and CSF have a low risk of developing MS. In contrast, those with abnormal MRI have a high risk of developing MS. NOTE: CSF = cerebrosinal fluid; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.

In progressive MS, the dominant pattern is a gradual accumulation of neurologic deficits, with slow clinical worsening. Disease activity and progression have both clinical and subclinical components. Clinical disease activity and progression are judged by observation and neurologic examination. Subclinical components refer to pathological changes that are not observable in a clinical examination but are observed using a variety of laboratory tests, predominantly neuroimaging parameters. Relapses are variously referred to as acute attacks, exacerbations, or disease flare-ups. They involve the acute, or sudden onset, of focal neurologi- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Examples of typical MS relapses include blurring of vision in one eye (optic neuritis), persistent numbness or tingling of a body part (sensory system relapse), weakness of a body part (motor system relapse), or loss of coordination (cerebellar system relapse). Early in the MS disease process, relapses are likely to involve sensory, motor, cerebellar, or visual system abnormalities ( , ). Later in the disease process, relapses are likely to involve bladder, bowel, cognitive, and sexual function abnormalities. Acute disease attacks are a characteristic feature of the relapsing-remitting MS subtype. Relapses also occur in patients with progressive relapsing disease and in a number of patients with secondary progressive disease. The only clinical disease subtype in which relapses never occur is primary progressive MS. Areas of the CNS often affected by MS. Reprinted with permission from University of Delaware. Sensory problems (numbness or tingling of a body part) ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapses generally consist of three phases. There is a period of worsening, with onset of new deficits or increasing severity of old deficits. This is followed by a period of stability, with no change in deficits. The final phase is the period of recovery, with variable degrees of improvement in deficits. Most patients recover within six weeks, although for some, improvements can continue over months. Recovery can be complete return to baseline status, partial return, or no improvement. However, some degree of improvement is typical, particularly early in the disease. Relapsing patients then remain clinically stable until the next disease attack. To be considered a relapse, deficits must persist for a minimum of 24 hours. This avoids confusion with deficits lasting only minutes to hours, which are believed to be a consequence of impaired nerve conduction through old lesion areas rather than the formation of a new lesion. Alternatively, new abnormalities that last seconds to minutes, such as Lhermitte's sign (a tingling sensation radiating down the arms, neck, or back on neck flexion), or paroxysmal attacks (stereotypic neurologic deficits occurring multiple times a day that last less than a minute) are also considered relapses if they occur repeatedly over several weeks. Sequential relapses are considered distinct only when they occur at least 30 days apart with a month of clinical stability in between. Although clinical relapses always produce changes in a patient's condition, they are not always associated with changes on neurologic examination. Maximal deficit in an MS relapse typically develops over several days but in some cases can develop much faster, over hours or even minutes, or much more slowly, over a period as long as several weeks. Physiologic factors such as temperature, pH, or electrolyte balance can temporarily disrupt nerve conduction and produce neurologic abnormality. A relapse must be distinguished from a which is a neurologic deterioration associated with a physiologic change such as infection or fever. This condition can last for days, mimicking a true relapse. Pseudoexacerbation deficits disappear once the precipitating factor has been corrected. They reflect a temporary disruption in nerve conduction, rather than the formation of a new lesion. Approximately 85 percent of MS patients begin with relapsing-remitting disease. MS relapses can involve a single neural system, as in optic neuritis, or several anatomically distinct systems at the same time, for example, combined motor and sensory problems. Attacks involving single neural systems are somewhat more common in the first MS relapse. Most patients experience their second attack within two to three years of the first, but 5 percent of patients remain free of relapses for 15 years or more. In most cases, there is substantial recovery from the first relapse; only 4 percent of patients show no improvement. The average relapse rate is one to two attacks a year, but this rate normally declines over time. The longer a person has MS, the less likely it is that relapses will be followed by complete recovery and the more likely it is that relapses will be associated with residual deficits and increasing disability. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapse features have prognostic significance (). In the first few years after disease onset, the number and type of relapses, as well as the degree of recovery, help predict future disease course. Relapses that involve visual, sensory, or brainstem systems have a better prognosis than those that involve cerebellar, motor, or sphincter systems. In the first two years of disease, a low relapse rate with excellent recovery indicates a better prognosis than a high relapse rate with poor recovery. Relapses restricted to single neural systems are prognostically better than those involving multiple systems. The relapse rate also has prognostic significance in the later stages of MS. With a disease duration of five or more years, an increasing relapse rate, polyregional relapses that involved multiple systems, and incomplete recovery from relapses indicate a worse prognosis. The relapsing form of MS is characterized by acute disease exacerbations. In contrast, progressive MS is characterized by slow deterioration and increasing neurological deficits. There are three forms of progressive MS. Approximately 15 percent of MS patients show slow deterioration from onset. In the second form, 10 percent have either primary progressive MS and never experience acute disease attacks or progressive relapsing MS (5 percent), and have occasional subsequent attacks. The third form, secondary progressive MS, is the major progressive subtype. These are relapsing patients who begin to slowly worsen 5 to 15 years after the first relapse. Once relapsing patients enter a progressive phase, they either stop having relapses or continue to experience exacerbations superimposed on slow worsening. Documentation of a progressive course requires at least six months of observation. Observation over a year or two is often necessary to be confident of progression, since deficits can accumulate at a very gradual rate. The major defining feature of progressive MS is slow deterioration that occurs independently of acute disease relapses and does not reflect residual deficits from acute disease attacks. An analysis of the disease course among 1,844 patients indicated that the presence or absence of relapses during the progressive phase does not significantly affect the progression of irreversible disability (4 percent of ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. patients in this study had been treated for up to one year with beta-interferon, but this did not affect the study results). Progressive MS patients can be clinically stable for up to several years at a time and can even show slight improvement for a period of time. Ultimately, however, all progressive MS patients develop disability with limited ability to walk. Progressive MS is a more severe form than benign or relapsing-remitting MS and has a worse prognosis. Clinical parameters such as relapses and progression underestimate the actual damage to tissue that occurs in MS. When macroscopically normal-appearing brain tissue is looked at under the microscope, one can detect inflammation, gliosis (scarring), and myelin damage. Chemical studies of normal-appearing brain tissue often reveal changes in organelles such as lysosomes, in enzymes, and in myelin constituents. In addition, a number of the new research neuro-imaging techniques can detect changes in brain and spinal cord areas that appear free of lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some of these abnormalities are detectable several months to years before they can be seen with conventional MRI. Changes in normal-appearing brain tissue are generally pronounced in MS patients with severe impairment. As a group, secondary progressive MS patients show more abnormalities in normal white matter and brain tissue than relapsing patients. (White matter corresponds to brain regions where axons are ensheathed in myelin; gray matter corresponds to brain regions that are rich in cell bodies.) Primary progressive patients often show subtle but diffuse changes in normal-appearing brain areas. Even conventional MRI indicates that most new lesion formation is clinically silent, meaning that clinical exam does not reveal any corresponding symptoms. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of new brain lesions do not produce identifiable relapses. They might, however, be associated with subtle cognitive changes or other neuropsychological changes that are not detected in clinical examination. The total lesion burden increases in MS patients, on average, 5 to 10 percent per year, reflecting in large part the development of clinically silent lesions. (This does not apply to patients on the disease-modifying therapies discussed later in this section.) Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected even in patients with minimal symptoms. Atrophy can progress without obvious lesion formation, most likely reflecting loss of axons. MS patients show an accelerated rate of age-related brain and spinal cord atrophy that is three- to tenfold higher than the rate in control populations. Spinal cord lesions are generally similar to those in the brain except for the absence of “black holes” (see discussion in of T1-weighted lesions). Spinal MS lesions rarely cover more than half of the cross-sectional area of the cord or exceed two vertebral segments in length. They are found more often in the cervical spinal cord (neck region) than thoracic region (midback) and are most ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

MRI involves application of a magnetic field to the body that causes nuclei with odd numbers of protons, such as hydrogen nuclei, to behave like tiny magnets. These protons align themselves either parallel or antiparallel to the applied external magnetic field. The net magnetization induces an electric current that forms the basic MR signal. An MR image is formed by determining the spatial distribution of the signal and reconstructing the data into detailed images. The signals are picked up by a very sensitive antenna and forwarded to a computer for processing. Two time constants, T1 and T2 relaxation times, are important in determining the appearance of MR images. T1, or the longitudinal relaxation time, is the time constant when 63 percent of the original longitudinal magnetization is regained as the nuclei return to alignment with the external magnetic field. T2 or the transverse relaxation time, is the time constant when the transverse magnetization decreases to 37 percent of its original value as the nuclei lose alignment with each other following the initial application of an external magnetic field (a radio-frequency pulse). By altering the imaging parameters and pulse sequences used, differences between tissues with intrinsically different proton densities and T1 and T2 relaxation times can be highlighted or obscured. Image contrast can be either T1 weighted or T2 weighted in order to emphasize the differences between normal and pathological tissues. For example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images. White matter is bright on T1-weighted images, whereas a matter is dark but not as dark as CSF. common in the midcervical region. Disease activity is much less frequent in the spine than in the brain. In summary, the clinical manifestations of MS possibly represent only the “tip of the iceberg,” with most of the CNS damage occurring much earlier and being detectable only when the accumulated damage overwhelms the ability of the CNS to compensate. The mechanisms through which CNS tissue is damaged or destroyed are discussed in greater detail later in the chapter. At the present time, neuroimaging provides the best assessment of disease activity in MS (, ). A number of neuroimaging techniques can measure distinct pathologic changes and thereby provide markers for different aspects of the MS disease ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Magnetic resonance imaging is a technique that creates cross-sectional images of the brain using a magnetic field and radio waves (). It is a versatile, powerful, and sensitive tool for measuring abnormalities in the brain. This is especially valuable with MS, because so much of the pathological activity of the disease is neurologically asymptomatic. Indeed, until neuroimaging results proved otherwise, the disease appeared to be quiescent during remissions. Neuroimaging has revealed a previously unsuspected level of activity and pathology throughout the course of disease. Contrast agents are used in MRI in cases where contrast between two tissues is poor. The contrasting agent, gadolinium, is normally excluded from the brain by the blood-brain barrier.

Gadolinium-enhancing activity on MRI correlates with clinical relapses and predicts increased risk or further disease activity. However, since most new brain MRI lesions are clinically silent, gadolinium-enhanced lesions are seen more often than clinical relapses. In T2-weighted images, MS lesions appear as very bright white areas against a gray or more neutral background and are the most readily visualized MS lesions by MRI. They reflect lesions with different pathology and of various ages, and reversible as well as irreversible abnormalities. T2-weighted hyperintense lesions can be used to measure the total lesion volume (burden-of-disease). The variable pathology, which is not distinguished in T2 burden-of-disease measures, is probably a determinant of associated disability. Only a modest relationship has been observed between T2 burden of disease and clinical disability in relapsing and secondary progressive MS. However, in patients with clinically isolated syndromes who are in the early stages of MS, T2 burden-of-disease has been correlated with the development of MS, as well as the clinical subtype of MS and disability 10 years later. The magnitude of T2 burden-of-disease changes very early in the disease process and may be valuable for predicting subsequent course. Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected in MS patients, including relapsing patients with minimal neurologic deficits. Both axon and myelin loss contribute to tissue atrophy. Recent studies suggest that CNS atrophy may be the best neuroimaging correlate for clinical disability (reviewed in 1999 by Trapp et al.). A number of different methodologies are used to measure atrophy. Current advances involve measurement of the whole brain and improved automation, but the optimal technique has not been decided. Axonal injury can be measured on proton MR spectroscopy by estimating -acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels in brain tissue. NAA is a molecule that is virtually confined to axons and neurons. Levels of NAA can fluctuate, suggesting that they can be used to measure reversible as well as irreversible damage. Persistent reduction of NAA on MR Spectroscopy correlates with axon loss, damage, or dysfunction. Reduced NAA is found not only within MS lesions but also in the normal-appearing white matter of relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients. The reduction in NAA is more severe in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS. In addition, NAA decrease in cerebellar white matter has been correlated with clinical ataxia. NAA can be measured in a discrete region of interest within the brain. Recently, whole-brain NAA has been measured in MS. This appears to be a more meaningful neuroimaging marker to evaluate axon damage. MR spectroscopy can also be used to measure lipid changes within both lesions and normal- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appearing brain tissue, but these studies are very preliminary and NAA measurements are the major focus of current MR spectroscopy studies in MS. Also referred to as black holes, T1-weighted hypointense lesions have lower signal intensity than the surrounding white matter. T1 hypointense lesions are most common in the supratentorial region (cerebral hemispheres). They are much less common in the infratentorial (brainstem and cerebellum) region and are not reported in the spinal cord. Compared to T2-weighted lesions, they represent more severe tissue pathology, with axon loss, demyelination, and extracellular edema. In postmortem studies of progressive MS, T1-weighted hypointense lesions correlate strongly with axon density measurements. T1-weighted hypointense lesions show a stronger correlation with disability than T2-weighted hyperintense lesions. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) can be used to study global brain function or to measure changes within a local region of interest. Populations of bound and soluble protons produce different signals in response to the external magnetic field. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) is the ratio of the different signals produced by these two populations. It is reduced in MS and is believed to reflect both demyelination and axon loss, thereby producing an index of tissue destruction. MTR measurements are correlated with MS disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS; see ), as well as cognitive measures. MTI shows great promise as a disease marker. Lower MTR values occur with disease worsening in relapsing, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients and even in patients with clinically isolated MS syndromes. In primary progressive patients who have a relatively small T2 burden of disease, MTR is significantly reduced, suggesting that axon damage is significantly greater in this clinical subtype. Differences in MTRs are associated with different lesion pathology. Lesions that are more destructive (as indicated by T1 hypointensity) have reduced MTR values. Lesions that remain hypointense show a persistent reduction in MTR, whereas lesions that become isointense recover in MTR. New lesions in secondary progressive patients have a lower MTR than those in relapsing patients. The decline in MTR over three years is significantly greater in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS, supporting a relationship between MTR changes and disease progression. MTR measures allow more significant lesions to be detected and may provide a better potential correlate with clinical disability. Reduction in MTR can precede the development of new lesions on conventional MRI. Diffusion-weighted MRI is sensitive to the diffusion, or random motion, of water molecules in tissue. It can detect subtle pathological changes that are not seen on conventional MRI. This technique ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. might allow detection of pathological change in white matter tracts, including demyelination and loss of axons, by quantifying anisotropy through a measure of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI can identify significantly altered diffusion properties in normal-appearing white matter. Lesions with the highest diffusion are the more destructive black holes, while the greatest change in anisotropy is seen in acute inflammatory lesions. Coincident with new lesion formation, diffusion-weighted imaging has shown changes in contralateral normal-appearing white matter. High-field-strength magnets, which are 4 tesla (T) or higher, increase the signal-to-noise ratio (conventional imaging machines are 1.5 T). They allow enhanced detection of small (less than 5 mm) MS lesions, particularly those aligned along blood vessels. Both MR spectroscopy and MTI can be conducted on high-field machines with enhanced sensitivity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is a technique for determining which parts of the brain are activated by different types of sensation such as sight or sound, by different types of tasks such as moving one's fingers or legs, or by different mental tasks such as adding sums, reading, or memorizing. This “brain mapping” is achieved by using an MRI scanner to measure changes in blood flow to different areas of the brain. When a particular brain region is activated, blood flow into the region increases. The incoming arterial blood is rich in oxygenated hemoglobin, and there is a corresponding decrease in local deoxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in the MRI signal are derived from regional changes in the concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin, which is a paramagnetic molecule (reviewed in Hirsch et al.). The fMRI signal is, thus, determined by the balance between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. FMRI can provide second-by-second images of changes in response to different stimuli and during performance of mental tasks. It provides a unique tool for assessment of neural circuits involved in loss and recovery of function, as well as for measuring the circuits underlying symptoms that are as difficult to study as cognitive changes, fatigue, pain, and sensory disturbances. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid that circulates around and within the brain and spinal cord. CSF provides a vehicle for removing waste products of cellular metabolism from the nervous system and is believed to be nutritive for both neurons and glial cells and to function as a transport system for biologically active substances such as releasing factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolites. Sampling this fluid thus provides an index to substances active in the CNS and possibly those involved in MS pathology. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. A number of potential CSF disease markers have been reported in MS, including markers that are proposed as distinguishing between different types of MS (). For the most part, these are markers of tissue damage or immune disturbance. None are currently used in routine clinical practice, since they have not proved useful enough to justify serial lumbar punctures. There has been particular interest in the specificity of oligoclonal bands in MS. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular anti-bodies that can be visualized when CSF proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis where they appear as separate bands of protein on a gel matrix. Each of the bands contains a single type of antibody produced by a single clone of B cells. Oligoclonal bands are for the CSF of MS patients, but they are not to MS patients. For example, they are also found in the CSF of patients with other inflammatory status, such as viral brain infections. In MS, however, the particular antigens that elicit each antibody band are unknown. Investigators have recently used molecular approaches such as phage display libraries to probe MS oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands for sequence information related to their antigenic target. These are powerful methods that should allow for the identification of antigenic targets for the oligoclonal IgG. A main question, however, is whether the oligoclonal IgG bands represent an immune response directed against the etiologic agent of MS or merely constitute a by-product of immune system activity. In other words, upregulation of the antibody response and the heterogeneous distribution of antibodies into oligoclonal IgG bands could be a result of B-cell hyperactivity rather than an immune response to a specific etiologic pathogen. A variety of blood, urine, and mucosal fluid disease markers have been studied in MS, but none of them have provided a reliable disease marker. Again they are either markers of tissue damage (such as S-100) or immune activation (such as neopterin). Blood markers have included matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, circulating adhesion molecules, levels of various cytokines and their receptors, different subpopulations of cells, a variety of antibodies including antiviral and autoreactive antibodies, S-100 levels, and neopterin levels. Urine disease markers have included myelin basic protein-like material, free light chains, neopterin, gliotoxin, and neuron-specific enolase. Mucosal fluid cells and immunoglobulins have also been studied. The diagnosis of MS is based on both clinical parameters, such as medical history and neurological examination, and paraclinical parameters such as MRI, CSF oligoclonal banding, and evoked potentials. There is no MS-specific diag- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nostic test, and the intermittent nature of the disease and high variability in presenting symptoms make diagnosis difficult (listed in ). The presentation of MS can be monosymptomatic or have multifocal signs and symptoms, and many neurodegenerative disorders are similar to MS in their presentation. The general diagnostic criteria, established in 1965 by a committee sponsored by the National MS Society (the MS Society), state that a diagnosis of “clinically definite” MS (CDMS) requires clinical evidence of two or more white matter lesions on at least two occasions. In 1983, these criteria were expanded by Poser et al. to include the use of paraclinical parameters, and they have since become the standard MS diagnostic criteria (). In July 2000, an international committee met to further revise these criteria, in particular to make MRI information a more integral component and to incorporate diagnostic criteria for primary progressive MS. The results of that meeting, however, were not available at the time of this writing. The failure of the Poser criteria to incorporate primary progressive MS has recently been addressed by revised criteria that define definite, probable, and possible levels of diagnostic certainty. These criteria are based on clinical findings, CSF abnormalities, brain and spinal cord MRI abnormalities, and evoked potentials. Using these criteria, at least one year of clinical progression must be documented before a diagnosis of primary progressive MS can be made. MRI reveals neuropathological damage in 70 to 95 percent of people with MS and, because of its sensitivity, is the most helpful paraclinical diagnostic test. However, the use of MRI in MS diagnosis has led to concern that its high sensitivity combined with limited MS specificity leads to misdiagnosis, since other conditions including myelopathy and disseminated encephalomyelitis can cause MRI lesions similar to MS lesions. Thus, it is important that imaging be used in combination with clinical data for the diagnosis of MS. Recently, several sets of criteria for the definition of “MRI-definite” MS have been suggested (). Patients with clinically isolated syndromes are particularly difficult to diagnose, and Barkhof et al. and Fazekas have identified criteria that are relevant to such cases. Although assessment of spinal cord damage using MRI remains behind the development of brain methodology, it can be useful in diagnosing patients suspected of MS, particularly in cases with equivocal or negative brain MRI results. Spinal cord imaging increases the diagnostic sensitivity of MRI and might also enable earlier diagnosis. When demyelination or sclerosis (scarring) occurs, the conduction of nerve impulses along axons is slowed or interrupted. Impaired conductance is reflected in an increased latency of evoked potentials or an increase in the amount of time that elapses between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the resulting ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. change in the brain's electrical field. Evoked potentials are measured by placing small electrodes on the head in the region corresponding to the stimuli presented ( ). Abnormal evoked responses to different types of stimuli provide clues to the location of plaques or lesions and are useful in detecting “clinically silent” lesions that do not produce easily observable symptoms. However, abnormal evoked responses are not unique to MS. For example, although abnormal visual IgG antibodies are composed of light and heavy polypeptide chains. Free light chains are found in patients with chronic infections or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, but also in healthy individuals particularly following strenuous exercise. Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. They are involved in various aspects of disease processes, particularly inflammatory responses. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular antibodies. They are of the CSF of MS patients, but not to it. Antiviral antibodies are produced by B cells in direct response to an antigen's presence, and certain antiviral antibodies are increased in the CSF of some patients with MS. Immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells and are integral in adaptive immune responses. Polyclonal increases of IgG occur in chronic infection and inflammation. White blood cells responsible for cell-mediated immune responses to antigens, including viral infections. Adhesion, costimulatory, and other surface of MS. molecules Upregulated adhesion molecules in blood and CSF indicate sustained potential for inflammation in the CNS throughout the clinical spectrum A major component of myelin, MBP is increased in the CSF of some, but not all, MS patients following a demyelinating episode.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. evoked potentials are common in MS, they also occur in compressive lesions of the visual pathway and spinocerebellar degeneration. Evoked potentials can aid in the localization of lesions, confirm clinically ambiguous lesions, and confirm the organic basis of symptoms. In addition, changes in evoked potentials can be used to measure disease progression and the effectiveness of therapeutic treatment, including treatments designed to improve conduction. Continued S-100 protein is an astroglial-specific protein that binds calcium. When a brain lesion occurs, S-100 is released into both the CSF and the blood. As a marker of brain damage, NSE reflects the severity of disease in patients with intracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, head injury, and certain tumors. A major constituent of glial filaments in differentiated CNS astrocytes, GFAP has been used for the diagnosis of astrocytic tumors, the study of astrocytic gliosis, and CNS regeneration and transplantation. Neurofilaments are important for axonal structure, transport, and regeneration. Accumulation of neurofilaments in motor neurons can trigger a neurodegenerative process and may be a key intermediate in the pathway of pathogenesis leading to neuronal loss. A modulator of axon outgrowth and cell adhesion that adapts its structure to requirements during development by alternative splicing and posttranslational modification. CNTF appears to promote remyelination, as well as formation of oligodendroctyes. Highly cytotoxic for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, gliotoxin may represent an initial pathogenic factor leading to the neuropathological features of MS, such as blood-brain barrier involvement and demyelination. A marker of immune activation, neopterin is increased in CSF of relapsing-remitting patients and correlates with a decrease of -tryptophan, reflecting interferon-gamma-mediated activation of macrophages. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that can dissolve the extracellular matrix of the blood-brain barrier. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Combinations of various types of evidence are used to diagnose MS under the Poser criteria. More than one combination of clinical and paraclinical evidence can support a diagnosis within a single category. Laboratory-supported diagnosis requires one of two possible immune disturbances in CSF: IgG oligoclonal bands or intrathecal IgG production. NOTES: CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid. OB, Oligoclonal bands.

Evoked Potentials as a Diagnostic Tool in MS Strobe light flash or reversible checkerboard pattern flash on a computer screen Series of clicking noises or tone bursts played into earphone On the scalp along the vertex and on each earlobe Evaluation of sensory nerve tracts in spinal cord, thalamus, and sensory cortex Mild electrical stimulus via electrodes on wrists or knees On the scalp, each wrist (medial nerve), and the knees (peroneal nerve) The use of evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool has greatly declined since the advent of the MRI, which provides a more comprehensive picture of disease activity. In at least some cases of progressive MS, visual evoked potentials show changes over time where none are detected in MRI scans. In May 2000, the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology concluded that although visual evoked potentials are useful to identify patients at increased risk of developing clinically definite MS, somatosensory evoked responses are only useful for that purpose, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend brainstem auditory evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool. Although MS is postulated to have an underlying immune-mediated pathogenesis, there is as yet no biologic marker that is disease specific and can be used for diagnostic purposes. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to allow detection of any putative disease-related infectious agent as a basis for defining the disease. Thus, MS continues to be defined by sets of criteria that have been ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. developed based on clinical and pathologic observations. MS may well be heterogeneous when viewed from the perspective of genetics, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical phenotypes, and immunopathology. To be considered a truly distinctive variant of MS, any putative distinct disease subtypes defined in one of these categories would have to be correlated with the distinctive features identified in each of the other categories. Cases classified as MS are recognized where disease distribution is mainly in the spinal cord, hind brain (cerebellum or brainstem), or cerebrum. Different animal models have distinct topographic distributions, some of which seem to have distinct immunopathologies. For example, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, the demyelinating disease that afflicts mice, is mainly a spinal cord disease. There is an apparent overrepresentation of specific phenotypes in certain geographic regions. For example, MS that is relatively restricted to the optic nerve and spinal cord is more common in Japan than in other countries. The Devic's pattern of MS features a predominance of spinal cord and optic nerve involvement. The pathology is considered more destructive than classical MS, and the prognosis is worse. At issue is whether these differences reflect different immunopathogenic mechanisms in a given individual, even when the disease trigger, or initiating event, is not distinct among such individuals. Even in identical twins with MS, the disease course can be markedly different. A number of immunomodulatory agents have been shown in double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III trials to benefit patients with relapsing MS ( ; see also 1999 review by Rudick ). These agents help clinical disease features (they decrease the number of attacks, the severity of attacks, and sustained worsening on neurologic examination) as well as MRI disease features (they decrease the formation of new lesions, the number of contrast-enhancing lesions, the total burden of disease, and brain atrophy). Although all of these drugs have side effects, they are manageable in most patients. The benefit of treatment is sustained for at least several years. It is not yet known whether these agents prevent, reduce, or delay transition from relapsing to progressive MS, but preliminary data suggest that this may be the case. Throughout this report, the term “disease-modifying therapy” is used to distinguish these agents from other medications used to relieve the symptoms of MS that do not alter either the frequency of relapses or the rate of progression. Beta-interferon (IFN-Î²) is an anti-inflammatory regulatory cytokine with antiviral, antineoplastic, and immunomodulatory activity. It has a number of effects on the immune system that would be beneficial in MS. For example, it decreases cell migration into the CNS, inhibits T-cell proliferation and expression of cell activation markers, inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (the enzyme that produces nitric oxide, a potentially damaging substance), and enhances ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

There are two types of recombinant (artificially made) beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1a (Avonex, Rebif) is a duplicate of human beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) has three molecular differences from human beta-interferon: it is not glycosylated, there is an amino acid substitution at position 17, and there is no “N-terminal” methionine. The three available beta-interferon therapies are given in different amounts and dosing schedules (). There are well-recognized side effects (most commonly flu-like reactions), which occur maximally during the first weeks or months of therapy. Flu-like reactions can be minimized by initiating therapy with a dose escalation schedule and consistent use of anti-inflammatory premedication during the first few weeks of therapy. *Rebif has been approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS by the European Commission but has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States because of the Orphan Drug Act. If tentative approval is received, Rebif could enter the U.S. market in 2003, when the exclusivity periods for Avonex and Betaseron end. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) consists of random polymers of four amino acids, designed to mimic myelin basic protein, an important component of CNS myelin. Glatiramer acetate is believed to work by activating antiinflammatory regulatory T cells, which then migrate into the CNS to inhibit local immune reactions. Glatiramer acetate has an excellent side effect profile. Patients may experience injection site reactions, but they tend to be quite minor. Some 10 to 15 percent of patients experience at least one immediate postinjection reaction characterized by chest tightness, palpitations, flushing, and anxiety within a few minutes of injection. The reaction lasts only minutes and is not dangerous. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) is a cytotoxic agent that interferes with DNA synthesis and repair, and suppresses a variety of immune system cells. It also enhances suppressor cell activity. It is given as an intravenous infusion over 5 to 15 minutes, every three months. Mitoxantrone is fairly well tolerated at low doses. In the recent Phase III trial, both the low (5 mg/m) and high (12 mg/m) doses showed efficacy, but the high dose gave the best overall results. Mitoxantrone should not be given at a cumulative dose of 140 mg/m or higher because of concerns about cardiotoxicity, which also means that this drug can be used for only a few years. Currently available treatments are highly effective in preventing the type of MS damage that can be visualized using MRI. They are moderately effective in preventing and reducing the severity of relapses, but they are generally disappointing in preventing long-term disability—the most important goal of treatment. This might reflect the timing of treatment, and there has been a recent emphasis on starting therapy at the time MS is first diagnosed. This type of early therapy is likely most effective in delaying or preventing long-term disability, although this effect has not yet been clearly demonstrated through empirical research studies (Richard Rudick, personal communication). Clearly, much remains to be done in the development of therapies for people who suffer from MS. Two recent studies, the interferon beta-1a (Avonex) prevention study (CHAMPS, Controlled High Risk Subjects Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention) and the interferon beta-1a (Rebif) early treatment (ETOMS, Early Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis) trial, have compared the use of disease-modifying therapy with placebo in patients after their first attack who also have an abnormal brain MRI. These are patients at high risk for MS, but who do not meet current criteria for a definite diagnosis. In both studies, early treatment with a disease-modifying agent significantly delayed onset of a second clinical attack over the two-year study period. Patients who received treatment also showed significantly less MRI disease activity over the next two years. These two trials have led to a reassessment of when disease-modifying therapy should be started. The National MS Society consensus statement endorsed treatment of patients as soon as a definite diagnosis of relapsing MS is made. If new diagnostic criteria are formulated for an MRI-based diagnosis at the time of a first attack, it is likely that the use of disease-modifying therapy will expand to include these early patients. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate have been tested mainly in relapsing MS. It is more controversial whether they benefit progressive MS. Several Phase III trials have examined beta-interferon therapy in patients with secondary progressive MS, with conflicting results. The European Secondary Progressive Study on beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) showed a significant effect on slowing progression. In contrast, the North American Secondary Progressive beta-interferon-1b study and the European SPECTRIMS beta-interferon-1a (Rebif) study showed no significant effect on progression. These trials did, however, show positive results on secondary outcomes such as relapse rate and MRI disease parameters. The European study, which showed a treatment effect on progression in contrast to the two negative studies, included secondary progressive patients who had a shorter disease duration, were still experiencing relapses, and had contrast-enhancing brain MRI lesions. Considered as a whole, these studies suggest that in the earlier stages of MS, when there is still a significant inflammatory component (reflected in clinical relapses and gadolinium-enhancing lesion activity), beta-interferon may have a positive effect on clinical progression. In the later, nonrelapsing, progressive stages of MS, where there appears to be ongoing atrophy relatively independent of contrast-enhancing lesion activity, beta-interferon does not seem to slow progression. The European Phase III trial of Mitoxantrone enrolled both relapsing and secondary progressive MS patients. The drug had a positive effect on progression as indicated by a decrease in the EDSS impairment scale at the end of the study (change of -0.13 compared to +0.23 in the placebo group, p = .038) (for EDSS scale, see ). An ongoing trial (IMPACT Study) in secondary progressive MS is testing double-dose interferon beta-1a (Avonex) once a week. There have been no major treatment trials in primary progressive and progressive relapsing MS. There currently is an ongoing three-year Phase III trial of glatiramer acetate in primary progressive MS (the Promise trial). Each of the currently available disease-modifying treatments has shortcomings, including partial efficacy for patients as a group and potential adverse effects. There are four reasons why treatments fail—nonadherence on the patient's part, adverse side effects, production of neutralizing antibodies, and nonresponsive disease (reviewed by Cohen at al., 1999). Patient adherence is a factor in the efficacy of any medication, but particularly so when a patient's hopes exceed the outcome—which is particularly salient for therapies that are preventive, but not restorative. The primary principles to increase adherence are appropriate selection of patients for treatment, availability of adequate medical support throughout treatment, and perhaps most importantly, patient education before and during treatment. MS patients need to be fully informed that the therapy can prevent relapses and the accumulation of disability, ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. but that it will not improve preexisting manifestations. In addition, some patients are averse to self-injection and will not be persuaded to inject themselves with any medication (unless, perhaps, they are convinced of a substantial and certain benefit, which many MS patients are not). Health care financing policies vary widely among different countries and even within countries such as the United States and Canada. This will also influence patient adherence. In countries such as France where the costs of MS therapies are fully covered by the state, cost is unlikely to influence adherence, but in countries where patients must assume the full costs of MS disease-modifying therapies themselves, many of them will decide that they cannot afford to pay more than $10,000 (U.S.) annual expense for the modest health benefit they might gain. Adverse effects are a common reason for discontinuing treatment, but they are generally not serious health threats. The most common side effect of glatiramer acetate is irritation at the injection site, although it is typically mild. The most common side effects of beta-interferon are flu-like symptoms, and these usually resolve after three to six months. (Depression is also a possible side effect and is discussed in greater detail in .) Although only 4 percent of actively treated patients withdrew from beta-interferon clinical trials because of side effects, in clinical practice, 11 percent discontinue within four months of initiating treatment (reviewed in 1999 by Mohr et al.). (The percentage of patients who discontinue treatment because of side effects might, however, decline as physicians become more experienced in managing these side effects.) Defining nonresponsive disease in individual patients is difficult, because unfortunately patients can continue to experience relapses after initiation of disease-modifying therapy with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment relapse rates is fraught with problems, and it is often difficult to identify whether an individual patient is responsive to therapy. At a minimum, a patient's level of neurological impairment and disability should remain stable on therapy. Persistent gadolinium-enhancing or T2 lesion accrual should be considered a worrisome feature, even in the absence of clinical evidence of activity or worsening. Finally, neutralizing antibodies, which can interfere with the effects of interferons, appear in up to 20 percent of patients after two years of beta-interferon treatment. They do not appear to be an issue with glatiramer acetate. Increased neutralizing antibodies appear to be associated with reduced clinical benefit, although there is still some controversy about this point. For example, it is still not known what levels of neutralizing antibodies are clinically significant, how often they persist, and what is the most reliable method of measuring them. More research is needed on testing for neutralizing antibodies in MS patients treated with beta-interferons and how to best use the results to properly manage patient treatment.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Disease-modifying therapies are expensive, costing roughly $8,000 to $10,000 (U.S.) per year. Several studies have indicated that their costs outweigh their benefits, but these analyses have been heavily criticized. Forbes and colleagues argued that it is not cost-effective to treat progressive MS patients with interferon beta-1b in Britain and that the money spent on interferon beta-1b would be better spent on other services, such as supportive care and simple interventions to reduce the burden of patients' symptoms. Analyses of cost-effectiveness of medical treatment often use quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to measure health benefits (see ). The estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY for relapsing-remitting MS range from 809,000 British pounds ($1,140,000 U.S.) to 2,038,400 British pounds ($2,870,000 U.S.). The estimates are considerably lower in Canada (406,000 to 490,000 Canadian dollars, or $270,000-$330,000 U.S.). For secondary progressive MS, the estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY range from 874,600 British pounds ($1,230,000 U.S.) to 1,024,000 British pounds ($1,440,000 U.S.). While disease-related expenditures are relatively easy to calculate, the benefits of these expenditures are not so easy to calculate, particu- Quality-adjusted life-years are a health status measure that includes both quantity and quality of life in a single outcome measure. Multiplying life expectancy by a quality-of-life adjustment fraction, or utility, results in a QALY value. Utilities represent the level of quality or value associated with a particular health state, and range in value from 0, representing death, to 1, representing optimal health. Utilities are determined in two ways: by researchers through literature searches for previously conducted utility studies or by direct measurement of utility values based on the assessment of people's values for different levels of health. The use of QALYs for resource allocation has been widely criticized as discriminatory against the elderly and the disabled by placing less value on extending their lives due to the lower potential for health status improvement. The determination of utility values that accurately reflect the many ways quality of life can be affected is difficult in part because one of the underlying assumptions of QALYs— that the severity of a disease state or disability and the corresponding value represent a fixed quantity—is unlikely to be true. The effect of health status on quality of life depends in large part on an individual's unique perspective. Although the use of QALYs is one of the current standards for such evaluations, it is a crude attempt to express a qualitative, subjective reality in quantitative terms and has been criticized as being of limited value in this respect. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. larly in long-term diseases where treatments might slow the progress of disease, but neither cure it nor restore impaired functions. In addition to the limitations inherent in the use of QALYs, there are other problems with the conclusion that disease-modifying therapies are not cost-effective. The studies done to date have been criticized for using poor economic methodology in interpreting the data. In a year 2000 review of immunomodulatory drugs used to treat MS, the British National Health Service committee on health technology assessment concluded that the cost-effectiveness of these drugs is simply not known. The committee cited a lack of quality clinical trials for each drug, including methodological limitations, poor reporting of data, small sample sizes, short duration, inconsistent treatment regimes and outcome measures, and uncertainty about the clinical significance of reported benefits. The latter criticism might, however, change. New data about these drugs are emerging at such a rapid pace that conclusions about their benefits should be reconsidered as new data from clinical trials become available. In general, cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered skeptically. Cost-effectiveness is a highly politicized issue in which economic principles are often misapplied. Indeed, the United States health care system often favors economically inefficient delivery of some products—for example, liver transplants—in that health care providers are willing to underwrite additional costs to gain market share. Further, cross-national comparisons have little merit because of differences in national health care systems, as well as other economic and social factors. Finally, although economic analysis reveals important financial trade-offs, all societies hold certain social values that outweigh economic considerations. For many people, the health and well-being of their loved ones and themselves is among the deepest of these values. Ultimately, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying MS will have to be better understood to design rational therapies. Physiology of Myelin and Axons: Normal Function, Demyelination, and Repair The integrative activity of the nervous system, which underlies motor, sensory, cognitive, and psychological behavior, depends on electrical signaling between neurons. Each neuron encodes its message in the form of action potentials (small all-or-none electrical impulses) that are carried to other neurons via axons, the cable-like fibers that extend from neuron cell bodies. Many axons within the brain and spinal cord are myelinated. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The myelin sheath provides a high-resistance, low-capacitance insulator that increases the reliability and speed of action potentials conducted along axon fibers. Myelin is what makes the white matter of brain white. It is a multilayered sheath formed by the oligodendroglial cells, or oligodendrocytes, that insulate axons ( ). Each segment of the myelin sheath surrounds the axon in a segmented fashion, with segments (called internodes) periodically interrupted at nodes of Ranvier. The internodal axon is normally surrounded by myelin sheaths whose thicknesses are related to the caliber of the ensheathed axon. In normal Oligodendrocyte making myelin. The processes of a given oligodendrocyte wrap themselves around portions of the surrounding axons. As each process wraps itself around, it forms layers of myelin. Each process thus becomes a segment of the axon's myelin sheath. SOURCE: National Institutes of Health Office of Science Education. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. myelinated fibers, the action potential does not travel in a continuous manner. On the contrary, it jumps from one node of Ranvier to the next, in a manner known as “saltatory” (derived from the Latin word for “jumping”). Saltatory conduction is a rapid process, with the impulse taking only 20 one-thousandths of a second to jump from one node of Ranvier to the next; as a result, myelinated fibers conduct impulses with a high velocity. Significantly, voltage-dependent sodium channels are clustered at the nodes of Ranvier but are relatively more scarce in the internodal axonal membrane. In contrast, potassium channels, which exist in low density at nodes, are more abundant in the internodal and paranodal axonal membrane, under the myelin sheath. Therefore, loss of the myelin sheath exposes relatively inexcitable axonal membranes; the consequence is that nerve impulses are conducted more slowly or not at all. Axonal Conduction Is Impaired in Demyelinated Axons Following damage to the myelin, conduction velocity is reduced, and conduction slows along the demyelinated axon ( ). Studies using evoked potentials to examine human subjects with MS have demonstrated that this slowing of conduction does not, in itself, necessarily produce clinical deficits. In addition, however, conduction failure can occur in demyelinated axons. When conduction failure occurs, the axon potential is not propagated from one end of the fiber to the other, and information is lost. This produces a clinical deficit. Conduction failure in demyelinated axons is now known to result not only from loss of the insulating myelin, but also from the molecular organization of the axon membrane. Following damage to the myelin, internodal parts of the axon membrane (which had previously been covered by myelin) are uncovered. Myelinated Axons Exhibit Complex Molecular Architecture Prior to the last decade, axonal dysfunction in demyelinating diseases was considered to be due entirely to the loss of the myelin insulation. According to this schema, after the myelin is damaged, there is a “short circuit,” and impulse conduction is slowed or fails. It is now known that although the schema described above is partially correct, it is not the whole story. The axon itself exhibits an elegant molecular architecture, and following damage to the myelin, this architecture is disrupted. The molecular architecture of the axon is manifest by the placement of specialized protein molecules, called ion channels, within the membrane of the axon. Sodium channels act as tiny molecular batteries, which produce the depolarization that is necessary for the generation of action potentials. In contrast, potassium channels act as molecular brakes, damping electrical activity. Within myelinated axons, these two types of ion channels have a complementary structure. Sodium channels are clustered in high density in the axon membrane at small gaps in the myelin called nodes of Ranvier, where they support the produc- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Their numbers there are too low to support secure conduction, which contributes to conduction failure. Potassium channels, on the other hand, tend to be located in the internodal parts of the axon membrane, beneath the myelin sheath; as a result of this, they are masked by the Pathogenesis.

The unmasking of potassium channels by demyelination thus introduces another factor that tends to interfere with the conduction of action potentials. Molecular Plasticity in Demyelinated Axons Underlies Restoration of Impulse Conduction Given that impulse conduction fails in demyelinated axons and that this contributes to clinical deficits, how do remissions occur? It is now clear that demyelinated axons possess a remarkable capability to rebuild themselves at the molecular level. In the weeks following demyelination, demyelinated axons acquire, within regions where myelin has been lost, a density of sodium channels that is high enough to support action potential conduction even in the absence of insulating myelin. The demyelinated nerve fibers insert additional amplifiers (sodium channels) in their membranes so that they are able to conduct action potentials reliably even though there is a short circuit. This is a striking example of neuronal plasticity, in this case at the molecular level. Although this molecular plasticity has been clearly demonstrated in laboratory experiments, a number of important questions remain: How do neurons “know” that their axons have been demyelinated and that there is a need to activate the machinery for synthesis of sodium channels? How do neurons control the synthesis and deployment of sodium channels? What turns on the genes for sodium channels and ensures that the correct types of sodium channels (there are nearly a dozen different types, which are like different types of batteries) are produced following demyelination? Also, how are sodium channels transported and inserted into the correct parts of the axon membrane so that they can function normally? These questions have important therapeutic implications and are currently under study. The presence of axonal degeneration in MS was recognized even in the early descriptions of this disease, but its presence has recently been reemphasized (). Axonal transection might be the structural basis for acquisition of permanent (nonremitting) neurological deficits, making it an especially important part of the pathology of MS. A corollary of this proposition would be that neuroprotective interventions that limit axonal injury should prevent, or at least lessen, the acquisition of new, permanent signs and symptoms in MS. As a step toward the development of neuroprotective strategies in MS, it will be important to delineate the mechanisms that underlie axonal injury in this disorder. Is it a consequence of demyelination? Alternatively, is the axonal damage a by-product of the inflammatory or immune processes involved in triggering demyelination? What is the nature of the “injury cascade” that leads from the ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.

Understanding the pathogenesis of the process might lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for MS. These questions are being approached in models of other neurological diseases such as trauma and cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, and should be actively pursued in MS research as well. Axonal transection during inflammatory demyelination. According to this schema, axonal transection during (A) is a consistent feature of inflammatory demyelinating lesions. This results in degeneration of the distal axonal segment (B) and irreversible loss of neuronal function.

This model posits that axonal viability depends upon oligodendrocyte-derived trophic effect.

MS is defined as a demyelinating disease because the myelin sheaths and their parent cells, the oligodendroglia, are major targets of immune-mediated damage (). The classical lesions are discrete plaques of demyelination, which, depending on disease stage, are associated with varying evidence of inflammation. The clinical signs, which are episodic and are not clinically predictable, are presumably related to the location of the lesions, although clinically “silent” demyelinating lesions also occur. These predominantly white matter lesions occur in multiple brain regions and appear at different times throughout the disease. Common syndromes correlated with lesions in specific areas include visual deficits, weakness and spasticity, eye movement abnormalities, and ataxia (). Lesions are often described as active or chronic, depending on whether there are signs of active inflammation, usually associated with ongoing demyelination, or whether the lesion is stable and does not show signs of inflammatory activity. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier that normally insulates the brain from pathogenic blood-borne substances is an early event in the development of MS lesions (). Antigen-specific T cells enter the nervous system, and when they encounter and recognize their specific antigen, a cascade of cytokine expression begins that contributes to the damage of the blood-brain barrier. This can be detected on contrast-enhanced MRI. Examination of active demyelinating lesions in autopsy cases of MS reveals structural and immunopathological abnormalities related to demyelination and abnormalities of oligodendrocytes. The inflammatory response is dominated by lymphocytes and macrophages, but the data on the relative numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells are still not settled. A plaque is characterized by loss of myelin sheath and infiltration by macrophages (which show myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein immunoreactivities).

Clinical Pathological Correlations in Common Syndromes of MS Often related to the involvement of the optic nerve as occurs in optic neuritis Frequently associated with plaques involving connections between the brainstem nuclei subserving eye movements One of the consequences of lesions involving the spinal cord or descending motor tracts in the white matter of internal capsule or brainstem Usually the result of lesions in cerebellum or its input-output pathways inflammatory responses amplify, macrophages are filled with lipids, myelin damage occurs, and there is apparently some collateral damage to axons. Scattered B cells and plasma cells are also sometimes associated with these lesions. Immunocytochemical analysis has suggested that there may be leakage of immunoglobulins and complement from vessels at the margins of active plaques. There is evidence for upregulation of a variety of cytokines within MS plaques including various interleukins (IL-1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12); beta-interferon; tumor necrosis factor (TNF); and transforming growth factor (TGF). Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. Their involvement in any disease is complex. They can initiate, sustain, or terminate various aspects of disease processes and are particularly involved in inflammatory responses. Specific chemokine receptors are expressed by infiltrating cells in demyelinating MS brain lesions and in CSF. These results imply pathogenic roles for specific chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions in MS and suggest new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Some investigators have emphasized that the pattern of pathology suggests a dying-back oligodendrogliopathy (those parts of the cell, such as the most distal process, farthest from the cell body are the most vulnerable). During the active stages of disease, the number of oligodendrocytes can be reduced near the demyelinating foci. Subsequently, there might be partial recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursors that may, in part, repopulate the margins of the plaque and contribute to remyelination. Trapp and colleagues have emphasized that the relapsing-remitting course is intimately related to the inflammatory demyelination and classical plaques, while more chronic progressive forms of the disease are linked to transection, or severing, of axons at sites of inflammation and demyelination. They have shown that severed axons were a consistent component in the lesions of individuals with MS and suggest that the number of these injured axons is correlated to the magnitude of the inflammation within the lesion. Axonal damage might be a pathological correlate of irreversible neurological deficits that occur in patients with progressive MS. In individuals with chronic MS, plaques are often sharply demarcated with scattered lipid-containing macrophages and little evidence of ongoing myelin destruction. Demyelination can be incomplete. The density of axons may be significantly reduced. There is usually astrogliosis within these lesions. It is not clear exactly how the axonal damage that occurs at later stages plays into this complex evolving pathology, but the extent of axonal damage appears to be a critical determinant of whether a person recovers from an attack or not. Lack of recovery from attacks and disease progression are more likely when axons are more severely damaged and repair mechanisms fail. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

The tight seal of the cells lining the blood vessels forms a blood-brain barrier that keeps many substances out of the brain. Leaky blood vessels in the body allow many molecules to cross through to other tissues, but the tight construction of the vessels in the head guards against entry of most molecules into the brain. Normally, only certain molecules, for example, blood gases such as oxygen and small nutritional molecules, can cross the blood-brain barrier, but this barrier breaks down when the brain is injured or in certain diseases, such as MS.

A correlation between demyelination and axonal degeneration observed at autopsy is supported by imaging studies, including those that compare the concentrations of -acetyl aspartate. For example, one study measured the levels of NAA, an amino acid found only in neurons that serves as a biological marker for integrity of the axon and neuronal cell body. The brains of MS patients showed significantly greater side-to-side differences in levels of NAA, indicating decreased neuronal integrity on the side of the brain with lower NAA levels. There was a correlation between this asymmetry in motor function and the asymmetry of NAA concentrations in the internal capsule. Insights into processes that lead to demyelination and axon damage can be obtained by analyzing T1-weighted image hypointensities, proton spectroscopy, MTI, and DTI and by correlating these measures with clinical and pathological findings. Gliosis is a prominent feature of the MS lesion, but it is best regarded as a secondary phenomenon. Whenever the CNS is damaged, it undergoes an injury response, usually called reactive gliosis or glial scarring. The response is broadly the same whatever the source of injury, although the details vary somewhat with different types of pathology. The glial reaction to injury includes recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, stem cells, microglia, and astrocytes. Formation of the glial scar after CNS injury generally occurs over a period of weeks. Microglia are typically the first cell types to enter the lesion. In the normal brain, they are quiescent with short, branched processes. Following injury, they exhibit various changes, including activation, cell division, and migration to the injury site. During activation, microglia display conspicuous functional plasticity, which involves changes in cell morphology, cell surface receptor expression, and production of growth factors and cytokines, and they become, in general, more macrophage like. Microglia can be either neurotoxic or neurotrophic. The final glial scar is made up mainly of a meshwork of tightly interwoven astrocyte processes, attached to one another by tight junctions and gap junctions and surrounded by extracellular matrix (reviewed in 1999 by Fawcett and Asher). (Astrocytes are irregularly star-shaped, background structural cells of the nervous system.) Gliosis is usually restricted to the area of demyelination, but it sometimes extends beyond that area. There is no specific way to identify the presence and extent of gliosis in MS lesions through MRI, although the T1 signal might be more sensitive to gliosis than the T2 signal. The role of astrocytes in gliosis is not completely known. Since there is evidence that glial scars can inhibit both axon growth and myelination, it is clearly important to know what causes them to form, what cells are involved, why they are inhibitory, and how to manipulate them. Finally, although gliosis is generally considered harmful, there is also evidence that the gliotic ensheathment of demyelinated axons might favor the restoration of nerve conduction.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The relapsing-remitting form of MS appears to be related to the demyelination of axons during relapses, followed by the remodeling and remyelination with consequent restoration of conduction that underlies remission. Remyelination is carried out by surviving oligodendrocytes or by the proliferation of progenitor cells that are then stimulated to become oligodendrocytes. Molecular remodeling of demyelinated axons, in terms of their redistributing their sodium channels along the axon, might act as a form of adaptive plasticity; this process may represent a target for future therapies. In contrast, the progressive form of the disease, which appears clinically as an unremitting accumulation of deficits, might reflect the superimposition of axonal injury or degeneration on multiple chronic foci of demyelinated axons. The finding that axonal damage can occur frequently in MS and the suggestion that these lesions contribute to persistent neurological deficits are important issues in MS research. Thus, it will be important to understand the mechanisms whereby axons are damaged and to define ways of protecting axons, which may be vulnerable to degeneration, in part due to their proximity to inflammatory and demyelinating foci. It will also be important to search for molecules that promote the regrowth of injured axons to their appropriate targets. Some of the lessons from studies of the repair of spinal cord injury are likely to be relevant here. Moreover, because abnormal patterns of ion channels have been found within neurons whose axons are undergoing demyelination, it will be important to understand the factors that influence the regulation of these channels. These lines of research, involving strategies can restore conduction in demyelinated axons represent opportunities to restore that protect axons from degeneration or promote repair, and those agents that functions and could have significant implications for therapy. Similarly, future therapeutic approaches might involve replacement of oligodendroglia with pluripotent stem cells (discussed further in ). Progenitor cells, those either already present in an individual or provided from another source by injection, can produce myelin in demyelinated foci in experimental animals. Future experimental therapeutics will involve approaches directed at restoring oligodendrocytes to ensheath axonal processes and to induce physiological modeling of axons to restore conduction. The most striking pathology in MS is the immune system's attack and destruction of the body's own myelin sheath, which is why it is believed to be an autoimmune disease, although this has not yet been definitively proven (). The pathogenic trigger that first causes the immune system to attack myelin is unknown, but the immunopathology, or pathological activity of the immune system, that ensues after that initial attack is becoming clearer. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The immune system defends the body against foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. It does so by recognizing that foreign invaders have special markers distinguishing them as “non-self,” compared to the body's own tissue (or “self”) (). Normally, the immune system reacts only to non-self invaders, not to its own tissues. Unfortunately, this process is not foolproof. Autoimmunity is an immune response mounted against antigens that are naturally produced within the body, or self-antigens, to cause lasting tissue damage. In the strictest sense, an autoimmune disease must meet several criteria. First, the disease must be reproduced by transfer of autoantibodies or autoreactive T lymphocytes (T cells) from affected to unaffected individuals. Second, the self-antigen that elicits the immune attack must be identified. Third, this antigen (or a closely related one) should cause a similar disease in an animal model. (Scientifically, it would be best to show that the antigen caused the disease in humans, but it would be unethical to intentionally infect humans, hence, the compromise for evidence in animals). It is now feasible to transfer human genes into animals in an attempt to satisfy these criteria. One of the first so-called transgenic studies that introduced certain human genes into an animal without MS led to the development of a disease resembling MS. Among the newly added genes were those for a specific type of histocompatibility antigen and for a particular type of T-cell receptor that binds to a fragment of a myelin protein (myelin basic protein). This type of study begins to confirm the autoimmune nature of MS. Human autoimmune diseases, however, are generally classified as such without meeting these three stringent criteria. Circumstantial evidence often is marshaled for classification. For example, patients are classified as having autoimmune disease if they have high levels of autoantibody or autoreactive T cells, or because there is a correlation between the level of immune activity and disease severity. Some examples of autoimmune diseases are listed in . Why does the immune system have autoreactive lymphocytes? During development, the immune system randomly builds a vast repertoire of cells that respond to a multitude of foreign antigens. At the same time, the immune system must weed out those cells that react to self-antigens. Most self-reactive B cells and T cells are removed early during development. Other regulatory mechanisms exist to keep self-reactive lymphocytes unresponsive later on. These are among the normal regulatory mechanisms resulting in immunological tolerance to most self-antigens. Even though there are usually small numbers of autoreactive lymphocytes in a normal adult, most do not cause disease, and some might even serve a (currently unknown) beneficial purpose. With autoimmune disease, however, there are large numbers of autoreactive immune cells. Autoimmune disease thus can be thought of as a failure of normal regulatory mechanisms that guard against autoimmunity. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The causes of autoimmune response in MS and most other autoimmune diseases are unknown but likely include a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental agents. For most autoimmune diseases, the actual genes and environmental agents are unknown. Gender also plays a role because women are disproportionately affected by autoimmune disease. The reasons for the gender difference are also unknown but appear to relate to distinct immune environments in women and How can genes and environment trigger autoimmune pathology? Genes control many properties of the immune system. Theoretically, autoimmune disease can occur if any of the genes controlling the immune system's ability to distinguish self from non-self are defective. The genes often suspected of predisposing to autoimmune disease encode proteins, such as histocompatibility antigens, that participate in this complex process of self versus non-self recognition. Environmental or infectious agents can stimulate pathological autoimmune reactions through at least two possible mechanisms: molecular mimicry, superantigens, and bystander damage (). Molecular mimicry occurs when a bacterial or viral epitope—the fragment of an antigen that elicits an immune response—is very similar to a self-epitope. This can occur following an infection where an immune cell targeting an epitope on a bacterium subsequently cross-reacts with a self-antigen. Superantigens are proteins from bacteria or retroviruses that lead to widespread activation of T cells. Unlike most antigens, which activate only a specific T cell, superantigens activate approximately one out of every ten T cells. Because of their generic ability to activate so many types of T cells, superantigens may inadvertently activate autoreactive T cells, which then attack self-tissues. In bystander damage, a virus upregulates a nonspecific immune response that then leads to pathology; for example, proinflammatory cytokines might activate Th1 cells or macrophages that contribute to the immunopathology. Once damage occurs, new cellular epitopes become exposed and trigger an immune response in a process called epitope spreading, which can also lead to autoimmune pathology. During an immune response against a particular epitope, the number of lymphocytes that recognize the epitope normally multiplies. Yet, in epitope spreading, the immune response escalates to target other epitopes on the same antigen or on related antigens. In this way, an initially nonpathological autoimmune response expands to produce a pathological response. The underlying basis for epitope spreading in autoimmune diseases is poorly understood. Another way to produce a pathological autoimmune response is for autoreactive lymphocytes to gain access to a target antigen from which they are ordinarily separated. The brain is one example of an anatomical sanctuary site, because it is protected by the blood-brain barrier of the central nervous system. Normally, T cells that might react against myelin do not pass across this barrier into the central nervous system. In MS, however, T cells become activated, which enables them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach their targets—myelin antigens—thereby generating an autoimmune response. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. One of the first pathological processes leading up to MS attacks is thought to be activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes, or T cells, and their migration into the central nervous system. However, T cells and the inflammatory molecules they secrete are not the only players. Many cells and molecules of the immune system—likely unleashed by T-cell activation—participate in demyeli- Interactions between major cell components of the immune system. This simplified outline shows interactions that occur in response to a foreign antigen. The antigen could be an epitope from a virus particle, bacterium, or other foreign agent. The antigen-presenting cell (APC) ingests the antigen (or in the case of an infecting virus, it may already be within the cell) and processes it into peptide fragments. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC, the cell surface structure characteristic of each individual) presents this target to a resting T cell. Binding of the peptide-MHC complex by the T-cell receptor activates the T cell. In the case of a CD8+ cell, it becomes a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), which will destroy any cells that have the same peptide-MHC complex on their surfaces. In the case of a CD4+ cell, the activated cell produces and secretes various cytokines that recruit and activate nonspecific effector cells (such as macrophages) or stimulate antigen-bound B cells to produce antibodies. When T and B lymphocytes are activated by a specific antigen, they undergo proliferation, producing more cells with their same antigen specificity.

Although no virus has yet been shown to contribute to the etiology of MS, there are several ways in which this could occur, and one of these is shown in this figure. Activated T cells cross the blood-brain barrier following activation by a microbe with a structural similarity to a component of the myelin sheath. Once inside the brain, these cells attack self-antigens, such as the various myelin proteins that are attacked in MS. NOTE: MBP = myelin basic protein. SOURCE: Steinman and Oldstone, 1997.

The key features of this cascade are not fully understood, including the precise ordering of events, the antigens targeted by T cells, and the contributions of B lymphocytes, or B cells, and other cells of the immune system. Yet, as this section explains, much insight has been gained into the immunopathology of MS. This knowledge has been—and continues to be—fundamental for devising therapies targeted to the immunopathology of MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. As much as a century ago, researchers observed that T cells were particularly abundant in MS lesions. Over time, using modern immunologic techniques, they managed to isolate and characterize a particular type of T cell, the autoreactive T cell, from the blood and CSF of MS patients. These and related findings gave credence to the hypothesis that autoreactive T cells played a dominant role in MS. After all, immunologists have long known that T cells are capable of orchestrating a multifaceted autoimmune attack. However, this was not enough to explain MS pathology. First, elevations in certain types of autoreactive T cells were not unique to MS patients. Second, and more critically, T cells were necessary but not sufficient to cause demyelinating disease in animal models. The transfer of myelin-specific T cells into normal animals initiated only inflammation, not demyelination. This suggested that other immune cells, particularly antibody-producing B cells () and macrophages, might also play key roles, even if autoreactive T cells launched the process.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The prime autoantigen that elicits the autoimmune response in MS is not known. While there are many candidate autoantigens, as yet none is preeminent. Much MS research focused on myelin basic protein (MBP), located at the inner surface of the myelin membrane. Clinical studies were shaped by research on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the classic animal model of demyelinating disease. In many species, MBP acts as a classical encephalitogenic autoantigen (an antigen capable of serving as the focus of an inflammatory attack in the brain). EAE research further established that in some strains of mice and rats, the autoimmune response to MBP displays two unique features. First, in the initial stages of the immune response in EAE, T cells react only to very small regions of the MBP molecule (“epitope dominance”), even though they later react to many more regions of the molecule (“epitope spreading”) (see ). Second, the encephalitogenic T cells in EAE use an unusually narrow repertoire of genes for their antigen receptors. (T cells recognize their target antigen by its capacity to bind to specific receptors on their surface membrane, called T-cell receptors [TCRs]). These two features raised hopes for developing immune-based therapies because a more limited range of therapies might succeed in combating MS in early stages. Unfortunately, these features turned out to be much less prominent in humans with MS. First, human T cells respond to a broader set of MBP epitopes. While there might be a relatively dominant epitope in the central portion of the MBP molecule, there are clearly many other target epitopes along the full sequence of this large polypeptide. Second, MBP-specific T cells use multiple genes for their TCRs, which allows for large variability among individuals. Generally, it appears that the T-cell response against myelin proteins differs greatly between individual patients, a property that suggests the potential need for individually designed immune therapies. Several research teams have attempted to identify MBP-specific T cells in MS patients. Unfortunately, these attempts did not show significant increases in MBP-specific T-cell counts in MS patients compared to healthy blood donors. However, when more definitive assay systems were used, increased frequencies of activated MBP-specific T cells were found in MS patients. These studies relied on complex methods and were influenced by numerous factors that complicate the interpretation of results. More direct assays, such as those that use binding of oligomeric class II-peptide complexes to specific T cells, might resolve the problem. To add a further degree of complexity, MBP does not appear to be the only autoantigen in MS: there are a number of additional myelin and nonmyelin proteins that are potential autoantigens in MS. Earlier hypotheses had implicated MBP on the basis of two lines of research. First, studies of EAE had suggested that MBP was indeed the most important, if not the only, encephalitogenic myelin autoantigen. Second, due to its particularly convenient molecular properties, MBP was the only myelin protein available both at high purity and in large ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. quantities. However, thanks to modern biotechnology, even minor myelin proteins are now available in large quantities and can be studied for their encephalitogenic capacity. Later studies established that many, if not all, myelin proteins are potentially encephalitogenic. Especially interesting among these newly recognized autoantigens is myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). In contrast to MBP, which lies on the inside of the myelin sheath, MOG lies on the surface. As one of the few myelin proteins accessible to humoral autoantibodies, MOG is a target for demyelinating immunoglobulins (see next section). In addition, MOG is a very effective autoantigen in rodents and in primates for encephalitogenic T cells. Some studies even demonstrated increased frequencies of MOG-reactive T cells in MS patients. These findings clearly warrant general confirmation. It is also important to investigate whether different subtypes of MS, which are distinguished by divergent clinical, genetic, and morphological features, are associated with enhanced T-cell responses against different target autoantigens. Thus far, research has spotlighted one class of T cells—those with a TCR termed Î±Î². Î±Î² T cells are the major class of immune cells centrally involved in adaptive immune responses against infections and tumors. Much less attention has been given to other T-cell classes (Î³Î´ T cells and NK1 T cells), which may function both as effector cells in autoimmune attacks and as suppressor cells that dampen autoimmune responses. There are reports linking the presence of Î³Î´ T cells in the brain (presumably) with the induction of heat shock proteins in MS lesions. Certain members of this broad class of proteins are a normal component of the myelin sheath, yet they are also found outside the CNS as well as in pathogens. The role of heat shock proteins in the development of the MS lesion is unknown, but there are various possibilities. Some of these proteins might act as a target autoantigen, as has been shown in autoimmune diabetes. They might also reflect inflammatory stress inflicted on local CNS cells, or they might be determinants of beneficial anti-inflammatory control mechanisms. Even though the precise pathological roles of T cells and their autoantigens are unresolved, this line of research has generated many approved or emerging therapies. These include vaccination strategies, which use either attenuated myelinspecific T cells or peptides representing myelin-specific T-cell receptors as vaccines to strengthen the body's own regulatory responses against pathogenic T cells (reviewed in Zhang et. al., 1998). Also under development are “altered peptide” therapies that use peptide analogues of myelin protein segments to induce autoreactive T cells to produce protective, rather than pathogenic, cytokine mediators. Cytokines, as discussed later, are a functionally diverse set of signaling molecules produced by T cells. *Each (Î± and Î²) refers to a polypeptide chain that forms the T-cell receptor. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. B cells (also known as B lymphocytes) have been detected in MS lesions for many years, although less consistently than T cells. While most MS research naturally focused on T cells, evidence also has accumulated for participation by autoreactive B cells. It now appears that both types of lymphocytes actively contribute to MS immunopathology. Autoreactive T cells are thought to launch inflammation and, through their release of cytokines, to stimulate B cells to secrete antibodies that cause demyelination. This is consistent with animal studies finding that EAE can be produced only by injecting myelin-specific T cells in combination with myelin-specific antibodies. Without injecting the antibodies, demyelination does not occur. In MS patients, levels in cerebrospinal fluid of the type of protein known to consist of antibodies (immunoglobulin) are often higher than in healthy people. The increased immunoglobulin is due to production by only a few different clones of B cells that have been induced to proliferate. B cells from the CSF of MS patients have been reported to contain mutations in the DNA sequences that encode antibodies, which is consistent with the notion of an antigen-driven selection of antibodies with high-affinity antigen-binding sites. Such events are commonly observed in immune responses against foreign antigens such as bacterial infections, as well as in humoral autoimmune responses. However, no foreign antigen or autoantigen responsible for the generation of oligoclonal bands in MS has yet been identified. One recent study using sophisticated immunocytochemistry furnished direct evidence of a pathologic role for autoantibodies. For the first time, MOG-specific antibodies were demonstrated to be bound to myelin debris in active MS lesions. If confirmed and extended to a larger group of patients, this finding would suggest that B-cell-derived autoantibodies might induce myelin destruction. On the other hand, although anti-MOG antibodies are found in the CSF of MS patients, they are also found in CSF of patients with other neurological diseases that are not demyelinating. Thus, despite tantalizing leads, the role of anti-MOG antibodies in MS patients is still unclear. Cytokines are soluble proteins produced and released by T cells, macrophages, and certain other cell types. Interferons (IFN- Î±, Î², and Î³), interleukins (including IL- 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, and 13), TGF-b, and the neuropoietic cytokines (such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor) are all different types of cytokines. They generally act as intercellular signaling molecules that regulate *Neuropoietic cytokines are the family of neural growth factors that act on both the nervous and the hematopoietic or immune systems.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and carry out immune functions, but their repertoire is complex. Some function as pro-inflammatory, others as anti-inflammatory agents. Some even have divergent functions during different phases of disease. Cytokines, including the subset known as chemokines (for ), also alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier or act on neural cells. Thus, particular cytokines can initiate, sustain, or terminate inflammatory disease processes. Proinflammatory cytokines and other secretory products of immune cells are proposed in several neurological diseases—including MS—to be toxic to neurons and oligodendrocytes if they are secreted in sufficiently high concentrations over a sustained period of time. In MS, the initial entry of autoreactive T cells into the CNS is thought to trigger the local production of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn begins the inflammatory process and enhances the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. A more permeable blood-brain barrier allows infiltration into the CNS of more immune cells which in turn contribute to the ongoing inflammation. Thus, understanding the roles of cytokines and their temporal sequence of activation is crucial to modifying the course of MS. Much of our present understanding of cytokine action in demyelinating disease comes from studies of animal models, including EAE. A large body of research is being compiled on the expression and possible function of cytokines as pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in MS. Some studies have used in situ immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization to visualize gene expression in lesions, whereas others have relied on the activation of inflammatory cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages) in vitro. Much of the research is comparing material from MS patients with or without treatment with immunomodulatory agents, especially glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon. Pro-inflammatory cytokines within active MS lesions have been localized to both infiltrating immune cells and glia. Longitudinal studies have linked clinical exacerbation and remission to high and low expression, respectively, of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-Î³. For example, secretion of TNF-Î³ and cell adhesion molecules by inflammatory cells is upregulated immediately prior to relapse. Yet, not all findings could be verified in all patient groups studied. Understanding of cytokines and their diverse roles throughout the course of disease, although still incomplete, has nevertheless spawned new treatments. One explanation for the success of glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon relates to their control over cytokine expression: they can induce T cells to switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (Th1) to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (Th2). T cells that are switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype release a variety of cytokines, such as IL-10, that reduce inflammation. CNS. CNS tissues were traditionally thought to be exempt from active immune reactivity, but it is now known ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. that the brain is subject to immune surveillance and can be the site of immune responses. Only activated and not resting T cells can cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with local CNS cells. Local glial cells can be stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines to express immunologically active molecules, such as the major histocompatability complex (MHC) products, cytokines, and chemokines required for local immune responses. Neurons are capable of suppressing immune responses within the CNS. Thus, immune responses are more likely to occur in areas of neuronal degeneration than in intact CNS tissues. Immune reactivity within the CNS must hence be viewed as the balance between the proinflammatory signals contributed by activated T cells and other inflammatory cells entering the brain and the anti-inflammatory signals from functional neurons. Epidemiologists define what causes a disease and what puts an individual at risk of getting this disease. They look for correlations such as whether Caucasians are more likely to have MS than Asians or whether residents of one county are more likely to get MS than residents of another. These correlations lead to hypotheses or working models as to which factors actually cause MS and which are only associated with it. These hypotheses or models can then be tested experimentally. Epidemiological studies have limitations, but for a complex disease like MS, they can rule out some factors and highlight others. They are the first step toward finding a biological mechanism for MS, or possibly a cure. Most epidemiological studies of MS have been observational and retrospective; researchers collected the information (for example, ethnicity, age of onset) from an individual (or from records) that had been diagnosed with MS. Such studies rely on an individual's ability to accurately recall information from years ago, for example, the infections that she or he had before the age of five. Other sources of data, such as death certificates, can contain incorrect information. Despite these shortcomings, a few factors consistently correlate with MS prevalence. Determining how these factors lead to an increased risk of MS has proven more difficult. The risk of MS increases with increasing distance from the equator. In the United States, this is seen as a gradient of risk, with higher risk in northern regions and a lower risk in the south. In Australia, the prevalence of MS increases similarly from lower, subequatorial latitudes to the more southerly latitudes. Studies on migrating populations, although inconclusive, offer tentative support for the hypothesis that environment influences MS risk. Individuals who have moved from a region with one risk level to a region with a higher or lower risk, in general, adopt the risk level of their new home. This is especially true for individuals moving from a low-risk to a high-risk area. Studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that this geographical effect had a defined susceptibility period before age 15. Although these data still ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appear in the MS literature and have led to several hypotheses about the effects of puberty or early dietary effects on MS risk, the sample numbers are too small to support such a tight cutoff. A later and larger study assayed the effects of migration by comparing location at birth with location at approximately 24 years of age. Although individuals did adopt the risk of their new home, the age values in that study are not precise enough to add to the argument for or against a cutoff. Most recently, a study comparing the prevalence of MS among native-born Australians and Australian immigrants from the United Kingdom (thereby providing a rough control for genetic background) suggests that rather than being established around age 15, environmental risk factors operate over many years and into early adulthood. Although the migrational studies suggest an environmental correlation with MS, the root cause of this latitude effect is unknown. Differences in diet or sunlight have been proposed, but neither has been supported by rigorous studies. Alternatively, the geographical distribution of MS could result from the migration either of a viral agent or of individuals (perhaps originally Scandinavians) who carried a pool of susceptible genes. Ethnicity is another definite risk factor. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other groups. In a study of 5,305 U.S. veterans with MS, Caucasian males had twice the risk of MS as African-American males. Other factors can modulate the effect of ethnicity on risk of MS. MS is almost absent among black Africans. African Americans, however, show a low risk of MS; this might be due to genetic mixing with Caucasian Americans or to an environmental effect. MS occurrence among Asians is also quite low. Again, Asian Americans show an intermediate risk for MS between Asians and Caucasian Americans. A discussion of the role of genetics in MS can be found in the next section. When applied to a complex disorder such as MS, conclusions derived from epidemiologic data of this type must be interpreted cautiously because inapparent explanations may be present. For example, a higher-than-expected incidence of MS observed in South Vietnamese immigrants (a low-risk group) residing in France (a moderate-risk area) superficially suggest a modifying role of the environment on MS. However, this immigrant population was in fact racially mixed and contained substantial numbers of individuals with mixed French and Asian ancestry. Thus, the higher-than-expected MS incidence in these immigrants could have been due to either genetic or environmental factors. Neither factor can be ruled out. A similar argument could explain the incidence of MS in West Indian immigrants residing in Great Britain. On the other hand, the increased incidence of MS observed in Japanese-Americans compared to individuals residing in Japan is not easily explained by racial admixture and does support a role of the environment on MS risk. As in other autoimmune diseases, women are much more likely to get MS than men, suggesting that hormonal or genetic factors are involved. The ratio of women to men with MS is about 2:1. Among both sexes, the age of onset for ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MS ranges between 10 and 59 years, with the highest incidence occurring among individuals in their mid-20s to early 30s, depending on the population examined. Males tend to have a slightly later mean age of onset than females. This results, at least in part, from an increase in the percentage of males with the primary progressive variant. This form of MS has a later onset than other types and affects approximately 15 percent of patients. The ratio of males to females with primary progressive MS is approximately 1:1. Epidemiological studies have provided conflicting data as to whether an infectious agent (viral or bacterial) either causes or triggers MS. The occurrence of MS epidemics has suggested that an infectious agent might be at work. The two MS epidemics cited most often, one in the Faroe Islands and one in Iceland, were directly preceded by the influx of foreign troops during World War II. Both, however, are open to multiple interpretations. Coincident with the stationing of foreign soldiers, the population of the Faroe Islands received increased medical services and changed its diet. The Icelandic epidemic, on the other hand, began shortly after the arrival of that island's first neurologist. In both cases, the increased prevalence of MS might have resulted from an increased level of detection or a combination of other factors, such as nonspecific immune stimulation resulting from the introduction of a variety of infectious agents into previously unexposed populations. No infectious agent has been associated with either of these MS clusters. Another area of investigation has explored whether environmental factors contribute to the onset of MS or the probability of MS attacks. Some studies suggest that MS attacks are more likely to occur in the spring and fall than in the winter or summer. Such a finding, if true, suggests that a relationship exists between some viral infections and the risk of exacerbations. Many patients with MS are also at heightened risk for urinary tract, pulmonary, or skin infections, yet the relationship between these potentially preventable infections and the course of MS has never been adequately studied. Additional research in this area is needed. Perhaps the most clear-cut epidemiologic link to MS attacks is the effect of pregnancy and the postpartum period. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the risk for MS attacks, particularly during the third trimester. The postpartum period is, conversely, associated with a significant increase in risk. An immunosuppressive state in the pregnant mother is created by increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Th2 cells) which, presumably, dampen the autoimmune reaction that produces attacks of MS. The explanation for the increase in attack risk during the postpartum period is less clear but might involve immunostimulation by prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. The absence of supporting evidence does not prove that a virus is connected with the disease. Unrelated individuals (in the case of the adoptee and conjugal studies) may differ in their susceptibilities to infectious agents. Researchers have isolated a variety of viruses from individual MS patients, but to ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. date, no one virus has been isolated from all MS patients examined. It might, however, be the case either that MS is not one single disease or that there are multiple ways to trigger it. Researchers continue to look for causative infectious agents. (See section below on infectious causes of MS for further discussion.) The aggregation of MS in some geographic areas, ethnic populations, or families could be explained by a common environmental exposure, a shared genetic background, or a combination of both environmental and genetic susceptibility. It is likely that in MS, as in other complex disorders, both factors contribute. It is also possible that the relative contributions of environment versus genetics might vary in different situations, depending on the degree to which an individual is genetically susceptible and the specific environmental context. The role of genetic factors in MS is discussed in the next section. MS is not considered a genetic disease in the classic sense because it usually occurs sporadically. However, population and family studies are consistent with a principal pathogenic role for genetic risk factors in MS etiology. This genetic component is indicated primarily by the increased relative risk to siblings of affected individuals compared with the general population. Familial aggregation (Î»s) is measured by estimating the ratio of the prevalence (frequency) in siblings versus the population prevalence of the disease. A Î»s of 1 represents no familial clustering of the trait. For MS, the Î»s is estimated to be between 20 (0.02/0.001) and 40 (0.04/0.001). Half-sibling1 and adoption studies confirm that genetic, and not environmental, factors are responsible for familial aggregation. In addition, twin studies from different populations consistently indicate that a monozygotic twin of an MS patient is at higher risk (25 to 30 percent concordance) for MS than a dizygotic twin (2 to 5 percent), providing additional evidence for a significant but complex genetic etiology. Finally, the frequent occurrence of MS in some ethnic populations (particularly those of northern European origin) compared to others (African and Asian groups), irrespective of geographic location, also provides evidence for a complex genetic etiology. Overall, adoption and family studies suggest that being related to a person with MS is a greater risk factor than living with someone with MS. A simple genetic model for the inheritance of MS is unlikely to be valid. Such a single-gene hypothesis is at odds with concordance data in twin and family studies and with the observed nonlinear decrease in disease risk as the genetic distance from the relative with MS is increased. It is likely that susceptibility is determined by multiple independent genetic loci (polygenic inheritance), each with a relatively modest contribution to overall risk. It is also possible that there are different genetic causes of susceptibility to MS (genetic heterogeneity). Finally, the genes that contribute to MS susceptibility are likely to be normal, common variants (or alleles) of genes rather than obviously defective mutations. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Most individuals who carry such susceptibility genes would have no obvious deleterious consequences. For example, the DR2 gene (described below) is the most important genetic contributor to MS susceptibility identified to date. Approximately half of patients with MS have this gene, but so do 15 to 20 percent of healthy Caucasians. Thus, only approximately 1 in 250 people who have DR2 develop MS. The cumulative action of several susceptibility genes, each with weak effects and limited penetrance, is thought to underlie genetic susceptibility to MS. (Penetrance refers to the likelihood that a person carrying an allele will develop specific manifestations caused by that gene.) The effects of individual susceptibility genes may also be influenced by interactions with other genes and by specific environmental exposures. Locus heterogeneity is also likely, meaning that there are different susceptibility genes in different MS patients. The possibility that MS is a heterogeneous disease with different causes or pathological processes adds an additional level of complexity to the analysis. In addition to MS, similar issues are present in other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus that are genetically complex, and common research tools will be needed to decipher specific disease genes in these different conditions. The genetic region most clearly associated with MS susceptibility is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, or HLA [human leukocyte antigen] in humans) locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21) (). This association has been seen in different population studies that have relied primarily on sporadic patients. Formal genetic linkage to 6p has also been found in several recent whole-genome scans of multiple affected MS families. Many of the MHC genes are extraordinarily variable or polymorphic, reflecting the importance of genetic variation of these critical antigen-presenting molecules in the maintenance of a heterozygous advantage and the need to effectively present a diverse array of antigens if immune homeostasis is to be maintained. Immune homeostasis refers to the capacity of the immune system to respond appropriately to a diverse number of infectious pathogens and tumors without initiating unhealthy responses against self-constituents (auto- The major histocompatibility complex is a chromosomal region that contains more than 100 genes, many of which make proteins involved in the immune system. It is named for the role it plays in rejecting tissue transplants ( means tissue). In humans, this region resides on chromosome 6 and is called the human leukocyte antigen gene complex. The terminology is slightly confusing because ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MHC and HLA also refer to the proteins that some of these genes make. In this report, the term “MHC molecules” is used to indicate the proteins. The role of the immune system is to differentiate between self and non-self. This allows it to tell the difference between, for example, muscle tissue (self) and an invading virus (non-self) and to respond appropriately. To do this, the immune system relies on several different proteins that specifically bind antigens. This process is analogous to a lock and key. The “lock” is an antibody, a T-cell receptor, or an MHC molecule. The “key” is an antigen, which can be a carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, or protein—anything that binds specifically to a component of the immune system. This discussion focuses on T-cell receptors and MHC molecules. T-cell receptors sit on the surface of T cells and bind to antigens outside the cell. (In the case of T-cell receptors and MHC molecules, antigens are small protein fragments.) Binding to an antigen signals the T cell either to die, to do nothing, or to become active. The signal context, such as whether the antigen is self or non-self, determines which of these signals is relayed. However the T cell cannot bind the antigen alone. It needs the help of an MHC molecule. MHC molecules sit on the surface of other cells. The MHC molecule, like two outstretched arms, holds onto an antigen and presents it to a T-cell receptor. There are two major classes of MHC molecules. MHC I molecules, which are expressed on most cell types, present antigens to CD8+ T cells. MHC II molecules, which are expressed on special antigen presenting cells (APCs), present antigens to CD4+ T cells. In humans, there are three main class I molecules, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and three main class II molecules, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR. Each arm of the MHC molecule is made up of a separate protein. In the case of MHC I molecules, there is an Î±-chain (A, B, or C) that pairs with the protein b2microglobulin. An MHC II molecule is made up of an Î±-chain and a Î²-chain (for example, DP-Î± and DP-Î²), but the story becomes more complex. Each MHC molecule can bind many but not all of the thousands of antigens that confront the immune system. The immune system relies on diversity among the MHC proteins to help stack the odds in its favor. The gene for each MHC protein chain comes in different varieties, or alleles. One of the MHC Î²-chains has more than 150 alleles. Each of these alleles produces a slightly different protein. The proteins vary just enough that although they all function as MHC proteins, they can bind different antigens. Any one person will have two alleles, at most, for a particular MHC protein (there are two copies of each gene in human cells), but across a population of individuals, this variety becomes more important. For example, in Gambia, West Africa, 25 percent of HLA-B genes are the HLA-B53 allele, compared to less than 1 percent in Europe. HLA-B53 is very effective at presenting an antigen from the parasite that causes malaria to CD8+ T cells. Researchers hypothesize that because HLA-B53 can protect people from the most severe forms of malaria, it is more prevalent in Gambia. Having a particular MHC allele can also be a disadvantage, as researchers have shown in the case of HLA-DR2 and MS. (HLA-DR2 actually designates both a specific DR-a chain allele and a DR-b chain allele.) Scientists still do not understand how HLA-DR2 predisposes individuals to MS, but this might have to do with the MHC molecule's ability to present specific antigens (for example, a fragment of myelin basic protein) to T cells.

In Caucasian MS populations of northern European descent, the critical MS-associated genetic region is thought to reside near the class II locus and is comprised of a group of genes with specific polymorphisms (alleles) that tend to occur in certain fixed combinations, termed haplotypes. In molecular terms, the “DR2” haplotype is designated as HLA-DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602. DR molecules are comprised of alpha and beta chains (encoded by A and B genes, respectively), and the polymorphisms are predominantly present in the beta chain. Of the more than 100 beta-chain sequence variations identified in humans, only one (1501, also designated as DR2) is associated with MS. How can the DR2 association with MS be explained? The DR2 molecule itself may have a propensity to bind peptide antigens of myelin and stimulate disease-inducing T cells. DR2 is known to bind with high affinity to a region of MBP (spanning amino acids 89-98) thought to be “immunodominant” in humans. X-ray crystallography of the DR2-MBP peptide complex revealed that the DR2 molecule contains a distinctive hydrophobic pocket in its antigen-binding region, created by a unique alanine residue at the B71 position into which glutamic acid at position 93 of MBP is tightly bound, anchoring the MBP-DR2 complex. In a larger sense, the structure of the antigen-binding domain of DR2 molecules likely facilitates binding of many peptides containing certain amino acid residues, specifically aromatic amino acids. Glatiramer acetate (copolymer 1), a currently available disease-modifying therapy for MS, is a random synthetic protein composed of four amino acids, including tyrosine. The tyrosine residues of processed copolymer peptides likely also bind to the hydrophobic pocket of DR2, perhaps interfering with presentation of this key MBP peptide to encephalitogenic T cells. It is surprising that no data exist on the interaction of DR2 and the response to glatiramer acetate in MS. Another possibility is that the DR2 molecule does not itself predispose to MS but that another nearby gene (perhaps another HLA gene such as DQ) is responsible. DR2 is also linked to other diseases. Besides MS, narcolepsy is the disease most strongly linked to DR2. In various studies, the HLA region has been estimated to confer somewhere between 10 percent and half of the inheritability of MS. To date, no other genes of major effect have been identified in genomic screens. Several studies appear to demonstrate that a deletion mutation in the CCR5 chemokine receptor gene (a coreceptor for HIV) on chromosome 3 confers a later age of onset or a more benign course of MS; this mutation is also associated with protection against HIV. This is particularly important because the expression of CCR5, which is increased in MS brain lesions, is thought to attract inflammatory cells into tissue. Another locus on chromosome 19q22 near apolipoprotein C1 has been linked to MS in several genomic screens, but the estimated Î»s is only 1.4. A polymorphism near the gene for myelin basic protein on chromosome 21 was reported to be linked to MS in a family from Finland, but not in other populations. Some studies have suggested linkages or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. associations with the TCR beta-chain locus on chromosome 7, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14, and a region on chromosome 5, but others have not found similar linkages. The inability to confirm some genetic regions as containing MS susceptibility genes might reflect the small genetic contribution of these putative genes or genetic heterogeneity; alternatively, the original claim might have been spurious. As noted above, it is likely that an additive model consisting of multiple independent genes, each with small effects, explains the non-MHC genetic contributions to MS. It should be emphasized, however, that the identification of specific genes that have even very minor genetic effects on MS can have an enormous payoff, both in terms of helping to decipher the underlying biology of MS and in pointing to new potential treatments. For example, the genetic studies discussed earlier that identified a role for the CCR5 chemokine receptor suggest that therapies aimed at this receptor could be investigated in people with MS. Perhaps the strongest indication that MS is a heterogeneous disorder comes from HLA studies showing an absence of DR2 association in particular ethnic groups or perhaps in some clinical variants. In Japanese patients, one form of MS (“Western type”) is characterized by disseminated CNS involvement and is associated with the DR2 haplotype. In contrast, a more restricted form of MS in which optic nerve and/or spinal cord involvement predominate (“Asian MS”) is not associated with DR2. Lesions in the non-DR2-associated condition are frequently more severe and necrotizing than in the disseminated form. In one report, the Asian MS form was genetically associated with an HLA gene named DP (the DPB1*0501 allele). Another area of uncertainty is the strength of the association between primary progressive MS (PPMS) and DR2. A number of (relatively) small studies failed to show any association between PPMS and DR2, although a recent larger study from northern Ireland appeared to show an association; it is possible that PPMS represents more than one underlying disorder. Evidence for genetic heterogeneity is not limited to case-control HLA association studies but is also derived from formal linkage studies. Analysis of the MHC locus in an American multiple affected member MS data set confirmed the significant genetic linkage to this region (lod score of 4.60), and the specific association with the DR2 allele; however 25 percent of the families that were DR2 negative showed no linkage to the HLA region on 6p21. This indicated most likely the presence of locus heterogeneity in familial MS in Caucasians. A related *Lod scores are based on the ogarithm of the ds of linkage between two genes. A score of 3 or more is considered evidence of a genetic linkage between a known gene (or gene marker) and another unknown gene that underlies a trait (such as MS). That information thus indicates that the trait has a genetic basis and localizes the gene to a specific chromosomal region. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. observation in MS-prone Caucasian families is that the phenotypic expression of MS aggregates within families in some cases, suggesting that some clinical manifestations of MS are influenced by an individual's genetic background. The extent to which distinct clinical forms of MS are associated with different susceptibility genes, as may be the case in EAE (see discussion of animal models), is not known. Also unknown is whether specific genes interact with certain causative agents or triggers. Genetic studies have the potential to answer these questions, particularly when the information is analyzed in combination with epidemiologic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. There are several human and animal diseases of known etiology or pathogenesis that resemble either the clinical or the pathological features of MS (). Animal diseases that resemble MS are discussed under animal models. CNS demyelinating diseases include those mediated by immune responses, infection, and toxins, as well as inherited disorders. Infectious agents can induce direct injury of oligodendrocytes and their myelin membranes, as well as indirect injury via the immune system. A variety of toxins, such as diphtheria, lysolecithin, cuprizone, and ethidium bromide, have been associated with demyelinating lesions. Many of these toxins induce lysis of the oligodendrocyte, with demyelination as a secondary effect. In addition, nutritional deprivation can be associated with demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous system. Immune-Mediated and Virus-Induced CNS Demyelinating Diseases Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), also known as post vaccination encephalomyelitis, occurs as a consequence of vaccination with neural antigens. EAE, the most widely used animal model of MS, is the animal counterpart of this human disease. ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. The uniformity of lesions differs from the multi-age lesions found in even the most acute case of MS. Post vaccination immune-mediated damage can also affect the peripheral nervous system. Since there is no standard laboratory-based test to diagnose the human disorder, the most reliable descriptions of the clinical spectrum of the disease are derived from collections of cases in which epidemiologic and statistical studies support the association of a triggering stimulus and disease. Such criteria are best met by cases associated with immunization with CNS tissue containing vaccines, for example, original Pasteur rabies vaccine. This vaccine complication can occur at all ages. A clinical hallmark of the rabies vaccine-associated form of ADEM is its uniphasic course evolving over days to several weeks. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. CNS Demyelinating Diseases That Resemble MS ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. Multifocal CNS lesions can occur as a component of an array of systemic collagen vascular disorders including systemic lupus eryhemtosus and polyarteritis nodosa. The CNS manifestations may be the presenting feature. The peripheral nervous system is also frequently involved. PML is caused by the JC virus, which infects and destroys oligodendrocytes with minimal associated immune response. It typically occurs in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised individuals and is common in AIDS. The disease can feature a subacute progressive or relapsing clinical course. The imaging and pathologic features can be distinguished from classical MS. HTLV-1 (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) infection is sometimes associated with a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy, usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. These inherited disorders are characterized by specific gene defects that result in either inadequate formation or excess breakdown of myelin. There may be a prominent inflammatory response in the region of myelin breakdown, but this is considered to be secondary to tissue breakdown. To date, therapeutic attempts with immunomodulatory agents in the leukodystrophies, specifically, adrenoleukodystrophy, have been ineffective. Toxic optic neuropathy, subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) Outbreaks of toxic optic neuropathy and SMON have been described in Cuba and in Japan.11,12,99 Sporadic cases of toxic optic neuropathy likely account for the disorder tobacco-alcohol amblyopia. Conversely, one need consider whether deficiency syndromes could underlie development of demyelinating syndromes; deficiency of vitamin B12, a cofactor in myelin formation, has also been implicated.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. ADEM, or postinfectious encephalomyelitis, has been implicated as a consequence of a wide array of viral infections, although for many, the epidemiologic data are not strong enough to support a causal link. Measles virus epidemics have, however, been convincingly linked to ADEM. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis (PIE) is thought to be autoimmune in nature rather than secondary to a direct virus injury for the following reasons: (1) encephalitis appears after the rash clears; (2) there is generally little or no evidence of infectious virus or viral genome in the CNS at the time of the demyelinating disease; and (3) there is evidence of increased reactivity against myelin antigens during the demyelinating disease. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis is generally uniphasic. Immune system disturbances, which are known to occur following measles virus infection, might underlie the immunopathological response of post-infectious encephalomyelitis. A new direction for studies of PIE involves the possibility of establishing a model for this disease in transgenic mice that express the CD46 measles virus receptor. Molecular cross-reactivity, or molecular mimicry, has been demonstrated between myelin antigens and an array of viruses. Homologous sequences from viruses have been used to induce EAE (for example, hepatitis virus antigens). The extent of T-cell receptor degeneracy (meaning that the same receptor can respond to a wide sequence of peptides) and T-cell receptor heterogeneity in humans suggests that a wide array of exogenous agents could induce such a disease mechanism. As in MS, the putative infectious trigger could be different in individual MS patients depending on their immunogenetic makeup and the status of their immune system at the time of infection. A remaining challenge in MS is to determine whether any infectious agents detected in the CNS of such cases also persist in the CNS without causing harm or whether they are responsible for generating a pathogenic immune response. ADEM cases are usually sporadic, and it is sometimes difficult to identify the initiating factor. Relapsing cases of ADEM have been described, especially in younger-age patients. For some cases, characteristic pathologic material has been available. Similarly, the EAE model can be manipulated to produce a relapsing chronic disorder by selecting animals with specific immunogenetic backgrounds and timing their immunizations so that the underlying systemic immune response is amplified or the blood-brain barrier is altered. Such variables could also determine the nature of the response of humans when they are exposed to potential disease-inducing antigens. JC virus, a member of the papovavirus family, is a common pathogen in humans, although the *JC refers to the initials of the individual from whom the virus was isolated in 1970. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. primary disease caused by this virus is not characterized. Common symptoms include hemiparesis, aphasia, focal seizures, and visual disturbances. JC virus is thought to reactivate in immunosuppressed hosts, especially individuals with AIDS, producing the opportunistic infection PML. The disease involves a progressive CNS syndrome with symptoms and signs that suggest white matter involvement. Demyelination is usually most prominent in the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. The histopathology is characterized by the presence of oligodendrocytes with intranuclear inclusion bodies filled with papovavirus infectious particles, indicating that this disease involves a direct, lytic infection of the oligodendrocyte; that is, the oligodendrocyte is broken apart after being infected with the virus. Enlarged astrocytes are also seen, suggesting that the JC virus can transform these cells. Demyelination is a result of the direct oligodendrocyte infection by JC virus. Thus, in PML the immune response is considered to be protective rather than pathogenic. This retrovirus is common in the tropics as well as Japan, and is usually associated with asymptomatic disease. HTLV-1 infection is infrequently associated with a T-cell leukemia or lymphoma or a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. The CSF generally shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated IgG and oligoclonal IgG bands directed against HTLV-1. Necrotizing lesions with inflammation in the white matter are present in the spinal cord. HAM/TSP can resemble MS clinically. In fact, a case of HAM/TSP might be diagnosed as MS if it were not for the presence of HTLV-1 antibody and the observation that the HTLV-1 genome can be detected in the CNS. The pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. There are numerous CD8+ T cells that recognize the virus, suggesting that this immune response might foster white matter disease. Infected glial cells are a possible source of inflammatory pathogenic cytokines and might also be the target for these cytolytic T cells. In addition, there is some evidence that molecular mimicry plays a role in disease pathogenesis. Host genetic factors, for example, HLA type, might also be important in determining susceptibility to HAM/TSP after infection. It has not been proven that MS is caused by an infectious agent, but various data, including the inflammatory nature of the disease, epidemiological studies, and a heightened immune response against several pathogens, suggest an infectious etiology (reviewed in 1998 by Kastrukoff et al.). Demyelinating diseases that clinically and pathologically resemble MS can be caused by viral agents or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Koch’s Postulate on Causation of Disease by a Pathogen The pathogen is always present in pathologically affected tissue. It would be rare to consistently isolate a pathogen from all cases of the disease that it causes because of shortcomings in isolation procedures. The pathogen is not present in tissues from controls. Pathogens can have a variety of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic disease to varied diseases. Host restriction may prevent experimental transmission. immunopathological responses (). Infectious agents might be able to cause demyelination either directly, as a result of oligodendrocyte lysis, or indirectly, by means of an immunopathological response. Demyelination mediated by an immunopathological response can occur by a number of mechanisms. For example, the infectious agent can induce a pathogenic cross-reactive immune response (molecular mimicry), or the release of myelin antigens can stimulate an immune response that is directed against white matter antigens and becomes more broad over time (epitope spreading). (See for a summary of autoimmunity and disease.) There are clear limitations to using classical criteria to implicate a pathogen isolated in MS as a causal agent for the disease, as shown in . These issues make it especially difficult to establish the significance of a positive isolation from tissues of a patient with MS. However, all cases in which an infectious agent causes a disease will clearly not fit standard criteria, and individualization of the requirements is sometimes necessary. Because of these limitations, it is prudent to consider criteria that may be more appropriate and realistic. One could consider the following additional guidelines in analyzing disease causation by a pathogen: consistent transmission or isolation of the pathogen; cure or effective treatment of the disease following elimination of the pathogen; absence of the disease in geographic regions where the pathogen is not present. It may also be appropriate to consider particular molecular signatures related either to the genes of the pathogen or to the transcription expression profile associated with a particular pathogen. Many pathogens have been implicated over the years as etiological agents in MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Agents Isolated or Implicated in the Etiology of MS Some of these claims have been doubted for the following reasons: contamination (for example, spirochete), artifacts of isolation methods (for example, simian cytomegalovirus), and normal flora (for example, herpes simplex-1 [HSV-1]). Although some of these agents are clearly capable of inducing a CNS demyelinating syndrome that resembles MS, it remains uncertain whether particular cases in which a pathogen is isolated represent a rare MS-like case or whether the pathogen may actually be a common cause of MS. There are various possible explanations of why so many pathogens have been isolated in MS but no single pathogen has been consistently observed. First, there might be a variety of pathogens that can independently cause MS (i.e., the disease is multifactorial), perhaps inducing heterogeneous forms of the disease. Second, MS might not be an infectious disease. The isolations of different pathogens might all be artifactual or related to rare events associated with a particular pathogen. Third, the relationship of the pathogen to MS might be a relatively minor one, possibly through interactions with genetic factors. Finally, the true pathogen might not yet have been identified. Thus far, there is inadequate evidence to either accept or reject suggestions that any particular pathogen is causally related to MS. A variety of members of the herpes group of viruses (for example, simian cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV-1, and human herpesvirus-6 [HHV-6]) have been implicated in the etiology of MS. Members of this group of viruses remain attractive candidates as etiologic agents in MS since they are common pathogens that are known to persist and reactivate from a latent stage (and therefore could trigger the attacks and remissions seen in MS) and in some cases can induce focal demyelination in animals (see discussion of animal models of virus-induced demyelination). The most recent herpesvirus candidate to generate attention is HHV-6. HHV-6, a common pathogen, is the cause of the childhood disease, roseola (exanthem subitem). This virus is associated with febrile seizures in children, can invade the CNS, and can persist in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the spinal fluid. In some cases, HHV-6 induces an MS-like disease, which raises the issue ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. of its broader involvement in MS. Some recent studies of HHV-6 have found no or rare evidence of HHV-6 genome in MS CSF (as well as little, if any, evidence of genome from several other members of the herpesvirus group). One recent study reported that there was an increased incidence of HHV-6 (as well as HSV and varicella-zoster virus) genome in CNS tissue from MS cases compared to tissues from controls; however, the differences were not statistically significant (see Sanders). Some investigators have argued that the cell type that is infected by HHV-6 differs in MS CNS compared to controls and, therefore, that the virus plays a role in the pathogenesis of MS. The interpretation of HHV-6 studies may be complicated because HHV-6 infection and the localization of the virus may be altered secondary to inflammation associated with MS or to immunosuppressive treatment of MS patients; therefore, a change in localization of HHV-6 in MS CNS compared to control CNS may be unrelated to any pathogenic role of HHV-6 in MS. Although HHV-6 may not induce the white matter lesions of MS, it remains a possibility that HHV-6 contributes to the demyelination seen in some cases of MS. The recent identification of CD46 as a cellular receptor for HHV-6 and the availability of transgenic mice that carry CD46 provide an opportunity to develop an experimental model of HHV-6-induced CNS disease pathogenesis. A recent study found that CSF from MS patients was culture-positive for and PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-positive for this agent more commonly than CSF from patients with other neurological disease. In addition, there was evidence of increased antibody against chlamydia in MS CSF, as well as evidence that MS CSF oligoclonal IgG bands were absorbed by chlamydia antigens. This work clearly needs confirmation. Members of the public awaiting cures for specific diseases often express impatience with the fact that most research on the biological basis of disease is based on animal studies, complaining that the time and money spent on animal studies would be better invested in clinical trials. However, animal studies are not simply interchangeable with clinical studies. Ultimately, every biologically active substance exerts its effects at the cellular and molecular levels, and the evidence has shown that this is remarkably consistent among mammals, even those as different in body and mind as rats and humans. Thus, animals can serve as models for basic biological processes in humans and can provide information about how drugs work that would not be obtainable in clinical studies. Animal models in which both spontaneous and induced disease occur have contributed greatly to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases, and in the future, they will be increasingly used to aid in the assessment of various treatment modalities. A variety of animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis and experimental treatment of diseases that share features with MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Immunization of mice, rats, or primates with myelin proteins (MBP, MOG, PLP) or other autoantigens (PLP). CREAE is a chronic, relapsing type of EAE In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis Genetic engineering is used to produce animals that express particular human genes hypothesized to be involved in MS A variety of viruses can induce CNS demyelination, including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and herpes simplex virus Most of our present knowledge of myelin-specific autoimmunity and, more generally, of immune reactivity within the CNS emanates from experimental animal models. It should, however, be noted that there is a diversity of distinct models, defined by the animal species, the target autoantigen, and the mode of induction. Three basic types of animal models have been developed to understand the disease mechanisms underlying MS: EAE, virus-induced demyelination, and genetically modified animals. EAE models have served, in many respects, as the prototype for current thinking on the pathogenesis of MS. This paralytic disease is characterized by the presence of inflammation and demyelination in the CNS. It is an autoimmune syndrome induced in different susceptible strains and species, generally by intradermal immunization with myelin antigens (natural or synthetic) or by adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes reactive against myelin proteins. The antigens capable of inducing EAE vary depending upon the strain and species of animal, the adjuvants employed, and perhaps also the history of environmental exposures experienced by the animal. EAE should be considered not as a single model but rather as a heterogeneous family of related disorders. Each of the EAE variants reflects different aspects of human MS, and conversely, there is no one EAE model that represents the entire complexity of MS (). As is the case in MS, susceptibilities to EAE are determined as complex genetic traits. In both disorders, the most evident susceptibility locus resides within the HLA locus. Also in both disorders, locus heterogeneity is extensive (i.e., different loci and genes). Different genes can act at specific stages of the ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Comparison Between Multiple Sclerosis and EAE SOURCE: Larry Steinman, presentation to the committee, November 17, 1999. EAE or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) disease process, influencing severity, recovery, susceptibility to relapse, remyelination, and other elements of the phenotype. Knowledge of the extensive heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and modifier genes in these MS models should provide targets for study in human MS. Even within genetically identical littermates, the immune response following immunization with whole myelin is heterogeneous, with different antigenic targets dominating in different individuals. When groups of genetically identical animals are housed in different facilities, the resulting clinical syndromes can be markedly different, presumably reflecting the effects of different individual microenvironments. Studies of EAE established that the pathogenic agents of the disease are CD4+ T cells, which produce cytokines of the proinflammatory Th1 pattern (IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±, but no IL-4) upon stimulation. The precursors of these T cells are contained within the normal immune repertoire, but they unfold their pathogenic potential only on activation, by either specific antigens, microbial superantigens, or mitogens. In EAE induced in the Lewis rat strain (and H-2 mice) by immunization ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. with MBP, the encephalitogenic T cells recognize almost exclusively single, circumscript epitope segments of the MBP in the molecular context of MHC class II (clonal dominance). This dominance can be gradually lost over time, a phenomenon referred to as determinant spreading. Furthermore, in these models, the T-cell receptor for most autoreactive T cells is based on a highly simplified repertoire of structural genes, such as the VÎ²8.2 gene for the TCR Î²-chain. These unusual features of antigen recognition have raised hopes with regard to immunospecific therapies. Unfortunately, however, they seem to be limited to only a few experimental models. Most EAE models, as well as the human myelin-specific T cells, do not show either striking epitope dominance or T-cell receptor biases. To date, attempts to identify possible functions of CNS-specific T-cell classes distinct from CD4+ T cells have not led to consistent pictures. Evidence from T-cell transfer models and TCR transgenic mice suggests that CD8+ T cells might help control and limit an ongoing CD4+ dependent EAE process. Most acute EAE models show profuse inflammatory CNS reactions with a conspicuous absence of large-scale demyelination, implying that MS-like demyelination is not caused directly by myelin-specific T cells but must be brought about by other mechanisms. B cells are the best-characterized effectors of this function. Large, confluent inflammatory demyelinated lesions can be produced in rats by transferring encephalitogenic T cells along with a monoclonal antibody against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. The T cells cause inflammation, thereby opening the blood-brain barrier to the autoantibodies, which enter the CNS where they bind to myelin and destroy it via complement- or phagocyte-dependent mechanisms. “Simple” immunization of rodents with MOG can also produce the same result. In addition to producing humoral autoantibodies, brain-specific B cells target and present myelin antigens to specific T cells. During this presentation process, the B cells may stimulate the activation of specific T cells, with a possible tendency to shift them from Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 cytokine (anti-inflammatory) profiles. The roles of autoreactive B cells in the pathogenesis of EAE are incompletely understood, mostly because of technical shortcomings. In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen-specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis. The germline repertoire of immunoglobulin genes in these mice has been replaced by the mature, rearranged gene encoding a MOG-specific autoantibody. Most, if not all, of the B cells in these mice express immunoglobulin receptors that are autoreactive to MOG. The mice spontaneously produce high titers of anti-MOG autoantibodies in their blood. There is no natural, spontaneous animal model resembling MS. The immunological conditions leading to relapses ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and remissions of inflammatory demyelinating disease over time are most commonly examined in chronic relapsing versions of EAE. These episodic courses depend on the modes of immunization as well as on genetic factors innate to the host animals. Although the conditions that trigger relapses in CREAE models are not yet well understood, models are expected to provide clues to these essential aspects of MS, especially when refined by the use of suitable transgenic animals. It has recently been shown that a chronic relapsing EAE in a primate, the common marmoset, is more like MS than other EAE models. This form of EAE, induced in marmosets by immunization with MOG, produces lesions that are almost indistinguishable from fresh, acute human MS plaques. In both the human disease and this animal model, a zone of myelin destruction is seen at the margins of lesions; within the lesions, myelin sheaths are replaced by vesiculated membranous elements. MOG-specific antibodies, thought to be related to the deposition of antigen-specific antibody, are present over the vesiculated myelin. In both settings, oligodendrocytes were spared, and there was some evidence of myelin repair. Axonal pathology, however, was more conspicuous in MS cases than in this animal model. It has been suggested that processes mediated by T-cells initiate the demyelinating lesions and that other effector mechanisms are the principal offenders in damaging the myelin sheath. Mechanisms that initiate the lesion might be immunologically distinct from those that propagate disease. Antibodies might play an important role in these processes. The marmoset EAE model has also confirmed the encephalitogenic potential of autoreactive T-cell clones, whose precursors are preformed in the healthy immune repertoire. At the same time, however, these experiments also show that all T-cell clones are not equally autoaggressive. Experimental animal models of MS are based almost exclusively on the use of rodents, mostly rats and mice. Unfortunately, rodent and human immune systems differ to such a large degree that not all observations made in rodent EAE can be directly translated to human MS. An important disadvantage of animal models is that they do not necessarily mirror the cellular or molecular pathology of MS. Some types of EAE, for example, produce brisk demyelination, whereas others produce little demyelination. Which is the best model? Since these features of MS are not yet fully understood, it is dificult to know how faithfully any given animal model of MS illustrates the human disease. In addition, these models are not very tractable for studies on the electrophysiology and biophysics of neuronal function, a serious limitation in a disease such as MS in which symptoms and signs arise from impaired nerve function. Powerful research methods are now available for studying the physiology and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. biophysics of normal or injured nerve cells. These methods permit neuroscientists to study electrical signaling in both normal and injured neurons, but they require that these nerve cells, with reproducible abnormalities, be reproducibly located, within fractions of a millimeter, in specific parts of the nervous system so that they can be studied. In MS and in most currently available animal models, the pathology is patchy, and the location of demyelinated and injured neurons varies from case to case. For the electrophysiologist who studies neuronal signaling by precisely placing tiny microelectrodes within neurons, studying the physiology of demyelinated or otherwise injured neurons when their location varies from animal to animal is, indeed, a challenge. A model in which focal demyelination, or axonal injury, can be produced at specific locations that are consistent from animal to animal would be a great improvement. Viruses can cause demyelination in several ways, the most straightforward of which is for viruses to lyse, or break open, oligodendrocytes, the myelinproducing cells. In some cases, however, the immune system is also involved. The mechanism by which virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination is carried out is not clear, but roles for molecular mimicry, bystander damage, and superantigen activation of T cells have all been proposed (see ). The best developed models of virus-induced demyelination are those caused by certain strains of TMEV and the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (reviewed in Kastrukoff et al.). Probably the most fruitful of the remaining models are those of semliki forest virus (SFV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (). The advantages of SFV are its small, simple genome and ease of mutagenesis. Although the HSV genome is large and complex, the wealth of molecular information related to this virus and the ability to manipulate the viral genome make it an attractive model system, as well. The DA strain of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that as in MS, the immune system fosters demyelination. The inflammatory, demyelinating, and multifocal lesions of TMEV infection are mediated at least in part by T cells directed against viral antigens. The inflammatory response directly contributes to tissue damage in this MS-like model, since susceptibility is determined in part by immune response genes and immunosuppression abrogates demyelination. One to two weeks after inoculation with the DA virus, there is a brisk inflammatory response in the brain with high levels of virus. This is generally a subclinical process since the mouse usually appears normal. After three weeks, the brain pathology virtually disappears, but mice develop a progressive spastic para- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Animal Viruses That Induce Demyelination The TO subgroup strains of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that the immune system fosters the white matter disease. The many different strains of MHV lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis, as well respiratory CNS disorders. The presence and extent of demyelination depend on the viral genotype, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as the strain, age, and immune status of the infected mouse. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. Experimental infection of mice and rats with specific strains of SFV leads to demyelination; other strains induce an encephalomyelitis. Demyelination depends on the specific strain of virus, the mouse strain, and the immune status of the host. Virus persists in the central nervous system. The role of the immune system in the demyelinating disease remains unclear. Many strains of HSV produce a diffuse encephalitis in mice, but certain virus strains induce an inflammatory demyelinating disease in particular strains. Other strains of mice have multifocal demyelination that can relapse or persist in varied areas of the brain. The role of the immune system in this model is unclear but appears to contribute to the destruction of CNS tissue. Maedi visna is found only in sheep. There is no experimental rodent model of maedi visna infection, and therefore one needs to investigate sheep. The absence of markers for the sheep's immune system and of genetically modified sheep with knockouts of different arms of the immune system are clear limitations of the maedi visna model. The pathology of disease varies from an encephalomyelitis to a pure inflammatory demyelination that resembles MS.37 Virus persists during the disease with a restricted expression in microglial cells. It remains unclear whether demyelination is a result of direct viral lysis or is mediated by the immune response. CDV produces a variety of CNS diseases in dogs, including acute and chronic encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Virus persists in the chronic disease and appears to be present in oligodendrocytes in some cases. Work with this model has been limited since dogs are required as the host. The pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease remains unclear. paresis associated with an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord. Although the titers of DA virus decrease over the first few weeks, virus persists in the central nervous system for the life of the mouse. The persistent virus is said to have a restricted, or incomplete, expression. In other words, viral genome is present, but the levels of infectious virus are low, with relatively little viral capsid ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. protein produced. (The capsid is the protein shell surrounding the viral DNA or RNA and is generally required for viral infectivity.) Advantages of the TMEV model include the simplicity of its genome, the detailed structural information about the virus, the ease with which it can be genetically manipulated, and finally, the extensive knowledge about the genes and immune system of mice, the natural host of TMEV (see .). Despite all that is known about TMEV and despite the ease in manipulating this simple virus, the pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease is not yet fully understood. It is clear that viral persistence in the oligodendrocytes and microglia is critical to the development of TMEV-induced demyelination; that is, an ongoing virus infection is always associated with the white matter disease. It is also clear that the immune system contributes to the late demyelinating disease, but exactly how remains poorly understood. Part of the difficulty in dissecting the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of TMEV (as well as some of the other animal models of virus-induced demyelination) is that it changes over time. Early after infection, the immune system controls the virus infection, but later in Advantages of the TMEV Model of Virus-Induced Demyelination The following features of TMEV make it an attractive model for studies of virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination: with only four structural proteins in the infectious particle. The genome is only approximately 8,100 nucleotides in length. Three strains are completely sequenced. The crystallographic structure of three strains of the virus has been solved, so that the location of every amino acid in the infectious particle is known. The B-cell epitopes that are the targets for neutralizing antibody have been identified and located on the infectious particle. Some of the epitopes on the virus that trigger proliferation of immune CD4+ T cells and some that act as targets for an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response are also known. Some components of the receptor for the virus have been identified. Infectious clones of the virus are available so mutations can be quickly engineered into any region of the genome. There is extensive knowledge about mouse genetics and immunology. The mouse, which is the natural and experimental host of TMEV, provides a special benefit in studies of the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease because so much is known about mouse genetics and the immune system. In addition, many genetically engineered mice are available, including those in which specific genes for different components of the immune system have been “knocked out.” ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. the disease, it contributes to the demyelination. In addition, during the disease there appears to be a critical “balance” of the immune response that is necessary for the induction of demyelination: an inadequate immune response early in the disease can lead to the death of the mouse within the first couple of weeks and before the appearance of demyelination, while a very forceful immune response early can lead to clearance of the virus so that no virus persists and white matter disease fails to develop. In other words, viral persistence and demyelination occur only in association with a certain level of the antiviral immune response. CD4+, as well as CD8+, T cells might be mediators of the late demyelinating disease. DA virus infection induces demyelination in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell knockout mice, suggesting that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediate the late demyelinating disease. The targets for these immunopathogenic CD4+ and the CD8+ T cells are unknown. There is some evidence for epitope spreading, in which an increasing number of myelin antigenic epitopes become the target for a CD4+ T-cell response. However, epitope spreading appears to begin after demyelination has become established, so it is unclear how important this mechanism of immunopathology is to DA-induced demyelination, especially early in the white matter disease. Mouse strains that are resistant to DA-induced demyelinating disease mount an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response and clear the virus. Mouse strains that are susceptible to the late disease do not mount this response, presumably allowing for virus persistence. L*, a small protein synthesized by demyelinating strains of TMEV via alternative translation, is critical for TMEV persistence and demyelination. L* inhibits the antivirus cytolytic T-cell response in susceptible mouse strains through an, as yet, unknown mechanism. Certain cells, for example, oligodendrocytes, may have cell-specific RNA-binding proteins that bind to the viral genome (as well as some nonviral messenger RNAs) and regulate whether L* or the viral capsid proteins are synthesized. The more L* that is synthesized, the more the expression of the virus is restricted. TMEV induces apoptosis in certain cells, including neurons and macrophages. The relationship between apoptosis and DA-induced demyelination remains an open question. There are many different strains of mouse hepatitis virus that lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis as well as respiratory and CNS disorders. JHM, S, and A59 strains of MHV induce demyelination. The extent of demyelination depends on the virus, including its geno-type, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as on the condition of the infected mouse, including its strain, age, and immune status. Intracerebral inoculation of the JHM strain into weanling mice leads to demyelination in the mice that survive encephalitis. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. At present, there are some notable limitations to MHV pathogenesis studies. MHV has a remarkably large viral genome (32 kb), making this a complex ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. pathogen. A system for efficient and rapid mutagenesis has not yet been perfected, and therefore manipulation of the viral genome is not straightforward. Investigators initially thought that demyelination occurred as a result of viral lysis of oligodendrocytes independently of the immune system. More recent studies, however, suggested that it does contribute to the demyelination (reviewed in 1996 by Houtman et al.). For example, investigators found that C57BL/6 mice that are immunosuppressed by gamma irradiation before being exposed to the JHM virus develop less severe demyelination. Adoptive transfer of JHM virus-infected splenic T cells to the infected irradiated mice leads to the development of significant demyelination. Other studies in rats showed that transfer of T cells from rats that have JHM virus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis leads to the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-like lesions. Studies in CD4+ and CD8+ knockout mice demonstrated that both T-cell types are needed for clearance of the virus; however, CD4+ T cells contribute to central nervous system inflammation and demyelination. A suggestion of the latter study was that the CD4+ T cells influenced the expression of cytokines, specifically the RANTES cytokine, and led to macrophage entry into the CNS; treatment of the infected mice with anti-RANTES antibody resulted in a decrease in macrophage infiltration and demyelination. These studies and conclusions require confirmation. The committee notes that the following animal models of virus-induced demyelinating disease are particularly likely to yield clues to the pathogenesis of MS: The HAM/TSP syndrome resembles MS. Because the principles relevant to this human disease might be similar to those in MS, investigating the pathogenesis of this disease could reveal insights into MS pathogenesis. The development of a widely available animal model for HAM/TSP is a high priority. PIE is of special interest since recurrences following this acute inflammatory white matter disease are so similar to MS attacks that the two diseases are indistinguishable, indicating a close relationship between PIE and MS. The availability of transgenic mice that carry a receptor for measles virus might provide an experimental model for the study of PIE. The pathological lesions of TMEV are similar to MS plaques; therefore, continuing delineation of the mechanism by which the immune system contributes to the virus-induced demyelination might lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Research on the MHV-induced demyelination model is presently limited by difficulties with site-directed mutagenesis methods. A high priority for research with this virus should be the generation of an infectious MHV cDNA clone and a refinement of mutagenesis techniques. Molecular genetic manipulation has become one of the most important tools for evaluating gene function in living organisms. These tools of molecular biology have extended the reach of researchers to a new level of understanding of neurodegeneration mechanisms. The development of animal models for neurodegenerative disorders by means of genetic engineering has revolutionized experimental neurology. The identification and cloning of genes involved in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotropic lateral sclerosis provided the keys to develop mice that overexpress the human genes involved in these diseases (reviewed in 1999 by Brusa). The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is genetically susceptible to diabetes, and transgenic NOD mice have been developed to allow examination of the role of possible autoantigens in the development of diabetes, which like MS involves an inflammatory autoimmune pathology. The NOD mouse has also identified candidate molecules and processes that have influenced research in EAE and MS. Mutant mice have provided insights into all aspects of biology for generations, but only in the last two decades has it been possible to modify the expression of selected genes, an essential breakthrough for analyzing the role of specific genes in complex processes and diseases such as MS. In addition, identification of the genes that are activated or inactivated in both pathological and repair processes in the CNS will likely reveal new and unexpected targets for uniquely selective disease-modifying therapies in MS. “Reverse genetics” and “forward genetics” offer contrasting approaches to the analysis of gene function. Forward genetics is an approach to identify genes that are not already implicated in a particular disease or process. Reverse genetics is an approach to identify the role of genes whose involvement in the disease or process being studied is already implicated. In forward genetics, large numbers of mice are mutagenized (using techniques that mutagenize genes at random); their resulting phenotypes are analyzed to select mutants that exhibit spontaneous MS. The mutated genes in the selected mutants are then positionally cloned and identified. The homologous human clones can also be identified, a task that is becoming vastly simpler as the human genome project nears completion. The advantage of this approach is that the screen is not biased in any way and can reveal genes beyond those already known to be involved in MS. Another advantage of forward genetics is that once a gene is identified in a disease process, one can quickly do a screen for suppressors and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. enhancers of the phenotype. This will yield the entire biochemical pathway (as opposed to just one step) involved in disease pathogenesis. One limitation to the forward genetics approach is that only a small percentage of the mutated genes will result in a phenotype relevant to MS. Consequently, large numbers of mutants have to be screened, which is generally expensive, time-consuming, and labor intensive. Yet the rewards—especially for complex diseases and processes that have resisted traditional approaches—are unparalleled. In reverse genetics, mutant strains of mice that either overexpress or lack specific genes are generated through a variety of techniques. The classic approach to creating transgenic mice is to inject a foreign gene (“transgene”) into a fertilized egg, thereby inducing overexpression of the transgene. The egg bearing the transgene is implanted into a host mother. Progeny bearing DNA encoding the transgene are screened, as are the corresponding levels of RNA and protein. This transgene is randomly incorporated into a mouse chromosome and ultimately leads to production of the protein of interest. This approach has been used to transfer human genes (such as those for T-cell receptor, HLA DR2, and CD4) into mice to see if they develop spontaneous MS. One limitation of “knockin” mice is that genes can be inserted in uneven copy numbers in “replicate” animals or might be integrated into disparate sites in the genome. Gene expression can also be altered through knockout experiments. Knockout mice, or null mutants, are created using embryonic stem cells and homologous recombination to produce a cell line in which a certain gene has been removed, or ablated. When transferred into an early mouse embryo, these cells can participate in the generation of all cell lineages including germ cells, thereby transmitting their genotype to the next generation. Alternatively, embryonic stem cells can be used to create so-called knock-in mice by inserting a gene into a particular locus. The transgenic gene-targeting approaches described above all rely on irreversible changes to the genome that are present from the onset of development throughout an animal's life. The function of the gene must be deduced from the phenotype of animals that have been deficient for the product of the disrupted gene throughout development. Yet, many genes play different roles at different stages of development and in different tissues. This presents serious drawbacks (reviewed in 1998 by Gingrich and Roder and in 1999 by Muller). First, an animal with a gene alteration that lethally disrupts development obviously cannot be studied as an adult—even though the gene might play another critical role, for example, in neural repair. This is particularly relevant to MS because many of the genes that regulate embryonic neural development also regulate neural repair in adults. Another limitation of transgenic models is that changes in the regulation of other genes could yield misleading phenotypes, in part because of differences between effects of the gene at different developmental stages, gene redundancy (other genes might also play the role of the missing gene), or adaptive mecha- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nisms that compensate for the missing gene. Even apparently unaltered phenotypes would thus not prove that the gene was not involved in the disease or process being studied. Another limitation of this approach is that in physiological responses, gene products tend to be produced in waves, whereas in transgenics, expression is usually “on” from the time of development. Alternative approaches in which one gene, or parts of it, can be inactivated or activated in specific tissues or at specific times (“conditional” and “inducible” mutants) have recently been developed in this rapidly expanding array of genealtering techniques (reviewed in Brusa, 1999; Gingrich and Roder, 1998; and van der Neut, 1997). This second generation of transgenic technology derives from the possibility of modulating the suppression of a transgene with external stimuli, by using a “biological switch” that can turn the foreign gene on and off. Gene expression patterns in the nervous system are highly regionalized. For example, the enzymes involved in producing neurotransmitters and their receptors differ from one subpopulation of neurons to another. Other proteins are more widespread, such as the intermediate filament proteins NF (neurofilament) or GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), or are ubiquitous, such as N-CAMs (neural cell adhesion molecules) and integrins. Thus, it would be particularly advantageous to develop tissue-specific mutants for MS research. The development of inducible systems will become an important tool in the many diverse aspects of research on the disease mechanisms and possibilities for repair in MS, including the potential administration of gene therapy. Transgenic overexpression of cytokines or gene targets of cytokines in the CNS offers a relatively non-intrusive mechanism to assess the role of individual cytokines in CNS development, function, and response to insult. A common technique for assessing the effects of a particular cytokine in EAE is to induce its expression directly in the CNS. This allows researchers to ask whether expression of the cytokine induces CNS pathology similar to that seen in MS. Directed expression of transgenes in the CNS relies on promoters that normally control the expression of CNS-specific genes. This includes the GFAP gene promoter, which drives expression in astrocytes, as well as the neurofilament promoter (neurons), and the myelin basic protein promoter (oligodendrocytes). To date, no one has isolated a microglial-specific promoter. Only MBP promoters have been used to overexpress gamma-interferon in the CNS. Phenotypes of transgenic mice range from a lethal, “jimpy”-like hypomyelinating mouse, through progressive demyelinating disease, to mice with no outward phenotype that nevertheless showed progression from EAE to a *A point mutation in the gene coding for myelin proteolipid protein causes male offspring of jimpy mice to have little or no myelination. Affected mice develop severe tremors and die prematurely at approximately 30 days. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. chronic demyelinating disease in contrast to control mice that recovered from EAE-induced demyelination. It is of interest that the same laboratory observed both extremes using the same constructs. This might be because the transgenes were unevenly integrated at different loci, since levels of expression did not obviously correlate with phenotype in one case. Asymptomatic transgenic mice did, however, show enhanced glial responses to CNS injury, and exacerbated ischemic infarction (Lambertsen et al., unpublished). These asymptomatic mice presumably reflect sub-threshold levels of cytokine. Nevertheless, crossing an asymptomatic MBP promoter-driven gamma-interferon transgenic mouse with MBP or MHC class I mice produced a more extreme jimpy phenotype. This might provide a clue to cytotoxic effects of beta-interferon-Î³ on oligodendrocytes, being perhaps dependent on local interferon-Î³ titers becoming sufficiently high to stimulate MHC I induction. It is not known whether similar mechanisms account for oligodendrocyte pathology in TNF-Î± and interferon-Î± transgenic mice. The IL-3 and IL-12 transgenic mice provide a useful counterpart, there being no obvious suggestion of a direct effect on oligodendrocytes., These mice illustrate the potential for direct macrophage and microglial attack on oligodendrocytes, which might occur in TNF-Î± transgenic mice. It is not clear from any of these experiments whether activation of immune cells took place within the CNS or following cytokine exit to the periphery. A systemic effect must account for the fact that overexpression of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 protected animals from EAE in two separate preparations. The fact that IL-4 transgenic mice did not show similar resistance might reflect insufficient expression within the CNS or strain background differences, given that IL-4 knockout exacerbated disease in another study. Most recently, a transgenic mouse has been “constructed” that expresses T-cell receptor genes from a human MBP-specific T-cell clone, along with relevant human MHC class II determinants and MBP. Under certain conditions, this “humanized” mouse developed spontaneous EAE that indeed showed inflammation with some demyelination. In recent years, there have been many advances in the use of transgenes (including gene knockouts), as well as even more sophisticated models that make use of tissue-specific and time-dependent regulators. These models should facilitate the development of rational therapies and the transfer of knowledge from animal models to the prevention and treatment of human disease. However, although temporally regulated targeting controlled by the administration of an environmental inducer has become feasible with high efficiency for some organs, it remains to be further improved for other tissues, particularly the brain. New generations of inducible promoters will more faithfully mimic the in vivo kinetics and dynamics of cytokine production. Knock-in mice, in which ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling disease of the nervous system, affecting about 1 million people worldwide. Even though it has been known for over a hundred years, no cause or cure has yet been discovered—but now there is hope. New therapies have been shown to slow the disease progress in some patients, and the pace of discoveries about the cellular machinery of the brain and spinal cord has accelerated. This book presents a comprehensive overview of multiple sclerosis today, as researchers seek to understand its processes, develop therapies that will slow or halt the disease and perhaps repair damage, offer relief for specific symptoms, and improve the abilities of MS patients to function in their daily lives. The panel reviews existing knowledge and identifies key research questions, focusing on: Research strategies that have the greatest potential to understand the biological mechanisms of recovery and to translate findings into specific strategies for therapy. How people adapt to MS and the research needed to improve the lives of people with MS. Management of disease symptoms (cognitive impairment, depression, spasticity, vision problems, and others). The committee also discusses ways to build and financially support the MS research enterprise, including a look at challenges inherent in designing clinical trials. This book will be important to MS researchers, research funders, health care advocates for MS research and treatment, and interested patients and their families. 3 Characteristics and Management of Major Symptoms 5 Strategies for Future Research on Disease Mechanisms 7 Building and Supporting the Research Enterprise Appendix D: Kurtze's Expanded Disability Status Scale Appendix F: U.S. Social Security Administration's Criteria for Qualifying as Disabled from MS Appendix G: Treatments That Have Been Claimed to Be of Benefit in MS You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

d194e8df-120f-43fa-aaf0-589d65a9dcf9,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that damages nerve cells in your central nervous system (CNS). Your CNS is composed of your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. causes symptoms that gradually get worse, as well as symptoms that come on suddenly after a period of being controlled. This sudden appearance of symptoms is called a . There’s for MS, and the damage it causes can’t be reversed. However, certain medications can help you manage the condition. Condition management focuses on medication that can treat relapses, as well as modify the disease to reduce damage and disability. It also involves other drugs that treat the symptoms or complications of MS. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following drugs for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS): cladribine (Mavenclad), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), diroximel fumarate (Vumerity), fingolimod (Gilenya), monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam), ozanimod (Zeposia), siponimod (Mayzent), teriflunomide (Aubagio) interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron, Extavia), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa), peginterferon beta-1a (Plegridy) alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), mitoxantrone hydrochloride, natalizumab (Tysabri), ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) There are several types of that work to help change the course of MS. The length of treatment with these medications can range from a few months to years, depending on how effective the medications are for you. Your may recommend switching between these drugs throughout the course of your treatment. This will depend on how effectively each drug manages your disease and how you tolerate the side effects. If you switch to a different DMT, your doctor will take note of whether you develop new . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 12 MS medications that are administered by injection or infusion. They help modify relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. They also treat clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a one-off episode of neurological symptoms. CIS can progress to MS and is sometimes categorized as a type of MS. These drugs are made up of proteins that keep certain from entering your brain and spinal cord. These WBCs are thought to that forms a protective coating over your nerve fibers. Therefore, preventing these WBCs from moving into your brain and spinal cord can help slow their damage and reduce the number of relapses you have. You inject these drugs yourself. Your healthcare provider will show you how to do this. The number of injections depends on the drug: Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is a manufactured substance that resembles a basic protein of natural myelin. It’s thought to work by prompting the WBCs to attack the substance instead of the myelin cells. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. You inject this drug yourself once per day or three times per week, depending on your dosage. Your healthcare provider will show you how. People who receive injections three times per week should ensure that at least 48 hours elapses between their injections. The FDA has also approved Glatopa, a generic form of Copaxone. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is an antibody that may block damaged T lymphocytes from moving into your brain and spinal cord. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The infusion takes about an hour, and you’ll get it every 4 weeks. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride was originally used to treat cancer. Now it’s also prescribed to treat people with MS. It suppresses the immune system cells that are thought to attack myelin cells. This medication is only available as a generic drug. It’s used to treat SPMS or worsening RRMS in instances where other drugs haven’t worked. It has a high risk of serious side effects, so it’s only appropriate for people with these more severe forms of MS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as a short IV infusion once every 3 months. The infusion should only take 5 to 15 minutes. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) is approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least two other MS medications but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It works by reducing the number of specific B and T lymphocytes in your body. This action may decrease the inflammation of and damage to nerve cells. Alemtuzumab is given as a 4-hour IV infusion. To start, you receive this drug once per day for 5 days. Then 12 months after your first treatment course, you receive it once per day for 3 more days. Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the newest infusion treatment for MS. It was approved by the FDA in 2017. It’s the first drug used to treat primary progressive MS (PPMS). It’s also used to treat CIS and relapsing forms of MS. Ocrelizumab appears to work by targeting and ultimately reducing the number of B lymphocytes. B lymphocytes are responsible for damage and repair of the myelin sheath. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion. To begin, you’ll receive it in two 300-milligram (mg) infusions, separated by 2 weeks. After that, you’ll receive it in 600-mg infusions every 6 months. You’ll also receive a corticosteroid and an on the day of each infusion to reduce the risk of reaction to the medication. Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) was approved by the FDA in August 2020 and is the newest treatment for MS. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), it also works by targeting harmful B lymphocytes and reducing their overall number. Ofatumumab is given as an injection once per week for the first 3 weeks. After a 1-week break, the drug is given as a monthly injection. The FDA has approved eight oral medications for the treatment of MS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) comes as an oral capsule that you take once per day. It was the first oral medication approved by the FDA to treat RRMS. It’s also used to treat CIS and active SPMS. Fingolimod causes the damaging WBCs to remain within your lymph nodes. This reduces the chance that they’ll enter your brain or spinal cord and cause damage. Teriflunomide (Aubagio) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Teriflunomide works by blocking an enzyme that’s needed by the damaging WBCs. As a result, teriflunomide helps decrease the number of these cells, which reduces the damage they can inflict. Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals to reduce the risk of MS relapse. It may also have antioxidant properties that help protect against brain and spinal cord damage. Monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s the newest oral drug on the market, having been approved by the FDA in April 2020. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Monomethyl fumarate is a bioequivalent of dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). Like dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl fumarate may have antioxidant properties and appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Cladribine (Mavenclad) is a pill that you take for a total of 16 or 20 days over the course of 2 years. You’ll have treatment for 2 weeks per year, with each one lasting 4 or 5 days. There’s a 1-month break in between the 2 weeks of treatment. It’s approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least one other MS medication but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It may work by reducing the number of harmful B and T lymphocytes that you have. Siponimod (Mayzent) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking certain inflammatory cells from leaving your lymph nodes. This action limits the amount of nerve damage that they can inflict. Diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Diroximel fumarate has the same active ingredient as dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), and it works the same way. This means that it may also have antioxidant properties and interfere with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Ozanimod (Zeposia) is an oral capsule that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking immune cells from leaving your lymph nodes and entering your CNS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) is currently the only DMT that’s approved by the FDA for use in children. It’s safe for use in people ages 10 years old and up. However, doctors may prescribe other DMTs off label. Off-label drug is when a medication approved by the FDA for one purpose is used for a different purpose that hasn’t been approved. However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs, but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So, your doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care. While many relapses go away on their own, more severe relapses require treatment. Inflammation causes MS relapses, and it’s typically treated with . These drugs can reduce inflammation and help make MS attacks less severe. Corticosteroids used to treat MS include: If corticosteroids don’t work, your doctor may prescribe corticotropin (H.P. Acthar Gel). Corticotropin is an injection, and it’s also known as ACTH gel. It works by prompting the adrenal cortex to secrete the hormones cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone. The secretion of these hormones helps to reduce inflammation. Medications to treat MS symptoms and complications Other drugs can be used to treat specific or from MS-related damage. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is an oral tablet taken twice per day to help improve walking. Dalfampridine works by blocking potassium channels, which form tiny pores in your nerve cells. This action may help damaged nerve cells to better send messages. Improved nerve impulse conduction aids in leg muscle control and strength. A doctor will often give to people with MS who have painful muscle stiffness or muscle spasms. Drugs commonly used to treat these symptoms include: is a common problem for people with MS. For this symptom, your doctor may prescribe a drug such as modafinil (Provigil). They may also prescribe an off-label drug, such as amantadine (Gocovri) and fluoxetine (Prozac). means “bad sensation.” It’s a type of pain that can feel like ongoing burning or itching. It may also feel like wetness, electric shock, or pins and needles. According to a published in Nature Reviews Neurology, some research has shown that people with MS are more likely to be clinically depressed than the general population. Drugs used to treat depression in people with MS include: Constipation is another common complication of MS. Your doctor may recommend with one of the following : Bladder dysfunction is also a common complication of MS. Symptoms may include frequent urination, , or hesitancy in starting urination. You may also experience frequent (nighttime urination). Both men and women with MS tend to have higher rates of sexual dysfunction than the general population, according to an from 2016. that may be prescribed to help treat include: Older drugs that must be injected directly into the penis are also available. These drugs aren’t used as much now that oral drugs are available. They include alprostadil (Caverject). A drug that may be used off label for this purpose is the blood pressure medication papaverine. People with a vagina or clitoris may experience problems such as reduced feeling or . There are no drugs currently available to treat these problems. However, for vaginal dryness, you can use water-soluble personal lubricants available over the counter. Many different types of drugs are available to help you manage MS. The type of drugs that may be best for you depend on the type of MS you have and the symptoms you experience. You may not be able to access all of these medications. Ask your doctor to confirm which drugs are currently on the market in your area and which ones might be most appropriate for you. Speaking with your doctor is especially important if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Work with your doctor to to manage your MS symptoms and help prevent further damage from the disease. Sticking to your treatment plan can help you feel better and slow the progression of your condition. — — MS Treatment Chart: Comparing Disease-Modifying Therapies Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

CALABRESI, M.D., Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland Abstract Abstract Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome). Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue. Five disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These treatments are partially effective in reducing exacerbations and may slow progression of disability. Multiple sclerosis (MS) typically presents in adults who are 20 to 45 years of age. Occasionally, the disease presents in childhood or late middle age. Twice as many women are affected as men, and persons of Northern European descent appear to be at highest risk for the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed or repeated three months after a clinically suspicious episode to facilitate early diagnosis of MS. Corticosteroid therapy should be used to shorten the duration of MS relapses and accelerate recovery. Disease-modifying treatment should be started early in the course of MS to minimize irreversible axonal damage. Glatiramer and the beta interferons have different mechanisms of action. Patients with MS who have an unsatisfactory response to beta interferons should be considered for glatiramer therapy. Patients with worsening forms of MS may be referred for mitoxantrone therapy; however, this agent has acute short-term adverse effects, as well as serious long-term adverse effects that include cardiotoxicity. A = consistent, good quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or limited quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, opinion, or case series.

Common presenting symptoms include monocular visual impairment with pain (optic neuritis), paresthesias, weakness, and impaired coordination . Frequent accompanying signs and symptoms include bladder urgency or retention, constipation, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression, diplopia, gait and limb ataxia, and Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion). Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements MS frequently is overlooked because initial symptoms resolve spontaneously in most patients. Relapses occur within months or years. In some patients, however, MS has a primary progressive course from onset. Abstract The diagnosis of MS is based on the presence of central nervous system (CNS) lesions that are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the CNS at least three months apart), with no better explanation for the disease process. Because no single test is totally reliable in identifying MS, and a variety of conditions can mimic the disease , diagnosis depends on clinical features supplemented by the findings of certain studies. CNS infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I) CNS inflammatory condition (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome) CNS microvascular disease (e.g., disease caused by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, CADASIL) Genetic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy, hereditary myelopathy, mitochondrial disease) Structural or compressive condition of the brain and spinal cord (e.g., cervical spondylosis, tumor, herniated disc, Chiari’s malformation) Vitamin B deficiency CNS = central nervous system; CADASIL = cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be highly sensitive in detecting clinically silent MS plaques. Consequently, findings of this imaging modality are included in diagnostic criteria that have been proposed by one set of investigators.  The major advantage of the proposed criteria is that an early diagnosis of MS can be made if an MRI scan performed three months after a clinically isolated attack demonstrates formation of a new lesion. The proposed diagnostic criteria also define MRI lesion characteristics that increase the likelihood of MS, including number of lesions (nine or more), location of lesions (position abutting the ventricles; juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal position), and lesion enhancement with the use of contrast medium .

A brain MRI scan is the most useful test for confirming the diagnosis of MS. MS lesions appear as areas of high signal, predominantly in the cerebral white matter or spinal cord, on T-weighted images . MRI scanning is useful for detecting structural pathology in regions that can be difficult to image by computed tomography, such as the posterior fossa, craniocervical junction, and cervical cord. A brain MRI scan performed with a high-field magnet (1.5 tesla or greater) is abnormal in almost all patients who have clinically definite MS.

This image shows multiple high-signal periventricular and white-matter lesions.

Sagittal images using the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) protocol reveal multiple high-signal lesions within the spinal cord, consistent with demyelination. These lesions, which also can be seen on the transverse cuts, often are situated dorsolaterally, and are usually less than one vertebral body in length. The lesions rarely cause cord swelling. MRI scans of the spinal cord in a patient with MS. Sagittal images using the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) protocol reveal multiple high-signal lesions within the spinal cord, consistent with demyelination. These lesions, which also can be seen on the transverse cuts, often are situated dorsolaterally, and are usually less than one vertebral body in length. The lesions rarely cause cord swelling. Evoked potentials (visual, brainstem auditory, and somatosensory) may be useful in demonstrating the presence of subclinical lesions in sensory pathways or in providing objective evidence of lesions suspected on the basis of subjective complaints. Of the sensory evoked potential tests, the visual evoked potential is the most useful because it can provide objective evidence of an optic nerve lesion that may not be evident on an MRI scan. In approximately 90 percent of patients with definite MS, the CSF IgG concentration is increased relative to other CSF proteins (e.g., albumin), and CSF gel electrophoresis reveals oligoclonal bands that are not present in a matched serum sample. However, an increased CSF IgG index and the presence of oligoclonal bands are not specific for MS and therefore are not diagnostic of the disease. CSF analysis probably is most useful for ruling out infectious or neoplastic conditions that mimic MS. Peripheral blood tests may be helpful in excluding other disease processes. Testing frequently includes determination of the vitamin B level, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and anti-nuclear antibody titers, as well as a test for Lyme disease, and a test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin test). In unusual cases, a more extensive evaluation may include tests for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, Sjögren’s syndrome A and B, angiotensin-converting enzyme, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I, and very long chain fatty acids (for adrenoleukodystrophy). Rarely, human immunodeficiency virus infection and opportunistic infections can mimic MS. Certain clinical or laboratory red flags should alert physicians to a possible diagnostic error. These flags include symptoms that could be explained by localized disease; the presence of steadily progressive disease; the absence of clinical remission; the absence of oculomotor, optic nerve, sensory, or bladder involvement; and normal CSF findings. However, none of these findings excludes the diagnosis of MS. Abstract Mild spasticity may be managed by stretching and exercise programs such as water therapy, yoga, and physical therapy. Medication is indicated when stiffness, spasms, or clonus interferes with function or sleep. Baclofen (Lioresal), tizanidine (Zanaflex), gabapentin (Neurontin), and benzodiazepines are effective antispastic agents . Intrathecal baclofen therapy has a major impact on medically intractable spasticity and has largely supplanted chemical rhizotomy or myelotomy. Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations In most instances, dystonic spasms respond well to carbamazepine (Tegretol) can be treated effectively with anticonvulsants or amitriptyline (Elavil). In patients with new bladder symptoms, urinalysis and culture should be performed to rule out infection, with appropriate treatment provided if needed. The first step in medical management of the neurogenic bladder is to determine whether the problem is a failure to empty urine or a failure to store urine. The history may or may not be helpful. A postvoid residual urinary volume is the best means of determining urinary retention. The anticholinergic drugs oxybutynin (Ditropan) and tolterodine (Detrol) are effective for symptoms of failure to store urine (in the absence of infection or overflow incontinence). Drug treatment of urinary retention usually is ineffective, although some patients benefit from attempts to decrease bladder neck tone using an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist such as terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), or tamsulosin (Flomax). Bethanechol (Urecholine) may be helpful in patients with a flaccid bladder. Definitive treatment of urinary retention involves teaching the patient to perform intermittent self-catheterization, if possible. In some patients, inhaled desmopressin (DDAVP) can be used to suppress nocturnal urinary production. Constipation is common in patients with MS. It should be managed aggressively to avoid long-term complications. Fecal incontinence is rare; when it occurs, the addition of fiber can provide enough bulk to the stool to allow a partially incompetent sphincter to hold in the bowel movement long enough for the patient to reach a bathroom. Short-term use of anticholinergics or antidiarrheal agents may be effective in combating incontinence associated with diarrhea. A careful sexual history may reveal problems such as feelings of sexual inadequacy, impaired libido, or direct sexual dysfunction resulting from erectile dysfunction, impaired lubrication, spasticity, or heat-related sensory dysesthesias. Counseling, a review of the sexual side effects of medications, and medical therapy may be appropriate. In some patients with MS, erectile dysfunction can be managed effectively with sildenafil (Viagra). Depression occurs in more than one half of patients with MS. Patients with mild, transient depression can be cared for with supportive measures. Those with more severe depression should be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are less sedating than other antidepressants. Bedtime administration of amitriptyline can be useful in depressed patients who also are having difficulty sleeping or have headaches or other pain syndromes. This symptom often responds to rest or medication. Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily, may be effective. Modafinil (Provigil), a narcolepsy drug that acts as a CNS stimulant, has been found to be effective in patients with MS; the drug is given in a dosage of 200 mg once daily in the morning. Occasionally, SSRIs can relieve fatigue in patients with MS. Amantadine has the added advantage of having anti–influenza-A properties and may be given from October to March. In a patient with an apparent relapse of MS, it is important to rule out a treatable infection such as sinusitis, bronchitis, or urinary tract infection. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of symptomatic relief for an acute relapse of MS. These agents work through immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, restoration of the blood-brain barrier, and reduction of edema. They also may improve axonal conduction. Corticosteroid therapy shortens the duration of acute relapses and accelerates recovery. However, corticosteroids have not been shown to improve the overall degree of recovery or to alter the long-term course of MS. If a patient is having acute disability from an attack, the physician should consider treatment with a three- to five-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (or equivalent corticosteroid) in a dosage of 1 g administered intravenously in 100 mL of normal saline over 60 minutes once daily in the morning. In patients with MS, physical therapy always should be considered because it improves function and quality of life independent of drug therapy. Supportive care in the form of counseling, occupational therapy, advice from social workers, input from nurses, and participation in patient support groups are all part of a united health care team approach to the management of MS. Some patients require temporary disability status. Patients with MS often are tempted to try alternative therapies such as special diets, vitamins, bee stings, a compound “off-label” transdermal medication (i.e., Prokarin), or acupuncture. Although definitive proof of the effectiveness of these treatments in MS is lacking, patients sometimes use them in a complementary fashion. Sole reliance on alternative therapies should be discouraged because patients then may be deprived of therapies that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of MS. Four disease-modifying therapies for the initial management of MS are available in the United States: intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex), subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). A fifth agent, mitoxantrone (Novantrone), has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of worsening forms of relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS .

Montvale, N.J.: Medical Economics Data, 2004. Cost to the patient will be higher, depending on prescription filling fee. The beta interferons are naturally occurring cytokines with a variety of immunomodulating and antiviral activities that may account for their therapeutic effects. The three FDA-approved beta interferons that are used for MS have been shown to reduce relapses by about one third and are recommended as first-line therapy or for use in glatiramer-intolerant patients who have relapsing-remitting MS. In randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials, use of beta interferons resulted in a 50 to 80 percent reduction in inflammatory lesions visualized on brain MRI scans. There also is evidence that these drugs improve quality of life and cognitive function. The major difference in the beta interferon drugs is that intramuscular interferon beta-1a is given once a week and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b are given three times a week, or every other day, respectively. The adequacy of weekly dosing has been questioned. There appears to be a modest dose-response effect with the beta interferons. One study of double-dose (60-mcg) intramuscular interferon beta-1a administered once a week found no benefit over the single-dose regimen. Whether the benefit of more frequent dosing is sustained remains unclear. An increased incidence of neutralizing antibodies with the more frequent subcutaneous dosing also must be considered. Influenza-like symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, muscle aches, and fatigue, occur in approximately 60 percent of patients treated with interferon beta-1a or interferon beta-1b. These symptoms usually dissipate with continued therapy and premedication with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Dose titration at the initiation of beta interferon therapy also is a useful strategy. Other side effects of the beta interferons include injection-site reactions, worsening of pre-existing spasticity, depression, mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminase levels. These side effects usually are not severe and rarely lead to discontinuation of treatment. Treatment with any beta interferon can result in the development of neutralizing antibodies. Although study results are variable, once-weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy has been reported to have the lowest incidence of neutralizing antibody development. The effect of neutralizing antibodies on the long-term efficacy of beta interferon therapy remains to be fully defined because titers and durations of antibody positivity (some neutralizing antibodies resolve with time) are variable. This drug is a polypeptide mixture that was originally designed to mimic and compete with myelin basic protein. Its mechanism of action is distinct from that of the beta interferons; therefore, patients may respond differently to the drug. Glatiramer in a dosage of 20 mg administered subcutaneously once daily has been shown to reduce the frequency of MS relapses by approximately one third. The drug also is recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and in the treatment of patients who cannot tolerate beta interferon therapy. Glatiramer therapy results in a one-third reduction in the inflammatory activity seen on MRI scans. Glatiramer generally is well tolerated and is not associated with influenza-like symptoms. Immediate postinjection reactions include local inflammation and an uncommon idiosyncratic reaction consisting of flushing, chest tightness with palpitations, anxiety, or dyspnea, which resolves spontaneously without sequelae. Routine laboratory monitoring is not considered necessary in patients treated with glatiramer, and the development of binding antibodies does not interfere with therapeutic efficacy. A phase-III, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial found that mitoxantrone, an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent, reduced the number of treated MS relapses by 67 percent and slowed progression on the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Ambulation Index, and MRI measures of disease activity. Mitoxantrone is recommended for use in patients with worsening forms of MS. Acute side effects of mitoxantrone include nausea and alopecia. Because of cumulative cardiotoxicity, the drug can be used for only two to three years (or for a cumulative dose of 120 to 140 mg per m). There also is some concern about treatment-related leukemia. Mitoxantrone is a chemotherapeutic agent that should be prescribed and administered only by experienced health care professionals. Natalizumab (Antegren) is in the final stages of phase-III clinical trails and is under accelerated review by the FDA. In a phase-II clinical trial, this drug appeared promising in that it reduced active MRI lesions by 90 percent and decreased MS relapses by more than 50 percent. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is directed against an adhesion molecule called VLA-4. The drug is administered intravenously once a month. Despite lack of FDA approval and definitive evidence of efficacy, several other drugs commonly are used in patients with MS. A number of small clinical trials support the modest effect of intravenous IgG, azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide, either alone or in combination with standard therapy. Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates that the best time to initiate disease-modifying treatment is early in the course of MS. Data indicate that irreversible axonal damage may occur early in relapsing-remitting MS, and that drug therapies appear to be more effective in preventing new lesion formation than in repairing old lesions. With disease progression, the autoimmune response of the disease may become more difficult to suppress. Both intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a therapy have been shown to reduce the cumulative probability of the development of clinically definite MS in patients who present with a first clinical demyelinating episode and have two or more brain lesions on an MRI scan. Based on these data, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society supports the initiation of immunomodulating therapy at the time of diagnosis. The physician must weigh evidence and recommendations against the practical concerns of young patients for whom the prospect of starting therapy that requires self-injection may be frightening and burdensome. Furthermore, few long-term data (more than 10 years) are available on the safety and sustained efficacy of disease-modifying drugs. A patient may opt to defer therapy, hoping to be among the minority of persons with benign MS; however, certain MRI and clinical features should prompt the physician and patient to reconsider this approach. An MRI scan with contrast-enhancing lesions, a large burden of white matter disease, or any T low-signal lesions (black holes) suggests a relatively poor prognosis. It may be useful to repeat brain MRI scanning in six months or one year to determine how quickly the disease process is evolving. The presence of spinal cord lesions or atrophy also suggests a poor prognosis. Clinical features may be less useful for assessing prognosis. Once definite disability develops, it may be too late to treat that component of the disease. The ability to diagnose and treat MS has improved considerably in the past 10 years because of the availability of MRI and partially effective immunomodulating therapies. The limited efficacy of immunomodulating drugs in the later, noninflammatory stages of MS highlights the importance of developing remyelinating and neuroprotective strategies for the disease.

Ensemble learning predicts multiple sclerosis disease course in the SUMMIT study Ensemble learning predicts multiple sclerosis disease course in the SUMMIT study   ,   ,   & , Article number:  () An to this article was published on 20 November 2020 The rate of disability accumulation varies across multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Machine learning techniques may offer more powerful means to predict disease course in MS patients. In our study, 724 patients from the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation in MS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (CLIMB study) and 400 patients from the EPIC dataset, University of California, San Francisco, were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was an increase in () ≥ 1.5 (worsening) or not (non-worsening) at up to 5 years after the baseline visit. Classification models were built using the CLIMB dataset with patients’ clinical and MRI longitudinal observations in first 2 years, and further validated using the EPIC dataset. We compared the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms ( and ) and three ensemble learning approaches (, and a Meta-learner ). A “threshold” was established to trade-off the performance between the two classes. Predictive features were identified and compared among different models. Machine learning models achieved 0.79 and 0.83 AUC scores for the CLIMB and EPIC datasets, respectively, shortly after disease onset. Ensemble learning methods were more effective and robust compared to standalone algorithms. Two ensemble models, XGBoost and LightGBM were superior to the other four models evaluated in our study. Of variables evaluated, EDSS, , and were the top common predictors in forecasting the MS disease course. Machine learning techniques, in particular ensemble methods offer increased accuracy for the prediction of MS disease course. The majority of currently approved multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies primarily target relapses, and have limited effects on halting the overall disability progression. Although a number of clinical and demographic features have been associated with long-term disease course in MS, there is increasing evidence that early and more aggressive treatment targeting relapses may delay or prevent the long-term accumulation of disability, but this effect must be balanced with the potential increase in side effects associated with more potent therapies. The identification of patients who are more likely to accrue disability would allow clinicians to institute more rigorous monitoring procedures and potentially initiate more potent therapies early in the course of the disease. In our research, we apply machine learning techniques to predict the disability level of MS patients at the five-year time point using the first two years of clinical and neuroimaging longitudinal data. The level of MS disability is measured by the () score using a 0–10 scale, in which 0 is normal and 6 corresponds to walking with a cane. Our goal is to predict which patients will accumulate disability (“worsening”), and which are likely to remain without disability accumulation (“non-worsening”) in their disease course. We define “worsening” as an increase of 1.5 or more from the baseline EDSS to the 5-year EDSS, and “non-worsening” as all other cases. The threshold is selected based on the fact that an EDSS increase of 1.0 or 1.5 is clinically significant and generally sustained, and is used as a primary or secondary endpoint in clinical trials of MS therapies. In this paper, we present our findings by applying ensemble techniques to integrate information from multiple machine learning classifiers. Ensemble learning has been proven to produce better and more robust predictive performance compared to any single model. In our experiment, we created a heterogeneous Meta-learner from three established machine learning algorithms as our base classifiers: (), , and . We further investigated the efficacy of two more homogeneous ensemble learners, and , which have gained much attention in recent years due to their superior performance. An additional motivation for our research is to study risk factors affecting MS patients’ disease progressions. To this end, we ranked the top predictors in our models and identified the most predictive factors. Detailed findings and discussions are presented in the “Results” section. All experiments were conducted by running a nested cross-validation. Specifically, the outer loop splits the data into ten stratified nonoverlapping folds. Each of the ten folds will subsequently be held out as the test data, while the remaining folds form the training data. For each training set, we apply a nested 10-fold cross-validation to select the hyper-parameters via a grid search based on the highest AUC (area under the ROC curve) score. We report the average model performance of the outer ten test folds. In addition to overall predictive accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were used to measure the performance in the positive and negative classes, respectively. Table presents our experimental results on the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation in MS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (CLIMB) dataset using 6-month observation windows. Since we are more interested in predicting the “worsening” class, we applied different thresholds in the ROC curve to increase a model’s sensitivity at the cost of lowering the specificity. For each threshold displayed in column 1 of Table , we present a performance comparison of the six models described in the “Methods” section, using sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracies. Consequently, we can observe the trade-offs between an increase in sensitivity and a decrease in specificity for each model, as we shift the threshold. A healthcare institution can select a desired threshold depending on its level of tolerance on the insufficient performance of the “non-worsening” class (i.e., a low specificity). From Table , we observe that: The highest accuracy on the “worsening” class that is of practical value is about 80%. This is because further improvement would lead to a <50% performance of the “non-worsening” class. Given 80% as the benchmark on the “worsening” class, XGBoost and LightGBM are the best models, with each achieving close to 70% on the other class at thresholds 0.35 and 0.3, respectively. Meta-learner is the next runner-up with 65% accuracy on the “non-worsening” class. It is worth noting that some algorithms are more sensitive to the shift of threshold values. For example, Random Forest degenerated quickly as the threshold value moved <0.4. On the other hand, XGBoost and LightGBM maintained a steady trade-off between the two classes, as we varied the thresholds. We conclude that they are the desirable models for our task due to their superior performance and robustness. Table presents the validation results of our models using the EPIC dataset. To facilitate a validation from a dataset with different variables and data frequency, we rebuilt our models using the CLIMB dataset, but with only the overlapping attributes of the two datasets and with annual observations. The resulting models were applied directly to the EPIC dataset to evaluate the efficacy of our models. We first observe that, similar to Table , ensemble methods continue to be the top performers for the CLIMB dataset. However, the best attainable performance has decreased to ~75 and 61% for the “worsening” and “non-worsening” classes, respectively. The reduced predicability is expected because the results in Table were obtained using fewer variables and less data frequency than those in Table . We further observe that the desired models for the CLIMB data align with the ones for the EPIC dataset. It is worth noting that SVM and Logistic Regression achieved similar performance, as the ensemble methods for the CLIMB dataset in Table . However, SVM didn’t sustain its effectiveness for the EPIC dataset and Logistic Regression was not a favored model in Table . Thus, we recommend ensemble models for our classification task due to their robust performance across varied datasets and experiments. In addition to validating the optimal models across the two datasets, we further evaluated the overall similarity of model performance for all thresholds. To this end, we performed an independent regression analysis for each evaluation metric (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and overall), using the corresponding accuracies of the two datasets. We present the regression statistics in the last two rows of Table . The high -square (correlation) values indicate that our models’ performances in the two datasets are highly similar. This is further evidenced by the regression coefficients where a value closer to one indicates a better match. In addition, the nearly zero values imply the statistical significance of the coefficients. Lastly, we present the AUC scores for our experiments in Table . The “CLIMB-all” and “CLIMB-part” columns denote the models trained using all and partial CLIMB features, respectively. In each column, all machine learning models differ marginally in terms of the AUC metric. However, AUC measures a model’s effectiveness over all thresholds, including the ones without practical values. The above closer analysis of Tables and revealed that the ensemble algorithms produced the most useful results for the two datasets in both experiments. We further observe that the models achieved higher AUC scores on the validation (EPIC) dataset, which confirms the generalizability of our models. We next examined the major factors that are predictive of MS progression. Five linear and tree-based algorithms, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM were selected for the study. These models were chosen because their feature importance was well defined. For linear models, the importance of a feature is proportional to the magnitude of its coefficients. Specifically, all linear models can be expressed as a linear combination of the dependent variables, i.e., $$y = \omega _0 + \omega _1x_1 + \omega _2x_2 + \ldots + \omega _Dx_D,$$ where is the target, (, , …, ) are the dependent variables, and (, , …, ) are the model parameters. With a preprocessed dataset, where each feature is normalized across all samples, the magnitude of indicates the contribution of in making the prediction. For (DT)-based models, the ranking follows the order of attributes that the algorithm chooses to split the branches. The algorithm implicitly performs feature selection by selecting an available node that produces the most homogeneous (i.e., purest) subbranches using criteria, such as . For a tree-based ensemble algorithm, attributes are ranked according to their average rank scores across all trees. Table presents the top ten risk factors identified by each of the five models, using the CLIMB dataset. Examining the top five risk factors associated with each model, we identified two consistent principal predictors (highlighted in bold) across all models. The first one, as expected, is either the EDSS score or its progression. It is worth noting that our task is to predict a patient’s EDSS score at 5-year mark, using the first 2-year observations. Thus, these EDSS-related predictors are lagged observations at the onset of the disease. The second principal predictor is a patient’s pyramidal function measure. In addition, a patient’s MS disease category or its progression is another important variable that appeared in four out of the five models. Specifically, SVM and Logistic Regression are dependent on ∆, while XGBoost and LightGBM rely on the value of DISEASE_CATEGORY itself. Expanding our investigation to the top ten risk factors associated with each model, we could identify two more common risk factors across all models, namely and (or its related change ∆AMBULATORY_INDEX). In addition to the seven common risk factors revealed by all models, the measure of a patient’s bowel and bladder function is the next important risk factor to watch out for because it appeared in three out of the five models. Furthermore, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest rely on a patient’s total number of Gad+ lesions and TDS+ calculated brain parenchymal fraction in making their predictions, whereas XGBoost and LightGBM utilize a patient’s genetic information, i.e., , in their decisions. Table presents the top ten risk factors identified by each of the five models using the EPIC dataset. Examining the top five risk factors identified by each model, we observe that the EPIC dataset displayed same top two consistent principal predictors (i.e., EDSS and ) like the CLIMB dataset across all models. Expanding to the top ten risk factors, we observe that the volume of the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain gray matter volume are two major predictors for the EPIC dataset. These two variables were not included in the CLIMB dataset. We recommend including them in the future CLIMB data collection effort. Other major predictors identified for the EPIC dataset are , , and . Although these variables are among the risk factors presented in Table , their rankings are lower than other factors, including DISEASE_CATEGORY DISEASE_ACTIVITY, and AMBULATORY_INDEX. Noting that the latter ones were not present in the EPIC dataset, we recommend including them in the future EPIC data collection effort. In this study, we applied machine learning techniques to predict disability accumulation levels of MS patients at the 5-year mark based on 2-year clinical observations. We built and validated our models using two real-world datasets: 724 patients enrolled in the CLIMB study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and 400 patients from the EPIC dataset from the University of California, San Francisco. We employed three baseline machine learning models and three ensemble learners in our study. We further addressed the data imbalance issue by increasing the weights for the minority class. Our experimental results demonstrate that XGBoost and LightGBM offer comparable predictive power for our task, and their performances are more robust than the other four models across the two datasets. In addition, we examined the top risk factors identified by our linear and tree-based models for both CLIMB and EPIC datasets. Several common as well as independent variables were identified from the two datasets, and future studies should consider evaluating these further. We conclude that a patient’s change in EDSS scores over the baseline value, pyramidal function measure, MS disease category, disease activity, ambulatory index, volume of the cerebrospinal fluid, and the brain gray matter volume are the top predictive indicators to forecast a patient’s disability level in 5 years. For future work, we plan to explore time series models, such as recurrent neural networks to better capture the temporal dependencies in the longitudial data. We also plan to incorporate genetic information and additional biomarkers from patients’ medical records. In this section, we describe the datasets, experimental design, and machine learning methods we employed to conduct our study. We included data from two prospectively followed cohorts that together form part of the SUMMIT Consortium. Our first dataset consists of 724 patients enrolled in the CLIMB. CLIMB patients undergo a complete neurological examination every six months, including measurement of EDSS. MRI procedures are performed on these patients on an annual basis. The dataset consists of 44 longitudinal and 24 demographic features. Of these, we excluded variables with excessive missing values as well as medication-related attributes. To reflect the change of a patient’s disease progression, we added a lagged variable for each clinical attribute, capturing the difference between the current and previous time points. Categorical features were further preprocessed using one-hot encoding, a technique in which an integer-encoded categorical variable is converted to a set of binary variables, each of which indicates a unique value of the category. One-hot encoding eliminates the artificial ordering introduced by the integer values that a machine learning algorithm could exploit erroneously. We applied one-hot encoding only to categorical variables, but not to ordinal variables whose rankings could provide useful information to the model. After preprocessing the data, we have a total of 198 features over a 2-year observation window. Our second dataset consists of 400 patients from the EPIC dataset from the University of California, San Francisco. Unlike the CLIMB dataset, patients in this dataset were monitored annually using 35 periodical features and 10 demographic variables. After augmenting the selected clinical attributes with additional lagged variables and preprocessing the categorical features, we have a total of 105 features over a 2-year observation window. Although we are more interested in predicting the “worsening” patients, they form the minority class in our training data. Indeed, we have 165 “worsening” cases out of a total of 724 training samples in the CLIMB dataset. We employed the cost-sensitive learning technique to address the class imbalance issue during our model training. In this approach, a higher cost (i.e., weight) is assigned to all minority instances to facilitate a larger penalty when any of them are misclassified. For each algorithm, the best weight was selected as a hyper-parameter using a nested tenfold cross-validation during the model training. Specifically, we conducted a grid search on a list of weights centered around the ratio of the majority to minority samples, and selected the one with the highest average AUC score on the ten test folds. While treating the imbalanced training data prevents degenerated models in which the predictions are biased towards the majority class, accurate forecast for the “worsening” class is inherently more challenging than that for the “non-worsening” class at the onset of the disease. To address this issue, we further establish a probability “threshold” to classify an instance belonging to the “worsening” class. Consequently, a lower threshold leads to higher accuracy in the “worsening” class at the cost of lower accuracy in the “non-worsening” class. Practitioners can select the model at different thresholds depending on their preferred tolerance on the false positive rate. Although both of our datasets are collected for similar research purposes, the CLIMB data constitute patient records with semiannual clinical visits, while the EPIC data are with annual follow-ups. In addition, the two datasets exhibit <50% common demographic and clinical features. The CLIMB study subjects provide informed consent, and this study is approved by the Partners Human Research Committee. EPIC subjects provide informed consent and this study is approved by the University of California Human Research Protection Program. Table summarizes the differences between the two datasets and presents their overlapping variables. These discrepancies prevent us from conducting a straightforward model validation, using one dataset for the other. To address this issue and, nonetheless, not limiting our model evaluation only to the overlapping variables, we design our study in three steps as follows. Step 1: we train and evaluate our machine learning models using the complete CLIMB data with a nested cross-validation approach. We analyze the experimental results and draw our conclusions, including the efficacy of our models. Step 2: we conduct the same experiment on the CLIMB data, but only with the set of variables overlapping with the EPIC data. The results will be (1) compared to the ones from step 1 to confirm the robustness of our models, and (2) validated using the EPIC dataset. Step 3: we conduct our risk factor analysis by extracting the top ten predictive variables from the linear (i.e., SVM and Logistic Regression) and tree-based (i.e., Random Forest, XGboost, and LightGBM) models. Principle risk factors are identified as the common predictors in these algorithms. The same analysis is conducted independently for the two datasets using their complete data. In addition to validating the common risk factors, our study further helps to identify potential key biomarkers that the two datasets failed to collect. We selected the following three established and popular machine learning algorithms as our baseline learners. These methods are illustrated in Fig. . A SVM performs classification tasks by constructing a decision boundary (i.e., hyperplanes) in a multidimensional space that separates instances of different class labels. As illustrated in Fig. , SVM strives to find a hyperplane that has the maximum margin, i.e., the maximum distance between the hyperplane and the data points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance reinforces that future data points can be classified with more confidence. SVM is capable of transforming the data into a higher dimensional space, using various kernel functions to enhance data separability. In our study, we adhered to the linear SVM to facilitate risk factor analysis. A Random Forest is a collection of DTs. A DT model uses a tree structure to model the data, in which each leaf node corresponds to a class label and attributes are represented as the internal nodes of the tree. Each branch represents a potential value of its parent node (i.e., an attribute). The major challenge in building a DT model is choosing the attribute for each node at each level. Information Gain and Gini Index are the two popular metrics used for attribute selection. DTs tend to have high variance since they are likely to overfit the training data. A Random Forest model, illustrated in Fig. , creates a forest of DTs where each DT is trained with a subset of training instances and a subset of attributes. By pooling predictions from multiple DTs, a Random Forest reduces the variance of each individual DT and achieves a more robust and superior performance. In our study, we used a random forest of 50 DTs, where each tree was built with ten randomly selected attributes. The rest of the model parameters were assigned the default values in Python’s scikit-learn package. Logistic regression is a generalized linear model that studies the association between a categorical response variable and a set of independent (explanatory) variables  = {1, , …, }. As illustrated in Fig. , the variable is first modeled as a linear function of with coefficients  = {, , …, }, and then the predictions (’s) are transformed into probability scores using a sigmoid function . In a binary classification task, the scores indicate a corresponding instance’s likelihood of belonging to the positive class. Thus, a cutoff (e.g., 0.5) can be established as a decision boundary to further categorize the instances into the more likely class. The “training” process involves adjusting the coefficients to maximize the cross-entropy of the model outputs and the true class labels. In addition to individual machine learning algorithms, we explored ensemble techniques to integrate information from the three base classifiers described above. Ensemble learning is a family of algorithms that seek to create a “strong” classifier based on a group of “weak” classifiers. In this context, “strong” and “weak” refer to how accurately the classifiers can predict the target variable. Ensemble learning has been proven to produce improved and more robust performance than single models. Figure illustrates the principle of ensemble learning. Specifically, multiple base classifiers, , , …, , are built for the original classification task with the training data . A Meta-learner is constructed by combining the predictions, , , …, , from the base classifiers to improve predictive accuracy. Our Meta-learner is an example of a heterogeneous ensemble because its base learners are obtained from different machine learning algorithms. Our next model, XGBoost, explores the efficacy of a homogeneous ensemble, where the base classifiers are obtained using a single machine learning algorithm. For the task of combining the outcomes from the base learners, we applied stacked generalization, in which an additional linear regression model was trained to predict the target variable in based on the individual predictions from our three baseline classifiers. Stacking typically yields better performance than a straightforward majority voting approach. We investigated the performance of XGBoost, an algorithm that has gained much popularity and attention since its inception in 2016. XGBoost was the winning algorithm for a number of machine learning competitions. The algorithm belongs to the family of homogeneous ensemble methods, in which the base learners, , , …, are created using a single machine learning algorithm exploiting the concept of “adaptive boosting”. Figure illustrates the concept of “adaptive boosting”. In particular, a sequence of classifiers is generated with the new model aiming to correct the errors made by the previous model. This correction is achieved by boosting the weights of the misclassified training instances in the previous model so that the new model will have a higher likelihood of correctly classifying them. Predictions from these homogenous learners are integrated into a final decision using methods, such as majority voting or stacked generalization. In XGBoost, instead of boosting the weights, the algorithm fits the new model to residuals of the previous model and then minimizes the loss when adding the latest model. The process is equivalent to updating your model with a gradient descent toward a local optimum solution. The third ensemble learner we employed in our study is LightGBM, a gradient boosting tree-based framework which implements two new techniques: (GOSS) and (EFB). In particular, with GOSS, the algorithm keeps all large gradient instances and only samples from the population of small gradient instances. Thus, GOSS focuses on large gradient instances as they are considered undertrained. With EFB, the algorithm bundles mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously) to reduce the number of features. Compared to other tree-based algorithms, LightGBM produces much more complex trees by following a leaf-wise split rather than a level-wise split, which is the main factor contributing to LightGBM’s superior performance.

Did you know that deficiency of good bacteria in your gut could lead to multiple sclerosis? Know how bacteria in your gut can influence the auto immune disorder, multiple sclerosis. By: | Bad gut bacteria — or an insufficient amount of good bacteria — may have a direct link to , say researchers, including one of Indian-origin. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic progressive auto-immune disease in which the immune system attacks the nervous tissue, potentially resulting in movement disorders. Other typical symptoms of MS include physical and mental fatigue as well as faintness, depression and paresthesia such as pins and needles, itchiness and numbness. Every human carries trillions of bacteria in their gut (gut microbiome) and recent advances in research indicate that these tiny passengers play an important role in our overall health maintenance, said Ashutosh Mangalam, Assistant Professor at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in the US. (Read: Researchers claim they have developed stem cell therapy that might reverse multiple sclerosis) Also Read - Boost health of gut microbe to reduce severity of COVID-19 symptoms Also Read - Gut microbiome imbalances influence the likelihood of ‘long Covid’ Since the bacteria are associated with contributing to good health, Mangalam and his colleagues wondered whether those with a chronic autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, would then have a gut microbiome that is different than the microbiome found in healthy individuals. In the study published online in the journal , the researchers said that MS patients do, in fact, have a distinct microbiome from their healthy peers. Although preliminary, our data suggest that patients with MS have reduced levels of good bacteria responsible for overall benefits obtained from consuming healthy foods, such as soybean and flaxseeds, Mangalam, who is senior author on the study, said. For the study, Mangalam and his team from Mayo Clinic conducted microbiome analysis on fecal samples collected from MS patients as well as healthy control subjects. We identified certain bacteria which are increased or decreased in the gut of patients with MS compared to healthy controls, he said.

MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Reviewed By: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In MS, the immune system attacks and damages or destroys myelin, a substance that surrounds and insulates the nerves. The myelin destruction causes a distortion or interruption in nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain. This can result in a wide variety of symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is estimated to affect 2.8 million people worldwide. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, though it can also occur in young children and the elderly. Multiple sclerosis is three times more common in women than in men. In addition, nearly all women afflicted with MS get the condition before menopause. This could mean that hormones play an important role in the disease’s development. Usually, MS in men is more severe than it is in women. They typically get MS in their 30s and 40s, just as their testosterone levels begin to decline. Although MS is more common in women than men overall, one form of the disease contradicts this pattern. People with primary progressive (PP) MS are about as likely to be male as female. (The four main types of MS are described later). People who smoke are more likely to develop MS, and to develop it more severely and with a faster progression. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other ethnicities. MS is believed to have a genetic component as people with a first-degree relative with the disease have a higher incidence than the general population. We don't know exactly what causes multiple sclerosis, but it is believed to be some combination of immunologic, environmental, infectious, and/or genetic factors. Some theories have been proposed, though there is not enough evidence to establish any one cause. Theories as to what causes MS include: Exposure to chemical solvents such as amines, esters, ethers, and ketones Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly perceives its own myelin (the protective sheath around the nerves) as an intruder and attacks it, as it would a virus or other foreign infectious agent. To understand how this harms the body, it helps to understand how nerves work. A nerve can be seen by the naked eye, but it is made up of hundreds or even thousands of microscopic nerve fibers wrapped by connective tissue. Nerves conduct messages to and from the brain by way of electrical impulses. Often the nerve fibers that make up a nerve are all individually wrapped in myelin, a protective sheath that causes electric impulses to conduct down the nerve much faster than fibers that lack myelin. (The same principle is used to improve electric wires by covering them with a plastic outer layer.) In multiple sclerosis, the immune system's T cells attack the myelin sheath. By attacking myelin, the immune system in a person with MS causes inflammation and degeneration of the myelin that can lead to demyelination, or stripping of the myelin covering of the nerves. It can also cause scarring (the ""sclerosis"" in the name “multiple sclerosis”). This causes electrical impulses to travel more slowly along the nerves resulting in deterioration of function in body processes such as vision, speech, walking, writing, and memory. While multiple sclerosis is not hereditary, genetics are believed to play a role. In the U.S., the chances of developing MS are one in 750. Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling) increases the risk to up to 5%. An identical twin of someone with MS has a 25% chance of being diagnosed with the disorder. It is thought there is an outside trigger, as genetics only makes certain people susceptible to getting MS, which is why the disease is not considered hereditary. Genes may make a person more likely to develop the disease, but it is believed that there still is an additional outside trigger that makes it happen. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis that have been identified and each type can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and a patient's response to treatment. The four types of MS are discussed on the next four slides. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS, RRMS or RMS) is the most common type of MS, affecting about 85% of MS sufferers. RR-MS is defined by inflammatory attacks on the myelin and nerve fibers causing a worsening of neurologic function. Symptoms vary from patient to patient, and symptoms can flare up (called relapses or exacerbations) unexpectedly, and then disappear (remission). Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS, PPMS) is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any relapses or remissions. There may be occasional plateaus, but overall, the progression of the disability is continuous. This form of MS occurs equally in men and women, and the age of onset is about 10 years later than in relapsing-remitting MS. Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS, SPMS) is a form of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS. Most people diagnosed with RR-MS will eventually transition to having SP-MS. After a period of relapses (also called attacks, or exacerbations) and remissions the disease will start to progress steadily. People with SP-MS may or may not experience remissions. Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PR-MS, PRMS) is the least common form of MS, occurring in about 5% of MS patients. People with PR-MS experience steady disease progression and worsening neurological function as seen in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS), along with occasional relapses like people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS). Symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be single or multiple. They may range from mild to severe in intensity. They may also be long-term or short-term in duration. Multiple sclerosis is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms are so varied and can resemble other diseases. It is often diagnosed by a process of exclusion – that is, by ruling out other neurological diseases – so the diagnosis of MS may take months to years. A physician will do a complete history and neurological exam, along with tests to evaluate mental, emotional and language functions, strength, coordination, balance, reflexes, gait, and vision. Tests to Help Confirm a Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Cerebrospinal fluid exam (spinal tap, lumbar puncture) One of the main ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. Characteristic areas of demyelination will show up as lesions on an MRI scan. On the left is a brain MRI scan of a 35-year-old man with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that reveals multiple lesions with high T2 signal intensity and one large white matter lesion. The right image shows the cervical spinal cord of a 27-year-old woman representing a multiple sclerosis demyelination and plaque (see arrow). There are several aspects to treating multiple sclerosis. Modifying the disease – there are several drugs that can reduce the severity and frequency of relapses Treating exacerbations (or attacks) with high dose corticosteroids Rehabilitation both for fitness and to manage energy levels Treatment for multiple sclerosis may include drugs to manage attacks, symptoms, or both. Many medications carry the risk of some side effects, so patients need to manage their treatment with their doctors. Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation in the body and affect the function of the immune system. They are often used to manage MS attacks, but can have numerous side effects. There are several medications approved for disease modification, including the following: Many medications are used to treat and manage symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol): Solu-Medrol is given intravenously during the acute attack, sometimes followed up with an oral corticosteroid. Continued from the last slide, here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. : Anti-convulsants like carbamazepine (Tegretol) or gabapentin (Neurontin) are used for face or limb pain. : Anti-depressants or electrical stimulation are used for pricking pain, intense tingling, and burning. : Antibiotics are used to manage infections : Vitamin C and cranberry juice are used to prevent infections : Used for bladder dysfunction This is usually treated by increasing fluids and fiber to the diet. Often resistant to treatment. Sometimes drugs or surgery are used if tremors are severe. There has been a lot of progress over the years in managing multiple sclerosis, and research is ongoing into new therapies. There are several new avenues of current research. Scientists hope to find further associations between lifestyle and illness progression. They want to learn ways to repair and reverse the damage MS causes. And they hope to learn the ultimate cause of this disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that progressively damages the nerves of the brain and spinal cord. Any sensory or motor (muscular) function in the body may be affected by the nerves damaged from MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, immunological, infectious, and/or environmental factors. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis and symptoms range from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and, to some degree, the patient's response to treatment. What Is Multiple Sclerosis?

Although further study is needed before this blood test can be used routinely to predict disease course and guide the care of individuals with MS, these findings add to growing evidence that NfL has potential as a predictive biomarker of MS disease activity and disability progression. . NfL is a fragment that is part of the debris that enters the spinal fluid and blood when nerve wires (axons) are damaged. Studies of NfL in the bloodstream and in spinal fluid have been underway to better define how this biomarker may be employed to help detect and predict disease activity and response to treatments, not only in MS but in other disorders. In this large study, the researchers identified 4,385 people with MS from Swedish MS registries, and 1,026 people who did not have MS. They tested NfL levels in blood samples and followed the participants for five years. People with MS had significantly higher levels of NfL in their blood, compared to people without MS. Higher NfL levels were significantly associated with worsening disability during the next year and with the likelihood of reaching moderate disability (affecting daily activities but not walking ability). This large study adds to a growing body of knowledge needed to determine the best use of NfL as a biomarker for MS care, treatment decisions, and clinical trials. Additional studies underway will help standardize its use and help understand how age and other health conditions impact NfL levels.  Plasma neurofilament light levels are associated with the risk of disability in multiple sclerosis” by Ali Manouchehrinia, PhD, and colleagues from the Karolinska Institutet was published on May 20, 2020 in .

c6bc2e3c-02fc-4b82-bca9-3caa108c9abf,"Reviewed by Jack Burks, MD, MSAA’s Chief Medical Officer Published studies to date continue to affirm the safety of several vaccinations for individuals with MS. These vaccines (listed in this article) do not increase the risk of developing MS or exacerbating its symptoms. The safety of the shingles vaccine is more difficult to judge for individuals with MS, since this is a live-virus vaccine. Vaccines that use a live virus could pose a risk for individuals with compromised immune systems, resulting from an illness or a medication taken for an illness. The shingles vaccine is important for individuals 60 years and older, because the risk of developing shingles, as well as a painful long-term complication of shingles, greatly increases with age. Similar to the shingles vaccine, the yellow fever vaccine also uses a weakened, live virus. In a small study, the yellow fever vaccine was shown to increase MS disease activity. Before receiving any vaccine, individuals with MS should consult their physician to make sure that the specific vaccine and its timing is appropriate for them. Published studies to date continue to affirm the safety of several vaccinations for individuals with MS. Researchers and national health organizations support the safety of the following vaccines for individuals with MS: influenza (via the injected flu vaccine using inactivated viruses*) These vaccines do not increase the risk of developing MS or exacerbating its symptoms. No evidence of a specific risk for relapse has been associated with any of these vaccinations. *Please note that flu vaccines are usually available in two forms: injected and intranasal. The injected type of flu vaccine uses the inactivated (or killed) viruses, and according to many published studies as well as national health organizations, is considered safe for individuals with MS. People cannot develop the flu from the injected vaccines, since these contain non-infectious particles. The intranasal vaccine (“FluMist”), given by nose with a mist, contains live viruses and is NOT recommended for individuals with MS. In a meta-analysis of immunization and MS (Rutschmann OT, et al, 2002), the authors evaluated and summarized the data from several published studies. They found no evidence that those vaccinations (listed above) increase the risk of an MS relapse. However, they did find strong evidence for an increased risk of an MS relapse in individuals with MS who become infected with one of the above-mentioned illnesses. Therefore, the authors conclude that evidence supports using strategies to reduce the risk of infection with one of these illnesses, and this can be most effectively accomplished through the use of vaccines deemed safe for individuals with MS. Before receiving any vaccine, individuals with MS should consult their physician to make sure that the specific vaccine and its timing is appropriate for each individual. If experiencing a relapse, patients may be advised to wait a period of time (approximately four to six weeks) before receiving a vaccine. If considering a vaccine containing a live virus (versus an inactivated virus), this should always be discussed in advance with one’s doctor. Several factors – including any medications someone has, is, or plans on taking – can play a large role in the safety of the vaccine. More information is provided in the next section of this article, which gives more details on the live-virus vaccine approved to reduce the risk of shingles. Additionally, for people who are taking or have taken certain medications (including Tysabri® [natalizumab], Gilenya® [fingolimod], and IVIG), more studies are needed to determine if these interfere with the effectiveness of certain vaccines. In addition to the vaccines listed earlier, no evidence has been shown for an increased risk of developing MS as a result of the following vaccinations: One meta-analysis (Farez MF, et al, 2011) found that vaccinations for diphtheria and tetanus may be associated with a decreased risk of developing MS. The authors note that further research is needed. on the flu and flu vaccines, please see the following articles from MSAA: (posted January 2013) (posted October 2012) Flu Vaccines, MS, and General Flu and Cold Information (posted October 2004) For additional information on all of the vaccines mentioned in this article, as well as general information on avoiding and treating the flu, please visit the According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the vaccine for shingles (also known as herpes zoster or zoster) is recommended for use in people 60 years and older to reduce the risk of shingles. This includes everyone in this age group who has no contraindications, as well as people who have had a previous episode of shingles and/or have chronic medical conditions. (The specific “chronic medical conditions” listed by the CDC include kidney failure, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pulmonary disease.) The shingles vaccine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 and is marketed under the brand name Zostavax®. The safety of the shingles vaccine is more difficult to judge for individuals with MS. The current data supporting its use are reassuring, but not complete because this vaccine has not been fully investigated in MS. The shingles vaccine has been more thoroughly investigated in other illnesses, including patients whose immune system may be compromised by their disease or by the drugs used to treat their disease. The shingles vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine, which can be an issue for individuals with MS. Most of the vaccines mentioned earlier in this article use viruses that have been inactivated (i.e., killed), so the virus has no chance of infecting anyone. The shingles vaccine contains live viruses, but these have been “attenuated,” meaning that their strength has been reduced to a point where they can’t infect someone with a healthy, uncompromised immune system. As with many individuals with various other health conditions, a large number of individuals with MS take medications that may modulate or suppress their immune system. A live-virus vaccine may conceivably be able to infect someone whose immune system is not fully functioning, a result of either an illness or medications given to treat an illness. In addition to some of the FDA-approved long-term disease-modifying therapies for MS, large doses or extended use of steroids, which are frequently prescribed to treat MS relapses, can also suppress the immune system. Less common treatments to be considered when evaluating the safety of the shingles vaccine include: experimental treatments for MS, such as those being studied in clinical trials with MS patients; off-label treatments, such as methotrexate and Imuran® (azathioprine); hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); and antiviral medications. Individuals with MS who are taking any type of medication that affects the immune system (such as disease-modifying therapies, steroids, or experimental therapies) are advised to talk to their doctor before getting a shingles vaccine. Their physician can assess the risks and benefits of the shingles vaccine in conjunction with the type of medication they are taking. For specifics on vaccine safety in regard to the different medications and treatments that affect the immune system, please refer to the bullet points in MSAA’s article, “.” Additional Information on Shingles and the Shingles Vaccine Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which is the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). This usually occurs decades after the initial chickenpox infection. The reactivation of this virus causes a painful rash with clusters of fluid-filled blisters. Lasting for weeks, months, or even years, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of shingles, and can cause chronic, sometimes excruciating pain in the area where the rash occurred. While most people only have one episode of shingles, second and third episodes are possible. For older individuals with MS, the risk of shingles and its complications is just as great as for those without MS – and for individuals with MS who take immunosuppressive medications, the associated risks become even greater. Everyone’s risk of shingles greatly increases as they get older, particularly after the age of 50. The risk of developing PHN (causing continued chronic pain) as a complication of shingles increases with age, as does the likelihood of experiencing longer lasting and more severe pain with PHN. Additionally, individuals with compromised or suppressed immune systems are also more likely to experience complications from shingles. No serious adverse events have been seen with the shingles vaccine, which has been tested in approximately 20,000 individuals (without MS) age 60 and older. The vaccine appears to be effective for at least six years, but may last longer. While older individuals may get the vaccine at any age, it appears to be the most effective in people 60 to 69 years. Studies have found that the shingles vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 51 percent in older adults, reduced the risk of PHN by 67 percent, and also reduced the severity and duration of pain associated with PHN. about shingles, the shingles vaccine (Zostavax), specific vaccine safety information, insurance coverage, and helpful resources, please see MSAA’s article, “.” Similar to the shingles vaccine mentioned above, the yellow fever vaccine uses a weakened, live virus. In an article about yellow fever vaccination and relapse rate (Farez MF, et al, 2011), seven individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) traveling to areas where yellow fever is common were studied. These individuals were each given a yellow fever vaccine. This small, unblinded study found that disease activity (in terms of relapse rate, active lesions, and other signs of disease activity) significantly increased following the vaccine, compared to 12 months before and nine months after receiving the vaccine. The authors stress the importance of weighing the risk of exposure to yellow fever against the risk of an MS relapse. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa. Individuals with MS are advised to consult their physician to determine the risks and benefits of the vaccine in their particular situations.

Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? Take medicines after your first attack of multiple sclerosis or as soon as you are diagnosed. Don't take medicines now. Wait to see how the disease progresses. Your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when multiple sclerosis (MS) is first diagnosed. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start taking MS medicines. Instead of medicines, you can try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and shots to help you manage your symptoms. It's hard to know the course that your MS will take. Doctors can't know for sure if your MS will get worse. A small number of people with MS have only mild disease and do well without treatment. But many get worse over time. Medicines can reduce the severity of attacks of and how often you have them. They may also reduce or delay disability. But they don't work for everyone. And there is no way to predict if they will work for you. These medicines have side effects that can range from flu-like symptoms to headaches, chest pain, flushing, infections, and allergic reactions to the injection. Some of these medicines can damage your liver or heart. These medicines are costly. Your cost will depend on your health plan coverage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It is also called MS. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve fibers have a protective covering called . Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS slowly destroys myelin and nerve cells in the central nervous system. This causes muscle weakness and other symptoms. Most of the time, MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your . Your doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An MRI scan is often used to confirm the diagnosis. That's because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with MRI. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. In general, MS follows one of four courses: Clinically isolated syndrome. The symptoms last for 24 hours or longer and go away. Relapsing-remitting. This means symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. Secondary progressive, which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressively worse. ""Progressive"" means it gets worse over time. Primary progressive. This means the disease is progressive from the start. Disease-modifying therapy means treatment to delay, change, or interrupt the natural course of the disease. For MS, this means taking medicine over a long period of time to reduce not only the number of attacks but also how bad they are. To slow down the spread of MS, your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when you are first diagnosed with MS. People treated soon after being diagnosed with MS may have better results than those who delay treatment. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Medicines for MS can be costly. They don't work for everyone. And it's hard to know who will benefit. Making a decision about starting disease-modifying therapy can be hard, especially if your symptoms have been mild. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start therapy. A small number of people with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and never have any disability. But there is no way to know who will fall into this group. Medicines can't cure MS. They don't stop disease activity or reverse nervous system damage that has already happened. But drugs may reduce relapses and delay disability in many people with relapsing forms of MS. If you decide not to try disease-modifying therapy at this time, work with your doctor to monitor your health through regular checkups and periodic MRI scans to evaluate whether the disease is progressing. If new lesions are developing or existing lesions are growing, you may want to reconsider your decision and begin treatment. If you decide not to take MS medicines, there are some other things you can do. Take other medicine, such as , to relieve symptoms during attacks or relapses. Try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment you can do at home to help you manage your symptoms and adjust to living and working with MS. Do what you can to stay well. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and try to reduce stress. Some people try alternative therapy to reduce their symptoms. Before you try any type of alternative treatment for MS, talk with your doctor about your treatment options. You can also get advice from an MS treatment center or the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. What do numbers tell us about benefits and risks of MS medicines? This section focuses on glatiramer and interferon beta, the most commonly used MS medicines. Progression from early symptoms to diagnosis of MS *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) Flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath (glatiramer) *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) The evidence suggests a slight positive effect for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. But the quality of the evidence isn't good. It is . If you have had some early symptoms of MS but don't have a clear diagnosis yet, medicine may reduce the chance that your symptoms will progress to full-blown MS. Take a group of 100 people who have had an MS-like episode but do not yet have an MS diagnosis: Without medicines, 45 to 58 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 42 to 55 may not. With MS medicines, 34 to 35 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 65 to 66 may not. Your risk of needing a hospital stay over the next 2 years may be lower if you take medicines than if you don't. : Without MS medicines, 20 people out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 80 out of 100 may not. With MS medicines, 12 out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 88 out of 100 may not. Many people who take MS medicines have uncomfortable side effects. : With interferon beta, 48 out of 100 may have flu-like symptoms. This means that 52 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . With glatiramer, 24 out of 100 may have symptoms such as flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. This means that 76 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . Some evidence is better than other evidence. Evidence comes from studies that look at how well treatments and tests work and how safe they are. For many reasons, some studies are more reliable than others. The better the evidence is—the higher its quality—the more we can trust it. The information shown here is based on the best available evidence. The evidence is rated using four quality levels: . Another thing to understand is that the evidence can't predict what's going to happen in your case. When evidence tells us that 2 out of 100 people who have a certain test or treatment may have a certain result and that 98 out of 100 may not, there's no way to know if you will be one of the 2 or one of the 98. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicine as soon as possible after receiving a diagnosis. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Your doctor may suggest that you take MS medicines because: You have had symptoms that are most likely caused by multiple sclerosis, tests show you most likely have MS, and your doctor is confident that you have MS. You have just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and early treatment may delay damage to your central nervous system. These medicines are the only ones proved to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and delay disability. You take the type of medicine prescribed (pills, injections, or shots). You visit your doctor regularly for blood tests and to check your progress. These drugs can make relapses less severe and reduce how often they occur. Medicines can slow the spread of the disease by limiting new areas of damage in the brain. These drugs don't work for everyone. It is hard to predict who will benefit. The long-term risks of some of these drugs are not known. Side effects of these medicines can include flu-like symptoms, headaches, diarrhea, nausea, hair thinning, depression, chest pain, anxiety, flushing, and redness and swelling at the injection site (for shots or injections). You visit your doctor regularly to check your progress. You try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment at home to adjust to living with MS. You avoid the risks and cost of medicines that you might not need or that may not work for you. You avoid taking medicine for multiple sclerosis if you end up being diagnosed with a different condition. You may have a higher chance of becoming disabled. Long-term use of steroid medicine may lead to other problems such as stomach ulcers, problems sleeping, and high blood pressure. Personal stories about treatment for multiple sclerosis These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions. The MS episodes I've had were fairly mild, but I'm worried that next time the symptoms will be more severe. I don't think I'm being pessimistic by deciding to take interferon. I think I'm giving myself the best chance to live a long and healthy life. I have never been much of a risk-taker, and my health is definitely not something I want to risk. My doctor recommends that I take the medicine. Even if it turns out that I might not have needed treatment for MS, I would rather err on the side of caution by starting therapy now. I know I would really regret not doing the treatment if I had a relapse a year from now or even a few years from now. I generally try to avoid medicine when I can. My doctor really thinks it would be a good idea for me to take the medicine, but I don't want to deal with the side effects, and I'm not sure I like the idea of giving myself shots on a regular basis. I don't want to take medicine ""just in case"" I have problems with MS later. Besides, I can always reconsider if and when I have another episode. Your personal feelings are just as important as the medical facts. Think about what matters most to you in this decision, and show how you feel about the following statements. I want to try the medicine now, even though it might not work. I don't want to take the medicine if it might not work. I worry that if I don't start treatment now, I may be sorry later. I'm willing to live with the side effects of medicine. I don't know if I can handle the side effects of medicine. I want to do whatever I can to make my attacks happen less often. I want to try to handle my attacks without medicine. Now that you've thought about the facts and your feelings, you may have a general idea of where you stand on this decision. Show which way you are leaning right now. Can medicines help prevent some nervous system damage from MS? If you decide not to start medicines now, are there other things you can try? Are you clear about which benefits and side effects matter most to you? Do you have enough support and advice from others to make a choice? How sure do you feel right now about your decision? Check what you need to do before you make this decision. Here's a record of your answers. You can use it to talk with your doctor or loved ones about your decision. LaMantia L, et al. (2010).

Multiple sclerosis, often called MS, is a disease that affects the —the brain and spinal cord. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve cells have a protective covering called myelin. Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS gradually destroys myelin in patches throughout the brain and spinal cord, causing muscle weakness and other symptoms. These patches of damage are called lesions. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. Generally, MS follows one of four courses: , where symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressive. ""Progressive"" means it steadily gets worse. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where the symptoms are progressive at first and are relapsing later. The exact cause is unknown, but most experts believe that MS is an autoimmune disease. In this kind of disease, the body's defenses, called the , mistakenly attack normal tissues. In MS, the immune system attacks the central nervous system—the . Experts don't know why MS happens to some people but not others. There may be a link, because the disease seems to run in families. Where you grew up may also play a role. MS is more common in those who grew up in colder regions that are farther away from the equator. Symptoms depend on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are damaged and how bad the damage is. Early symptoms may include: You may feel weak and stiff, and your limbs may feel heavy. You may drag your leg when you walk. Your vision may be blurred or hazy. You may have eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. You may feel tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, or numbness. You may feel a band of tightness around your trunk or limbs. You may feel lightheaded or dizzy or feel like you're spinning. Diagnosing MS isn't always easy. The first symptoms may be vague. And many of the symptoms can be caused by problems other than MS. MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure that you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your central nervous system. The doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An is often used to confirm the diagnosis, because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with this test. During a relapse, to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to keep down the number of attacks and how severe they are and to slow the progression of the disease. (This is called disease-modifying therapy.) You may find it hard to decide when to start taking the drugs that slow the progression of MS. The drugs may not work for everyone, and they often have side effects. You and your doctor will decide together when you should start any of these drugs. There is no cure for MS. Treatment and self-care can help you maintain your quality of life. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help you manage some physical problems caused by MS. You can also help yourself at home by eating balanced meals, getting regular exercise and rest, and learning to use your energy wisely. Dealing with the physical and emotional demands of MS isn't easy. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to your doctor. You may be depressed, which can be treated. And finding a support group where you can talk to other people who have MS can be very helpful. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. Because a person's risk of MS is slightly higher in some families when a relative has MS, there may be a . For more information, see . Some research suggests that where you lived as a child and you have had could be triggers for MS later in life. But these links have not been proved. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) vary from person to person depending on which parts of the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system) are damaged. The and scarring caused by MS can affect any part of the central nervous system. Myelin is the insulating coating around a nerve. Symptoms may come and go or become more or less severe from day to day or, in rare cases, from hour to hour. Symptoms may become worse with increased body temperature or after a viral infection. , such as weakness, leg dragging, stiffness, a tendency to drop things, a feeling of heaviness, clumsiness, or a lack of coordination (). , such as blurred, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. Optic neuritis—sudden loss of vision that is often painful—is a fairly common first symptom. It occurs in up to 25 out of 100 people who have MS. , such as tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, a band of tightness around the trunk or legs, or electrical sensations moving down the back and legs. As MS progresses, symptoms may become more severe and may include: Worse muscle problems, and stiff, mechanical movements () or uncontrollable shaking (). These problems may make walking difficult. A wheelchair may be needed some or all of the time. Bladder symptoms, such as an inability to hold urine () or to completely empty the bladder, or a loss of bladder sensation. (impotence) and . . These are common in people who have had MS for some time. Feeling very tired (fatigue). This can be worse if symptoms such as pain, spasticity, bladder problems, anxiety, or depression make it hard to sleep. In general, multiple sclerosis follows one of four courses: , where symptoms may fade and then recur at random for many years. The disease doesn't advance during the remissions. Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course. In 8 to 9 out of 10 people with this course of MS, the relapsing-remitting phase lasts about 20 years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course. Later on, it becomes steadily progressive. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where steady deterioration of nerve function begins when symptoms first appear. Symptoms appear and disappear, but nerve damage continues. Few people have this course of MS. MS is different for every person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. The duration of the disease varies. Most people who get MS live with it for decades. MS usually progresses with a series of that occur over many years (relapsing-remitting MS). In many people the first MS attack involves just a single symptom. It may be weeks, months, or years before you have a relapse. As time goes by, symptoms may linger after each relapse so you lose the ability to fully recover from the relapse. New symptoms often develop as the disease damages other areas of the . Events that can mean you may have a more severe type of MS include: Frequent relapses during the first few years of the disease. Early, lasting motor problems that affect movement. Many lesions that show up on an early in the disease. Some people have a few mild attacks from which they recover entirely. This is called benign MS. Although rare, a small number of people die within several years of the onset of MS. This is called malignant or fulminant MS. Because MS may affect your ability to move and walk, it can place limits on your daily living, particularly as you age. If you or someone in your family has MS, talk to your doctor about . Knowing what to expect will help you plan for the future. Reduced ability to move and walk. This makes it necessary to use a wheelchair some or all of the time. Your risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) increases with: Geographic location, or where you lived during childhood (up to age 15). People who spend the first 15 years of their lives in colder climates that are farther away from the equator tend to be more likely to get MS than people who lived closer to the equator during those years. Family history of MS. About 15 out of 100 people who have MS have a relative with MS, most often a brother or sister. Certain genetic characteristics associated with the . These appear more frequently in people who have MS. This may mean that there are one or more that may increase the chance of getting MS. Race. People of Western European ancestry are more likely to get MS. Being female. MS is about 3 times as common in women as in men. Some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are similar to those of many other illnesses. See your doctor if over a period of time you have more than one symptom, such as: Blurry, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain, loss of vision, or double vision. A feeling of heaviness or weakness, involuntary leg dragging, stiffness, walking problems, and clumsiness. Tingling or a pins-and-needles sensation; numbness; tightness in a band around the trunk, arms, or legs; or electric shock sensations moving down the back, arms, or legs. Inability to hold urine or to completely empty the bladder. Problems with memory, attention span, finding the right words for what you mean, and daily problem-solving. If you have been diagnosed with MS, see your doctor if: You begin having a symptom that you have not had before or you notice a significant change in symptoms that are already present. Milder MS-type symptoms can be caused by many other conditions or may occur now and then in healthy people. For example, lots of people have minor numbness in their fingers or a mild dizzy spell once in a while. Stiffness and muscle weakness can result from being more active than usual. A wait-and-see approach () is appropriate for these types of everyday aches and pains, so long as they do not continue. If your symptoms occur more often or don't go away, talk to your doctor. Talk to your doctor about what to expect from the disease and from treatment. MS is an unpredictable disease, but you probably can get some idea of what is ""normal"" and what symptoms or problems are reasons for concern. Some people who have MS want active, regular support from their doctors. Others want to manage their condition on their own as much as possible. Wherever you are in this range, find out which signs or symptoms mean that you need to see your doctor. And seek help when you need it. Health professionals who may be involved in evaluating symptoms of MS and treating the condition include: or . Consult your doctor when symptoms first start. He or she will refer you to a neurologist if needed. If you have MS, your family doctor or internist can treat your general health problems even if you see a neurologist for MS treatment. . A neurologist can decide whether your symptoms are caused by MS. He or she can also help you decide what may be the best treatment for your condition. Many university medical centers and large hospitals have MS clinics or centers staffed by neurologists and other health professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating MS. They may be able to provide the most thorough evaluation. If you have been diagnosed with MS, at some point you may need to seek the help of: A , to assist with exercise to maintain body strength and flexibility and deal with movement problems. An , to identify ways of accomplishing daily activities if MS has caused any physical limitations. A , to improve speech, chewing, and breathing if MS has affected the muscles of the face and throat. A , to help with managing pain, maintaining strength, and adapting to physical disability. A or , to evaluate and treat , or other mood disorders, and problems with memory and concentration if these develop. A , to help with any significant chronic pain that MS may cause. A pain specialist, often as part of a pain clinic, can help find ways of reducing pain when possible and dealing with pain that doesn't go away. A , to do surgery for severe or . Diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) isn't always easy and in some cases may take time. Your medical history and can identify possible nervous system problems and are often enough to strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS. Tests may help confirm or rule out the diagnosis when your history and exam do not provide clear evidence of the disease. MRI and neurological exam may help doctors predict which people will develop MS after a first attack of symptoms. of the brain and spinal cord. This test is done to . (sometimes called a spinal tap). This test may be done to evaluate . Most people with MS have abnormal results on this test. . This test can often reveal abnormalities in the and in the that other tests may not detect. MS is diagnosed when it is clear from neurological tests and a neurological exam that lesions (damaged areas) are present in more than one area of the (usually the brain, spinal cord, or the nerves to the eyes). Tests will also clearly show that damage has occurred at more than one point in time. Some people have had only one episode of a neurological symptom such as optic neuritis, but MRI tests suggest they may have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. Urinary tract tests may be needed to help diagnose a problem with bladder control in a person who has MS. may be needed to identify thinking or emotional problems, which may be present without the person being aware of them. Typically, these tests are in a question-and-answer format. A blood test for JC virus antibodies may be done. This test can help you and your doctor understand your risk for getting a rare but serious brain infection called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Treatment can make living with multiple sclerosis (MS) easier. Your type of treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and whether your disease is active or in remission. You may get medicines, physical therapy, and other treatment at home. Medicines are used to treat relapses, control the course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs), or treat symptoms. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and who have active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicines. This group also recommends treatment with medicine after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS. If you decide not to try medicines at this time, meet with your doctor regularly to check whether the disease is progressing. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You and your doctor will set up a schedule of periodic appointments to monitor and treat your symptoms and follow the progress of your MS. Monitoring your condition helps your doctor find out if you may need to try a different treatment. , occupational therapy, and nonmedical treatment done at home may also help you manage symptoms and adjust to living and working situations. To learn more, see . In rare cases, MS is life-threatening. If your condition gets considerably worse, you may want to make a living will, which allows your wishes to be carried out if you are not able to make decisions for yourself. For more information, see the topic . In general, there is no way to prevent multiple sclerosis (MS) or its attacks. For people with , , and , treatment with medicine may reduce the frequency of relapses and delay disability. If you have multiple sclerosis (MS), it is important to find ways of coping with the practical and emotional demands of the disease. These are different for everyone, so home treatment varies from person to person. Home treatment may involve making it easier to get around your home, dealing with , handling specific symptoms, and getting support from your family and friends. to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don't use throw rugs. And try adjusting your daily schedule so that your routine is less stressful or tiring. , either on your own or with the help of a physical therapist. . At some time, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home somewhat cool, and avoid hot swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. Change how and what you eat if you are having problems swallowing. Thicker drinks make swallowing easier. Try milk shakes or juices in gelatin form. Avoid foods such as crackers or cakes that crumble easily. These can cause choking. Soft foods need less chewing. Use a blender to prepare food for easiest chewing. Eat frequent, small meals to avoid fatigue from eating heavy meals. Ask your doctor about and occupational therapy to help you manage at work and home. Make all efforts to preserve your health. Proper diet, rest, wise use of energy, and practical and emotional support from your family, friends, and doctor can all be very helpful. For more advice about coping with MS at home, contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. Medicines for multiple sclerosis (MS) may be used: During a , to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to alter the natural course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs). These medicines can shorten a sudden relapse and help you feel better sooner. They have been shown to affect the long-term course of the disease or to prevent disability. Strong evidence suggests that MS is caused by the causing and attacking nerve cells and myelin, which is the protective coating surrounding the nerve fibers. Medicines that change the way the immune system works can reduce the number and severity of attacks that damage the nerves and myelin. For people who have , disease-modifying therapy can reduce the number and severity of relapses. It may also delay disability in some people. Some of these medicines may also delay disease progression and reduce relapses in some people who have or . The most commonly used disease-modifying therapies are: Interferon beta (such as Betaseron), for clinically isolated syndrome (first MS attack), relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive MS. Glatiramer (Copaxone), for clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. Other disease-modifying medicines may also be used for MS. Your doctor will prescribe a medicine depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms, and how your body responds. They include: Some people have only one episode of a neurological symptom such as . Yet or other tests suggest that these people have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have had a clinically isolated syndrome. These medicines, when taken early or even before you have been diagnosed with MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend your time without disease. Treating specific symptoms can be effective, even if it doesn't stop the progression of the disease. Symptoms that can often be controlled or relieved with medicine include: Medicines can also help with sexual problems, emotional problems, and walking problems. Sildenafil (Viagra) can help with sexual problems in both men and women. Clomipramine may also be given to improve . Dextromethorphan and quinidine (Nuedexta) is a medicine that can be used for uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing at strange or inappropriate times. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medicine that can be used to help with walking problems. Medicine may be used only some of the time or regularly, depending on how severe or constant a certain symptom is. Changes in diet, schedule, exercise, and other habits can also help manage some of these symptoms. See . Cannabinoids are substances found in marijuana. Similar drugs can be created in a lab. Some forms of natural and man-made cannabinoids may help with symptoms such as pain and spasticity. They are not available in all areas. Talk to your doctor if you are considering cannabinoids. A variety of other medicines and biological chemicals have been tried or are being studied as therapy for MS. None of them have been clearly proved as beneficial, and none have been approved for treatment of MS. Several medicines are being tested in clinical trials. People with MS who have not responded to standard therapy sometimes choose to take part in these trials. To learn more about clinical trials, talk to your doctor or contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Despite the recommendation, some people find it hard to decide whether to begin disease-modifying therapy, especially when their symptoms have been fairly mild. Some may not want to bear the risks and side effects of medicine when they are not sure they need it. Some may want to see whether their disease gets worse before they start therapy. A small percentage of people diagnosed with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and may never develop any disability, but the disease is unpredictable. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The need and desire for medicine vary. If your symptoms are mild, you may choose to manage them without any medicine. If you have specific symptoms that are causing problems, certain medicines may help you keep them under control. Or you may want to use medicine only during a relapse. The possible side effects of using steroids or other medicines to treat symptoms or control a relapse. Some people have only minor side effects. But others may have side effects that concern them more than their MS symptoms. The costs of treating symptoms and controlling relapses. In some cases, using medicine to control symptoms and relapses may reduce the need for hospital stays. Other personal issues that you face at work or at home. Also keep in mind that it can be hard to tell if medicine is helping. Multiple sclerosis is a disease with spontaneous remissions. This means that your condition can improve on its own, without any treatment. Just because your symptoms improve after treatment doesn't mean that a treatment is working. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have severe (shakiness) affecting movement may be helped by surgery. People with severe (muscle stiffness) may be helped by insertion of a spinal pump to deliver medicines when oral medicines fail. for tremor. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. Severe and disabling tremor that occurs with the slightest movement of the limbs may be helped by an implanted device that stimulates an area of the brain. A does the surgery to implant the device. Implantation of a drug catheter or pump, for spasticity. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. People who have severe pain or spasticity may benefit from having a catheter or pump placed in the lower spinal area to deliver a constant flow of medicine, such as baclofen. The unpredictability and variety of symptoms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) make it a disease that people have tried to treat in many different ways. Many have been proposed as treatments for MS. None of these treatments have been shown to modify the course of the disease. Some of those most commonly used are: Diets and vitamin, mineral, herbal, or dietary supplements. (often used by ). Although clinical research has not shown all of these complementary therapies to be effective, a person with MS may benefit from safe nontraditional therapies along with conventional medical treatment. Some complementary therapies may help relieve stress, depression, fatigue, and muscle tension. And some may improve your overall well-being and quality of life. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying any of these complementary therapies or to MS treatment. Clinical research also has been unable to show that treatments such as ""liberation"" angioplasty for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), bee venom therapy, Prokarin (a caffeine and histamine combination), removal of mercury fillings (dental amalgams), and have any benefits for people who have MS. Some of these therapies may be harmful as well as expensive and are not recommended by most experts. Experimental treatments for MS involve reducing the activity of the . This may be done with medicines and biological chemicals or through methods such as total lymphoid irradiation, in which the entire lymph node system is exposed to radiation. While these methods have been used with success in the treatment of certain other medical conditions, they have failed to produce significant benefits when tested in controlled clinical trials. They remain experimental treatments for MS. , which uses immature cells from the bone marrow, has been studied. Early results suggest that stem cell transplant may delay disability, especially in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Stem cell transplant may be an option for people who have very aggressive or malignant forms of MS. It remains unproved and isn't recommended for treating relapsing-remitting MS. There is no cure for MS. So far, the only treatments proved to affect the course of the disease are approved disease-modifying therapies. Other types of treatment should replace these medicines if you are a candidate for treatment with them. Some people who have MS report that complementary therapies have worked for them. This may be in part because of the . Some complementary therapies don't treat the disease itself, but they may affect a person's sense of well-being and help the person feel better and healthier. If you are thinking about trying a complementary treatment, get the facts first. Discuss these questions with your doctor: Talk with your doctor about the safety and potential side effects of the treatment. This is especially important if you are on drug therapy for MS. Some complementary treatments in combination with drug therapy can be quite dangerous. A treatment that could be harmful to you and may or may not improve your symptoms isn't worth the risk. Because MS symptoms can come and go, you may find it hard to judge whether a particular treatment is really working. Keep in mind that if you get better after using a certain treatment, the treatment isn't always the reason for the improvement. MS may often improve on its own (spontaneous remission). An expensive, unproven treatment that may or may not help you may not be worth its cost. Beware of therapy providers or products that require a large financial investment at the beginning of a series of treatments. Even if they aren't effective in treating MS, some complementary practices (such as acupuncture, massage, or yoga) may be safe. And they may lead to healthy habits that improve your overall well-being. These might be worth trying. With a hard-to-treat disease like MS, it can be tempting to jump at the promise of an effective treatment. Be cautious about trying unproven treatments.

8ee519d7-f582-4190-9cad-a75cec325d9c,"Low-Frequency and Rare-Coding Variation Contributes to Multiple Sclerosis Risk International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium Multiple sclerosis is a complex neurological disease, with ∼20% of risk heritability attributable to common genetic variants, including >230 identified by genome-wide association studies. Multiple strands of evidence suggest that much of the remaining heritability is also due to additive effects of common variants rather than epistasis between these variants or mutations exclusive to individual families. Here, we show in 68,379 cases and controls that up to 5% of this heritability is explained by low-frequency variation in gene coding sequence. We identify four novel genes driving MS risk independently of common-variant signals, highlighting key pathogenic roles for regulatory T cell homeostasis and regulation, IFNγ biology, and NFκB signaling. As low-frequency variants do not show substantial linkage disequilibrium with other variants, and as coding variants are more interpretable and experimentally tractable than non-coding variation, our discoveries constitute a rich resource for dissecting the pathobiology of MS.

Women are as men to suffer from MS, and indicates that women with MS are also more likely to experience cardiovascular disease than men with the same condition. On the whole, individuals with MS are more likely than the general population to experience heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure. The difference in risk is particularly striking for women, prompting scientists to recommend more thorough preventive measures and early cardiovascular risk testing for women with MS.MS is notoriously difficult to diagnose. Its cause is not well understood, and there is currently no cure. Treatments focus on symptoms, which can vary considerably in type and severity from person to person. At times, MS may go into remission or be suddenly exacerbated. Many individuals with MS turn to natural remedies in addition to pharmaceuticals to treat their symptoms and prevent attacks.According to , commonly experience muscle problems (such as spasms or numbness), vision deterioration, bladder infections and bowel troubles, pain and tingling in the limbs, difficulty with speech or swallowing, dizziness, depression, and loss in libido. Many with MS may go undiagnosed for years; part of the MS diagnosis process involves ruling out every other condition known to cause nerve damage.Some researchers hypothesize that the inflammation characteristic of MS may contribute to higher risks for other inflammatory conditions. Whether elevated risk of in women with MS is attributable to the inflammatory nature of the condition or to other related complications, such as depression, is still unclear.Thankfully, one of the best natural treatments for reducing MS symptoms is also a key step for preventing cardiovascular disease: exercise. According to the , exercise can help slow disease progression, minimize MS symptoms, and reduce the likelihood of associated comorbidities. Good news for ladies (and men) with MS hoping to live well and fend off cardiovascular trouble.Katie BrindAmour is a Certified Health Education Specialist and passionate health and wellness freelance writer.

28a543a7-d394-4d26-aa31-7b48e097cffb,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice At present there is no cure for MS but various treatments exist to manage the disease At present there is no cure for MS, but management of the disease includes drug treatments to treat acute inflammatory attacks (or relapses), medications that reduce the risk of further inflammatory relapses (disease modifying therapies) and treatments to slow disease progression. Then there are also therapies that alleviate and improve various symptoms. Successful management of MS also includes a healthy diet, exercise and rehabilitation. The following information should not be relied on to suggest a course of treatment for a particular individual, and it should not be used in place of a visit, call, consultation or the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare provider. MS relapses are caused by inflammation in the central nervous system that damages the myelin coating around nerve fibres. This damage slows or disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses and causes the symptoms of MS. Acute relapses are commonly treated with steroids, which can be given intravenously or orally for only a few days. The steroids work by damping down the inflammation that is causing demyelination. Steroids are not believed to have any long-term benefit on the course of disease, but they can be effective at: Steroids do not affect the outcome of a relapse, such as any difficulty or disability that someone might experience following a relapse Disease modifying treatments are not a cure for MS but aim to prevent or reduce the number of relapses that occur in relapsing-remitting MS. Drugs commonly used to modify the disease course in relapsing MS beta interferon-1a (Avonex): injected into a muscle once a week. beta interferon-1a (Rebif): injected under the skin three times a week. beta interferon-1b (Betaferon): injected under the skin every other day. beta interferon-1b (Extavia): injected under the skin every other day. glatiramer acetate (Copaxone or Brabio): injected under the skin daily, or three times a week at a higher dose. glatiramer acetate (generic): injected under the skin daily. peginterferon beta 1a (Plegridy): injected under the skin once every two weeks. cladribine (Mavenclad): pills taken for up to five consecutive days in the first month and for up to five consecutive days in the second month, with the same course repeated a year later. This may need to be repeated at some point in the future. dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera): taken as a capsule, twice daily. diroximel fumarate (Vumerity): taken as a capsule, twice daily. fingolimod (Gilenya): taken as a capsule, once daily. The first dose is taken under medical supervision to monitor heart rate and blood pressure. siponimod (Mayzent): approved to treat relapsing forms of MS and clinically isolated syndrome. It is taken as a tablet, once a day. So far, it has only been approved for use in the United States of America by the American Food and Drug Administration. teriflunomide (Aubagio): taken as a tablet, once daily. alemtuzumab (Lemtrada): taken as two treatment courses of intravenous infusions (IV or ‘drip’). The first course consists of intravenous infusions on five consecutive days. The second course is taken 12 months later and consists of intravenous infusions on three consecutive days. Some people may need a third or further infusion. ocrelizumab (Ocrevus): taken as an intravenous infusion, with a more intense course to start and then further infusions every six months. natalizumab (Tysabri): taken as an intravenous infusion via a drip once every four weeks. It is generally administered in a hospital infusion clinic by a qualified health professional. Drugs used to modify the disease course in progressive MS So far, only a few drugs have been approved specifically to treat progressive MS. In some countries, people with relapsing forms of MS who are initially treated with one of the above drugs and are subsequently diagnosed with secondary progressive MS, can continue with their existing treatment if they still experience relapses (a phase described as active secondary progressive MS). In other countries, however, being diagnosed with secondary progressive MS can act as a trigger to stop the individual from being prescribed with drugs approved for relapsing MS. ocrelizumab (Ocrevus): approved to treat .  Ocrelizumab is also an immune suppressing or modifying drug. In primary progressive MS it targets B cells. As above, it is taken as an intravenous infusion, with two half doses in the first month followed by further infusions every six months. In some countries (notably those in Europe) there is a more restrictive license that requires people with primary progressive MS to also have evidence of inflammatory activity. This evidence is collected through MRI scans. siponimod (Mayzent): approved to treat . As with the treatments above, siponimod is also an immune modifying drug, similar to fingolimod, but with further biological effects. It is taken as a tablet, once a day. So far, it has only been approved for use in the United States of America by the Food and Drug Administration. cladribine (Mavenclad): approved to treat relapsing forms of MS including Cladribine is taken as a tablet in two treatment courses, twelve months apart. diroximel fumarate (Vumerity): approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US to treat . It is taken as a capsule, twice daily. Other drugs that have been used to modify the disease course in MS In some countries, a number of other immune suppressing or modifying treatments are still used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis, although in many countries these have been replaced by the treatments above. They can be useful for some people with MS, such as for those with more severe or frequent relapses or for people whose MS is rapidly worsening. Neurologists and people with MS need to work together to balance the positive effects of the drugs against their potential adverse side effects. These drugs include: autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT): This is usually a disease modifying drug treatment  the transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells. It is typically available through clinical trials or as experimental medicine. People with MS experience a wide range of symptoms caused by damage to their central nervous system. A number of treatments have been tested for MS symptoms and there has been some progress for particular symptoms such as spasticity and gait problems. However, testing of treatments for use in other symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment has been unclear to date. Balancing treatment benefits with the risk of side effects is difficult in symptom management. For example, a treatment that improves spasticity and pain but worsens mobility may not be worth pursuing. Neurologists need to work closely with each person with MS to find appropriate treatments for that person’s symptoms. Other symptom management techniques such as rehabilitation, energy conservation and exercise also need to be considered. Aversa, Italy, 03/2012.

Then there are also therapies that alleviate and improve various symptoms. Successful management of MS also includes a healthy diet, exercise and rehabilitation. The following information should not be relied on to suggest a course of treatment for a particular individual, and it should not be used in place of a visit, call, consultation or the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare provider. MS relapses are caused by inflammation in the central nervous system that damages the myelin coating around nerve fibres. This damage slows or disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses and causes the symptoms of MS. Acute relapses are commonly treated with steroids, which can be given intravenously or orally for only a few days. The steroids work by damping down the inflammation that is causing demyelination. Steroids are not believed to have any long-term benefit on the course of disease, but they can be effective at: Steroids do not affect the outcome of a relapse, such as any difficulty or disability that someone might experience following a relapse Disease modifying treatments are not a cure for MS but aim to prevent or reduce the number of relapses that occur in relapsing-remitting MS.

ef0f7b1c-7edc-4c10-85f4-828c91c7b27d,"— Scientific proof now shows that the overall attitude you take toward yourself may help you manage multiple sclerosis. So why not shower yourself with love? Because now there is scientific proof that loving yourself may actually help your multiple sclerosis (MS). In a , researchers concluded that the quality of intimate relationships was strongly associated with self-concept and illness acceptance. This, they said, suggested that self-concept could be used to contribute to better outcomes for those with MS. While self-concept, the knowledge one has about themselves, is than self-esteem, the overall attitude one takes toward themselves can benefit those with MS. Read more: Vitamin D may help prevent, treat multiple sclerosis » One way to improve both self-esteem and self-concept is to shower yourself with love. Literally tell yourself how awesome you are, over and over, in a loving, positive way. In a that covered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Syrian refugees, patients with MS saw that self-esteem and satisfaction with life were after the use of repetitive positive reinforcement. In general, researchers in the PTSD study said Treatment by Repeating Phrases of Positive Thought, or TRPPT, had a positive effect on people with MS with life factors such as stress and anxiety. TRPPT also shows significant success in helping decrease depressive symptoms. By thinking positively, people who perceive stress as less threatening are able to cope with it more effectively, while people who think negatively do not expect things to go as planned and tend to anticipate bad outcomes. In addition, TRPPT is free, has no side effects or limits, and is even accessible in places like war-torn Syria. Read more: New drug to treat MS awaits FDA approval » Strategies like TRPPT could benefit people with MS in particular because studies indicate there are high levels of depression among people with the disease. One study looked at the first year after an MS diagnosis and the associated . Many people with MS chose to avoid the illness, pretending they were not sick. In addition, the study showed a high prevalence of depression. It also showed a reduction in quality of life as a result of lower self-concept and psychological well-being. According to one , there are two questions you need to ask to determine if you need a hug. During the past two weeks, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? During the past two weeks, have you often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things? Answering “Yes” to one or both of these questions could signify some depression, a common and serious emotion that should be discussed with your doctor. “When people struggle with physical discomfort, it’s not uncommon to experience feeling depressed or a lack of motivation. Especially with MS, when you don’t know exactly when the next flare-up will occur, it can be hard to keep your head up.” , PhD, a psychologist in Southern California, told Healthline. “Often people turn toward Band-Aid treatments such as medication or distractions such as overuse of television, social media, or not committing to the work they are meant to do. Instead, one can focus their efforts on strategies that increase their self-concept and self-worth which will naturally decrease depression.” Jones added. “Some of these strategies include: doing a daily gratitude journal, doing things a little out of your comfort zone, and sharing your vulnerability with others.” Read more: The effects of alcohol, coffee, and smoking on multiple sclerosis » Having MS can also affect your relationships — creating situations that may require people to seek professional help. One program based in Colorado, , is a relationship enrichment program that integrates information and resources of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society with marriage education. The National MS Society has a variety of to help flame the romance. One is to create rituals and traditions. Make it a habit to acknowledge and celebrate your relationship. Another is to find ways to express caring and appreciation in your relationship every day. It could be as simple as a gentle stroke on the cheek. Loving yourself can also help. Being positive can help traditional medicines due primarily to better adherence, while depression was associated with a lower likelihood of adherence. MS takes a lot of , according to a study at the University of Washington, and part of this is the ability to love oneself and to love others.

What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is caused by damage to tissues surrounding nerve fibers. () is a condition that results from damage to myelin, the tissues surrounding nerves of the brain and . Damage to the myelin is a result of an autoimmune disease in which the body produces an immune response against its own tissues. is more common in women than in men. Symptoms and signs of are extremely variable and range from mild to severe, and may include: Some people with MS may have no symptoms to mild symptoms; about 30% of those affected will have significant disability after 20-25 years with the condition. The average age of onset for MS is about 34 years of age; but children and teens also get the condition. There is no cure for MS, but disease-modifying drugs can reduce the symptoms, delay disability, and reduce progression of the condition as seen on . The body's immune system attacks nerve sheaths, causing multiple sclerosis.. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be thought of as an immune-mediated inflammatory process involving different areas of the () at various points in time. As the name suggests, the condition affects many areas of the central or CNS. Normal nerves are surrounded by a myelin sheath to insulate and protect them from damage. This sheath also allows effects how fast nerve signals get from the brain or spinal cord (CNS) to the affected body part. As this sheath is destroyed, the nerve conduction to that body area or part decreases or is interrupted completely. The destruction is caused by the body's immune system attacking the myelin sheath. The reason that the body's immune system attacks the sheath is not understood fully, but it is believed to be related to a combination of a genetic predisposition and acquired or environmental influences. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? The signs and symptoms of MS in adults, children, and teens are similar; however, children and teens with the disease (pediatric MS) also may have and complete that adults with MS do not experience. Moreover, symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis differ from person to person. Visual, sensory, and motor signs and symptoms are all part of MS; however, there is a wide range of symptoms that can appear. Some people have mild cases of MS with little or no disability over the years. Others have more severe types of MS, requiring confinement to a wheelchair or bed. Over 30% of those affected with MS will have a significant disability after 20 to 25 years. Still, others may live their entire lives symptom-free (some individuals without multiple sclerosis symptoms are found incidentally to have multiple sclerosis lesions by MRI or individuals in whom an examination of their brain after death unexpectedly reveals that they were affected by the disease). This variability makes it difficult in some cases to diagnose multiple sclerosis. Often the signs and symptoms are mistaken as being psychiatric in origin. 5 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis The of multiple sclerosis are often . Large number of people with multiple sclerosis develop optic neuritis (inflammation of the , which is an extension of the central nervous system), described as a painful vision loss. If a patient is diagnosed with optic neuritis early, treatment could change the course of the disease. Before the actual loss of vision, the patient may have visual changes described by many people as blurred or hazy vision, flashing lights, or alterations in color. The tissues around the eye and moving the eye may be painful. Most people recover over several months. Others are left with permanent visual defects. Double vision occurs when the eyes move in different directions and is another common symptom of multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis Pictures, Symptoms and Treatment What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis commonly affects the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for balance and fine motor coordination. Consequently, people with multiple sclerosis often have difficulty maintaining their balance when walking and performing delicate tasks with their hands. The unexplained dropping of a cup or other objects, or unusual weakness can occur. Electrical-type pain sensations in the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs There appears to be a relationship between multiple sclerosis, higher temperatures, and the worsening of symptoms. occur in about 5% of people with multiple sclerosis. Those with MS may complain of disturbances, , or may feel that they are experiencing changes in attention span or memory. Many symptoms of multiple sclerosis lead to other complications, such as infections of the bladder (urinary infections), kidney, or blood. Any area of the body can be involved, making this disease difficult to distinguish from other nervous system disorders. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis in Children and Teens (Pediatric MS)? The signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis in children and teens are similar to those experienced by adults; however, they also may have seizures and extreme or lethargy. Children with MS are considered to have the form of MS known as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. They process information from our environment and control voluntary muscle movements to allow the body to do certain things. When you touch something hot, for example, signals are sent from sensory nerve endings in your hand up long nerves in your arm, eventually reaching the spinal cord. From there, the signal is transferred up your spinal cord to your brain, where the information is processed. Your brain then sends a signal back down the spinal cord to the nerves in your arm. These nerves cause the muscles in your arm to contract, pulling your hand away from the heat. This system works efficiently, unless there is a disease process affecting the nerve pathways in the spinal cord and brain. MS is one of the diseases that can affect these pathways. The nerves in the body are covered by a fatty substance called myelin (myelin sheath). The myelin sheath insulates the nerves and allows them to transmit information to and from the brain in a fraction of a second. If the myelin is disrupted in any way, the transmitted information is not only delayed, but it may also be misinterpreted by the brain. This autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath leads to areas of (also known as plaques) in the brain and spinal cord. These plaques disrupt the transmission of information by nerves in the CNS and lead to the symptoms seen in MS. At What Age Can Multiple Sclerosis Start? Who Has MS? MS is more common in individuals of northern European descent. Women are more than twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men. Multiple sclerosis usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and the average age of onset is approximately 34 years. Multiple sclerosis can affect children and teens (pediatric MS). It has been estimated that 2%-5% of people with MS develop symptoms prior to age 18. What Is Multiple Sclerosis? MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Diagnosing multiple sclerosis is difficult. The vague and nonspecific nature of this disease mimics many other diseases. Doctors combine history, physical exam, laboratory work, and sophisticated medical imaging techniques to arrive at a diagnosis. More often than not, a specialist is required to make a diagnosis. Examples of tests and procedures used to diagnose MS include: A (), blood chemistry, , and often spinal fluid evaluation ( or “”) are all routine laboratory tests used to rule out other conditions and help confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. An MRI, which creates an image of the brain or the spinal cord, is used to search for changes within the brain or spinal cord that are unique to multiple sclerosis. What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? There are several treatment options for multiple sclerosis. Listed examples below are US FDA-approved drugs to treat multiple sclerosis. These are known as disease-modifying therapies for MS. Disease-modifying therapies have been found through clinical trials to reduce the number of relapses, delay the progression of disability, and limit new disease activity that is observed on MRI. Examples of drugs used to treat MS include: Beta interferons, for example: (Mavenclad) oral tablets is a drug used to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis; relapsing forms that include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults. Generally, cladribine is used in people with MS who have tried other that were not tolerated well or ineffective. People with clinically isolated syndrome not take cladribine. () is a agent that has been approved by the FDA to treat multiple sclerosis. Treatment with mitoxantrone requires monitoring of cardiac function, and there is a fixed limit to the dose that can be administered to patients. It also carries the long-term risk of . For these reasons, Novantrone is typically reserved for patients with more aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis. New research and treatment methods are currently being investigated and are expected to offer some hope to people with multiple sclerosis. In particular, new research studies have shown that skin patches containing myelin peptides may be a promising therapy. Consult your healthcare team for options. What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? In addition to drugs that target the disease process, other medications used to relieve certain symptoms of MS. Muscle relaxants, for example, () Selective reuptake inhibitor () The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, for example, (), (, Adcirca), and ) (, Staxyn ODT) What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? Most people with the form of MS progress to a stage where relapses become much less frequent, but they continue to accumulate disabling symptoms. This new phase of the disease is termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Symptoms of this type of MS are intermittent and worsen neurologic symptoms, which can last several days or weeks before returning to their original state of health. Some people, however, are left with residual deficits (residual disability) after some attacks. A few people have a form of MS. In this type, people have relapses superimposed on a pattern of continuous progression of disability. Rarely, people with multiple sclerosis have a pure progressive () forms of the disease. Their disability progresses in the absence of attacks over time. Most people with MS usually die from diseases such as or heart attacks, especially in those who are bedridden. Currently, there is no cure for multiple sclerosis. As of yet, no true way of preventing multiple sclerosis has been found. When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? The symptoms of multiple sclerosis are very variable and differ from patient to patient. They can also be confused with symptoms of many other conditions. You should talk with your physician if you or someone you know has any of the signs and symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis or if you have any concerning symptoms. Several of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be severe enough to send the patient to a hospital's emergency department. Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you have any of the following symptoms: Visual changes and painful eye movements. Optic neuritis, one of the most common early signs of multiple sclerosis, causes these symptoms. If you experience personality changes or sudden loss of strength in the arms and legs. These symptoms are common with multiple sclerosis, but they can also be signs of other serious diseases that require urgent treatment such as , infection, or chemical imbalances. Managing Symptoms of MS with Diet, Exercise, and Alternative Treatments Some people with MS explore alternative forms of therapy and treatments, including many who are already taking drugs for the disease. Some people with multiple sclerosis have benefited from: Restorative, maintenance, and preventive rehabilitation Talk to your healthcare team about alternative treatments for MS.

8e626ff9-49f8-45d9-a3a8-dcefad10ad50,"Everything You Need to Know About PPMS and the Workplace Medically reviewed by — — Having primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) can warrant adjustments to various aspects of your life, including your job. In severe cases, PPMS can make it challenging to work. According to an article in the , PPMS causes a higher likelihood of not being able to work compared with other forms of MS. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean you have to stop working altogether. Here are the answers to some of the most common work-related questions about PPMS. No. In fact, the suggests this is one of the most common mistakes made by those who’ve just received a diagnosis. Symptoms can progressively worsen with this type of MS, but this doesn’t necessarily mean you have to leave your job right away. Your doctor will offer guidance when it comes to your career and PPMS. If they feel that your job is unsafe for any reason, they will provide advice ahead of time. A self-assessment can be invaluable in making this decision. First list your job requirements along with what you bring to the table. Then make a list of your symptoms. See if any of your symptoms directly affect your ability to perform any of the work-related tasks you do on a regular basis. If you think PPMS symptoms are starting to interfere with your job, you might consider talking to your boss about modifying your role before leaving your career altogether. Do I need to disclose my condition to my employer? There is no legal requirement to disclose a PPMS diagnosis to your employer. You might be hesitant about disclosing, especially if you’ve just received a diagnosis. However, you could find that disclosing your condition will lead to accommodations you may need on the job. It’s against the law for an employer to discriminate or fire someone because of a disability — this includes PPMS. Weigh this decision carefully, and ask your doctor for advice. Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) not only prohibits discrimination based on disability, but also requires that employers provide reasonable accommodations. To gain accommodations, you’ll need to speak with your employer or a human resources representative at work. Some examples of workplace accommodations that may be helpful with PPMS include: add-ons to restrooms, such as grab bars and automatic dryers However, the ADA doesn’t require an employer to make changes that would cause any hardships. Examples include new job creation and providing a personal mobility device. Symptoms of PPMS such as severe fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairment may cause absenteeism. You may also need to miss part of your workday due to doctor’s appointments, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. PPMS causes more lesions on the spine than the brain compared to other forms of MS. This could mean you may be prone to more walking difficulties as the disease progresses. However, the precise timing of this varies, and not everyone will face walking difficulties. Physical therapy can help you maintain your ability to walk. So you may not face any challenges with work-related walking. Given the fact that PPMS can take a few years to accurately diagnose and that it’s progressive, you have likely already experienced symptoms while on the job. The rate of disability is higher with this form of MS, but early intervention may help slow an early onset. All in all, the effects on your job ultimately depend on the type of work you do, as well as the severity of your symptoms. A of MS patients in Norway found that about 45 percent still worked two decades after initially being diagnosed. Due to disability, the percentage of PPMS patients working was smaller, at about 15 percent. What are the best career options for people with PPMS? There are no particular careers best for people with PPMS. Your ideal career is one that you enjoy, have the skill sets for, and can perform comfortably. These can include a range of careers, from business to hospitality, service, and academia. Technically, no job is off-limits. The key is choosing a career you enjoy and that you feel safe doing. Quitting your job because of PPMS is a difficult decision, and is often a last resort after accommodations no longer help. People with PPMS commonly need social security disability insurance (SSDI) benefits. SSDI may help pay for basic living expenses if you can no longer work. Talk to your doctor about other resources that may be available to you if you can no longer work.

aa6439fb-43d6-41b3-89dd-3e37342b2613,"Published: April 03, 2010. Updated: April 03, 2010 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease, a non-contagious chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system which can present with a variety of neurological symptoms occurring in attacks or slowly progressing over time. The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is approximately 350,000 cases in the United States and more than 2.5 million worldwide. There are at least 10,000 newly diagnosed cases of MS annually. In northern Europe, continental North America, and Australasia, about one of every 1000 citizens suffers from multiple sclerosis, whereas in the Arabian peninsula, Asia, and continental South America, the frequency is much lower. In Sub-Saharan Africa, MS is extremely rare. With important exceptions, there is a North-South gradient in the Northern hemisphere and a South-North gradient in the Southern hemisphere, with very low frequencies near the equator (between latitudes 40 degrees North and 40 degrees South. Climate, diet, geomagnetism, toxins, sunlight, genetic factors, and infectious diseases have been discussed as possible reasons for these regional differences. It has been postulated that an environmental factor during childhood might play an important role for the development of MS later in life. This was based on several studies in migrants demonstrating that if migration occurs before the age of 15, the migrant acquires his new region’s susceptibility to MS. If migration takes place after 15, the migrant keeps the susceptibility of his home country. MS occurs mainly in the Caucasian race. It is 20-fold lower in the Inuits of Canada than in other Canadians living in the same region. It is also rare in the Native American tribes of North America, the Australian Aborigine and the Maoris of New Zealand. These few examples point out that the genetic background plays an important role in the development of MS (see below). As observed in many autoimmune disorders, MS is more common in females than males; the mean sex ratio is about two females for every male. In children, who rarely develop MS, the sex ratio may reach three females for each male, whereas MS occurring in the fifth decade more commonly affects males. Onset of symptoms usually occurs between 20 to 40 years of age, rarely below 15 or above 60, although both is possible. MS is not strictly a hereditary disease. However, MS is a disease influenced by a variety of factors, one of which is the genetic background of an individual. There is no single gene known to be responsible for MS, though a few genes have been demonstrated to increase the risk of development. Although these genes are of scientific interest and continue to play a part in research, they are not enough to diagnose an individual with MS. Overall, an average one of every 25 siblings of an individual with MS will also be afflicted. Up to every second identical twin of a MS-affected person will develop MS, but only one of 20 fraternal twins. If one parent is affected by MS, only about 1 of 40 of his children will develop MS later in life. There also seems to be an association with specific HLA antigens (HLA-DR2). The ultimate cause of MS is unknown. It is hypothesised that a viral infection or other environmental factor in childhood might prime the immune system for an abnormal reaction later in life. On a molecular level, there might be a structural similarity between an unidentified infectious agent and components of the central nervous system, causing confusion in the immune system later in life (a process called “molecular mimicry”). However, so far there is no known “MS virus”. Certainly MS is not an infectious disease and not contagious. The importance of genetic factors has been discussed above. It is widely accepted that a special subset of white blood cells, called T cells, play a key role in the development of MS. Under normal circumstances, these lymphocytes can distinguish between self and non-self. In a person with MS, however, these cells recognize healthy parts of the central nervous system as foreign, and attack them as they would a virus. In MS, the part of the nervous system primarily attacked is myelin. Myelin is a fatty substance that covers the axons of nerve cells, and which is important for proper nerve conduction. Normally, there is a tight barrier between blood and brain, called the blood-brain barrier (BBB), built up of endothelial cells lining the blood vessel walls. Lymphocytes (blue) surrounding blood vessel (center) within MS lesionIn MS, the BBB breaks down; autoreactive T cells cross the BBB and trigger an inflammatory process, also mediated by other immune cells, such as cytokines and antibodies. Due to this abnormal behavior of the immune system, MS is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The inflammatory process finally leads to a destruction of myelin called demyelination. Repair processes, called remyelination, also play an important role. This is one of the reasons why, especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms tend to decrease or disappear temporarily after days to months. Nevertheless, axonal damage and irreversible loss of neurons occur early during the course of the disease. However, due to its plasticity the brain can often compensate for some portion of the damage. MS symptoms develop as a result of multiple lesions in the brain and spinal cord, and can vary greatly between different individuals, depending on where the lesions occur. In general, relapses tend to occur more frequently during spring and summer than during autumn and winter. Infections like the common cold, influenza or unspecific diarrhea increase the risk for a relapse. In contrast, influenza vaccination is safe and does not trigger relapses as demonstrated in several recent studies. It can therefore be recommended for MS patients, especially for those at risk for influenza (e.g. healthcare workers). Tetanus vaccination is considered to be safe as well, although so far it has not been studied in that respect. In general, vaccinations with living, attenuated viruses increase the risk of relapses. Pregnancy can directly effect the susceptibility for relapse. The last three months of pregnancy offers a natural protection against relapses, whereas during the first few months after pregnancy, especially during the first six weeks, the risk for a relapse is increased 20-40%. According to current knowledge, pregnancy doesn’t seem to influence long term disability. MS does not increase the risk of bearing a handicapped child. Statistically, there is no good evidence for triggering of relapses through trauma or operations. In principle, surgical procedures require no special precautions if not dictated by existing disability. Participation in sports is possible, although extremes, such as marathon running, should probably be avoided. Emotional stress may cause a relapse, although study data has been inconsistent. Heat can transiently increase symptoms, in something known as Uhthoff’s phenomenon. This is why some patients avoid saunas or even hot showers. However, heat is not an established trigger of relapses. Extensive exposure to the sun should be avoided, since ultraviolet radiation is a strong stimulus for the immune system. Currently there are no clinically established laboratory investigations available to predict prognosis or therapeutic response, although promising approaches have been undertaken that need further confirmation, such as treatments based on the two antibodies anti-MOG and anti-MBP, and TRAIL, a TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand. In most cases MS starts with an acute flare-up of symptoms within hours to days, called a relapse, exacerbation, bout, episode, or attack. Inflammation of an optic nerve (optic neuritis), causing painfulness of eye movement and visual deterioration frequently is the first symptom. However, not all patients with optic neuritis develop MS. Sensory disturbances such as numbness or tingling sensations are other frequent initial symptoms. In principle, MS can start with any of the symptoms mentioned in the section above. Especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms frequently decrease or resolve spontaneously within days to months. Therefore, this disease course is called relapsing remitting. New relapses can occur within weeks to many years and can include formerly experienced and/or new symptoms. However, MRI studies have shown that nerve damage can continue in relapsing remitting patients even if symptoms subside. It has long been known that “MS never sleeps”. This highlights the importance of preventive treatment if and when it is available. In many cases, the disease course changes after several years and symptoms start to deteriorate slowly with or without superimposed relapses. This course is called secondary chronic-progressive, or just secondary progressive. However, some patients stay in a relapsing remitting course for the rest of their lives. About 10% of all MS-affected individuals experience chronic progression without relapses from onset of symptoms. This course is called primary progressive and frequently comes along with weakness of the legs, gait and bladder disturbances. Degenerative processes and not inflammation are thought to play the most important role in this clinical disease course. Chronic progression from onset of symptoms with superimposed relapses is referred to as relapsing progressive. MS is suspected in a female, between 15 and 60 years old and usually of Northern European, Northern US or Canadian descent. Affected individuals may experience a wide variety of symptoms, such as vision loss, double vision, nystagmus, difficulty with speech, various kinds of tremor, clumsiness of the hands, unsteady gait, weakness, spasticity, numbness, and bladder (urgency, hesitancy), bowel, as well as sexual dysfunction. Various cognitive impairments are also common, such as difficulty performing multiple tasks at once, difficulty following detailed instructions, loss of short term memory, depression, and fatigue. Symptoms and signs may partially disappear after a few days or weeks. MS plaques appear hyperintense on T2 weighted studies. They usually are oval in shape, and appear in the periventricular region or corpus callosum. Detection of gadolinium enhancement can help differentiate active from chronic lesions and could help in establishing the temporal dissemination of the disease on follow up. A lumbar puncture, which is a procedure done to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, is useful for providing evidence of chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, often indicated by oligoclonal banding. Nerve conduction studies of optic, sensory and motor nerves can provide further evidence for MS, as the process of demyelination results in reduced nerve conduction velocities. The diagnostic process is completed by several laboratory tests to exclude other diseases that can mimic MS, such as Sarcoidosis, Vasculitis, and Lyme disease). A definite diagnosis of MS requires evidence for dissemination of lesions within the central nervous system both in space and in time. This means that not only must there exist evidence of at least two distinct lesions, verifiable by clinical symptoms or by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), there must also be evidence of an occurrence of new symptoms or lesions within a time interval of at least 30 days. Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is made using the 2005 revised McDonald diagnostic criteria [1]: Generally speaking, three parameters are used to assess the diagnosis. An attack refers to an episode of neurological disturbance that has lasted for at least 24 hours. This is usually a subjective report by the patient and should be backed by objective findings. A clinical lesion refers to a neurological lesion detected by history and physical examination. A paraclinical lesion refers to a lesion that is detected by MRI, evoked response testing or urodynamic studies. In addition to the assessment of the three parameters discussed above, the criteria require that evidence for dissemination of lesions in both space (spatial dissemination) and time (temporal dissemination). 2005 revised McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + two clinical lesions (spatial dissemination) Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + one clinical lesion + one paraclinical lesion (spatial dissemination). One attack + one clinical lesion + evidence of spatial dissemination by MRI, CSF + evidence of temporal dissemination by MRI or evidence of second clinical attack. One year of disease progression + two of the following There is no known definitive cure for multiple sclerosis. However, several drugs have proven to be effective in its treatment. Intensive research is underway to study a variety of promising new drugs. Treatment is aimed at maintaining a maximum quality of life. Physiotherapy plays an important role. There are three primary forms of medication used to treat the symptoms: During an exacerbation, corticosteroids (such as prednisone or methylprednisolone) used at high dosages (500 mg - 2 g per day intravenously for a course of 3 to 5 days) can accelerate regression of symptoms. Subsequent tapering with pills may be reasonable in certain cases. There is clear evidence that sole treatment with oral steroids at dosages of 100 mg per day or less and subsequent tapering is inferior to intravenous high dose treatment. In principle, steroid treatment during pregnancy is possible. There is no good evidence that corticosteroids influence longterm outcome. Long-term treatment can influence the course of the disease: Interferon-beta1a or beta1b (Avonex; Betaseron [in Europe Betaferon]; Rebif) has been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Interferon-beta is a cytokine that under natural conditions is produced by the body during viral infections; as a drug it is extracted either from special mammalian cells or special bacteria. All preparations must be injected into either muscle or skin every second day to once per week, depending on the preparation. Attempts to develop pills containing Interferon-beta have not been successful so far. Some of the interferons have been proven to be effective not only in relapsing remitting MS, but also in secondary progressive MS, as long as superimposed relapses occur. Main side effects include flu-like symptoms which tend to decrease during ongoing therapy and which can be alleviated, for example, by paracetamol or ibuprofen. Another frequent side effect is inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site if Intereferon-beta is injected into the skin. Regular blood monitoring is required. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) has also been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Concerning its therapeutic effect it is approximately comparable to Interferon-beta. Glatiramer acetate consists of synthetic peptides made of four different amino acids, which are basic modules of all proteins in the human body. Once per day must be injected into the skin. Attempts to develop pills containing glatiramer acetate have also been unsuccessful. Copaxone is effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS. So far, beneficial effects in secondary progressive MS have not been convincingly demonstrated. Main side effects include inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site, and a rare but transient and perturbing “post-injection” reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, breathlessness, and anxiety. A post-injection reaction does not require discontinuation of therapy. In general, Copaxone is considered to cause fewer side effects than Interferon-beta. However, most MS patients injecting Interferon-beta also tolerate their therapy well. Regular blood monitoring is required. Azathioprine is an agent available as a pill approved for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS in some countries. However, its effectiveness has not been proven as stringently as for the interferons and glatiramer acetate, and an effect in secondary progressive MS has not been demonstrated. In general, it is well tolerated. After longtime therapy the risk of cancer increases slightly (after 10 years of therapy about fourfold). Regular blood monitoring is required. There is some evidence that immunoglobulins (antibodies) are effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, a large clinical trial (PRIVIG) is presently continuing. Immunoglobulins have not been proven to be effective in secondary progressive MS. The currently most effective drug in the preventive treatment of MS is Mitoxantrone. It has been proven to be effective in relapsing remitting and in secondary progressive MS. In most cases it is administered every three months intravenously. Therapy with Mitoxantrone is generally well tolerated, however, since with ongoing therapy the risk for damage of the heart muscle increases, at an average Mitoxantrone can only be administered for 3 to 4 years. This is why Mitoxantrone is only used in cases of rapid disease progression. Mitoxantrone treatment requires monitoring of the heart function during therapy. Regular blood monitoring is required. With these precautions Mitoxantrone treatment is safe. A family of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the statins, have shown anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of MS. However, so far there has not been provided sufficient evidence that statins are beneficial in the treatment of human MS patients with normal cholesterol levels. Recently, scientists found women who took vitamin D supplements were 40% less likely to develop multiple sclerosis than women who did not take supplements. However, this study does not allow to conclude that vitamin D has a beneficial influence on ongoing MS. Furthermore it could not distinguish between a beneficial effect of vitamin D and multivitamin drugs including vitamin E and various B vitamins which may also exert a protective effect. Primary progressive MS is very difficult to treat. High dose corticosteroids every three months can show some effect. In principle, there is no efficient preventive treatment for primary progressive MS available. Symptomatic therapy as described in the next paragraph and physiotherapy play an important role. A variety of medications are used to treat symptoms without influencing the inflammatory nature of the disease (symptomatic treatment): Baclofen and tizanidine can be useful against spasticity. There is no convincing evidence that cannabinoids (marijuana) can improve spasticity. The anticonvulsant drugs Gabapentin and Carbamazepine and the antidepressant amitriptyline can improve pain and tingling sensations in certain cases. SSRIs be used for depression, as well as for fatigue. Fatigue can also be influenced by amantadine and modafinil. There is also treatment for bladder disturbances available which is effective in many cases. Examples are oxybutynin and trospium chloride. Treatment with sildenafil (Viagra) or similar substances can improve male erectile dysfunction in many cases. Additional treatment options include plasmapheresis (“washing the blood”, showing similarities to dialysis) for severe, non-steroidresponsive relapses. Because of improved treatment for complications such as lung and bladder infections, the life expectancy of those diagnosed with MS is only slightly reduced. The earlier in life disease onset occurs, the slower disability progresses. This is due to more frequent chronic progressive courses with faster accumulation of disability when onset occurs at a higher age. Disability after 5 years correlates well with disability after 15 years: 2/3 of MS patients with low disability after 5 years will not markedly deteriorate during the next ten years. Further MS cases in the family do not influence disease progression. 1 of 3 patients will still be able to work after 15-20 years. Visual loss as the initial symptom is a marker for a rather good prognosis; gait disturbance, weakness or numbness for a rather poor prognosis. Rapid regression of initial symptoms, age at onset below 35, only a single symptom at onset, rapid development of initial symptoms and short duration of the last relapse indicate a good prognosis. When the initial disease course is relapsing remitting, the statistical duration until a wheelchair is needed, is 20 years. This means that many MS patients will never need a wheelchair. If the disease course is primary progressive then a wheelchair at an average will be needed after 6 to 7 years. It has to be noted that most of this longterm data was acquired before the advent of modern immunomodulatory drugs about 10 years ago, which have been shown to delay disease progression over a period of several years.

Obesity can lead to severe brain pressure disorder Around 2.3 million worldwide are affected by MS (multiple sclerosis). According to MSSI (a society for MS people in India), there are 2 lakh MS people in India. Unlike a migraine, epilepsy and brain stroke, MS is quite uncommon in India. Not many people are aware of MS due to lack of awareness about the condition.Dr Sudhir Kumar, Senior Consultant Neurologist, Institute of Neurosciences, Hyderabad, explains in detail about what is MS and the causes of multiple sclerosis. Also Read - Low fitness levels can up your risk of developing psoriasis Also Read - Genes linked to common brain disorder, Chiari 1 malformation, identified is a disease of the Central Nervous System that affects the brain, spinal and optic nerve. It is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies attack the nerves in the brain, spinal cord and eyes. It usually affects people in the age group of 10 – 16 years. However, young women in their 20s and 30s are at a high risk. Compared to men, MS is more common in women and it can affect people up to the age of 60 years. The exact cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. As said earlier, MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune cells attack the myelin sheath, a fatty substance that coats the nerve cells and helps in transmitting the impulse and stimuli to and from the brain. As a result, it can affect the functioning of the brain, spinal cord and optic. This is the reason, loss of coordination and balance and loss of vision in either one or both the eyes are one of the common symptoms of MS. Also, the symptoms might vary from person to person. Read more on As people suffering from this disease usually suffer from repeated attacks, hence the name ‘multiple’ sclerosis. There are periods of relapse and remission meaning, the symptoms might get better for some time but can come back from time to time. Also, in some cases, the condition is progressive which means that the symptoms worsen gradually over time. However, it can also turn into a debilitating condition in few cases, where the symptoms tend to worsen with no time. Hence, the condition of a person with MS is quite unpredictable. It is seen that with treatment the relapse of MS can be prolonged and the severity might be reduced. Also read about .

989f887f-2454-437a-bbeb-749abb921d96,"The FDA has approved Vumerity, a new drug to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Experts say Vumerity is effective and has fewer side effects than current medications. Biogen has set the annual price of Vumerity at $88,000, drawing criticism from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Biogen has released the annual price it will charge for a new oral treatment for relapsing forms of . The company said the price for Vumerity will be $88,000 per year. The company sent a statement to Healthline saying it is taking steps to make sure the drug is affordable for customers. “Biogen will work to maximize patient access to Vumerity through their insurance benefits, including potential value-based agreements with payers based on real-world patient outcomes,” the statement read. Biogen and Alkermes plc the approval of by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late October, making it the 18th FDA-approved treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The announced price tag brought quick criticism from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “Vumerity is an efficacious and tolerable treatment option for people with relapsing MS, but being priced only $500 lower than the least expensive oral disease modifying treatment does not show the commitment to affordable access that we had hoped,” Bari Talente, executive vice president, advocacy, National MS Society, said in a . She noted the price of Tecfidera, another Biogen treatment for MS, has risen $40,000 to almost $95,000 since it debuted in 2013. “We urge Biogen to publicly commit to keeping price increases lower than the rate of inflation,” Talente said. Vumerity is expected to be similar in results to but with fewer side effects. “Both drugs use a unique mechanism of action that is not offered by other treatments,” , a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center in Maryland and the vice president of healthcare access for , told Healthline. Past has shown that Tecfidera has success on multiple sclerosis with a 53 percent reduction of relapses, 38 percent reduction in the likelihood of disability progression, and 90 percent reduction on active contrast MRI lesions. However, “Tecfidera has bad side effects, especially in the beginning,” noted Costello. “Vumerity is different and has less gastrointestinal problems.” Costello explained that people with uncomfortable side effects may not adhere to a treatment. Considered a follow-up drug to Tecfidera, doctors predict better adherence with Vumerity due to the fewer side effects. The active ingredient in Vumerity is diroximel fumarate, which is rapidly converted to monomethyl fumarate in the body. Tecfidera is a dimethyl fumarate and also converts to monomethyl fumarate. “[The drugs] become identical in what they do in the body. But, how they get there is different,” explained Costello. “We expect Vumerity to provide the same benefits as Tecfidera, but we are waiting [on] results,” , neurologist at Missouri Baptist Medical Center in St. Louis, a trial site for the EVOLVE-MS study, told Healthline. Singer is also the director and founder of . “The research I presented at ECTRIMS in September 2019 showed approximately 30 percent of those on Vumerity had gastrointestinal side effects but less than 1 percent discontinue due to this side effect,” Singer told Healthline. “The full results from the EVOLVE-MS trials are pending.” Vumerity is approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS, and active secondary progressive MS. It’s not approved for primary progressive or secondary progressive MS that’s not active. But, “it may work for other forms of MS,” said Costello. “We want the DMTs to be a positive experience,” Singer said. “Vumerity provides another option for MS.” The drug’s warning label does include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) as a possible risk. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy. Gastrointestinal issues are common but not to the extent with Tecfidera. Other warnings are allergies, liver damage, and low white blood cell count. “There are very rare cases of PML with Tecfidera in MS patients with very low lymphocytes (white blood cell type) for numerous months in patients over age 50. Simple blood counts should be done to monitor,” said Singer. “The goal with Vumerity is to achieve success of Tecfidera with better tolerability,” explained Singer. Biogen offers customer-assisted programs to help reduce or eliminate costs. Costello explained that both Tecfidera and Vumerity have a unique mechanism of action, unlike any other drug. This provides people with options and different ways to reduce inflammation with MS. Treatment choices are up to doctors and their patients making a shared decision. Costello suggests talking about goals, risk tolerance, monitoring, and your ability to adhere to a specific treatment. “The disease, plus the person’s goals and values, is the conversation that drives the medication choice,” said Costello.

Following cell surface binding, ocrelizumab selectively depletes CD20-expressing B-cells through antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis. The precise mechanisms through which ocrelizumab exerts its therapeutic clinical effects in multiple sclerosis are not known but involve immunomodulation through the reduction in the number and function of CD20-expressing Bcells. Components of MS pathology potentially affected by this mechanism include reductions in: auto-antigen presentation, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, production of autoantibodies, and formation of meningeal lymphoid follicle-like structures. Ocrelizumab affects cell types in the middle of the B-cell lineage, including pre-B cells, mature and memory B cells, but not lymphoid stem cells or plasma cells. The capacity for B cell reconstitution and preexisting humoral immunity are thought to be preserved. The average half-life of ocrelizumab in the body is approximately 28 days. Following administration, B-cells are rapidly depleted and can remain undetectable for a prolonged and variable period of time ranging from 6 months to more than 12 months. Q: How can we apply prior experience with rituximab? Significant anecdotal off-label experience with rituximab has accumulated in large MS centers around the world including the Mellen Center, for treating both MS and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Uncontrolled case series have reported excellent efficacy and safety when rituximab has been used to treat MS. Though ocrelizumab targets the same immunologic mechanism and is administered in a similar fashion to rituximab, ocrelizumab is a different antibody. In vitro characterization of ocrelizumab demonstrated enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and reduced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) as compared with rituximab. Ocrelizumab binds to a different, but overlapping, epitope of the extracellular domain of CD20 as compared with rituximab. As of March 2017, ocrelizumab is FDA approved to treat relapsing and primary progressive forms of MS. Ocrelizumab is an infrequently administered intravenous medication, given in the outpatient (office or hospital-based infusion room) setting. In Phase III studies of RRMS, ocrelizumab was administered as follows: Followed by ocrelizumab 600mg IV x 1 every 6 months In a Phase III study of ocrelizumab in PPMS, total dose and frequency was similar to the above protocol except follow-up doses every 6 months were divided as 300mg IV each separated by 14 days. The efficacy of ocrelizumab was demonstrated in two double-blind, double-dummy, Phase 3 studies (OPERA I and OPERA II) evaluating the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab vs IFN beta1a SC in adult patients with RRMS. In those studies, treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the relapse rate vs IFN beta-1a by 46% in OPERA I (p<0.0001) and by 47% in OPERA II (p<0.0001). Ocrelizumab treatment also significantly reduced the time to onset of disability progression vs IFN beta-1a, and suppressed new T2 lesions (by 77% in OPERA I and 83% in OPERA II) and gadolinium-enhancing lesions (by 94% in OPERA I and 95% in OPERA II). We do not anticipate restricting use of ocrelizumab to patients who have experienced breakthrough disease on other disease modifying therapies. Ocrelizumab was evaluated for efficacy in PPMS in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled Phase 3 trial (ORATORIO). A total of 732 patients were randomized to receive ocrelizumab 600 mg IV or placebo every 24 weeks. Treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability sustained for ≥12 weeks (as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale) by 24% compared with placebo (p=0.0321). Ocrelizumab also significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability sustained for ≥24 weeks by 25% vs placebo (p=0.0365). Subgroup analyses of patients in ORATORIO with (n=193) vs without gadolinium-enhancing lesions (n=533) at baseline showed that efficacy tended to be stronger in patients with baseline gad enhancement (HR for disability progression 0.65, 95% CI 0.40, 1.06) than without gad enhancement (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62, 1.13). This result is consistent with the results of other disease modifying therapies tested in PPMS, the common theme of which is that younger patients and those with evidence of active inflammation in the form of new T2 or gadoliniumenhancing lesions are the most likely to benefit from therapy. Q: What are the major adverse effects of ocrelizumab: The most common adverse events observed in the Phase III studies of ocrelizumab were mildto-moderate infusion-related reactions. The incidence of adverse events, including serious infections, was similar between ocrelizumab and placebo. Particular events of interest: Mild to moderate infusion reactions were observed in approximately 25% of patients at the time of first infusion. Moderate infusion reaction was defined as requiring minor local or noninvasive management (usually additional medication or change in infusion rate). The incidence of infusion reactions decreased substantially with subsequent infusions in the clinical trials (to 10% or less). Infusion reactions may typically include itching. Severe infusion reactions (requiring urgent medical management) occurred very rarely in the clinical trials. Ocrelizumab must be administered in physician office or inpatient setting by nurses who have experience and qualification to infuse the drug, under supervision by physicians who have experience managing infusion reactions. The rate of common infections was similar between ocrelizumab and placebo or Rebif, with upper respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, occurring each up to 15% of the time in ocrelizumab vs. 10% of the time in the placebo group. No opportunistic infections were identified. Ocrelizumab should not be utilized in patients with active acute or chronic infections. Ocrelizumab might reactivate Hepatitis B infection. For this reason checking for Hepatitis B infection prior to initiating ocrelizumab is important. Neoplasms occurred rarely across all treatment arms in all 3 Phase III clinical trials. The rates of events overall are consistent with what is expected in an MS patient population. Breast cancer occurred in 6 of 781 females treated with ocrelizumab and none of the 668 females treated with interferon beta 1a or placebo. Longer-term data are required to effectively assess the impact of ocrelizumab on rates of malignancy. We recommend patients adhere to usual age-appropriate malignancy screening recommendations. Infusion reactions are expected related to the mechanism of action of ocrelizumab (cytolysis), and those standard infusion reactions may be differentiated from those with features of mast cell or basophil activation (signifying potential progression to anaphylaxis). Features such as itching cannot be used to differentiate between the two. Patients who develop a non-life-threatening mild to moderate SIR can usually be managed by temporary discontinuation of drug infusion alone. Once all symptoms have resolved, most patients will tolerate a slower infusion rate (one-half the rate at which the reaction occurred) with additional antihistamines plus acetaminophen. Patients with even mild symptoms of mast cell/basophil activation (eg, urticaria and dyspnea) should in most cases not resume infusion or be retreated, because reexposure to the causative agent could result in a fulminant and severe anaphylaxis. No definitive guidance is available on the effect of ocrelizumab on pregnancy. Theoretically, the drug could pass to the fetus and have an effect on the fetus. We will counsel woman to use effective contraceptive methods while on ocrelizumab and wait at least 5 months (based on the half-life of the drug) since their last ocrelizumab infusion before attempting to conceive. Q: Should we monitor CD19 counts in a patient on ocrelizumab? We do not expect to routinely monitor B-cell (CD19) counts in patients receiving ocrelizumab or altering the administration schedule based on CD19 counts. The return of B-cells may affect some patients’ abilities to receive other therapies after ocrelizumab, so checking CD19 counts may occasionally be useful to monitor the return of B-cells after treatment. Q: Is any routine monitoring required for patients on ocrelizumab? We routinely check MRI scans of the brain at least every 12 months in patients on therapies for both safety and efficacy monitoring. Q: Is PML a concern in patients treated with ocrelizumab? Although no cases of PML related to ocrelizumab have been reported in MS patients, the experience is limited to patients enrolled in clinical trials. There have been cases of PML reported in association with rituximab therapy in other diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, there may be other rare complications of rituximab in MS patients which has not yet been recognized. Live vaccines should be avoided for patients within 6 months of any ocrelizumab infusion, potentially longer based on B-cell reconstitution. Because rituximab may reduce the generation of new antibodies, the efficacy of vaccines is probably reduced during rituximab therapy. Therefore, clinically indicated vaccines should be given one month or more before starting rituximab. If vaccines are needed during rituximab treatment, they ideally should be given about 1 month prior to the next treatment course. An ongoing study will assess the effectiveness of standard vaccines in patients being treated with ocrelizumab. Kappos L, Li D, Calabresi PA, et al.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS is the most common type, and typical symptoms include sensory disturbances, Lhermitte sign, motor weakness, optic neuritis, impaired coordination, and fatigue. The course of disease is highly variable. The diagnosis is clinical and involves two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Symptom exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for patients with acute, significant symptoms. Disease-modifying agents should be initiated early in the treatment of MS to forestall disease and preserve function. Two immunomodulatory agents (interferon beta and glatiramer) and five immunosuppressive agents (fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, and mitoxantrone) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MS, each with demonstrated effectiveness and unique adverse effect profiles. Symptom management constitutes a large part of care; neurogenic bladder and bowel, sexual dysfunction, pain, spasticity, and fatigue are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach to improve quality of life. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in young adults. The prevalence varies by geographic region, ranging from 110 cases per 100,000 persons in the northern United States to 47 per 100,000 in the southern United States. Women, smokers, and persons residing at higher latitudes or with a family history of MS are at increased risk of disease. Those with increased exposure to sunlight and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are at decreased risk. Total costs associated with MS may exceed $50,000 per person annually.  Enlarge     Print Multiple sclerosis is a clinical diagnosis requiring two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space.

For information about the SORT evidence rating system, go to Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The most common type of MS is relapsing remitting MS . In the acute attack, T cells, B cells, and macrophages interact with adhesion molecules on blood vessel surfaces to traverse a blood-brain barrier weakened by matrix metalloproteinases. Once through, T cells and B cells release inflammatory mediators and immunoglobulins targeting the myelin sheath, while macrophages expose axonal surfaces and release harmful nitrous oxygen and oxygen free radicals. This cascade of events leads to demyelination and axonal injury.  Enlarge     Print Discrete attacks that evolve over days to weeks, followed by some degree of recovery over weeks to months; the patient has no worsening of neurologic function between attacks Initial relapsing remitting disease, followed by gradual neurologic deterioration not associated with acute attacks Primary progressive and progressive relapsing (10% of cases) Characterized by steady functional decline from disease onset; these types cannot be distinguished during early stages until attacks occur (progressive relapsing) or fail to occur (primary progressive); progressive relapsing is rarer than primary progressive *—Develops in about 50% of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.

CNS pathologies to consider include other inflammatory, demyelinating, or degenerative diseases; infections; neoplasms; and migraines. Genetic diseases, nutritional deficiencies, and psychiatric diseases may also present in a manner similar to MS. The diagnosis of MS should be questioned in the presence of abrupt/transient symptoms, prominent cortical features (seizures, aphasia), peripheral neuropathy, and other organ (cardiac, hematologic) involvement, because these are not typical of MS.  Enlarge     Print Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care MS is a clinical diagnosis.

In addition to MRI, evoked potentials (visual, auditory, and somatosensory) may provide objective evidence of deficits consistent with MS. Visual evoked potentials are especially helpful for persons with vision-related symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid may be obtained, although this is not routinely recommended; analysis typically demonstrates oligoclonal bands and an increased immunoglobulin G concentration.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS; infections and stress may play a role. For those with significant, acute symptoms, corticosteroids are the treatment of choice and have strong evidence of benefit. Although parenteral steroids build up to peak concentrations faster than oral preparations, a Cochrane review indicates no difference in effectiveness (as measured by clinical or radiologic markers) or safety between oral and parenteral preparations. If the disease is unresponsive to steroids, plasmapheresis may be performed. Plasma exchanges are relatively well tolerated and are usually performed every other day for 14 days. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The goal of disease-modifying therapy is to forestall disease, preserve function, and sustain healthy immune function while suppressing the T-cell autoimmune cascade thought to be responsible for demyelination and axonal damage. Early treatment at or before the diagnosis of clinically confirmed MS may delay damage to the CNS.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved seven agents for the treatment of MS: interferon beta, glatiramer (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), natalizumab (Tysabri), and mitoxantrone . Because of the chronic nature and evolving treatment of MS, disease-modifying treatment is typically managed by a neurologist with expertise in prescribing these potentially toxic agents.  Enlarge     Print Disease-Modifying Agents for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Injection site reactions (e.g., edema, inflammation, pain); influenza-like symptoms; leukopenia; elevated liver enzyme levels; depression and suicidal thoughts (increased with preexisting depression, neutralizing antibodies) Decrease in progression: RR = 0.69; (0.55 to 0.87) Injection site reactions, facial flushing, chest tightness, palpitations Decrease in disability at two years: MD = 0.33; (0.08 to 0.58) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.18 vs. 0.40 Bradycardia (contraindicated in recent heart disease or arrhythmia); elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression at two years: HR = 0.70; (0.55 to 0.87) Melanoma, macular edema, herpes encephalitis (only occurs at higher doses) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.37 vs. 0.54 Alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, decreased white blood cell count, elevated liver enzyme levels, peripheral neuropathy Decrease in progression: HR = 0.76; (0.51 to 0.97) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.17 vs. 0.36 Flushing, abdominal pain, lymphocytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression: HR = 0.62; (0.44 to 0.87) Infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Decrease in progression at two years: RR = 0.74; (0.62 to 0.89) Myelosuppression, elevated liver enzyme levels, decreased cardiac function, leukemia Decrease in progression: OR = 0.30; (0.09 to 0.99) HR = hazard ratio; MD = mean difference; OR = odds ratio; RR = relative risk. *—Estimated retail price of treatment for one year based on information obtained at .

Interferon beta, an immunomodulatory agent with more than 20 years of safety data, is effective in decreasing exacerbations and the progression of relapsing remitting MS. Interferon beta is available in three injectable formulations. Common adverse effects include local reactions and influenza-like symptoms. Interferon treatment may be associated with suicidal thoughts, so other agents should be considered in patients with depression. Glatiramer is an alternative immunomodulatory daily injection for relapsing remitting MS with a good safety record. Glatiramer decreases relapse and progression of disability at two years. Common adverse effects include local and systemic injection reactions (e.g., chest tightness, palpitations). Glatiramer should be avoided in persons with known hypersensitivity to this agent. Fingolimod is the first oral agent that is FDA approved for disease modification in relapsing remitting MS. A study of 1,272 patients between 18 and 55 years of age with relapsing remitting MS compared fingolimod with placebo, and demonstrated a decrease in annual exacerbations and progression of disease at two years. Bradycardia is a known adverse effect; patients should be observed for six hours after taking their first dose, and the medication is contraindicated in those with recent heart disease or arrhythmia. The FDA has approved two additional oral agents. Teriflunomide, approved in September 2012, has been shown to decrease relapse rates compared with placebo. Adverse effects include elevated transaminase levels, alopecia, and diarrhea. Teriflunomide carries an FDA warning for hepatic toxicity. Dimethyl fumarate, approved in March 2013, has been shown to decrease relapses and disease progression. Adverse effects include flushing, abdominal pain, decreased lymphocyte counts, and elevated transaminase levels. All of these oral agents suppress the immune system and put patients at risk of opportunistic infections. Because of this, these agents are typically used when the disease does not respond to, or the patient is unable to tolerate, an immunomodulatory agent. Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are immunosuppressive agents reserved for disease that does not respond to first-line agents. Although both are effective, natalizumab carries an FDA warning for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and mitoxantrone carries a warning for cardiotoxicity. Ongoing trials are evaluating the effectiveness and safety of additional agents in the treatment of MS to include the injectable daclizumab and oral cladribine and siponimod. Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multidisciplinary treatment of primary and associated symptoms is essential in enhancing the quality of life in younger and older patients with MS. More than 70% of patients with MS have urinary tract dysfunction, with 10% demonstrating urinary symptoms at initial diagnosis. Urinary dysfunction can be classified as failure to store or empty, and can be differentiated with postvoid residual testing. Failure-to-store symptoms are typically treated with anticholinergic medications, although patients should be cautioned about adverse effects, such as dry mouth and confusion. Nocturia may respond to limited evening fluid intake or intranasal desmopressin; if desmopressin is prescribed, patients should be cautioned about the potential for hyponatremia. Injectable onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) may be used if symptoms do not respond to these agents. Failure-to-empty symptoms are treated with clean intermittent catheterization, although some may respond to an alpha adrenergic blocker. Up to 75% of patients with MS experience constipation, incontinence, or both. Treatment should include dietary fiber, bulk-forming agents, and adequate hydration. Rectal stimulants, stool softeners, and enemas may be used if needed. Colostomy is an option for patients with intolerable symptoms. About 50% to 90% of men and 40% to 85% of women with MS have some type of sexual dysfunction. Although sexual dysfunction may have a considerable negative impact on quality of life, it is often unaddressed. Men are primarily treated with peripherally acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. There is no established pharmacologic agent for women. Collaboration with a sex therapist or couples counselor may be beneficial. Approximately 85% of patients with MS report pain during the course of their illness. Those with pain report poorer health and poorer psychological functioning. Trigeminal neuralgia and dysesthetic (neuropathic) limb pain are common. Trigeminal neuralgia is initially treated with carbamazepine (Tegretol) and baclofen (Lioresal), as it is in persons without MS. Neuropathic pain in MS may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Hydrotherapy has also been shown to be helpful in pain management, and is beneficial for the spasticity associated with MS. Cannabinoid therapy may be helpful for pain symptoms. It is estimated that 70% to 80% of patients with MS experience muscle spasticity. These symptoms are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating modalities such as physical, occupational, and electromagnetic therapy. Baclofen is a first-line agent and works by decreasing alpha motor neuron activity. Oral baclofen has a short half-life and is associated with daytime sedation and muscle weakness. Intrathecal baclofen can be used to avoid daytime sedation, although muscle weakness may still occur. Diazepam (Valium) and gabapentin (Neurontin) may be used alone or in conjunction with baclofen. OnabotulinumtoxinA, with or without concomitant physical therapy, may also be helpful. Although cannabinoid therapy has been used for spasticity, the evidence for its effectiveness is mixed. The American Academy of Neurology states that patients should be counseled that these agents are probably ineffective for objective spasticity. More than 90% of patients with MS report fatigue; one-third report it to be their most troubling symptom, and many present with it. Although fatigue may occur as a result of comorbid depression, it also may appear independently. Fatigue has profound impacts on quality of life and is a leading cause of disability claims. Treatment for fatigue is multifocal. After evaluating for comorbid causes of fatigue (e.g., sleep disorders, thyroid disease, vitamin B deficiency, anemia), environmental manipulation, such as controlling heat and humidity levels, may help prevent flare-ups. Energy conservation measures such as napping and the use of assistive devices for mobility may be recommended based on the individual patient. Amantadine has been used off label in a limited number of trials and has been found to be beneficial for fatigue, although it is associated with insomnia and confusion. Other medications, such as modafinil (Provigil), have been tried with mixed results, and are not FDA approved for patients with MS. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and other vascular comorbidities in patients with MS is similar to that in the general population. The presence of these conditions may worsen the course of MS. In addition to using targeted MS and symptom-modifying therapies, physicians should also manage these comorbidities. Surveys show that more than 50% of patients with MS seek treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic manipulations, massage, yoga, and herbal therapies.  Physicians should ask patients if they are using integrative treatments, and should be prepared to help them find quality information on the risks and benefits of the treatments they choose. provides information and resources on traditional and integrative treatments for MS.  Enlarge     Print Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines : A PubMed search was completed using the keyword and medical subject heading multiple sclerosis.

13e04c07-4ded-4fa7-a94c-5e908b4398f5,"COVID-19 updates, including vaccine information, for our patients and visitors Dr. Kinkel meets with a patient during a regular medical checkup. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. The central nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. In MS, the body attacks myelin, the protective substance coating millions of nerve fibers. When the myelin or nerve fiber is damaged, nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain and spinal cord are distorted. The symptoms of MS are variable and unpredictable. They can be mild, such as numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss of vision. Problems with fatigue, bladder, bowel control or sexual function are common. The progression and severity of MS varies from person to person. Our is led by , an internationally recognized neurologist. Our top priority is the people we serve. People diagnosed with MS and their families face years of many unknowns. Loss of cognition or vision, reduced mobility and emotional changes, among many other symptoms, can become life-altering, multidimensional challenges. In response to these challenges, the multiple sclerosis program works as a multidisciplinary team with physical therapists, psychiatrists, mobility experts and others to provide complete care for people with MS.  Our patients with MS have access to leading-edge research -- led by  -- in the development of new therapies.

3a7554cd-8346-49e5-aa25-cac19720d76d,"Research Highlights from the AAN and CMSC 2018 Annual Meetings Research Highlights from the AAN and CMSC 2018 Annual Meetings Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Research Pipeline Various Strategies for Wellness and Symptom Management, Physical Activity and Exercise, Vitamin D, and Reproductive-Health Topics Hot Topics in MS: Stem Cells, Lipoic Acid, Diet and MS, Obesity and MS, Gut Microbiome, and Medical Marijuana The cascade of research driving advances in multiple sclerosis (MS) continued at the same heightened pace in the first half of 2018. The results of numerous significant studies were reported at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), held in Los Angeles in April, and the Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), which took place in Nashville in May. We have summarized some of the most interesting findings from those conferences in this update. Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Research Pipeline The treatment options for people with MS are likely to continue to expand in the years just ahead, as several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are in late stages of clinical development and/or are under review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Five noteworthy studies of such “pipeline” medications are summarized here. Cladribine and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes Cladribine is an oral medication taken for up to 20 days over a period of two years. It selectively targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to depletion of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. It is approved for use in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in several countries, but is not yet approved for use in the United States. In the Phase III CLARITY study, cladribine showed efficacy when compared to placebo over the course of two years of use by people with RRMS. A post-hoc analysis of that study’s data examined the impact of cladribine on a subset of individuals who had high disease activity as measured by relapses, MRI findings, and other characteristics. The analysis found that the effectiveness of cladribine versus placebo in this subpopulation was comparable to that seen in the overall CLARITY population in terms of reducing MRI markers of disease activity. This includes reducing such MRI markers as cumulative new T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions and cumulative combined unique active lesions. This post-hoc analysis did not focus on safety. However, in the CLARITY study from which this analysis’ MRI data were derived, certain adverse events occurred more frequently in the cladribine groups than in participants receiving placebo. These adverse events included lymphocytopenia (21.6 percent in the 3.5-mg cladribine group and 31.5 percent in the 5.25-mg group, versus 1.8 percent in the placebo group), and herpes zoster (eight patients and 12 patients, respectively, versus no patients). As clinicians experience continued progress in treating MS overall, an increasing focus is placed on improving outcomes in people with high disease activity. Studies of this type help provide informed treatment strategies for these individuals. Opicinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets LINGO-1, a protein in the central nervous system whose role is to halt myelination (repair of the protective covering of the nerves) and prevent the survival of neurons (nerve cells). The SYNERGY trial assessed various doses of opicinumab, given by intravenous infusion, in combination with interferon beta-1a, over the course of 72 weeks in people with relapsing forms of MS (RMS). The results showed a sort of “inverted U” effect with more favorable outcomes in the 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg dose groups, indicating that other factors may have been involved in how the participants responded. That finding prompted investigators to explore those factors associated with a better response to opicinumab. Their post-hoc analysis identified three factors associated with better response to the medication: shorter disease duration (less than 20 years); lower baseline magnetization transfer ratio values in T2 lesions, which may signify lower myelin content in those lesions; and lower baseline diffusion tensor imaging-radial diffusivity values in T2 lesions, a characteristic that may be consistent with greater structural integrity. Practicing “precision medicine” involves identifying those factors that enable clinicians to give the right medication to the right patient at the right time. As this study shows, that effort may entail drawing on highly technical, and possibly even less understood, biomedical characteristics and concepts in the service of individualizing care. Ublituximab and central nervous system lesions in relapsing MS Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody given by infusion. Like Ocrevus, ublituximab targets the CD20 molecule. Researchers evaluated 24-week data from a Phase II trial of the medication in people with relapsing forms of MS. Among 31 individuals who had a total of 73 T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions on MRI at baseline, no T1 Gd+ lesions were found at Week 24. Additionally, T2-lesion volume decreased by 8.1 percent from baseline to Week 24, prompting the authors to conclude that ublituximab has “robust efficacy” on MRI endpoints. Ozanimod is an oral, once-daily medication being evaluated for use in RRMS. It is a selective modulator of two types of S1P receptors: S1P1 and S1P5. Data from two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B, show that ozanimod, given at 1 mg/daily and 0.5 mg/daily, had favorable outcomes relative to Avonex (interferon beta-1a) – both in terms of annualized relapse rate (ARR) and MRI findings. Annualized relapse rate, or ARR, refers to how many relapses a person in a particular study group is likely to have, on average, over a one-year period. For example, if the placebo group in a clinical study had an ARR of “1,” the average person in that group could expect to have one relapse per year. Ozanimod, given at doses of either 1.0 mg or 0.5 mg, reduced the ARR by 48 percent and 31 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the SUNBEAM trial. In these same doses, it also reduced the ARR by 38 percent and 21 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the RADIANCE trial. Meanwhile, the adjusted mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions was reduced by 25 percent to 48 percent in people taking ozanimod versus those receiving interferon beta-1a. Additionally, the individuals taking ozanimod had fewer adverse events overall and fewer adverse events leading to study discontinuation. Siponimod, relapses, and disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Siponimod is an oral medication being studied for use in secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Its mechanism of action is similar to that of Gilenya (fingolimod), in that it works at the S1P receptor family to block the movement of lymph cells from lymph nodes; however, siponimod appears to interact with fewer of the receptors than Gilenya does – with its primary actions at the S1P1 and the S1P5 receptors, the same receptors that ozanimod targets. The Phase III EXPAND study showed that siponimod reduced confirmed disability progression (CDP). Investigators analyzed the results of that trial to understand to what extent, if any, this effect was related to a reduction in relapses. This information is important to uncover, because it could have implications for the effectiveness of the medication in people who do not experience relapses or who have very infrequent relapses. Using sophisticated statistical analyses, the researchers concluded that, “Siponimod treatment reduces the risk for CDP in both relapsing and non-relapsing SPMS patients. Our analyses suggest that siponimod’s effect on disability is largely independent from the effect on relapses.” Research into the safety and effectiveness of a DMT does not stop when that medication wins approval from the FDA. Several recently reported studies provide ongoing information on approved DMTs or findings from focused analyses of data from those medications’ major Phase III clinical trials. Highlights from several such studies are reported below. Ocrevus (ocrelimzumab) was approved by the FDA in 2017 for RMS and PPMS. The medication is administered by IV infusion, with 600 mg given every six months. The safety and efficacy of Ocrevus were assessed in two large clinical trials, OPERA I and OPERA II, in which individuals with relapsing MS received either Ocrevus or Rebif (interferon beta-1a). At the end of those trials, study participants were allowed to continue on Ocrevus or switch from Rebif to Ocrevus during a so-called “open-label extension” (OLE) period. A recent analysis found that switching from Rebif to Ocrevus at the start of the OLE period was associated with rapid and significant reductions in disease activity as identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients who changed therapies in the OLE went from having an adjusted number of 0.48 T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions per scan prior to switching, to an average 0.00 such lesions per scan after one year and two years on Ocrevus. Tysabri (natalizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that is administered by IV infusion of a 300-mg dose every four weeks. The medication was approved for use in adults with relapsing MS in 2004. However, Tysabri was voluntarily withdrawn from the market the next year after three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection caused by the JC virus, were identified in individuals taking the medication. Tysabri became available again in 2006, following implementation of a comprehensive risk-management program, which includes testing potential Tysabri users to see if they have anti-JC virus antibodies. Now, a team of New Zealand researchers have reported favorable results with administering Tysabri every six weeks rather than every four weeks, noting that they pursued extended-interval dosing with a view toward reducing the risk of PML. Those investigators report that after administering Tysabri at six-week intervals to 27 patients for an average of two years, none of the participants had lesions on MRI, and only one reported relapse. No participants were diagnosed with PML. This treatment strategy reflects ongoing efforts across the MS treatment spectrum to balance efficacy and safety to the patient’s maximal advantage. Aubagio (teriflunomide) was approved in 2012 for use in relapsing MS. It is an oral medication administered as 7-mg or 14-mg once daily. An analysis of long-term data on patients with relapsing MS who participated in two Phase III trials of the medication and the extensions of those trials found that 74 percent taking the 14-mg dose had stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores over five years. Mean EDSS scores at five years were higher (indicating disease progression) in those who experienced a relapse, compared with those who did not – at 2.70 and 2.43 respectively. A separate study examined 169 pregnancies in women who took Aubagio during pregnancy. Based on findings of teratogenicity – an elevated incidence of birth defects – in animal studies, use of the medication is contraindicated in pregnant women and females of reproductive potential not using effective contraception. Nonetheless, some women have taken the medication shortly before conceiving or while pregnant. In this study, the final dose of Aubagio was administered pre-conception or in the first trimester in all but four cases. Outcomes were known for 67 of the 169 pregnancies. Two structural abnormalities were reported: one case of congenital hydrocephalus in a full-term pregnancy and one cystic hygroma (a fluid-filled sac resulting from a blockage in the lymphatic system) detected on ultrasound during pregnancy (with the outcome of that pregnancy unknown). Researchers concluded that the current data from pregnancies exposed to teriflunomide show no warning signs of a treatment-related increased risk for birth defects. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a monoclonal antibody approved for use in RMS in 2014. It is administered by intravenous infusion over four hours for two multi-day treatment courses 12 months apart. Researchers recently analyzed data on 393 individuals who had participated in clinical trials of Lemtrada and then remained on the medication during a longer-term extension study. The researchers found that after using Lemtrada for six years, 77 percent of the more than 300 patients studied showed stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores compared to their baseline scores. Additionally, 43 percent achieved a six-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI), further underscoring the long-term benefits of treatment. Another analysis examined outcomes in extension-study patients who received re-treatment with Lemtrada due to disease activity after the initial two courses of therapy. Among 178 participants who received at least one re-treatment, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) fell from 0.85 (12 months before receiving a third course of Lemtrada) to 0.20 (12 months after the third course). The percentage of individuals with a CDI increased from 4 percent to 14 percent over those two time periods. Researchers concluded, “Patients who were re-treated due to relapse and/or MRI activity after the initial two courses demonstrate continued alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] efficacy after [Course 3] with reduced relapses and stable or improved disability.” Glatiramer acetate is an injectable DMT approved for use in relapsing forms of MS. It is available both as a branded medication (Copaxone) and in generic form from two other companies. In a one-year, placebo-controlled study, administering the medication in a dose of 40 mg/mL three-times weekly reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 34 percent and MRI disease activity by 34.7 percent relative to placebo. A new analysis shows that those benefits were sustained for up to five years in people participating in the open-label phase of the study, which was supported by Teva. The overall ARR during the entire long-term follow-up period was 0.26 for individuals who started on glatiramer acetate in the placebo-controlled phase of the study, and was 0.32 for those who switched from placebo to glatiramer acetate in the open-label phase. Researchers added that the most common adverse events seen over the long term were generally mild and consistent with the medication’s established safety profile. Interferon beta-1b was the first DMT approved for use in MS, and today is available in branded form as Betaseron and Extavia. A 23-year observational follow-up study was conducted with 87 patients treated at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. The study found that 29 percent of individuals used the medication for less than one year, while 18 percent remained on therapy for more than 15 years. Of the individuals who stopped treatment, side effects were the reason cited most often in those who discontinued therapy before five years of use, while lack of efficacy was given as the reason for stopping in those who used the medication for longer periods. A stable disease course on a DMT does not predict continued stability after discontinuing that therapy, regardless of a person’s age. Noting that clinicians sometimes recommend stopping DMT therapy as individuals with MS get older, researchers assessed the advisability of this strategy by examining data from the New York State MS Consortium (NYSMSC) database. Of 135 patients who were considered stable on DMT therapy as determined by minimal change in EDSS score, 35.6 percent saw their EDSS score worsen after stopping their DMT. Age did not affect post-discontinuation course, with 34.1 percent of people age 54 years and younger and 37.7 percent of people age 55 years and older recording unfavorable changes in their EDSS scores after going off a DMT. People with MS and their healthcare providers today face a “welcome dilemma” unimaginable even 20 years ago. With more than a dozen disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) now approved by the FDA for use in adults, patients and clinicians have an opportunity (and challenge) to select the medication likely to best address the each individual’s specific health status and needs. That can be a daunting prospect, particularly because few clinical trials have directly compared one agent with another. Given the scarcity of such studies, investigators often rely on sophisticated analytical methods – such as propensity scoring and other techniques – to assess the merits of one agent relative to others. Those methods, while useful, typically are considered by physicians to be less authoritative than a head-to-head trial of two agents. This section highlights five recently presented studies that compared agents within the same trial or via analysis of data drawn from different trials or large patient databases. In considering various treatments, however, it is critical to not only look at clinical trial data and other analyses, but also for individuals to talk with their clinician about their specific history and circumstances – in order to individualize their care and achieve an optimal effect. DMT impact on cognition in patients at increased risk of progressive disease The OPERA 1 and OPERA 2 trials were identical Phase III studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) to Rebif (interferon beta-1a) in people with relapsing MS. Study participants received either 600 mg of Ocrevus every 24 weeks or 44 ug of Rebif three times a week for 96 weeks. The studies included 186 individuals receiving Ocrevus and 180 receiving Rebif who were considered to be at increased risk of progressive disease based on their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems scores. Participants completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at baseline and during the course of 96 weeks to assess their cognitive function. Over the study period, individuals receiving Ocrevus who were at increased risk for disease progression had a greater mean improvement in SDMT scores than did increased-risk individuals receiving Rebif (6.2 for Ocrevus versus 2.6 for Rebif). Assessing DMTs in terms of annualized relapse rates Annualized relapse rate (ARR) is a measure of a DMT’s impact on disease course in MS. Researchers drew on data from two studies of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) and two studies of Aubagio (teriflunomide) to assess the ARR in newly diagnosed individuals starting one or the other of those medications. The participants had been diagnosed with relapsing MS within one year of study enrollment and had not taken other DMTs. The investigators used individual patient data from the studies to match analyzed subjects by key baseline characteristics. Their analysis showed that at 108 weeks after treatment initiation, the ARR was numerically lower in newly diagnosed individuals receiving Plegridy than in newly diagnosed Aubagio patients. However, this difference was not statistically significant. In a separate study, a German network of more than 130 neurologists drew on its database of roughly 25,000 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to assess various DMTs in terms of ARR. The analysis found that Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) had a statistically significant reduction in ARR versus interferon medications. Tecfidera also performed better than the other agents in terms of time to first relapse. A third study assessed the ARR in people with highly active RRMS who switched to either Tysabri (natalizumab) or Gilenya (fingolimod) after inadequate response to DMTs that are considered first-line therapies in Europe. Such medications include interferon medications, glatiramer acetate, Aubagio, and Tecfidera. Researchers analyzed data for 897 “patient triplets” or matched sets of individuals who either switched from one first-line therapy to another or from a first-line therapy to Tysabri or Gilenya. The study drew from the MSBase Registry, an international online registry for neurologists studying multiple sclerosis and other neuro-immunological diseases. The analysis found that after switching, individuals moving from a first-line therapy to Tysabri had an ARR of 0.21; those moving to Gilenya had an ARR of 0.30; and those switching from one first-line therapy to another had an ARR of 0.33. The ARR was statistically significantly reduced for Tysabri, with no evidence of difference for Gilenya. Earlier this year, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first DMT approved to treat relapsing MS in adolescents and children aged 10 years and older. This medication was approved for use in adults with RMS in 2010. The Phase III PARADIGMS study compared use of Gilenya to interferon beta-1a for up to two years in 214 individuals aged 10 to 17 years with pediatric-onset MS. At the end of the study, Gilenya reduced the annualized rate of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions by 52.6 percent and the number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions per scan by 66.0 percent compared with interferon beta-1a. The early recognition of MS and the evidence-based assessment of likely disease course are critical to patients’ and physicians’ ability to engage in shared decision-making on treatment choices and overall wellness strategies. A significant amount of research is being conducted to map the connections between imaging findings or biomarker levels and establishing the diagnosis and predicting the course of MS. Other studies are focused on what measures of physical function may reveal about current and future health status. Several recent studies exploring these issues are highlighted below. 2017 McDonald Criteria apply well to children at MS onset MRI findings play a key role in the diagnosis of MS, but most research on the significance of imaging results has been focused on adults. Now, a study by investigators from The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and other institutions, has found that the 2017 McDonald Criteria are largely applicable to children, as well as adults, when assessing patients at clinical disease onset. The researchers assessed more than 2,800 MRI scans from 331 pediatric patients with MS, acquired demyelinating syndrome, and related conditions, and followed those patients’ course over a median of six years. They found that the presence of ≥one T1-hypointense lesions or ≥one periventricular lesions were the MRI features most predictive of MS outcome. The 2010 McDonald criteria and 2017 version of those criteria had comparable utility in predicting a pediatric patient’s disease course, but the investigators said the 2017 criteria were easier to apply. “Both ‘black holes’ and periventricular lesions at baseline are strong predictors of MS” in children, as they are in adults, the researchers concluded, adding that evidence of new disease activity is required to confirm MS in children who present with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Location of brain lesions predictive of walking speed The presence of MRI-detected lesions in the infratentorial/cerebellar region of the brain is associated with slower walking speed in people with MS, according to a retrospective chart review of 82 individuals. A team of Connecticut-based researchers reviewed magnetic resonance images and medical records to determine whether the location of lesions in four areas of the central nervous system – the spinal cord, and the infratentorial/cerebellar, juxtacortical, and periventricular regions of the brain – was associated with mobility and disability in people with MS. No significant relationship was found between number of CNS regions with lesions and Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or time in performing the Timed 25-Foot Walk test. Similarly, no significant relationship was seen between the presence of lesions in any one region of the CNS and EDSS score. Higher number of oligoclonal bands correlates with relapses and disease progression People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who had 10 or more oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were far more likely to have relapses and disease progression over the ensuing two years than individuals with RRMS who had <10 OCBs in their CSF samples. That was the finding from a retrospective study of 128 people with RRMS on DMT therapy. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania also found that in addition to having more relapses and more new lesions on MRI, people with ≥10 OCBs were more likely to begin using an assistive device relative to their counterparts with fewer OCBs. “As OCBs may have greater diagnostic weight going forward, the quantity may be important in guiding selection of DMTs,” the study’s authors noted. Tapping into a new means of assessing MS subtype and mobility The number of times a person with MS can tap his or her foot in 10 seconds correlates with MS subtype and with results of mobility measures such as the 25-Foot Walk Test (25FWT). This finding was discovered by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and related institutions. In a study of 30 people with non-progressive MS, 30 with progressive MS, and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 10-second tap counts distinguished people with MS from healthy controls, and those with progressive MS from their peers with non-progressive MS. Further, slower foot tapping correlated with slower performance on the 25FWT and Timed Up and Go test (TUG). “The associations between foot tap speed and mobility measures, such as the TUG test and 25FWT, suggest that rapid foot-tapping may be a useful marker for tracking or predicting progression of mobility dysfunction in people with MS, regardless of their ability to ambulate,” the researchers noted. Various Strategies for Wellness and Symptom Management, Physical Activity and Exercise, Vitamin D, and Reproductive-Health Topics People with MS often must contend with a wide range of issues affecting their quality of life, overall health status, and general well-being. As the nature and impact of those issues have become better understood in recent years, an array of healthcare professionals – from psychologists and physical therapists to health educators and epidemiologists – are analyzing databases and devising innovative programs to further define and more effectively address challenges involving everything from insomnia to infertility. To follow are highlights of research in these areas. These were reported earlier this year at the Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). Well, maybe not the absolute best medicine, but apparently good medicine when it comes to addressing depression in people with MS and other neurologic conditions. Researchers at Evergreen Health in Kirkland, Washington, conducted a prospective, open trial of laughter therapy (LT) for 31 participants: 17 with MS, eight with Parkinson’s disease, two with spinal cord injury, and the remainder with other disorders of the central nervous system. After participating in eight, 60-minute laughter therapy classes taught by a certified LT instructor (yes, there is such a thing), participants who completed the course saw an improvement from baseline in their scores on a measure of depression. Scores on a separate measure of anxiety essentially were unchanged from baseline. “Our findings show that LT may reduce depression and be administered across a variety of neurological deficits, including for people with limited exercise options due to severe disability,” the researchers noted. However, they added that the approximate 50 percent attrition rate – with 14 participants not completing the program – may indicate a potential shortcoming for when the intervention is employed in people with neurological conditions. Comparing strategies for stress reduction in people with MS Both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and group education on stress reduction can provide short-and long-term benefits to people with MS, according to a randomized study involving 62 adults with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of ≤8.0. Compared to their status at the start of the study, people in both groups experienced significant reductions in stress both eight weeks and 12 months after participating in an MBRS program or group education. Both groups also saw improvement on a measure of emotional well-being at eight weeks, but that improvement was no longer statistically significant at 12 months. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of degree of stress reduction achieved or improvement in emotional well-being, suggesting that both approaches are viable options for addressing the stress and other emotional issues that can be part of living with MS. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may improve insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and fatigue in the roughly 40 percent of people with MS who experience chronic insomnia, according to an ongoing study. Seven people have completed the randomized controlled trial thus far, with five participating in a six-week program of CBT for insomnia and two serving as controls. The CBT group showed a 78 percent improvement from baseline on a measure of insomnia symptoms, compared to a 38 percent improvement in the control group. Similarly, sleep quality improved by 63 percent for people in the CBT group and 32 percent in the control group. Additionally, two measures of fatigue showed improvements of 70 percent and 50 percent, respectively, for people receiving CBT, versus a 37 percent improvement and 20 percent worsening, respectively, for control group members. Can shared medical appointments enhance wellness in MS? So much needs to happen in an MS patient’s regular visit with his or her clinician. As a result, education on wellness, managing co-morbidities, and other important topics can get lost in the time crunch. Two researchers from Cleveland explored whether shared medical appointments, or SMAs, may be a solution to that problem. In the typical SMA model, individual appointments for patients are scheduled around a time set aside for group instruction and discussion. In this case, the Cleveland researchers offered a monthly SMA, with group sessions covering topics such as nutrition, therapeutic yoga, and guided imagery. Thirty-three patients attended at least one SMA, with 45 percent of those participants returning for at least one more SMA, and 36 percent attending three or more sessions. Patient-satisfaction assessments found 75 percent of participants had a favorable view of the value of the information presented and regarding attending future SMAs. Female patients attended preferentially relative to men, noted the researchers, adding that “encouraging wellness interventions at an earlier age and to wider demographics and disability level” may encourage more people with MS to adopt healthy lifestyle practices. Becoming physically active is a challenge for people with MS – and for all people, for that matter. Staying active after completing a formal physical therapy or exercise program can be even more of a challenge. However, two New York City physical therapists have reported success in encouraging ongoing physical activity among seven of eight participants in a six-week wellness exercise class (WEC) they conducted. All eight of the program’s participants recently had been discharged from outpatient physical therapy. The weekly exercise class that they then entered consisted of 60 minutes of progressive aerobic and resistance training, as well as stretching. Upon completing the six-week class, participants showed improvement from baseline on several measures of the physical and psychological impact of MS. And, in keeping with the adage that success begets success, at a follow-up four weeks after completing the class, seven of the eight class members reported being active in an independent gym program. The researchers concluded, “Providers should work with physical therapists to assure that, after rehabilitation, affordable opportunities such as group WEC exist to help those with MS have the opportunity to independently engage in an exercise program. This bridge between therapy and discharge could safely enhance adherence to exercise post rehabilitation, and potentially decrease the need for a future prolonged course of PT.” Research supports maximal strength training for people with MS Properly supervised maximal strength training (MST) is safe for people with MS and can help improve their strength, balance, and walking speed, according to a team of researchers from Hunter College in New York City. Those researchers conducted a pilot study in which nine people with MS (six women and three men) participated in an eight-week program. The twice-weekly sessions involved leg press, knee flexion, and ankle plantarflexion, with weights increased based on participant capability and preference. At the end of the exercise program, the participants showed significant improvement from baseline in the Six Minute Walk Test and Mini-BESTest. Meanwhile, measures of fatigue and spasticity did not change significantly from the study’s start until its end, suggesting that the strength training did not increase fatigue or spasticity. The researchers noted that while the study is ongoing, the results to date suggest that “MST is a safe and effective intervention, and that [people with multiple sclerosis] can benefit from a higher intensity of intervention than might have previously been thought.” Time spent in physical activity correlates with higher Vitamin D concentrations in people with MS, according to a study of 23 women and 15 men with multiple sclerosis and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤4.0. Researchers used an activity-monitoring device, patient diaries, and measurement of Vitamin D blood levels to follow patients over a one-month period. The participants did not take Vitamin D supplements before or during the study. The fact that study participants who were more physically active had higher levels of Vitamin D than those who were not as active – despite the fact that they were not taking the Vitamin D supplements, is intriguing. This is because many MS patients have lower-than-normal Vitamin D levels, and because physical activity has been shown to improve outcomes in MS. The study’s authors noted that alternative pathways leading to the connection between disease progression and Vitamin D levels need to be considered. Long-term reduction in spasticity seen with intrathecal baclofen therapy Five years after implantation of a pump to deliver intrathecal baclofen therapy, both ambulatory and non-ambulatory people with MS had significant reductions in spasticity, according to researchers from the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center and related institutions. Those researchers examined the records of 77 individuals (40 ambulatory and 37 non-ambulatory) who had a pump implanted between 2001 and 2014, and for whom at least three years of follow-up data were available. The patient’s mean age at surgery to implant the pump was 47.1 years; 62 percent of the patients were women. For ambulatory patients, spasticity as measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) improved from 14.5 (range 10.8-20.25) at baseline to 2 (range 0-8) after five years on IBT. For non-ambulatory patients, MAS score improved from 24 (range 16.5-26) to 2 (range 0-5) after five years of IBT. Pain scores also improved significantly in both groups. Physical therapy (PT) has been shown to improve gait speed in people with MS. The medication dalfampridine extended-release (DER) also can increase gait speed in those with MS, but only about 38 percent of individuals experience this benefit. Now, the results of a small study support combining the interventions in people with MS who do not see a 20 percent or greater improvement in their Timed 25 Foot Walk test (T25W) after three weeks on the medication. The study involved eight adults with MS. Four of those people had been taking DER for three weeks and did not have a ≥20 percent improvement in T25W at the end of that period. They continued on DER for another six weeks, but also engaged in twice-weekly physical therapy during that period. The other four participants did not receive DER but also engaged in six weeks of twice-weekly PT. Among the DER + PT patients, T25FW results improved by 20.7 percent from Week 3 to Week 9, while the PT-only group had a 6.8 percent improvement in T25W during that period. Infertility and MS – findings from a large database analysis Women with MS are more likely to have a diagnosis of infertility, less likely to use infertility medications, and less likely to have a live birth than their age-matched peers without MS. Those are the main findings from an analysis of United States’ commercial insurance claims for 117,041 women with MS and more than 1.4 million women without MS. The analysis, which spanned the period from 2006 through 2015, found that 8.52 percent of women with MS and 8.02 percent of those without MS had a diagnosis of infertility. While that percentage difference is small, the researchers noted that it is statistically significant. Similarly, a significantly lower proportion of women with MS used any fertility treatment relative to women without MS (1.01 percent versus 1.19 percent). Finally, the rate of live births in women on any infertility treatment was 5.00 percent among women with MS, compared with 6.98 percent among those who did not have MS. Data from the New York State Multiple Sclerosis Consortium (NYSMSC) provide reassuring news regarding both the incidence of relapses during pregnancy and the near-term effect on infants of maternal use of DMTs in pregnancy. Among 109 women who reported a pregnancy after being diagnosed with MS, 48.6 percent had a relapse in the two years before becoming pregnant, but just 11.9 percent reported a relapse during pregnancy. Those relapses were more common in the first and second trimesters than in the third trimester. Meanwhile, 45.8 percent of the women reported a relapse in the first two years after birth, with most of the relapses occurring in the first year after delivery. Women who had experienced a relapse in the 24 months before pregnancy were more likely than others to have a relapse in the 24 months after birth, while relapse during pregnancy was not associated with postpartum relapse. Eleven of the women in the analysis were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for at least part of their pregnancy, with six continuing to use their DMT through their entire pregnancy. None of those women reported birth problems, and none of their children had been referred for special medical services at age 1 or 2 years. Hot Topics in MS: Stem Cells, Lipoic Acid, Diet and MS, Obesity and MS, Gut Microbiome, and Medical Marijuana Research into interventions for MS extends far beyond the important efforts to develop new pharmacologic treatments and to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of currently approved medications. Increasingly, investigators are assessing the impact of diet, the gut microbiome – a key component of the immune system – and various substances as they look for ways to manage symptoms and improve outcomes. Studies also are exploring the role of two very different types of interventions long used to treat other conditions — medical marijuana and stem-cell transplantation – in MS. This section reviews pertinent findings in these and other areas reported at the 2018 Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). When relapses continue while taking a DMT – a role for stem-cell therapy? An international team of researchers is assessing the role of stem-cell transplantation for individuals with highly active RRMS who continue to have relapses despite taking a DMT. At the AAN’s annual meeting, those scientists reported interim results from their Multiple Sclerosis International Stem cell Transplant (MIST) trial. The study involves 110 individuals with RRMS on a DMT who have had two or more relapses in the past 12 months. Fifty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive stem-cell transplantation, while the other 55 continue to receive the DMT that their treating neurologist deemed best for them. Importantly, the study is employing “non-myeloablative” stem-cell transplantation, meaning that patients can go through a less-demanding pre-treatment regimen than what was first used in stem-cell transplantation and still often used in treating certain types of cancer. The study’s main endpoint is treatment failure, defined as a 1.0 increase in EDSS sustained for six months or more. After a mean follow-up of three years, 60 percent of patients in the DMT arm had experienced a treatment failure, compared to just 6 percent of those in the stem-cell transplant group. During the first year after transplant, those receiving stem cells saw their EDDS score improve from 3.5 to 2.4, while it worsened in the DMT group from 3.3 to 3.9. Both of those findings were statistically significant. No deaths occurred in the stem-cell transplant group. These results led the researchers to conclude that in people with RRMS who have more than two relapses in a year while on a DMT, stem-cell transplantation is superior to continued use of a disease-modifying therapy. Meanwhile, a separate, smaller study from a single center suggests that stem-cell transplantation may be a first-line option for the minority of MS patients who have rapidly evolving severe multiple sclerosis (RESMS), also known as highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). British investigators performed stem-cell transplantation on five men and two women who had not received a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and who had experienced two or more severe relapses in the 12 months before the procedure. These individuals all had clinical or imaging findings that suggested that their MS would continue to worsen, and all had at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion seen on MRI associated with their relapses. They ranged in age from 27 to 52 years old, and their median time between symptom onset and treatment was nine months. The investigators used each patient’s own stem cells for the procedure. After a median follow-up period of 18 months, none of the participants had experienced a relapse following the transplantation, although one had a single new gadolinium-enhancing lesion six months after treatment. The median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score for these individuals improved from a median 5.5 before treatment to 3 at the last follow-up. No serious adverse effects were observed. The investigators concluded that autologous (using the patient’s own cells) hematopoietic (blood-cell producing) stem-cell transplantation is safe and effective for previously untreated patients with rapidly evolving, severe MS. Lipoic acid is a naturally occurring compound that exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its potential role as a dietary supplement for people with MS has been the focus of recent research, including a study by investigators from the Oregon Health & Science University and VA Portland Health Care System. Those researchers administered 1,200 mg of oral lipoic acid to people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and healthy controls. They then drew blood samples to measure the amount of lipoic acid found in the plasma of all three groups, as well as levels of substances involved in immune system responses. In particular, the investigators wanted to see if taking lipoic acid would stimulate the body’s production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which plays a role in modulating the immune system. They found that two hours and four hours after ingesting lipoic acid, the health controls and people with SPMS had increased cAMP levels relative to baseline, while those with RRMS had decreases in cAMP. Also, women with RRMS had lower plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E2, which stimulates cAMP, compared to women with SPMS and women without MS four hours after taking lipoic acid. These findings prompted the investigators to conclude that the differences in the way people with RRMS responded to lipoic acid relative to those without MS or with SPMS may have implications for the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents in RRMS. Following a paleolithic diet can help decrease fatigue in MS through changes in people’s lipid profiles, according to a study reported at the AAN annual meeting. The paleolithic – or so-called “caveman” diet – focuses on eating meat, fish, nuts, and vegetables available before the advent of processed food. A one-year study of 18 people with progressive MS found that a comprehensive intervention that included following a paleolithic diet, neuromuscular stimulation, and stress reduction reduced participants’ mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score from 5.51 at baseline to 3.03 at 12 months. During that time, participants saw their HDL-C (“good cholesterol”) levels increase, their total cholesterol levels decrease, and their body mass index (BMI) fall (BMI is a measure of healthy or unhealthy weight). The researchers concluded, “Lipid profile variables are associated with the improvements in fatigue in progressive MS patients on a modified Paleolithic diet-based multimodal intervention.” Meanwhile, researchers from Johns Hopkins reported on people with MS who follow a Mediterranean-style diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seafood and polyunsaturated fats while eating little red meat and drinking in moderation. The researchers found that these individuals appear to have less severe depressive and cognitive symptoms than people with MS who follow a more-traditional American diet. The researchers had 34 people with MS complete dietary recall surveys and then assessed those people for depression, cognitive impairment, and other known symptoms of MS. The investigators noted that the results of this cross-sectional survey need to be validated by interventional studies that could better examine the nature of the relationship seen between diet and the MS symptoms studied. Other research being conducted at Johns Hopkins is examining how caloric restriction affects the metabolite profiles of people with MS. In a six-month study, 19 people with MS who were receiving monthly injections of Tysabri and who had a higher body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m (indicating that they are overweight) chose from one of two calorie-restriction strategies. The first strategy, chosen by 11 individuals, involved continuous calorie restriction (CCR), with participants consuming 78.6 percent of their daily caloric needs each day. The other approach, chosen by eight participants, entailed intermittent calorie restriction (ICR), with people consuming only 25 percent of their daily caloric needs two days per week, and consuming their full caloric needs on the other days of the week. Nine of the 11 people in the CCR group and six of the eight in the ICR group completed the study. Researchers are assessing blood samples collected at baseline, three months, and six months to see how the two calorie-restriction approaches influenced the production of metabolites. They note that the results of their analysis may provide new information on how dietary changes affect clinical outcomes in MS. People who are obese at the onset of MS are likely to experience greater functional impairment and higher risk of relapses in the first two years after onset than people with a healthy weight, according to a study of more than 1,500 people with MS. Drawing on data for 1,524 participants in the Accelerated Cure Project’s study, researchers found that obesity was associated with a 15-percent increase in the number of impaired functional domains and a 30-percent increase in early relapse activity. People who were obese also were on average 8-percent older than non-obese patients at the onset of MS. The investigators explain, “These results warrant further investigation into the impact of this proinflammatory phenotype [obesity] in MS.” Gut reaction? Exploring potential ties between MS and the digestive tract’s microbiome The mix of bacteria found in the digestive tracts of people with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) differ from the bacterial milieu found in the gastrointestinal systems of people who don’t have those conditions, two recent studies found. Those studies reflect a growing research focus on potential links between MS and the “gut microbiome,” the digestive tract’s bacterial environment, which is known to play a major role in immune-system function. In the first study, American researchers used sophisticated genetic testing to analyze 42 stool samples from individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), as well as stool samples from 28 healthy donors. Compared to the samples from healthy volunteers, stool samples from people with RRMS had a statistically significant greater abundance of several types of bacteria, including Ruminococcus torques, Ruminococcus obeum, and Lactospiraces. Escherichia coli and Oscillibacter also were found more often in people with RRMS than in healthy controls. Conversely, people who did not have MS had a higher concentration of other bacteria – including bacteroides fragilis and Roseburia – than did study participants with MS. The researchers noted that further, larger studies are needed to determine whether these findings can help pave the way for markers of disease activity or even therapies that target the composition of the gut microbiome. Meanwhile, Italian investigators found differences in both the stool and blood samples of individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) – referring to individuals experiencing a symptom of MS, but who have not yet been diagnosed – relative to healthy volunteers. They found that butyrate-producing bacteria were more abundant in the healthy volunteers compared to those with CIS. Additionally, the blood of people with CIS had an increased level of a type of white blood cell involved in immune function – T helper (Th) 17 – and fewer T regulatory (Treg) cells producing Interleukin 10, compared to healthy volunteers. The researchers said that both findings indicate that gut microbiome dysfunction or imbalance exists at the earliest stages of MS. Most people with MS who use medical marijuana (MM), find that the medication helps manage their pain, spasticity, and other symptoms. This is according to two recent small-scale studies. In the first study, 14 individuals at the University of Rochester MS Center (13 with MS and one with transverse myelitis) enrolled in the New York State Medical Marijuana Program and completed a survey on their experience with MM. Ninety-three percent of these individuals who were certified by the state program to use medical marijuana actually had tried the medication at least once, with 77 percent reporting ongoing use, and 62 percent saying they used MM at least daily. Seventy-seven percent of participants said MM was helpful in managing their symptoms, 70 percent said that their quality of life improved with marijuana use, and most respondents reported no side effects. Most subjects estimated that they spent between $100 and $300 per month on MM, and cost was cited as a factor in stopping use of MM or using the agent less frequently.   The second study is being conducted in Colorado, where cannabis use – for any purpose, not just medical reasons – is legal. The experience and beliefs of 25 patients from the Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of Colorado were reported in preliminary findings from the research. Fifty-six percent of those participants believe cannabis has a beneficial effect on MS symptoms, while 8 percent think marijuana could entail harm in terms of MS symptoms. Seventy-six percent said they would consider cannabis use to ease their symptoms. Pain was the reason most frequently cited for using cannabis (by 57 percent of respondents), followed by spasticity/muscle tightness (29 percent), and muscle spasms (14 percent). Slowed thinking was the most commonly reported side effect, cited by 29 percent of participants. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents said that they were not currently using cannabis, with half of those people saying their non-usage was because they did not know enough about the medication. The authors of the second study noted, “As cannabis becomes more available under the laws of individual states, the results of this ongoing study may have important implications in the future landscape of MS symptom treatment and research exploring the efficacy of cannabis for MS symptom management.” For general information or to speak with a trained Client Services Specialist, please call MSAA’s Helpline at .

Mealy, Anna Whetstone, Gunes Orman, Izlem Izbudak, , Michael Levy Objective To differentiate MRI characteristics of optic neuritis associated with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Background Optic neuritis is a common presenting feature of both neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis. Distinguishing between NMO and RRMS is important in guiding treatment, but biomarkers of NMO and MS can be absent early in the disease process. We looked for differences in MRI characteristics of optic neuritis associated with NMO and MS that provide an early clue in the diagnostic workup. Design/Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 26 NMO and 26 RRMS patients presenting to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with MRI-confirmed acute optic neuritis. MRIs were assessed to identify the location and longitudinal extent of each contrast enhancing lesion. For the purposes of this study, the optic nerve was divided into intraorbital, canalicular, pre-chiasmal, chiasmal, and optic tract. Results There are distinct differences in MRI characteristics between NMO- and RRMS-associated optic neuritis. The majority of NMO lesions were longitudinally extensive measuring at least 17.6 mm in length and involving at least three optic nerve segments. At a cutoff of 17.6 mm lesion length, the specificity for NMO is 76.9% with a sensitivity of 80.8% and positive likelihood ratio of 3.50. Conversely, MS lesions were more commonly focal in one optic nerve segment localized anteriorly. Conclusions Optic neuritis in NMO has a distinct pattern on MRI as compared with RRMS and can help differentiate these two neuroinflammatory diseases at presentation.

Reaching an evidence-based prognosis for personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis , –() Personalized treatment is ideal for multiple sclerosis (MS) owing to the heterogeneity of clinical features, but current knowledge gaps, including validation of biomarkers and treatment algorithms, limit practical implementation. The contemporary approach to personalized MS therapy depends on evidence-based prognostication, an initial treatment choice and evaluation of early treatment responses to identify the need to switch therapy. Prognostication is directed by baseline clinical, environmental and demographic factors, MRI measures and biomarkers that correlate with long-term disability measures. The initial treatment choice should be a shared decision between the patient and physician. In addition to prognosis, this choice must account for patient-related factors, including comorbidities, pregnancy planning, preferences of the patients and their comfort with risk, and drug-related factors, including safety, cost and implications for treatment sequencing. Treatment response has traditionally been assessed on the basis of relapse rate, MRI lesions and disability progression. Larger longitudinal data sets have enabled development of composite outcome measures and more stringent standards for disease control. Biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain, have potential as early surrogate markers of prognosis and treatment response but require further validation. Overall, attainment of personalized treatment for MS is complex but will be refined as new data become available. Personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) depends on prognostication at baseline, a shared treatment decision between the physician and patient, and early assessment of response to therapy. Prognosis can be evaluated soon after diagnosis on the basis of demographic and environmental factors, clinical features, MRI measures and biomarkers. Individuals with poor prognostic features should be recommended high-efficacy therapies early on; studies are underway to investigate whether most patients with relapsing–remitting MS could benefit from initial aggressive therapy. During the treatment discussion between the neurologist and patient, factors such as comorbidities, pregnancy planning, patient preferences, risk tolerance, safety, cost and treatment sequencing should be considered in addition to prognosis. Early assessment of treatment response is important to identify the need to switch therapy; composite outcome measures that incorporate clinical and MRI data are best for predicting long-term disability. Personalized MS therapy is currently limited by a lack of evidence-based biomarkers; newer biomarkers, such as neurofilament light chain, have potential, but further validation and standardization of assays are required.

a41dff9d-43ea-4326-9e5b-cef47a4bc524,"— Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a condition that causes inflammation and damage to nerves in the eyes, spinal cord, and sometimes brain. If you or a loved one have been diagnosed with this condition, you might be wondering: Can NMO be cured? Is NMO fatal? Does NMO get worse over time? Read on to understand the answers to these pressing questions. There’s currently no known cure for NMO. But NMO treatments may reduce the number of relapses you experience. If you’ve tested positive for a type of antibody known as anti-AQP4, your doctor may prescribe eculizumab (Soliris) or inebilizumab (Uplizna). These targeted immune-suppressing therapies may help limit relapses in people with NMO who produce anti-AQP4 antibodies. Several other medications may also help reduce relapses in people with NMO, including those who don’t have anti-AQP4 antibodies. These include: Your doctor may also prescribe additional medications, physical therapy, or other treatments to help manage symptoms and complications of NMO. NMO affects different people in different ways. It’s possible to live for many years with NMO, especially if you receive treatment early on with immune-modulating medications. Some people develop life threatening complications from NMO. One small study found that about people with NMO develop breathing difficulties. Those breathing problems may require treatment with a ventilator. Fatal respiratory failure sometimes occurs. Starting treatment soon after diagnosis is important to reduce the risk of death. The authors of a 2019 review article report that about of people with NMO who don’t get any treatment die within 5 years of their first episode of symptoms. Getting early treatment may help you live longer and healthier with NMO. It’s rare for NMO to have a secondary progressive stage like you’d see in multiple sclerosis (MS). Disabilities tend to occur due to multiple acute relapses or episodes. During an attack, symptoms get worse over the course of several days. After each relapse, NMO symptoms may partially improve. But over time, multiple relapses tend to cause lasting nerve damage that may result in irreversible vision loss, muscle weakness, paralysis, and other impairments. Treatment with targeted therapies or other immune-modulating medications may help prevent relapses and limit impairments. NMO rarely has a secondary progressive stage. It can cause multiple relapses. You may experience partial improvements after each relapse but develop lasting impairments over time. There is no cure for NMO, but starting treatment quickly helps increase the likelihood that you’ll live longer and with better overall health. Early treatment with targeted therapies or other immune-modulating medications may help prevent relapses, limit the development of impairments, and prevent early death from NMO. Your doctor can help you learn more about your treatment options. — What’s the Difference Between Neuromyelitis Optica and MS? What’s the Connection Between MS and Optic Neuritis? Who Treats NMO?

These teams were funded through a request for proposals on this topic from the National MS Society. Among the findings, the researchers report that being male, younger and having greater disability is associated with greater risk tolerance, and that lower tolerance for risk is associated with poor treatment adherence. The National MS Society is committed to developing tools that allow better treatment decision making and personalized medicine, including evaluating therapy benefits and risks. These studies begin to yield insight into how people with MS approach treatment decisions. Understanding these choices can help to improve treatment satisfaction and adherence. Robert J. Fox, MD (Cleveland Clinic) and colleagues published findings in (), and Jared Bruce, PhD (University of Missouri-Kansas City) and colleagues published their findings in ().   DETAILS Although the potential effectiveness and safety risks of MS therapies are largely known, relatively little is known about how any therapy’s benefits and risks are perceived and weighed by people with MS and their care partners and loved ones. This benefit/risk trade-off is important for clinicians, industry, and regulators to understand when considering which therapies to develop, approve for clinical use, and recommend to people with MS. The National MS Society is committed to developing tools that allow better treatment decision making and personalized medicine, including therapy benefits/risks. For these reasons, the Society released a targeted request for proposals on this topic in 2015. As a result, Health Care Delivery and Policy Contracts were awarded to Robert J. Fox, MD (Cleveland Clinic) and Jared Bruce, PhD (University of Missouri, Kansas City).   First, Dr. Fox and colleagues conducted focus groups at four sites in the U.S. to identify themes related to therapy preferences and decision making. Based on those discussions, the team composed a survey that was then completed by 3,171 people with MS recruited through the North American Research Committee on MS () Registry and the National MS Society.   The survey asked about the level of tolerance that participants would have for real-world risks associated with a hypothetical therapy. Risk levels went from mild to severe, and included skin rash, infection, kidney injury, thyroid injury, liver injury, and PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a viral infection of the brain that often leads to death or severe disability).   Participants exhibited the highest tolerance for infection and thyroid injury and the least tolerance for kidney injury and PML. The authors note that a large proportion of the population studied was “risk averse” – depending on the complication, up to 39% were unwilling to assume any risk for the therapy’s benefit.   Men were more risk tolerant than women. Also, increasing age was associated with lower risk tolerance. Greater disability was associated with greater risk tolerance. Participants taking oral and infusion therapies reported a greater risk tolerance compared to those using injectables.   Dr. Fox (Cleveland Clinic) and colleagues published these findings in ().   Dr. Bruce enrolled 208 people with MS, recruited through the University of Kansas Medical Center MS Clinic and the local office of the National MS Society. Participants underwent cognitive testing and were asked to complete a computer-administered series of questionnaires that measured clinical, social, and neuropsychiatric functioning, as well as “probability discounting.”   Probability discounting describes how quickly a person dismisses a reward as it becomes increasingly improbable (e.g., how likely would you be to pay for a lottery ticket that has a 1/10 chance vs. a 1/10,000 chance of winning? How quickly you decide not to play this lottery as the chance of winning goes down describes your probability discounting rate.) In this study, participants indicated their likelihood of taking a hypothetical medication as the probability of side effects and medication benefits varied.   People who discounted the potential benefits of therapy faster because of side effects were more likely to have less knowledge of MS and to exhibit worse adherence to treatment. Discounting treatments due to side effects was not associated with increased depression and anxiety, but people who discounted treatments that had higher efficacy were more likely to have decreased cognitive function.   Dr. Bruce (University of Missouri-Kansas City) and colleagues published these findings in ().   These studies begin to yield insights into how people with MS approach treatment decisions. Understanding these choices can help to improve treatment satisfaction and adherence.   Learn how to work with your healthcare team to treat MS   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

30ecc319-3294-4510-8bc8-e00e1d0bb333,"Fingolimod Increases Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Level Secretion from Circulating T Cells of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis     , –() The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis involves an autoimmune and a neurodegenerative mechanism. Central nervous system-infiltrating immune cells in multiple sclerosis also possess a neuroprotective activity through secretion of neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Fingolimod was shown to slow the progression of disability and loss of brain volume. The objective of this study was to explore whether fingolimod induces secretion of neurotrophins by immune cells. Blood was drawn from 21 patients before the initiation of treatment with fingolimod and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The levels of the neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, β-nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor were screened in the supernatants of separated T cells and monocyte cultures using a customized, multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels were further validated by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment with fingolimod significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion from T cells. A specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed these results in the supernatant of T cells after 6 and 12 months of therapy. T cells that reach the bloodstream of fingolimod-treated patients with multiple sclerosis may contribute to the neuroprotective effect of this therapy by increased secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This mechanism of action of fingolimod in patients with multiple sclerosis has not been previously reported. This is a preview of subscription content, .

Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Find out about available and emerging therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory central nervous system disease that causes often disabling physical symptoms, including problems with mobility, vision, coordination and cognitive function, as well as fatigue and pain. If you've been diagnosed with relapsing-remitting , your doctor is likely to recommend immediate treatment with medications known as disease-modifying therapy (DMT). have been shown to reduce the number of relapses and delay progression of disability to some degree. These drugs differ in how they're taken and how often, whether they can be taken during pregnancy, and what side effects they can cause. They also differ in how people respond to them, and a person's response to a drug can change over time. Also, aren't a cure, and you might still need treatment for symptoms of . An understanding of can help you and your doctor form the best treatment strategy for your relapsing-remitting . These medications are among the first approved for relapsing and are still used as first line therapy. They include: The interferon beta medications are given by self-injection, either under the skin or in a muscle. The frequency of injections varies from once every two days to once every two weeks. These drugs have moderate to strong evidence of effectiveness, reducing the relapse rate and slowing the development of new -related brain lesions for relapsing . These drugs are considered generally safe and require minimal monitoring. Flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions, such as redness and discomfort, are commonly reported side effects of interferon beta drugs. This also is considered an initial therapy option for relapsing . This drug is thought to act through immune system cells known as T cells. It might also have nerve-protecting effects. Glatiramer acetate is given by self-injection under the skin, either three times weekly or every day. It's generally well tolerated, but injection site reactions, such as redness and discomfort, are common. This is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat both relapsing and primary-progressive . Not only has it been shown to reduce relapses, but it can slow disease progression. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion initially twice in two weeks. After that, the infusion is given every six months. Infusion reactions, such as a headache, rash, nausea and fever, are common. Your doctor might recommend that you be given a corticosteroid and an antihistamine before infusion to help prevent reactions. People with hepatitis B shouldn't take ocrelizamab. is a humanized monoclonal antibody that reduces the migration of immune cells across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. This medication is given intravenously every four weeks. Natalizumab is effective against relapsing , reducing the relapse rate by about two-thirds. However, it's associated with a small but important risk of a serious brain infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). People who take natalizumab must be closely monitored for symptoms of , which include progressive weakness and visual or cognitive changes that might not be reversible. A person's ongoing risk is assessed using factors such as: The presence of antibodies to a virus known as John Cunningham virus on blood testing Previous treatment of immunosuppressive drugs, such as mitoxantrone This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells, but it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions, such as a headache, rash, nausea and fever, are common with alemtuzumab. Due to the risks associated with alemtuzamab, the recommends extensive screening before using the drug. It's only available from registered providers, and people treated with alemtuzumab must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. These oral are approved for treating relapsing . This once-daily oral medication reduces the relapse rate of . Fingolimod is a unique medication that binds to many different types of body cells. It traps white blood cells in lymph nodes so that they can't enter the brain and cause new lesions. People with heart disorders or related conditions can't use fingolimod. It can temporarily slow the heart rate, so the first dose must be taken under medical supervision. It also requires monitoring of vision because of a risk of buildup of fluid in the macula, an area in the center of the retina. For that reason, people with diabetes generally shouldn't use fingolimod. Teriflunomide has been approved in two doses, 7 milligrams (mg) and 14 mg, taken once daily. It's generally well tolerated at both doses. Possible side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, elevation in liver enzymes and hair thinning. Pregnant women and people with liver conditions shouldn't use teriflunomide. Also known as BG-12, dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily. Common side effects include flushing and gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea and nausea. Its coating is designed to reduce gastrointestinal problems, and taking it with food also can help relieve them. This twice-daily capsule is similar to dimethyl fumarate but typically causes fewer side effects. It's approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of . This drug has been shown to be effective in reducing relapses and new brain lesions. It was also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include increased risk of developing infections. This once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate and help slow the progression of . It's also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include viral infections, liver problems and low white blood cell count. Other possible side effects include changes in heart rate, headaches and vision problems. There's no way to know which treatments will work best for you or how your disease will progress. Recommendations are based on several factors, including: Recent activity, including recent attack frequency, severity and recovery The severity of lesion damage to the brain and spinal cord based on an MRI Other illnesses you have or medications you take that might interact with therapy Your own preferences regarding type of therapy (oral or injectable, for example) Shared decision-making between you and your doctor is the best approach to your treatment plan. Once you start a , it's important that you continue taking your medication as prescribed. Be sure to report new symptoms to your doctor, who will monitor your response and possibly switch your medication if needed. Your situation is unique, and the best treatment is one tailored to your needs. Olek MJ, et al.

The study is recruiting at 24 centers in the United States and United Kingdom. One strategy is an “escalation” approach, in which individuals start taking a less-powerful therapy with the option of switching to a more potent one if disease activity continues. The other strategy involves starting with a strong therapy that is potentially more effective, but also carries greater risk for significant adverse effects. The “Determining the Effectiveness of Early Intensive versus Escalation Approaches for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis” (DELIVER-MS) Trial is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).   DETAILS :  People with relapsing-remitting MS and neurologists are currently faced with the dilemma of adopting one of two treatment approaches: an escalation approach, starting a disease-modifying therapy that is considered safe but with a modest likelihood to control the disease activity, and escalating to more potent therapies in the face of continued disease activity; or an approach, which, in contrast, involves giving a high-efficacy therapy, with the rare potential for significant adverse effects, as the first-line treatment. Despite significant interest from both patients and care providers on this topic, there is currently no evidence comparing these two approaches in a head-to-head trial.   The DELIVER-MS Trial is one of two studies funded by PCORI that will help inform treatment decisions around whether, and which, people with MS would most benefit from early, possibly more risky aggressive therapy. The other study is “TRaditional versus Early Aggressive Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis” (). Both studies are recruiting participants.   : Investigators are seeking participants diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS who are between the ages of 18 and 60 years. Participants are eligible if they have had MS for five years or less, and have never been treated with an MS disease-modifying therapy. Further enrollment criteria are available from the contact below.   Eligible participants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups, and will choose along with their neurology provider among options in either a first-line or higher-efficacy therapy group. Participants and their neurology specialist will choose the therapy within the category that is most appropriate for them. During the three years that they are enrolled in the study, participants will have regular check-ups and MRI scans with their MS team, to look at the effects of treatment. They will be free to change treatment, in discussion with their neurologist, for any reason at any time.   The primary outcome being measured is the effect of treatment on brain tissue loss. Investigators will also monitor treatment effects on disability progression as measured by the EDSS scale, quality of life, other imaging measures, and safety.   : To learn more about the enrollment criteria for this study, and to find out if you are eligible to participate, please visit the study website, , and you will be connected with a participating site in your area.   The following sites are enrolling in the United States: Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH Cleveland Clinic-Las Vegas, NV Ohio Health, Columbus, OH Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO University of Rochester, Rochester, NY University of Texas, Houston, TX University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI   Download a brochure that discusses issues to think about when considering enrolling in an MS clinical trial (PDF).   Without participants in research studies, MS research would come to a standstill. .

This finding may set the stage for a therapeutic strategy that “resets” the immune system in MS.Researchers funded by the National MS Society have pinpointed a molecular signal that triggers the beneficial effects of gut bacteria in mice with MS-like disease. If continued research confirms and extends these findings to people who have MS, the results may present a novel target for a therapeutic strategy that “resets” the immune system to stop immune attacks in MS. Yan Wang PhD, Lloyd Kasper, MD (Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH) and colleagues report their findings in . ()  MS involves immune-system attacks against the brain and spinal cord. The gut, including the small and large intestine, is the largest immune organ in mammals. Each of us has millions of “commensal” bacteria living within our guts. Most of these bacteria are harmless as long as they remain in the inner wall of the intestine. They play a critical role in our normal physiology, and accumulating research suggests that they are critical in the establishment and maintenance of immune balance by the molecules they release. These molecules are absorbed by the complex structure of immune cells that are contained in the immune tissue associated with the gut. Lloyd Kasper, M.D., is funded by the National MS Society, with underwriting support from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, to examine the effects gut commensal bacteria in MS and in mice with MS-like disease. Specifically, his team is looking at a molecule called polysaccharide A (PSA) that is released by specific species of gut bacteria (Bacteroides) that colonize almost 95% of people worldwide. Previous work in the Kasper lab (. ) showed that PSA can reduce the effects of EAE, an animal model of MS, by stimulating the production of immune cells that regulate inflammation (known as Tregs). In this study, Dr. Kasper’s team investigated how bacterial PSA affects specific Tregs via an immune system protein (known as Toll-like receptor 2, or TLR2) in mice with EAE.  Dr. Kasper’s team administered PSA to mice six days before inducing EAE, until nine days after EAE induction. They then analyzed which immune system signals contributed to PSA’s beneficial effects. The results show that bacterial PSA could expand a subset of Tregs that expresses the protein CD39. This expansion was dependent on TLR2. Signals from the protein CD39 were critical for the protective effects of PSA. CD39 was essential for the function of Tregs. When CD39 was deleted from mice, PSA was not able to control inflammation, and the ability of disease-causing immune cells was enhanced. This study presents exciting findings on how gut bacteria may be able to modulate the immune attack in MS. If the results are confirmed in further study, CD39 may present a possible target for treatments that can stop the immune attack and enhance the protective capability of T regs. Ultimately, this could lead to the testing of an oral treatment that provides beneficial bacteria to reset the immune system in people with MS.  about possible links between the gut, the immune system, and MS.

Current research in , , , and , together with , provide support for the notion that MS is not a single disease but rather a spectrum. There are three : , characterized by periods of neurological worsening following by remissions; , in which there is gradual progression of neurological dysfunction with fewer or no relapses; and , in which neurological deterioration is observed from onset. is a convergence of pathology with physiology. Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state; whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Referring to MS, the physiology refers to the different processes that lead to the development of the lesions and the pathology refers to the condition associated with the lesions. Multiple sclerosis can be pathologically defined as the presence of distributed (or ) in the disseminated in time (DIT) and space (DIS). The gold standard for MS diagnosis is pathological correlation, though given its limited availability, other diagnosis methods are normally used. The scleroses that define the disease are the remainders of previous demyelinating lesions in the CNS white matter of a patient () showing special characteristics, such as confluent instead of perivenous demyelination. There are two phases for how an unknown underlying condition may cause damage in MS: An unknown soluble factor (produced by CD8+ T-cells or CD20+ B-cells), creates a toxic environment that activates microglia. with hidden damage appear in the brain and spine (). Some clusters of activated , axonal transection and myelin degeneration are present. appear and immune cells infiltrate, causing . and axon destruction. Multiple sclerosis differs from other in its confluent cortical lesions. These types of lesions are the most specific finding for MS, being exclusively present in MS patients, though currently they can only be detected at autopsy. Most MS findings take place inside the white matter, and lesions appear mainly in a periventricular distribution (clustered around the ventricles of the brain). Apart from demyelination, the and deep (GM) nuclei can be affected, together with diffuse injury of the NAWM. GM atrophy is independent of classical MS lesions and is associated with physical disability, fatigue, and cognitive impairment in MS At least five characteristics are present in CNS tissues of MS patients: beyond classical white matter lesions, production with , an environment fostering immune cell persistence, and a disruption of the outside of active lesions. The that give the name to the condition are produced by healing old lesions. MS is active even during remission periods. -like aggregates in the are formed only in secondary progressive MS. and correlate with the degree of subpial cortical demyelination and brain atrophy, suggesting that they might contribute to cortical pathology in SPMS These follicles are composed mainly of infected B-cells. Four different damage patterns have been identified in patient's brain tissues. The original report suggests that there may be several types of MS with different immune causes, and that MS may be a family of several diseases. Though originally a biopsy was required to classify the lesions of a patient, since 2012 it is possible to classify them by a blood test looking for antibodies against 7 lipids, three of which are cholesterol derivatives are believed to both impair myelin repair and aggravate inflammation. It is believed that they may correlate with differences in disease type and prognosis, and perhaps with different responses to treatment. In any case, understanding lesion patterns can provide information about differences in disease between individuals and enable doctors to make more effective treatment decisions. According to one of the researchers involved in the original research, ""Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T-cell-mediated or T-cell plus antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity."" The scar presents and around blood vessels, with preservation of , but no signs of activation. The scar presents T-cells and macrophages around blood vessels, with preservation of oligodendrocytes, as before, but also signs of activation can be found. This pattern has been considered similar to damage seen in NMO, though AQP4 damage does not appear in pattern II MS lesions Nevertheless, pattern II has been reported to respond to , which points to something pathogenic into the blood serum. The infiltration in these cases convert this pattern into a candidate for research into autoimmune connections like anti-, anti- or About the last possibility, research has found antiMOG antibodies in some pattern-II MS patients. Pattern II pathogenic T cells has been shown to be different from others The functional characterization shows that T cells releasing Th2 cytokines and helping B cells dominate the T-cell infiltrate in pattern II brain lesions. The scars are diffuse with inflammation, distal , activation and loss of (MAG). It is considered atypical and an overlap between MS and . The scars do not surround the blood vessels, and a rim of preserved myelin appears around the vessels. There is evidence of partial remyelinization and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. At first, some researchers thought it was an early stage of the evolution of the other patterns. Recently, it is thought that it represents ischaemia-like injury with absence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF, related to the pathogenesis of . The scar presents sharp borders and degeneration, with a rim of normal-appearing . There is a lack of oligodendrocytes in the center of the scar. There is no complement activation or MAG loss. These differences are noticeable only in early lesions and the heterogeneity was controversial for some time because some research groups thought that these four patterns could be a consequence of the age of the lesions. Nevertheless, after some debate among research groups, the four patterns model is accepted and the exceptional case found by Prineas has been classified as NMO For some investigation teams this means that MS is an immunopathogenetically heterogeneous disease. The latter hypothesis is further corroborated by a recent study that demonstrated significant differences in routine cerebrospinal fluid findings between patients with pattern I lesions and patients with non-pattern I lesions, including a lack of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, in most pattern II and III patients. Finally, some previously diagnosed with pattern II MS were later found to have in fact MOG-IgG-related encephalomyelitis, suggesting that both the current clinicoradiological diagnostic criteria for MS and the histopathological criteria for MS may be insufficiently specific. This was already indicated by previous studies that found a relatively high rate of false diagnoses of MS among patients with AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or MOG encephalomyelitis. Currently antibodies to and in sera, detected by , can be used as markers of the pathological subtype given by brain biopsy. Another development in this area is the finding that some lesions present defects that could distinguish types of lesions. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration are observed together. Some clinical trials have shown that the inflammation produces both the relapses and the demyelination, and that neurodegeneration (axonal transection) is independent from inflammation, produces the accumulative disability, and advances even when inflammation and demyelination are delayed. It seems that neurodegeneration is produced by damaged , which in turn comes from activated . Currently it is unknown what the primary cause of MS is; if MS is a heterogeneous disease, the lesion development process would not be unique. In particular, some PPMS patients having a special clinical course named could have a special genetic cause and a different development process. Several types of damage appear in the brain: and characteristic . Changes in NAWM include axonal injury without demyelination, low-grade inflammation, and microglial and astrocytic activation Illustration of the four different types of glial cells found in the central nervous system: ependymal cells, astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes MS lesions develop inside NAWM areas. Their shape is influenced by their activity The most accepted sequence of events is first NAWM appearance, then the so-called pre-active lesions, with activated microglia, and finally the BBB breakdown, which enables the entry of T-cells to the CNS. This marks the beginning of an autoimmune attack which destroys myelin in active lesions. When the attack is resolved, a characteristic is formed by astrocytes. Current models can be divided into two categories: and . In the former, it is hypothesized that a problem in CNS cells produces an immune response that destroys myelin and subsequently breaks the BBB. In latter, an external factor produces BBB leaks, enters the CNS, and destroys myelin and axons. Whatever the underlying condition for MS is, it appears that damage is triggered by an unknown soluble factor in the CSF, potentially produced in meningeal areas; this factor can diffuse into the cortical parenchyma and destroy myelin either directly or indirectly through microglia activation. The evolution of a preactive lesion is related to reactivity. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cell surface markers have been observed in NAWM and ""initial"" lesions, corresponding to a so-called loss of homeostatic microglial equilibrium. Some authors report active lesion formation before BBB breakdown; others point to as a factor of the breakdown. MS lesions are driven mainly by . It has been found recently that B-cells are also involved. The () is a protective barrier that denies the entrance of foreign material into the nervous system. BBB disruption is the moment in which penetration of the barrier by lymphocytes occur and has been considered one of the early problems in MS lesions. The BBB is composed of which line the walls of the central nervous system. Compared to normal endothelial cells, the cells lining the BBB are connected by and which form in order to create a barrier to keep out larger molecules such as proteins. In order to pass through, molecules must be taken in by or an alteration in the BBB permeability must occur, such as interactions with associated like ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3. The BBB is compromised due to active recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes and their migration across the barrier. Release of allow for the activation of on the lymphocytes and monocytes, resulting in an interaction with the endothelial cells of the BBB which then activate the expression of to degrade the barrier. This results in disruption of the BBB, causing an increase in barrier permeability due to the degradation of tight junctions which maintain barrier integrity. Inducing the formation of tight junctions can restore BBB integrity and reduces its permeability, which can be used to reduce the damage caused by lymphocyte and monocyte migration across the barrier as restored integrity would restrict their movement. After barrier breakdown symptoms may appear, such as . Activation of and lymphocytes and their migration across the barrier may result in direct attacks on myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic demyelination event observed in MS. After demyelination has occurred, the degraded myelin sheath components, such as and , are then used as identifying factors to facilitate further immune activity upon myelin sheaths. Further activation of cytokines is also induced by macrophage and lymphocyte activity, promoting inflammatory activity as well continued activation of such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have detrimental effect on BBB integrity. Recently it has been found that BBB damage happens even in non-enhancing lesions. MS has an important vascular component. Postmortem studies of the BBB, especially the vascular endothelium, show immunological abnormalities. Microvessels in periplaque areas coexpressed HLA-DR and VCAM-1, some others HLA-DR and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and others HLA-DR and ICAM-1. The damaged white matter is known as ""Normal-appearing white matter"" (NAWM) and is where lesions appear. These lesions form in NAWM before blood–brain barrier breakdown. BBB can be broken centripetally (the most normal) or centrifugally. Several possible biochemical disrupters were proposed. Some hypotheses about how the BBB is compromised revolve around the presence of compounds in the blood that could interact with vessels only in the NAWM areas. The permeability of two , and , may be involved in BBB breakdown. Breakdown is responsible for infiltration and inflammation in the brain. Monocyte migration and -mediated attachment to brain microvascular endothelia is regulated by through . Using iron nanoparticles, involvement of macrophages in BBB breakdown can be detected. A special role is played by . These increase BBB T-cell permeability, specially in the case of MMP-9 and are supposedly related to the mechanism of action of interferons. Whether BBB dysfunction is the cause or the consequence of MS is disputed, because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. (Adhesion molecules could also play a role in inflammation) In particular, one of these adhesion proteins involved is (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, also called ), and is under study as therapeutic target. Another protein involved is , which is found also in brain biopsies of inflammatory elements, and which could be related to the behavior of under therapy. Some molecular biochemical models for relapses have been proposed. Normally, gadolinium enhancement is used to show BBB disruption on MRIs. Abnormal tight junctions are present in both SPMS and PPMS. They appear in active white matter lesions and in gray matter in SPMS. They persist in inactive lesions, particularly in PPMS. A deficiency was implicated in this process. Uric acid added in physiological concentrations (i.e. achieving normal concentrations) is therapeutic in MS by preventing BBB breakdown through inactivation of . The low level of uric acid found in MS victims is manifestedly causative rather than a tissue damage consequence in the white matter lesions, but not in the grey matter lesions. Uric acid levels are lower during relapses. It is not known what causes MS. Several problems appear together with the white matter lesions, like cortical lesions and normal-appearing tissues. Several theories have been proposed to explain it. Some areas that appear normal under normal MRI look abnormal under special MRI, like magnetisation transfer MTR-MRI. These are called Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) and Normal Appearing Grey Matter (NAGM). The cause why the normal appearing areas appear in the brain is unknown, but seems clear that they appear mainly in the ventricles and that they predict the course of the disease. Given that MS lesions begin inside the NAWM areas, these areas are expected to be produced by the same underlying condition that produces the lesions, and therefore the ultimate MS underlying condition, whatever it is. Historically, several theories about how these areas appear have been presented: The search for an auto-antigen has taken a long time, but at least there is one reported. It is the enzyme This theory in part could also explain why some patients report amelioration under dietary treatment. (HERVs) have been reported in MS for several years. In fact, one of the families, was first discovered while studying MS patients. Recent research as of 2019 point to one of the HERV-W viruses (pHEV-W), and specifically one of the proteins of the that has been found to activate in vitro. Activated microglia in turn produces demyelination. Some interactions between the and the HERVs could be the trigger of the MS microglia reactions. Supporting this study, a against the viral capside () has shown good results in trials in phase IIb. Venous pathology has been associated with MS for more than a century. Pathologist noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around veins. Some other authors like pointed to venous obstructions. Mechanical flow: Later the focus moved to softer hemodynamic abnormalities, which were showing precede changes in sub-cortical gray matter and in substantia nigra. However, such reports of a ""hemodynamic cause of MS"" are not universal, and possibly not even common. At this time the evidence is largely anecdotal and some MS patients have no blood flow issues. Possibly vascular problems may be an aggravating factor, like many others in MS. Indeed, the research, by demonstrating patients with no hemodynamic problems actually prove that this is not the only cause of MS. Endothelium: Other theories point to a possible primary endothelial dysfunction. The importance of vascular misbehaviour in MS pathogenesis has also been independently confirmed by seven-tesla . It is reported that a number of studies have provided evidence of vascular occlusion in MS, which suggest the possibility of a primary vascular injury in MS lesions or at least that they are occasionally correlated. Venous insufficiency: Some morphologically special medullar lesions (wedge-shaped) have also been linked to venous insufficiency. BBB infection: It has also been pointed out that some infectious agents with positive correlation to MS, specially , can cause problems in veins and arteries walls CCSVI: The term ""chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency"" was coined in 2008 by Paolo Zamboni, who described it in patients with multiple sclerosis. Instead of intracranial venous problems he described extracranial blockages, and he stated that the location of those obstructions seemed to influence the clinical course of the disease. According to Zamboni, CCSVI had a high differentiating healthy individuals from those with . Zamboni's results were criticized as some of his studies were not blinded and they need to be verified by further studies. As of 2010 the theory is considered at least defensible A more detailed evidence of a correlation between the place and type of venous malformations imaged and the reported symptoms of multiple sclerosis in the same patients was published in 2010. Haemodynamic problems have been found in the blood flow of MS patients using Doppler, initially using (TCCS), pointing to a relationship with a vascular disease called (CCSVI). In 2010 there were conflicting results when evaluating the relationship between MS and CCSVI. but is important to note that positives have appeared among the blinded studies. CSF flow: Other theories focus in the possible role of flow impairment. This theory could be partially consistent with the previous one. Currently a small trial with 8 participants has been performed Whatever the underlying primary condition is, it is expected to be a soluble factor in the CSF, maybe an unknown or , or a combination of them. Also B-cells and microglia could be involved. In particular, it is known that B-cells of MS patients secrete an unknown toxin against oligodendrocytes It has been reported several times that CSF of some MS patients can damage myelin in culture and mice and have been recently brought into the stage. Whatever the problem is, it produces of neurons respecting astrocytes In 2012 it was reported that a subset of MS patients have a seropositive anti- status, which can represent up to a 47% of the MS cases, and the study has been reproduced by at least two other groups. In 2016 a similar association was reported for anti--2 If the existence of any of these subsets of MS is confirmed, the situation would be similar to what happened for Devic Disease and . MS could be considered a or a new medical entity will be defined for these cases. Some authors propose a primary neurodegenerative factor. Maybe the strongest argument supporting this theory comes from the comparison with NMO. Though autoimmune demyelination is strong, axons are preserved, showing that the standard model of a primary demyelination cannot be hold. The theory of the trans-synaptic degeneration, is compatible with other models based in the CSF biochemistry. Others propose an oligodendrocyte stress as primary dysfunction, which activates microglia creating the NAWM areas and others propose a yet-unknown intrinsic CNS trigger induces the microglial activation and clustering, which they point out could be again axonal injury or oligodendrocyte stress. Finally, other authors point to a cortical pathology which starts in the brain external layer () and progresses extending into the brain inner layers If as expected MS is an heterogeneous disease and the lesion development process would not be unique. In particular, some PPMS patients have been found to have a special genetic variant named which would behave differently from what here is explained. It is due to a mutation inside the , an to mutation in the position p.Arg415Gln, in an area that codifies the . Several for diagnosis, disease evolution and response to medication (current or expected) are under research. While most of them are still under research, there are some of them already well stablished: : They present proteins that are in the CNS or in blood. Those that are in CNS but not in blood suggest a diagnosis of MS. A polyspecific antiviral immune response against the viruses of , and found in 1992. In some reports the MRZR showed a lower sensitivity than OCB (70% vs. 100%), but a higher specificity (69% vs. 92%) for MS. (FLC). Several authors have reported that they are comparable or even better than oligoclonal bands. Golan, Daniel; Staun-Ram, Elsebeth; Miller, Ariel (2016). ""Shifting paradigms in multiple sclerosis"". .

2ff79889-eab0-4b19-97b8-7216d3066379,"— Three new drug approvals, vaccination guidelines, and more by Multiple sclerosis (MS) news in 2019 focused largely on drugs -- new drugs, old drugs, drug costs, and treatment strategies -- but new vaccination guidelines and biomarker research also earned headlines. The FDA approved three new MS drugs in 2019, most recently (Vumerity), a new oral fumarate drug to treat relapsing forms of MS. Like dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), which was approved in 2013 for relapsing MS, diroximel fumarate is designed to convert to monomethyl fumarate in the body, but appears to produce fewer gastrointestinal side effects than the older drug. Diroximel fumarate relied in part on dimethyl fumarate's safety and efficacy data and findings from the ongoing, open-label phase III study to win FDA approval. Two other MS drugs earned OKs this year, the first being (Mayzent) for adult patients with relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. The drug was the first oral agent for secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with active disease and the first treatment specifically approved for patients with active SPMS in over 15 years. The FDA based its decision on the phase III trial results, which demonstrated that patients with SPMS had 21% lower risk in time to 3-month confirmed disability progression with siponimod than with placebo. The other FDA nod went to (Mavenclad), also for active secondary progressive disease and relapsing MS, based on results of the phase III clinical trial. In that study, cladribine (also a chemotherapy drug) significantly decreased the number of MS relapses and reduced the progression of disability versus placebo. The drug had a to its ultimate approval. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Arzerra) -- approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia but investigational for MS -- outperformed teriflunomide (Aubagio) in reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR), according to two phase III studies presented at the 2019 European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) congress in September. In the ASCLEPIOS I trial, monthly injections of ofatumumab led to a 50.5% relative reduction in ARR compared with oral teriflunomide; in ASCLEPIOS II, the ARR with ofatumumab bested that of teriflunomide by 58.5%. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), which was approved in 2017 for relapsing and primary progressive MS, and rituximab (Rituxan), which is used off-label in MS, ofatumumab depletes B cells; but unlike those drugs, ofatumumab can be self-injected. Also reported at ECTRIMS were new findings about , an investigational selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator, which outperformed teriflunomide in a head-to-head trial of adult relapsing MS patients. In the OPTIMUM phase III trial, oral ponesimod reduced ARR by 30.5% versus teriflunomide over about two years. The trial aimed to place ponesimod within the spectrum of the oral MS drugs, ""which are getting to be, more and more, the standard treatment,"" OPTIMUM researcher Ludwig Kappos, MD, of University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland, told Ocrelizumab showed real-world safety and effectiveness in data presented at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) forum in March. In a prospective study of patients who started treatment in 2017, ocrelizumab showed fewer adverse events than expected in six months of clinical practice. Also at ACTRIMS, an extension study of patients from the CARE-MS II trial showed that over eight years, alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) continued to show benefits in clinical outcomes, lesion load, and brain volume loss in relapsing-remitting MS. Interim data from the real-world ESTEEM study presented at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) annual meeting in June showed that dimethyl fumarate was effective and safe for black patients with relapsing-remitting MS. And in the phase IIIb ASSESS trial, also presented at CMSC, fingolimod (Gilenya) bested glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) at lowering relapses and disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS patients. A trial published in January showed that, in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting MS, than disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), though ocrelizumab and alemtuzumab were not included in the study. Also in January were the results of a three-cohort study that showed that patients treated initially with fingolimod, natalizumab (Tysabri), or alemtuzumab had a lower risk of converting to secondary progressive MS than patients who started with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (Rebif). ""The ditherers must take note,"" wrote editorialist Ari Green, MD, of the University of California San Francisco: ""The signs are strongly pointing to the to forestall damage. Waiting on the sidelines does not appear justified."" In real-life settings, an observational study in Wales found that starting produced better long-term outcomes. And higher-efficacy infusible therapies had a disproportionately larger effect in patients, a chart review of 1,000 patients at University of Colorado in Aurora presented at ECTRIMS suggested. At ACTRIMS, a small study looked at patients with and found they had similar times to relapses, inflammatory events, and disability progression as stable patients who remained on treatment. ""This data suggest that younger age goes along with more inflammatory disease activity and that is the critical group that needs to be treated with DMTs,"" said author Tanuja Chitnis, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, in an interview with ""And potentially after the age of 45 or 50, in stable patients, there may be opportunities to stop or step down DMTs."" Biomarkers that predicted long-term MS outcomes also racked up headlines. At ECTRIMS, researchers showed that levels of serum neurofilament light (NfL) increased six years before the clinical onset of MS. Research presented at ACTRIMS indicated that early levels of serum NfL may pinpoint which MS patients are at . And in a longitudinal study published this year, 15 years after a clinically isolated syndrome event, showing that spinal cord and gadolinium-enhancing lesions had consistent links with secondary progression development and physical disability. Two studies published this year assessed rising MS drug costs. One found that MS patients with private insurance paid 20 times more in 2016 compared with 2004; the other showed that prices of self-administered MS drugs more than quadrupled in 11 years and Medicare spending for Medicare Part D beneficiaries soared more than 10-fold during the same period. The American Academy of Neurology issued new indicating that most MS patients should receive recommended vaccinations, including yearly flu shots. A case-control study presented at ECTRIMS demonstrated that . ""In the general population, vaccinations are seen as a problem; there are lobbies in many countries against vaccinations,"" Mar Tintore, MD, PhD, of University Hospital Vall d'Hebron in Barcelona, Spain, told ""In MS patients, vaccinations are especially important. Now that we are using immunosuppressive drugs, we need to vaccinate our patients.""

Fortunately, times are changing and our acceptance of marijuana has paved the way for a better understanding of how it affects us. Myths about weed have run rampant since the days of reefer madness. Fortunately, times are changing and our acceptance of marijuana has paved the way for a better understanding of how it affects us. Recently, Dr. Kevin Hill author of “Marijuana: The Unbiased Truth about the World’s Most Popular Weed”, and addiction psychiatrist at the McLean Hospital held an “Ask Me Anything” forum on . Dr. Hill opened the forum to users who were curious about weed myths. Here are some of the abbreviated highlights from the forum. Q. What are the negative effects that can be seen on the mind stemming from long-term use? Has there been sufficient data collected in this regard? Major negative effects of long-term use include cognitive difficulties, worsening anxiety, worsening depression, and increased likelihood of expressing a psychotic disorder (not causing one). But we need more long-term studies, and the NIH is planning these studies as we chat today. Q. Are there any documented indirect deaths from Marijuana? Yes, deaths may result indirectly from marijuana use – someone may use poor judgment or get in a car accident in part due to their use. These indirect deaths would be hard to measure, though. Just because someone has THC in their system does not mean that THC causes an event to occur. Q. How do you feel about the use of marijuana during pregnancy? It would be difficult to do these studies for ethical reasons, but I think most agree that exposing the fetus to marijuana is a bad thing. There is some animal research showing that prenatal exposure to THC affects brain development. Q. What are the areas that you think there may be actual medical uses of marijuana (or marijuana-derived drugs)?  I think there is strong evidence supporting the use of mj or cannabinoids for chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. Early clinical trials of cannabidiol (one of the cannabinoids) for epilepsy are very positive. We need to do more studies of marijuana and cannabinoids as treatments for various medical problems. Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not MJ is, in fact, a gateway drug? In the US, when people say “gateway”, they imply a causal relationship. If you use marijuana, you will automatically move on to become addicted to other drugs later. I don’t think of it that way. People who have addiction problems at 25 or 45 often describe initial use of marijuana or alcohol or nicotine at an early age. I think, then, that early use of any of these substances increases the likelihood of future addiction. Q. What do you think about the criminals keeping it schedule 1? Should they be fired or frankly put in prison for ignoring the science? I don’t think marijuana should be schedule 1. Schedule 1 means 1) addictive– yes it is addictive for some people and 2) no medical value. I don’t think you can say at this point that marijuana does not have medical value. Q. Out of the adult patients you see for marijuana addiction, what fraction is self admitted? How does this compare to alcohol? Can you compare and contrast the addictions? Only about 6% of those seeking treatment for addictions say that mj addiction is their main problem. Hopefully this AMA with Dr. Hill gave you some more info on popular weed myths. He answers many more questions . What do you think about Dr. Hill’s answers? Let us know on .

48d72272-4480-4b0c-996e-e416389f45c6,"Effect of open label pulse cyclophosphamide therapy on MRI measures of disease activity in five patients with refractory relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis Maria Ida Gobbini, Mary E. Smith, Nancy D. Richert, Joseph A. Frank, Henry F. McFarland Objective. To evaluate the response to cyclophosphamide (CTX) of five patients who failed an average three treatments with multiple other therapeutic agents, using serial monthly MRI measures. Methods. Five patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and documented MRI disease activity were started on monthly pulse intravenous CTX at a dose of 1 g/m. CTX was administered without an induction phase according to the protocol similar to the treatment of lupus nephritis. The five patients were followed with monthly MRI and clinical evaluation for a mean of 28 months. Results. All the patients showed a rapid reduction in the contrast-enhancing lesion frequency and in three patients there was a decrease in the T2 lesion load within the first 5 months after starting CTX treatment. The administration of CTX during overnight hospitalization was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions.

2465aece-9b7b-47aa-8559-b8b69a13617d,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Everyone has stress and feels its effects. Short-term effects of stress include headaches, shallow breathing, trouble sleeping, anxiety, and upset stomach. Long-term (chronic) stress can raise the risk for heart disease, back pain, depression, constant muscle aches and pains, and a weak immune system. Chronic stress can affect your emotions and behavior. It makes you grouchy, impatient, less enthusiastic about your job, and depressed. To keep stress at a minimum and reduce its effects on your life, research shows it is helpful to find and practice healthy ways to manage it. Try these methods to see what works best for you. Start by sitting up straight. Breathe in so your rib cage expands, and then breathe out slowly. Breathing in this way relaxes muscles. This helps to reduce tension. It also reduces the likelihood of muscle and back pain. You can focus on a word, a mantra, or even your breath by focusing on your nostrils. Feel the breath coming in and going out. What you're trying to do is put the focus on something other than your problems. Do this for 10 to 20 minutes, twice a day. Sit or lie down, if you can, and close your eyes. Starting at your head, tense your face by clenching your teeth and furrowing your brow. Hold the tension for 5 seconds, then release it. Next, tense your shoulders by bringing them up to your ears. Hold for 5 seconds, then release. Tense your arm muscles and hold for 5 seconds, then release. Continue to tighten and release each group of muscles in your body until you reach your toes. Focus on the warmth and heaviness of your body as you relax. Breathe gently for a few moments, then open your eyes. Sit or lie down and close your eyes. For 5 to 10 minutes, imagine you're in a place you love. This may be the beach, the mountains, or the house you grew up in. Breathe slowly and deeply as you imagine what you see, feel, hear, taste, and smell in your special place. Be patient with yourself and with this process. It's important to find a method that works for you on an ongoing basis, not just when your life is out of control. Doing this regularly can give you a place of calm to return to when the going gets rough.",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-10.17437744140625,72

Objective: To assess whether elevated BMI is associated with accelerated retinal atrophy. Methods: In this observational study, 513 MS patients were followed with serial spectral-domain OCT for a median of 4.4 years. Participants were categorized as normal weight (BMI: 18.5–24.9 kg/m), overweight (BMI: 25–29.9 kg/m), and obese (BMI: ⩾30 kg/m). Participants with diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled hypertension and eyes with optic neuritis (ON) ⩽6 months prior to baseline OCT or during follow-up were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed with mixed-effects linear regression. Results: Obese patients (n = 146) exhibited accelerated rates of ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) atrophy relative to normal weight patients (n = 214; –0.57%/year (95% confidence interval (CI): –0.65% to –0.48%) versus –0.42%/year (95% CI: –0.49% to –0.35%); p = 0.012). GCIPL atrophy rate did not differ between overweight (n = 153) and normal weight patients (–0.47%/year vs –0.42%/year; p = 0.41).

Transverse myelitis can also affect bowel and bladder function. Transverse myelitis attacks tend to be more severe in NMO than in MS, causing more severe symptoms — although that is not always the case. A new blood test that measures antibodies to aquaporin-4 detects NMO in about 70 percent of cases.

The goal of PLEX is to lower the level of NMO-IgG in the blood.PLEX involves removing blood from the body through a needle and tubing. Through a series of steps, the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) is separated from blood cells and replaced with an artificial plasma substitute; the plasma substitute and blood cells are combined and returned to the body through an intravenous line.

A nested case-control study (Langer-Gould 2014) did not show an association between HepB vaccination, HPV vaccination, or any vaccination and the risk of MS and other central nervous system demyelinating disease in the next three years. A systematic review of immunization and the risk of developing MS (Farez, Correale 2011) found no increased risk of MS after vaccination with following agents: BCG, Hepatitis B, Influenza, Measles-Mumps-Rubella. The risk of MS appeared reduced after tetanus or diphtheria vaccination. A single retrospective case control study in 47 MS patients receiving VZV vaccination showed improvement in 29.8%, deterioration in 8.5%, and no change in 61.7%. Four patients developed a mild vaccine-associated chickenpox. The significance of this study is unclear at the present time. Q: Is there any evidence that vaccinations either cause or precipitate relapses of MS? There does not appear to be any evidence that vaccinations cause or precipitate relapses in people known to have MS. A practice advisory from the American Academy of Neurology (Rutschmann et al 2002) found strong evidence against an increased risk of MS exacerbation after influenza immunization. There is limited data related to other specific vaccinations increasing relapse rate. A randomized blinded trial of influenza vaccination in patients with relapsing MS showed no difference in attack rate between treated and placebo treated patients (Miller et al 1997). At the Mellen Center we recommend that patients get the influenza vaccination shot (not the FluMist live inactivated vaccine) annually. Our opinion is that the risk of influenza in the MS population outweighs any risk of the influenza vaccine. Note that each year’s vaccine varies, and so this may change depending on information emerging with future vaccination cycles. Q: What are the recommendations for vaccinations in adults now? Attached is the recommended Adult Immunization Schedule for the United States for 2016. There are no additional vaccination recommended for the MS population (see below for specific medications and vaccination recommendations). Our recommendation is that MS patients receive the standard schedule of vaccinations for their age and other individual characteristics unless they are on specific medications with an impact on response to vaccination (see below). MS patients should try to avoid live attenuated vaccines where possible (see below). Attachment - Q: Should any specific vaccinations or types of vaccinations be avoided and if so why? Inactivated vaccines are generally considered safe for people with MS including those taking a disease modifying therapy. Live attenuated vaccines are generally not recommended for a person with MS because their ability to cause disease is weakened but not totally inactivated. We note that this is a theoretical risk and that there is no high quality evidence showing an increased risk in the MS population of live attenuated vaccines at this time. Q: Do any of the DMTs we use have an effect on the safety or efficacy of vaccination? Corticosteroids, particularly long term daily use, might have an impact on the efficacy or response to vaccination. However, organ transplantation patients on long term steroids do not show an impaired immune response to influenza or pneumococcal vaccinations (Briggs 1980). The response has not been evaluated in MS patients, but generally corticosteroids are not used in an ongoing fashion other than as intermittent pulse therapy in MS. When patients with MS are treated with a course of steroids, at the Mellen Center we recommend deferring immunization until 6 weeks after steroids are completed. Interferons do not seem to interfere with immune responses in MS patients and may have an antiviral effect. In a prospective study of 88 MS patients treated with interferon beta-1a and 77 untreated patients with MS, similar proportions (93 and 90% respectively) developed protective immune responses after receiving seasonal influenza vaccination (Schwid et al 2005). There is no evidence that glatiramer acetate affects the safety or efficacy of vaccination (glatiramer acetate package insert). There is no evidence of an effect of natalizumab on the safety or efficacy of vaccination. A study evaluating immune responses in MS patients going onto fingolimod vs placebo showed that while most patients mounted an effective immune reaction, there was a lower response rate compared with placebo patients (Kappos et al 2015). Teriflunomide treated patients generally mounted an effective immune response to immunization with seasonal influenza vaccine (Bar-Or et al 2013). Patients with MS treated with daclizumab mount normal immune response to influenza vaccination (Lin et al 2016). See below for specific discussions of fingolimod and alemtuzumab. Other than specific recommendations for certain DMTs, there is no overall increase in safety risk for MS patients from vaccinations. Rituximab has been used off label for refractory MS and for neuromyelitis optica. At present there is no literature on vaccinations and rituximab specific to MS. Results of immunization in patients with rheumatic conditions on rituximab vary from preserved response to immunization (Bingham 2010, Arad 2011, rheumatoid arthritis patients) to reduced (Albert 2006, lupus patients). These studies are confounded by the immunological abnormalities in the patients prior to treatment. In light of the lack of data, at the Mellen Center we would recommend required immunizations be given 6 weeks prior to initiation of rituximab if possible. Q: Should any vaccines be used before starting DMTs and if so under what circumstances? Fingolimod (Gilenya), a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator approved for relapsing MS, may increase the risk of dissemination and potentially life threatening varicella zoster (VZV infections). At the Mellen Center we check for VZV antibodies before initiating fingolimod therapy. If immunity is not demonstrated by elevated VZV titers, we initiate chicken pox (two-step) vaccination prior to initiating fingolimod. Optimally checking for the development of VZV antibodies prior to beginning medication would be prudent. Having elevated VZV titers does against developing zoster infections (anecdotal communication). At the Mellen Center we recommend waiting 1 month after last VZV immunization to initiate fingolimod. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52. CD52 is a cell surface antigen present on T and B cells. Alemtuzumab depletes circulating T and B cells for variable amounts of time; over months T and B cell lines repopulate, with B cells usually repopulating over 6 months and T cells over 12 months. Because of this profound immunological effect, should not be used after initiation of alemtuzumab due to an increased risk of infection. Live attenuated vaccines include: Live Attenuated Flu Vaccine (LAIV, nasal spray), MMR, chickenpox, and Zostavax (herpes zoster). Vaccines which are not live include: tetanus toxoid boosters and injectable influenza vaccine. One study showed retained immune competence related to prior vaccination after treatment with alemtuzumab (McCarthy C, et al 2013). We recommend that any required vaccinations be given 6 weeks before initiating alemtuzumab to ensure an adequate immunological response before lymphocyte depletion. A similar recommendation is reasonable for other major immunosuppressive regimen (e.g. cyclophosphamide, bone marrow transplantation, rituximab, etc.). Q: Should patients having a relapse avoid immunizations? There is limited data on this group of patients. The National MS Society advises that people experiencing a serious relapse affecting the ability to carry out activities should defer vaccination until 4 - 6 weeks after the onset of the relapse. Q: What about the use of shingles vaccine (Zostavax, live-virus to prevent shingles) in older patients with MS? There is no high quality evidence about shingles vaccine in the MS population. At present at the Mellen Center we recommend patients have this vaccination unless on immunosuppressing medications. This is consistent with recommendations from the National MS society. The CDC does not have specific recommendations for travel vaccination for the MS patient. Care should be taken with patients on strong immunosuppressing regimens similar to that for bone marrow transplant patients. Most patients with MS will not conform to this designation. Reviewing the data for travel immunization in immunocompromised individuals may be helpful in those patients on alemtuzumab, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, daclizumab or other major immunosuppressing medication regimens. At the Mellen Center we advise our patients travelling to at risk countries to seek infectious disease counselling before travelling. Ms relapse risk not increased; not recommended if immunosuppressed Insufficient data in MS, consider before immunosuppression Possibly associated with reduced risk of MS; no restrictions MS relapse risk not increased by vaccine; not recommended with immunosuppressive therapy; initiate prior to starting fingolimod if no immunity National MS Society recommendations on MS and vaccination The Academy of Neurology, in collaboration with the Immunization Panel of the Multiple Sclerosis Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines, published a summary of evidence and recommendations regarding immunizations and MS. They concluded that: The evidence supports strategies to minimize the risk of acquiring infectious diseases that may trigger MS relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations). The influenza, hepatitis B, varicella and tetanus vaccines are safe for people with MS. Decisions about the potential benefits and risks of any given immunization should be made in consultation with your healthcare providers, including your family physician and neurologist. People who are experiencing a serious relapse that affects their ability to carry out activities of daily living should defer vaccination until 4-6 weeks after the onset of the relapse. Inactivated vaccines are generally considered safe for people with MS, including those who are taking an interferon medication (Avonex®, Betaseron®, Extavia®, Plegridy™, Rebif®), Aubagio®, Copaxone®, Gilenya®, Glatopa®, Lemtrada®, Novantrone, Tecfidera® or Tysabri®. Live, attenuated vaccines are generally not recommended for a person with MS because their ability to cause disease has been weakened but not totally inactivated. People on therapies that suppress the immune system, such as Cytoxan, Imuran, Novantrone, Rheumatrex® and/or chronic corticosteroid therapy, should consult their neurologist before taking any live-virus vaccine. A person should not receive a live-virus vaccine following a course of Lemtrada. MS experts are not in agreement about the risks for a person with MS whose close family member receives a live-virus vaccine. The family should discuss with the neurologist how best to handle this situation. 2015-2016 Injectable Seasonal Flu Vaccine (includes H1N1) The 2015-16 inactivated seasonal influenza (flu) immunization is manufactured by several different companies under different brand names. Each is a single injection that provides immunity to three or four different flu viruses. Trivalent vaccines protect against three types of flu: the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus; the A/Switzerland/971/2013 (H3N2)-like virus; the B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (a B/Yamagata lineage virus). Quadrivalent vaccines protect against the same three viruses plus an additional B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus). The 2015-16 inactivated seasonal flu immunization is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for everyone over 6 months of age. The seasonal flu vaccine has been studied extensively in people with MS and is considered quite safe, regardless of the disease-modifying therapy they are taking. However, individuals being treated with Lemtrada® should be given the inactivated flu vaccine six weeks before receiving their Lemtrada infusion. A high-dose inactivated flu vaccine (Fluzone High Dose) is available for people over age 65. The Centers for Disease Control does not specifically recommend the high-dose vaccine for people over age 65 and the high-dose vaccine has not been studied in people with MS of any age. For these reasons, the National MS Society continues to support influenza vaccination (flu shots) for people with MS but recommends that only the standard dose be used. If additional data for Fluzone high dose in MS patients become available, the recommendation may be revised. FluMist is a live-virus flu vaccine (sometimes called LAIV for ""live attenuated influenza vaccine”) that is delivered via a nasal spray. This live-virus vaccine is not recommended for people with MS. Recommended for all children, adolescents, and adults at risk of contracting this potentially lifethreatening disease. In 2002 the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine (IOM) determined that there is no association between hepatitis B vaccination and the onset of MS. Designed to prevent the HPV 6, 11, 16 and/or 18-related cervical cancer, cervical dysplasias, vulvar and vaginal dysplasias, and condyloma acuminate in girls and women ages 9 to 26. One case report (Waldemann et al., 2009) described the onset of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following the second immunization with Gardasil and Sutton et al. (2009) reported five patients who presented with multifocal or atypical demyelination syndromes within 21 days of the second or third immunization (three of whom had previously experienced clinical isolated episodes of neurological dysfunction). However, a recent large-scale study of patient registries in Denmark and Sweden (see below) found no increased risk of developing MS among nearly 800,000 who received this vaccine. Use of Gardasil should be preceded by a discussion between patient and physician regarding benefits and risks. A live-virus vaccine to prevent shingles. MS neurologists do not recommend live-virus vaccines for people with MS because these vaccines can lead to an increase in disease activity. However, Zostavax is an exception because most people have had chicken pox earlier in their lives and therefore already have the virus in their bodies. Each person needs to discuss the potential benefits and risks of this vaccine with her or his healthcare provider. While this vaccine has not been studied in people with MS, it should be made available to any person with MS directly exposed to smallpox as the risks associated with not getting vaccinated would be too great. This vaccine should be considered by people with MS who have never had chicken pox, lack evidence of prior immunity, and are considering starting an MS medication that has the potential to suppress cell mediated immunity – for example, Gilenya (fingolimod) and Lemtrada (alemtuzumab). The vaccine should be taken six weeks before starting the MS therapy. Studies of Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness in People with MS Some, but not all, immunizations have been evaluated for safety and efficacy in people with MS: A study by the Vaccines in Multiple Sclerosis Study Group published in 2001 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that vaccination for tetanus, hepatitis B or influenza did not appear to increase the short-term risk of relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) in people with MS. A study by the National Immunization Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published in the Archives of Neurology in 2003, found that vaccination against hepatitis B, influenza, tetanus, measles, or rubella did not increase a person’s risk of developing MS or optic neuritis (which is often a first symptom of MS). A small, unblinded study, published in the Archives of Neurology in 2011, of people with relapsingremitting MS who received the yellow fever vaccination prior to travel, found a significantly increased risk of MS relapses during the six weeks following the vaccination when compared to the remainder of the two-year follow-up period. For people with MS who must travel to areas where yellow fever is common, the increased relapse risk needs to be carefully weighed against the likelihood of exposure to yellow fever – which is a potentially fatal illness. A study of nearly four million girls and women identified in nationwide patient registries in Denmark and Sweden, published in JAMA, found no increased risk of developing MS among nearly 800,000 who received quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil), designed to prevent cervical cancer. A review of data from the complete electronic medical health records of Kaiser Permanente Southern California between 2008 and 20011, published in JAMA Neurology, found no long-term association of vaccines with MS or any other acquired central nervous system demyelinating disease.

Multiple Sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system. It involves an abnormal response of the body’s own immune system. MS gradually destroys the myelin, which is the protective covering of the nerve fibers. Progressive nerve damage can then lead to permanent damage. The course of MS and the symptoms vary from person to person. MS is one of the most common neurological disorders. There are approximately 2.3 million people with MS worldwide. The cause of MS is unknown and there is no cure.

Med. 2000;343:938–952 [3] National Multiple Sclerosis Society,https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/MS-FAQ-s Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is the first episode of neurological symptoms experienced by a person, lasting at least 24 hours. The person may experience a single sign or symptom, or more than one at the same time. Not everyone who experiences CIS goes on to develop MS, but CIS can be an indicator for it. Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, with 85% of people with MS being initially diagnosed with RRMS. People experience attacks or exacerbations of symptoms (‘relapses’), which then fade or disappear (‘remission’). Relapses can last for varying periods – from a few days up to months – and then the disease may then be inactive for months or years. Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS) is a secondary phase of RRMS that may develop years or even decades but most people who have RRMS will transition to SPMS. In SPMS there is progressive worsening of symptoms over time with no definite periods of remission. SPMS can also be categorized by whether it is active or not active (someone who has active MS experiences relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS) is not very common and is characterized by steadily worsening symptoms and disability from the start, rather than sudden attacks or relapses followed by recovery.

We induced crEAE by injecting 3x10 myelin basic protein-(MBP) sensitized lymph node cells into adult female SJL/J mice. Fifty-one mice, divided randomly into 4 groups, were used in the first trial. Two groups received IGF-I (a gift of Cephalon, Inc.) 0.6 mg/kg/d subcutaneously from day 7 to day 16 and the other two groups received placebo injections. IGF-I treatment reduced clinical deficits during the first attack and during 2 subsequent relapses. Image analysis of immunostained and histological sections showed that IGF-I treatment reduced BBB defects and both the numbers and sizes of inflammatory, demyelinating, and demyelinated lesions. Twelve mice that had recovered from their first attack were used in our second trial to evaluate possible adverse effects of prolonged treatment with a higher dose of IGF-I. Six received 1.2 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks (days 19- 63). No adverse effects of IGF-I treatment were identified. The eyes, hearts, livers, and kidneys of IGF-I-treated mice were normal histologically and their spleen also appeared normal except for mild to moderate microscopic increases in lymphopoesis. Our results suggest that prolonged IGF-I treatment is well tolerated and that the anti-inflammatory effects of IGF-I have a major role in reducing clinical deficits and lesion severity in crEAE.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare but serious brain infection that is caused by the JC virus (JCV). It is estimated that at least 50% of the general population has been exposed to JCV, but infection is generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals. However, in immunocompromised patients, including those taking certain multiple sclerosis disease modifying therapies (DMT), JCV can mutate and infect the brain, specifically oligodendroglial cells, and result in PML. Other possible central nervous system manifestations of JCV include cerebellar granule cell neuronopathy, encephalopathy, and meningitis. When should a clinician caring for an MS patient suspect PML? PML should be suspected in MS patients with new characteristic lesions on MRI or sub-acute (evolving over weeks or months) progressive neurologic symptoms in the setting of immunosuppressive medications known to increase the risk of PML. PML should be considered in patients who develop atypical MS lesions or otherwise typical new lesions for MS while on natalizumab. The clinical symptoms of PML can vary significantly between patients, and may include weakness, paresthesias, cognitive or behavioral changes, gait dysfunction, speech/language difficulties, visual field defects, or seizure. However, PML can be asymptomatic for many months prior to clinical presentation with new lesions on MRI, so patients should be monitored closely via MRI and undergo lumbar puncture for JCV PCR if there is a suspicion for PML. Anti-JVC Antibody Negative Natalizumab exposure (months) Patients w/o prior immunosuppressant use Anti-JVC Antibody Negative Natalizumab exposure (months) Patients with prior immunosuppressant use If PML is suspected, clinicians should hold DMT pending further evaluation, depending on the level of suspicion. A clinician may repeat a brain MRI in 1 month if a new subcortical lesion develops, but further immediate evaluation with lumbar puncture for JCV PCR is reasonable depending upon the patient’s JCV antibody status and clinical history. Although serum JCV antibody testing can help assess the risk of PML, it does not indicate the presence or absence of PML. The diagnosis of PML depends on integration of imaging, clinical, and laboratory evidence, as there is not a single test that establishes a diagnosis of PML (Table 1). Brain MRI most commonly demonstrates one or more T2/FLAIR hyperintense and T1 hypointense lesions involving the subcortical and juxtacortical white matter (Figure 1). Up to half of patients with MS disease modifying therapy-associated PML exhibit faint rim enhancement with gadolinium administration, so this is not uncommon at the time of PML diagnosis. PML lesions can be multifocal or unifocal. The dynamic nature of MRI findings can contribute to diagnosis, since PML becomes unlikely if the MRI manifestations are stable over weeks to a few months on serial imaging. Both PML and an inflammatory response to the virus will result in dynamic changes on MR images, while static findings are inconsistent with this disease. CSF examination is an integral component of evaluation for PML, but CSF JCV PCR testing methods have variable sensitivity. The Cleveland Clinic Laboratory JCV PCR is a send out test to the Mayo Clinic, which reports a lower limit of detection of 10 copies/microliter of CSF.7 Another ultra-sensitive multiplex JCV PCR is available via the National Institutes of Health.8 If PML is highly suspected and the Mayo Clinic CSF JCV PCR is negative, one should repeat the lumbar puncture for ultra-sensitive PCR at the NIH, which requires frozen samples. The Cleveland Clinic lab typically does not freeze CSF upon receipt, so specific instructions are necessary (see Appendix). Although diagnosis can generally be established via clinical history, MRI, and CSF analysis, brain biopsy is sometimes obtained when the diagnosis of PML has not been confirmed. Prior to biopsy it is worthwhile to repeat the CSF sampling at least once unless the rate of progression suggests the need to immediately sample tissue in an effort to find an alternative diagnosis. Histopathological examination of brain tissue confirming PML will demonstrate characteristic demyelination, bizarre astrocytes, and oligodendroglial nuclear inclusions seen with PML. These findings should be confirmed with specific histopathology or molecular analysis. Tissue PCR for JCV is also performed in biopsy specimens to support association of the brain lesion with JC virus. Evidence supporting the diagnosis of PML Subacute onset of weakness, paresthesias, cognitive or behavioral changes, gait dysfunction, speech/language difficulties, or seizure ≥1 T2/FLAIR hyperintense and T1 hypointense lesions involving the subcortical and juxtacortical white matter, some may exhibit faint rim enhancement Atypical MS lesions or even typical lesions for MS while on natalizumab CSF JCV PCR (commercial or ultrasensitive/quantitative PCR at NIH) positive Histopathology: demyelination, bizarre astrocytes, and oligodendroglial nuclear inclusions Tissue PCR for JCV positive What are mimics of PML that should be considered in this evaluation? In the process of evaluating a patient with suspected PML, other etiologies to consider include Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), CNS vasculitis, VZV leukoencephalitis, neoplasm (metastases, glioma, and lymphoma), HSV encephalitis (especially in the setting of seizure and temporal lobe lesions), autoimmune encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis relapse. What is the appropriate treatment for natalizumab-associated PML? Natalizumab should be immediately discontinued, and the patient should be hospitalized for urgent plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis expedites clearance of natalizumab, accelerating restoration of leukocyte transmigration across the blood brain barrier. A course of five 1.5-volume exchanges, performed every other day, is recommended to ensure that natalizumab levels are reduced sufficiently to allow lymphocyte migration into the CNS. Modern apheresis management typically uses lower volume exchanges (i.e. 1-volume), which may then require more exchanges. These protocol differences should be discussed with laboratory medicine. Other CNS manifestations of JCV infection (cerebellar granule cell neuronopathy, meningitis, and encephalitis) should be treated similarly. However, the impact of plasmapheresis on long-term outcomes is somewhat unclear. What is the appropriate treatment for PML in the setting of other MS DMTs? Rare cases of PML have been reported with use of other MS DMTs, both independent of and following use of natalizumab. In the setting of monoclonal-antibody associated PML (including rituximab or ocrelizumab), plasmapheresis should be considered if PML is diagnosed within 2 months of drug administration, but the evidence supporting accelerated drug clearance is not as strong as with natalizumab. For PML associated with other MS DMTs (including fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate), immediate discontinuation of the immunosuppressive agent is recommended. If PML is diagnosed in the setting of teriflunomide, an accelerated drug clearance protocol (for example, activated charcoal administration) should be instituted. There is no current evidence supporting the use of IVIg or GM-CSF in treatment of PML. However, in anti-CD20-associated cases of PML, one could consider IVIg administration if a patient has low levels of IgG. This management strategy also applies to other CNS manifestations of JCV infection. What is the evidence supporting use of other medications (mirtazapine, maraviroc, and mefloquine) in management of PML? Several medications have demonstrated in vitro effects against JCV replication and cell entry, including mirtazapine and mefloquine. However, the evidence for their clinical effectiveness is limited. Maraviroc, a CCR5 chemokine receptor antagonist, is hypothesized to reduce PML-associated IRIS, and is discussed further below. Of these medications, mirtazapine appears to be the most promising, particularly in natalizumab-associated PML. Given its potential survival benefit and low likelihood of side effects other than somnolence, we recommend initiation of mirtazapine 30 to 45mg daily, with a maximum dosage of 60mg daily . We do not recommend routine use of mefloquine at this time due to potential psychotropic side-effects. Recommended Dosing of Adjuvant Medications in PML Management 30 to 45mg daily, with a maximum dosage of 60mg daily CCR5 antagonist, potentially reducing severity of IRIS* What is IRIS and why should we be concerned about it? Although immune reconstitution is desired for management of PML and results in better outcomes, Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) is a potentially dangerous amount of acute and sometimes fulminant inflammation in the brain that should be treated. IRIS usually follows withdrawal of immunosuppression and causes clinical deterioration associated with the patient’s immune response reacting to the newly-recognized JCV infection in the CNS. Severe IRIS is generally characterized by both clinical and radiographic worsening. Mellen Center Approach: PML Diagnosis & Management Brain MRI may demonstrate gadolinium enhancement at the site of PML lesions due to breakdown of the blood brain barrier from the inflammatory response. The increasing degree of inflammatory activity seen with IRIS portends poor prognosis, and therefore warrants treatment. Specifically, the immune response to JCV-infected oligodendroglia is hypothesized to injure uninfected oligodendroglia. It is also important to consider early MS disease activity as a possibility in the months following PML, but within 6 months of diagnosis MRI changes are likely related to PML and/or IRIS. Generally, IRIS is managed with intravenous methylprednisolone to suppress the immune response and therefore its potentially dangerous brain inflammation. Given the need for immune reconstitution for control of JCV infection, the balance between immune response against JCV infection and immunosuppression to moderate IRIS can be challenging. If a patient with PML develops clinical symptoms of IRIS and MRI confirms inflammation (i.e. increase in T2 hyperintensities, usually with gadolinium enhancement), IV methylprednisolone should be administered (1g IV daily for 3 days). Periodic clinical and MRI reassessment should be performed to follow response to therapy, and IV methylprednisolone can be repeated every 4 weeks if needed for clinical manifestations of IRIS. Isolated MRI changes without clinical worsening do not necessarily warrant change in management. Maraviroc, a CCR5 chemokine receptor antagonist, is hypothesized to reduce the severity of IRIS by decreasing recruitment of CCR5 positive lymphocytes into the central nervous system. The clinical effectiveness of maraviroc has not been established, though there are case reports suggesting potential benefit. Potential side effects include hepatotoxicity, infections, and skin hypersensitivity reactions, which can be severe. We recommend starting maraviroc, 300mg twice a day, at the time of PML diagnosis. Depression is commonly seen in patients who develop PML and should be treated with antidepressants and psychotherapy. Given the potential antiviral benefit of mirtazapine, this is often considered as a first-line treatment of depression. Seizures are occasionally seen, although can be subtle, particularly if they arise from the frontal or temporal lobes. Although some clinicians utilize antiepileptic mediations prophylactically, we generally advise against this approach and instead start antiepileptic medications only after a confirmed seizure has occurred. What is the prognosis of PML secondary to MS therapies? If patients can overcome the initial PML infection and subsequent IRIS, then the long-term prognosis is variable but can be good. In general, residual neurological deficits are common. In patients with natalizumab-associated PML, survival is estimated to be approximately 75% overall. Factors associated with better prognosis include younger age at diagnosis and lower pre-PML disability. Early recognition and diagnosis of asymptomatic PML with appropriate management also portend better prognosis.19 However, clinical stability typically takes 3-6 months after the diagnosis of PML is made. If a clinician desires to send a CSF sample for ultrasensitive JCV PCR at the NIH, several additional steps must be taken: The Cleveland Clinic lab should be instructed to freeze at least a 1ml aliquot of CSF upon receipt, and that it must be frozen for transport The clinician should place an order for an extra tube, and the information in the comments section should be populated by the Epic SmartPhrase “.nihjcv,” which should be available to all Mellen Center physicians. This SmartPhase contains all necessary information about the test, sample handling, and shipping instructions. A specific form for the NIH must be completed regarding the patient’s history and sample being sent, and should be sent to the Cleveland Clinic lab with the sample. This forms is available on the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute shared drive at ”, along with detailed shipping instructions for the sample.

The MS health-care field has entered an era of exponential knowledge growth in which better understanding of the immunologic dysregulation of the disease has translated into an expanding array of treatment options. It is estimated that, if it has not already, within the next decade the demands of a growing MS patient population will outstrip the number of professionals dedicated to the management of this chronic, lifelong disease. Therefore, there is a pressing need to attract and retain clinicians in this dynamic field. In response to this need, the Foundation of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers organized a 2-day colloquium, a Mentorship Forum, on January 23-24, 2015, bringing together talented internal medicine and neurology trainees from across North America with an interest in MS and neuroimmunology. This article highlights the rationale for the MS Mentorship Forum, its structure and content, and its outcomes. We believe that the stage has been set to interest young, promising clinicians in learning more about MS and to encourage them to consider a career in this field. In so doing, we hope to contribute to the development of the next generation of MS experts to make a palpable difference in the lives of those affected by MS.

Lee, , Sharmilee Gnanapavan, Gavin Giovannoni, Tongguang Wang, Joseph P. Steiner, Marie Medynets, Mark J. Vaal, Valerie Gartner, Avindra Nath Background: The cause of neurodegeneration in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis is unknown. We investigated the impact of specific neuroinflammatory markers on human neurons to identify potential therapeutic targets for neuroprotection against chronic inflammation. Methods: Surface immunocytochemistry directly visualized protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors on neurons in human postmortem cortex in patients with and without neuroinflammatory lesions. Viability of cultured neurons was determined after exposure to cerebrospinal fluid from patients with progressive multiple sclerosis or purified granzyme B and IL-1β. Inhibitors of PAR1 activation and of PAR1-associated second messenger signaling were used to elucidate a mechanism of neurotoxicity. Results: Immunohistochemistry of human post-mortem brain tissue demonstrated cells expressing higher amounts of PAR1 near and within subcortical lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis compared to control tissue. Human cerebrospinal fluid samples containing granzyme B and IL-1β were toxic to human neuronal cultures. Granzyme B was neurotoxic through activation of PAR1 and subsequently the phospholipase Cβ-IP3 second messenger system. Inhibition of PAR1 or IP3 prevented granzyme B toxicity. IL-1β enhanced granzyme B-mediated neurotoxicity by increasing PAR1 expression. Conclusions: Neurons within the inflamed central nervous system are imperiled because they express more PAR1 and are exposed to a neurotoxic combination of both granzyme B and IL-1β. The effects of these inflammatory mediators may be a contributing factor in the progressive brain atrophy associated with neuroinflammatory diseases. Knowledge of how exposure to IL-1β and granzyme B act synergistically to cause neuronal death yields potential novel neuroprotective treatments for neuroinflammatory diseases.

These findings have generated the idea that MS should be understood as a disease of the whole brain, not just the white matter. While it is no doubt the case that many different pathways are ultimately involved in the destruction of brain tissue that occurs in MS, the implications of the accumulated evidence for understanding disease pathophysiology – and hence the overall significance of these imaging findings – are doubtful. Here, I argue that the principled use of imaging can, in fact, address questions about the genesis of these whole-brain abnormalities, rather than simply describe them.

22384df7-c9b5-493e-bf9d-95efc12f7456,"Are you sure your patient has Multiple Sclerosis? What are the typical findings for this disease? A first attack of neurological symptoms in children with central nervous system (CNS) demyelination may represent a monophasic illness or be the first presentation of a chronic relapsing disorder such as multiple sclerosis (MS), a condition that is increasingly being recognized and diagnosed in childhood. Cranial, and possible spinal imaging, and lumbar puncture are key diagnostic tests. Acute management of demyelination usually involves initiation of corticosteroid therapy with IVIG, with plasma exchange required in severe cases. Once the diagnosis of MS is confirmed, immunomodulatory treatment should be initiated with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. Safety and tolerability data support the use of these MS immunomodulatory therapies in pediatric MS. Neurological symptoms attributable to demyelination commonly include the following: Unilateral or bilateral visual loss (optic neuritis) Motor, sensory or urological deficits localizing to the spinal cord (transverse myelitis) Brainstem deficits (typically internuclear ophthalmoplegia or INO) Other monofocal or polyfocal neurological deficits Polyfocal neurological deficits with encephalopathy (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or ADEM) Optic neuritis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute monocular or binocular visual loss (see Figure 1). Ophthalmological features of optic neuritis typically include: Optic disc edema is sometimes seen, but may be absent in retrobulbar optic neuritis. Neurological abnormalities outside of the optic nerve may also be present. Neuroimaging, usually brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, reveals optic nerve thickening and/or enhancement in approximately 55% of children (see Figure 2) and visual evoked potentials are abnormal in up to 88% of children. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive technique for measuring retinal nerve fiber thickness, may aid in diagnosis. Transverse myelitis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute onset of weakness and sensory deficits localizing to the spinal cord (see Figure 3). Typical symptoms of transverse myelitis include: Bilateral (may be asymmetric) lower extremity weakness Sensory paresthesias or hyperesthesias with a spinal sensory level L’Hermitte’s symptom (pain with forward neck flexion) indicating cervical spinal involvement Bowel or bladder dysfunction (lesions above the sacral cord cause urinary retention and constipation) While many children will experience partial TM, others may have complete cross-sectional cord involvement with clinical features of flaccid paresis with hyporeflexia and later hyperreflexia. Longitudinally-extensive transverse myelitis (spanning > 3 spinal segments) or transverse myelitis with concurrent or rapidly sequential optic neuritis should prompt consideration of neuromyelitis optica (see Figure 2). Of note, approximately 10% of children with MS have longitudinally-extensive spinal cord lesions. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) may be useful to confirm a spinal cord localization. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is defined by the presence of polyfocal neurological symptoms and signs with encephalopathy (either behavioral change or alteration in consciousness). Symptoms of ADEM are often preceded by a febrile illness or viral prodrome. ADEM may be the clinical manifestation of age-dependent demyelination as the majority of individuals with ADEM are under the age of 10 years. While ADEM is most commonly a monophasic illness, relapsing and multiphasic forms have been described. International consensus definitions for monophasic and relapsing forms of ADEM describe the clinical features and time course in detail. Typical brain MRI findings of ADEM are shown in Figure 4. Other presentations of acute demyelination include: Polyfocal neurological deficits without encephalopathy The cornerstone of MS diagnosis is demonstration of demyelination that is disseminated in both space and time. Specific consensus definitions have been proposed for childhood-onset MS requiring either (i) two discrete demyelinating attacks separated by at least 30 days and involving two separate areas of the CNS; (ii) one attack consistent with demyelination and MRI evidence of new lesions meeting criteria for dissemination in time (see below); or (iii) two non-ADEM attacks in a child with an initial ADEM presentation. As in adult-onset MS, MRI may be used as a surrogate marker for dissemination in space and time, facilitating earlier disease diagnosis. Specifically, new criteria proposed by Polman et al (2010) require that dissemination in space on MRI be defined as involvement of greater than or equal to one T2 lesion in at least two of the following four areas: i. periventricular ii. juxtacortical iii. infratentorial and iv. spinal cord with symptomatic brainstem or spinal cord symptoms not contributing towards the total lesion count. Dissemination in time may be fulfilled by demonstration of either: i. new T2 and/or gadolinium-enhancing spinal cord lesion(s) on follow-up MRI (irrespective of timing of baseline MRI) or ii. simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions. More than 95% of children with multiple sclerosis initially experience a relapsing-remitting disease course with reported relapse rates between 0.38 and 1.2 per year. Primary progressive disease (neurological deterioration in the absence of discrete relapses) is rare in the pediatric age group. Children with MS appear to experience more frequent relapses as compared to adult-onset MS patients in the first several years following diagnosis. The time from a first attack to a second neurological event is highly variable and may be greater in younger children. Childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase, defined by disability progression in the absence of clear relapses, between 15 to 20 years following first attack. What other disease/condition shares some of these symptoms? Acutely, it is important to exclude central nervous system infection especially if neurological symptoms are accompanied by fever, encephalopathy, meningismus or other systemic signs. The combination of brain and/or spinal cord white matter abnormalities with multiple cranial neuropathies should raise suspicion of central nervous system Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis), especially if there has been recent travel to an endemic area or if a tick bite is recalled. While rare, malignancy, such as central nervous system lymphoma, should also be considered, particularly if MRI features are atypical for demyelination, or if spinal fluid examination reveals atypical cells. A history of persistent or increasingly frequent headache, seizures, or lumbar puncture evidence of an elevated opening pressure should prompt consideration of isolated CNS vasculitis or CNS vasculitis associated with systemic disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). Children with CNS vaculitis usually respond to steroid therapy and experience an exacerbation of symptoms as steroids are tapered. Distinguishing vasculitis from MS has important therapeutic implications as vasculitis management requires long-term immunosuppression with medications such as cyclophosphamide. Neurological symptoms associated with renal or liver impairment, fever, lymphadenopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation should prompt consideration of macrophage activation syndrome. High serum ferritin and fasting triglycerides, unexpectedly low ESR, and the presence of hemophaocytic cells in a bone marrow aspirate or CSF are diagnostic. Repeated attacks of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis should raise suspicion of the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). The diagnosis of NMO is aided by testing for antibodies directed against Aquaporin 4. NMO is important to consider as the disease often has an aggressive course with rapid disability progression, requiring potent immunosuppressive agents to maintain disease control. See Figure 6. MS is thought to be a disease influenced by both genetic predisposing factors and environmental triggers of aberrant CNS directed autoimmunity. It is increasingly believed that MS predisposition is established during childhood, as evidenced by studies of immigrants to areas of high MS prevalence who acquire the MS risk of their new community only if they immigrated prior to age 15 years. What laboratory studies should you request to help confirm the diagnosis? How should you interpret the results? There is no laboratory test that can confirm MS diagnosis. The majority of laboratory evaluations are performed to exclude other conditions – a requirement prior to considering MS as the etiology of a patient’s clinical symptoms. However, several investigations are helpful in supporting an MS diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is important in confirming the presence of CNS demyelination and for excluding other diagnoses. At first presentation, more that 50% of children with MS will have an elevated CSF leukocyte count, typically below 30 cells/microliter with a lymphocytic predominance. A higher leukocyte count or neutrophilic predominance should prompt consideration of CNS vasculitis, CNS infection, or NMO. CNS vasculitis is also often associated with an elevated opening pressure. CSF oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in CSF, but not detected in serum, may be found in up to 90% of childhood-onset MS patients at first presentation as compared to approximately 10% of children with ADEM or NMO. Isoelectric focusing methods have the highest diagnostic yield. It should be noted that MS patients may initially have undetectable CSF OCBs, but may develop them later in the disease course. Testing of visual, brainstem auditory, and visual evoked potentials is often useful for confirming the clinical demyelinating syndrome and for documenting subclinical disease. Almost 50% of children with MS in one study demonstrated subclinical abnormalities in at least one of these evoked potential pathways, most commonly visual. Visual evoked potentials are abnormal in over 85% of children with clinical optic neuritis. Would imaging studies be helpful? If so, which ones? Neuroimaging, especially brain and/or spinal MRI with contrast, is valuable in confirming the presence of inflammatory CNS lesions and in excluding other possible diagnoses. Lesion characteristics of younger children may differ from older children, with younger MS patients being more likely to have ill-defined brain MRI lesions and grey matter involvement. Large lesions with indistinct borders are typical for ADEM. One recent study suggested that the presence of two of the following MRI features may aid in distinguishing children with MS from those with ADEM with 81% sensitivity and 95% specificity: i. presence of T1 black holes ii. absence of diffuse bilateral pattern iii. presence of two or more periventricular lesions. MRI has now been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for MS in children and adults and allows a diagnosis of MS even at first presentation if there is the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions suggesting disease dissemination in time. Classification of Childhood Demyelinating Syndromes An algorithmic approach to the classification of childhood demyelination has been published (Banwell, Lancet Neurol 2007) and Yeh (Nature Reviews Neurol 2009 ). If you are able to confirm that the patient has Multiple Sclerosis, what treatment should be initiated? The care of children with MS revolves around management of acute relapses and longer-term immunomodulation with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. The acute management of a first attack of demyelination or MS relapse usually relies on initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Doses in the range of 20-30 mg/kg IV per day (maximum 1 g per dose) for 3 to 5 days are typically used. Mild relapses that are not distressing to the patient and do not impair functioning may require supportive management, but not pharmacological therapy. Serum glucose, urine glucose, and blood pressure should be monitored during corticosteroid treatment. If children improve, with this initial course but have an incomplete resolution of symptoms, an oral prednisone taper starting at 1 mg/kg/day for 2-3 weeks could be considered. If children do not significantly improve or clinically worsen during the course of steroid therapy, evidence from published case series suggest that IVIG may be of benefit with a typical dose of 2 g/kg administered over 2 to 5 days. If symptoms of demyelination are severe and potentially life-threatening (for example, severe encephalopathy or respiratory depression), there is class I evidence in adult MS patients for the use of plasma exchange (PLEX), which is typically administered as 5 to 8 exchanges over 10 days. Class I evidence in adult-onset MS exists for the following therapies: interferon beta 1a, interferon beta 1b, and glatiramer acetate. Route of administration, doses, potential adverse effects, and associated laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Figure 5. While there have been no formal randomized-controlled trials of interferons or glatiramer acetate in children with MS, available case-series level evidence suggest that these treatments are safe and well-tolerated in childhood. Children who are receiving interferon treatments should have serum white blood cell counts and liver enzymes monitored monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Thyroid function should be monitored yearly. Sexually active patients should be counselled regarding contraceptive use due to potential teratogenicity of some of these agents. Second-line therapies are offered to families if frequent relapses occur despite treatment with one of the first-line agents, or if treatment with these agents causes intolerable side effects. Cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, azahtioprine all have case-series level evidence to support their use in childhood MS. Case series have also recently been published reporting natalizumab use in pediatric MS patients. Fingolimod (FTY 720) has recently been licensed for use in adult-onset MS patients and increased efficacy and convenience of oral administration may make this an attractive therapeutic option for pediatric MS patients. The safety of this medication in children for whom the immune system is still maturing has not yet been definitively established and fingolimod does not have regulatory approval for use in children. Emerging therapies including cladribine, rituximab, alemtuzumab, dacluzumab, laquinimod and ocrelizumab also have the potential for improved efficacy and tolerabiltiy as compared to interferons or glatiramer acetate but the risks of life-threatening infection and malignancy must be carefully considered, especially for pediatric MS patients. What are the adverse effects associated with each treatment option? Corticosteroid therapy may be associated with the development of hypertension and hyperglycemia. Many children experience gastrointestinal irritation that can be reduced with use of H2 blocking agents. Agitation, mood disturbances, sleep disruption and personality changes are common in patients on high doses of corticosteroids, but typically resolve as doses are reduced. Longer-term use may be associated with osteopenia, weight gain, and adrenal suppression. Given that long-term (ie: more than 3 weeks) of corticosteroid therapy is not recommended and repeated monthly intravenous corticosteroids failed as a model for MS disease modulation, corticosteroids are reserved for acute relapse therapy. IVIG infusion may be associated with headache, nausea, flushing, back pain, and hyptotension. If any of these occurs during an infusion, the infusion rate may be slowed or the medication discontinued. Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids may be useful in preventing these symptoms. Rarely, IVIG may be associated with acute renal failure, cardiac failure, or thrombosis. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been described in patients with IgA deficiency. Aseptic meningitis is a well-described complication of IVIG administration. As in treatment with other blood products, transmission of infectious agents is possible. Treatment with PLEX may be associated with hypotension, pulmonary edema, metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte abnormalities (ex: hypocalcemia or hypokalemia) and therefore requires administration by a trained team of individuals and close monitoring. Anaphalaxis is rare but can occur as can significant hemorrhage (from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and infection. Side effects of commonly used first-line immunomodulatory therapies are summarized in Figure 5. What are the possible outcomes of Multiple Sclerosis? Almost 95% of children with MS experience a relapsing remitting course with attacks consisting of subacute onset of neurological symptoms separated by periods of relative disease quiescence. While recovery after an acute relapse is expected, residual deficits often perist. Persistent neurological deficits may significantly affect daily functioning. After a period of between 15 to 20 years, childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase where there is disability accrual in the absence of discrete relapses. The goal of immunomodulatory treatment is to reduce relapse rate and long-term disabilty. The available first-line therapeutic agents have a similar efficacy in reducing relapse rates by approximately 18-30%. Medications differ in terms of route of administration, frequency of administration, and side effect profiles and therefore treatment choice must be individualized. Fatigue significant enough to limit daily activities and to affect school performance is experienced by up to 40% of children with MS. Non-pharmacological measures such as scheduling key activities for early in the day, and brief daytime napping may be sufficient for some MS patients, but pharmacological therapy is often required. Modafinil prescribed at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily and increased as needed up to 100 mg twice daily is often an effective pharmacological therapy. Childhood MS occurs during key academic years and ongoing CNS inflammation may interfere with learning and memory. Between 50- 70% of children with MS demonstrate evidence of cognitive impairment with formal testing. Cognitive impairment has been associated with younger age at first attack and longer disease duration. Impaired learning and scholastic difficulties have longer-term implications for global functioning and vocational choices. Children with MS may experience bowel and/or bladder dysfunction as well as sexual dysfunction. Mood disorders, most commonly depression, are often identified in pediatric MS patients. Health care practioners should be comfortable discussing these issues with adolescent patients. Childhood MS is being increasingly recognized and diagnosed. While the true incidence of pediatric MS remains to be precisely defined, it is estimated that 3-10% of all MS patients experience their first symptoms prior to the age of 18 years. Multiple sclerosis in both children and adults has been reported in many countries worldwide, but there is marked regional variation in MS prevalence. There is a well-described latitude gradient in MS, with greatest MS prevalence reported in countries further away (in either direction) from the equator. Early life place of residence appears to correlate with MS risk. A study of adult-onset MS patients demonstrated that immigration from areas of low reported MS prevalence (India and Pakistan) prior to the age of 15 years was associated with higher risk of being later diagnosed with MS as compared to immigration after age 15. A single center Canadian study of adult and childhood-onset MS patients showed that the two groups shared the common experience of having spent most of the childhood years in Canada, irrespective of self-reported familial ancestry. One of the factors that may explain regional variations in MS risk and especially the latitude gradient is sunlight exposure and consequent serum vitamin D status. Studies in adults have shown that MS risk is inversely related to daily oral vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. A study of twins discordant for MS diagnosis showed that co-twins who reported higher sunlight exposure were less likely to subsequently develop MS. Risk of adult-onset MS is higher for individuals born in the spring as compared to the fall, suggesting that maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy may be an important determinant of MS risk. Both retrospective and prospective studies in children have shown that low serum 25(OH)D levels at first presentation are correlated with increased risk of MS diagnosis. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been implicated as a contributing factor to MS development in both children and adults. Three case-control studies in children have shown that children with MS more commonly demonstrate remote EBV seropositivity as compared to matched controls. One prospective Canadian study has shown EBV seropositivity at first attack of CNS demyelination to be more common in children later diagnosed with MS as compared to those individuals remaining monophasic. In seropositive individuals, antibody titres are also higher in children with MS as compared to controls. MS is more common in first-degree relatives of MS patients, as compared to the general population, and MS has a higher prevalence in monozygotic as opposed to dizygotic twins, suggesting that there may a genetic contribution to MS risk. The HLA DRB1 allele has been associated with increased risk of adult-onset MS in numerous studies. A recent prospective study in Canadian children with a first attack of central nervous system demyelination demonstrated that the HLA DRB1*15 allele was more common in those children later diagnosed with MS as opposed to children who remained monophasic. Several genome-wide studies have implicated other immune-related genes in MS, but all are felt to have a very low contribution to individual MS risk. What complications might you expect from the disease or treatment of the disease? Fatigue, cognitive impairment, and persistent neurological disability are all possible complications of MS in children (see above). Treatment-related side effects are discussed in the section describing therapies. Are additional laboratory studies available; even some that are not widely available? Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new non-invasive technique that enables measurement of retinal nerve fibre thickness. As significant numbers of axons are found in the retina, OCT is emerging as a potentially valuable tool in measuring the degree of axonal degeneration in MS. Applications of OCT in MS include estimation of visual prognosis after optic neuritis, demonstration of degree of axonal degeneration in MS patients without optic neuritis, and use as a surrogate outcome marker in MS treatment trials. To date, there is no known intervention that will prevent MS development. There is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency at first presentation of neurological symptoms increases risk of subsequent attacks and is associated with relapse rate in individuals with established MS. Future studies exploring the role of vitamin D supplementation are of considerable interest.

Resources:MS Society of Canada: National MS Society: . Ongoing controversies regarding etiology, diagnosis, treatment There is still considerable debate about definitions for many childhood demyelinating syndromes, especially recurrent and multiphasic forms of ADEM. It remains unclear whether these forms of ADEM represent discrete diagnostic entities with a favourable prognosis, or if these forms of ADEM represent an age-related early manifestation of MS. Treatment algorithms for childhood MS are largely derived from randomized controlled trials conducted in adults. There is a paucity of clinical trials that include pediatric participants. Inclusion of children with MS in large scale therapy trials will be increasingly important in the near future with the introduction of new potent immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments for whom the effects on the developing immune system have yet to be defined.

Koeleman, Javier Martin In this study, 1,833 systemic sclerosis (SSc) cases and 3,466 controls were genotyped with the Immunochip array. Classical alleles, amino acid residues, and SNPs across the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region were imputed and tested. These analyses resulted in a model composed of six polymorphic amino acid positions and seven SNPs that explained the observed significant associations in the region. In addition, a replication step comprising 4,017 SSc cases and 5,935 controls was carried out for several selected non-HLA variants, reaching a total of 5,850 cases and 9,401 controls of European ancestry. Following this strategy, we identified and validated three SSc risk loci, including DNASE1L3 at 3p14, the SCHIP1-IL12A locus at 3q25, and ATG5 at 6q21, as well as a suggested association of the TREH-DDX6 locus at 11q23. The associations of several previously reported SSc risk loci were validated and further refined, and the observed peak of association in PXK was related to DNASE1L3. Our study has increased the number of known genetic associations with SSc, provided further insight into the pleiotropic effects of shared autoimmune risk factors, and highlighted the power of dense mapping for detecting previously overlooked susceptibility loci.

2098dd21-a88a-4c70-a492-b8d41dc0ac32,"What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting For more than three decades, multiple sclerosis (MS) experts from around the world have gathered in a European city each fall to share the results of their research at the annual meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). This year’s gathering was held in Berlin, Germany, October 10-12, where the findings were presented from hundreds of studies on topics ranging from the safety and effectiveness of investigational medications to the role of diet in controlling symptoms of MS. Along with the annual meetings of organizations such as the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), the ECTRIMS meeting is an important forum for researchers and clinicians to compare notes, generate hypotheses, make plans for future research, and discuss how best to translate study findings into improved patient care. This ECTRIMS 2018 research update article highlights more than 30 studies with important implications for people with MS. While these studies represent only a small sampling of the research presented at ECTRIMS, they were selected for their relevance to the current and potential near-term management of MS, and with a view toward addressing a variety of topics. Accordingly, the study findings reported below are organized into eight categories: We hope this information will be of interest and value. For additional information about MS, symptoms, and symptom management, as well as MSAA’s programs and services, please visit or call . Questions for MSAA’s Client Services department may be emailed to . And as always, please note that your healthcare provider remains your best source of information on the medical and overall management of your MS, and should be consulted with any questions you may have or before making any changes to a treatment regimen or other aspects of your approach to living with MS. For readers who are not familiar with study protocol, to follow is a helpful listing that provides a brief explanation of the different clinical trial phases. Phase I studies are primarily concerned with assessing the drug’s safety. This initial phase of testing in humans is done in a small number of healthy volunteers, and is designed to determine what happens to the drug in the human body – how it is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. Once a drug has been shown to be safe, it must be tested for efficacy. This second phase of testing may last from several months to two years, and involve up to several hundred patients. Phase II studies are often “double-blinded,” meaning that the participants, medical staff, and investigators are not told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo. In a Phase III study, a drug is usually tested in several hundred to several thousand patients, usually in multiple medical facilities around the world. Phase III studies typically last two or more years. Only after a Phase III study is successfully completed can a pharmaceutical company request FDA approval for marketing the drug. Phase IV clinical trials are conducted after a drug has been approved. Participants are enrolled to further monitor safety and side effects, while evaluating long-term efficacy. Ongoing decline in relapse rate seen in long-term study of Gilenya People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who took Gilenya (fingolimod) for five years or more had low rates of disease activity during that period, with gradually decreasing relapse rates, researchers reported. The investigators drew on data from LONGTERMS, an open-label, single-arm, extension study assessing the ongoing safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 0.5 mg of Gilenya in RRMS patients who had participated in earlier clinical trials of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT). The LONGTERMS study evaluated 754 patients. Sixty-seven percent of study subjects were women, and the mean time since MS diagnosis was 4.8 years. The annualized relapse rate in the population declined from 0.26 at one year to 0.16 at five years and to 0.14 for those patients for whom data were available at the 10-year mark. Of the 697 patients for whom five-year data was available, 78 percent were free from confirmed disability progression in the six months prior to assessment. The most common adverse events reported were viral upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and hypertension. The most common serious adverse events were MS relapse, basal cell carcinoma, and pneumonia.  Charting rise in treatment-satisfaction scores with switch to Aubagio Patients switching to Aubagio (teriflunomide) from other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) showed improvements in treatment satisfaction up to 96 weeks after switching, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Phase III TENERE study extension and the non-interventional TAURUS-MS I study. Both studies employed the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), which was administered at baseline and every 24 weeks thereafter in the TENERE extension study, and at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 in TAURUS-MS I. More than 650 patients from the two studies switched to 14 mg/day of Aubagio after having been on other DMTs. From baseline (initiation of Aubagio) to week 96, Global Satisfaction scores increased for patients from both studies. The average change from baseline was 9.1 in TENERE and 15.3 in TAURUS-MS I, with both changes being statistically significant. Tecfidera altered composition of gut microbiome in 12-week study  Tecfidera (delayed-release dimethyl fumarate) altered the gut microbiome in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who took the oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) over 12 weeks. The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other microbes found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system. Recent research suggests that the composition of the microbiome, as defined by the presence and number of various microbes, may affect the course of MS. In a study involving 36 patients with RRMS, 17 types of microbes were significantly altered in MS patients compared with 165 healthy controls. In particular, people with MS had lower levels of compared to the healthy controls. Twenty-seven of the study participants received Tecfidera, while nine received an injectable DMT. At two weeks, subjects receiving Tecfidera reported a worsening of GI symptoms compared to baseline, but this impact on symptoms was not seen at 12 weeks. Meanwhile, at 12 weeks, the Tecfidera patients had an increased abundance of . Similar alterations were not seen in the participants receiving an injectable DMT. Researchers continue to investigate not only the role of the gut microbiome in MS, but also the impact that individual microbes may have on disease course. As those investigations continue, this study adds to the understanding of the interplay between MS medications and the composition of the microbiome. As the investigators note, “It could therefore be speculated that direct effects on the gut microbiome are part of the therapeutic actions” of Tecfidera. Exploring treatment outcomes in African Americans relative to Caucasian Americans Do treatment outcomes on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) differ between African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CA)? A team of researchers posed that question in the context of the widely held view that African Americans often have a more aggressive form of MS than Caucasian Americans, and therefore may require more efficacious therapies.   To find answers, those investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of the CombiRx study, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated combined use of interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate in relapsing-remitting MS. The CombiRx study followed patients for three years. Eighty-eight percent of the study’s 1,008 patients identified as Caucasian Americans, and 7 percent identified as African Americans. At the start of the study, the AA participants had worse disability and a higher total burden of brain/spine lesions than CA participants. Once on treatment, however, there was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. While that finding is welcome news, the researchers noted that there is a need to study larger numbers of African-American patients to further explore the relative efficacy of DMTs in the AA and CA populations. They added that research into the causes of disparity in disease burden prior to treatment also is warranted. Support for early initiation of Betaseron in clinically isolated syndrome Starting Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) sooner rather than later in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) yields benefits up to 15 years after initiation of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), researchers report. Investigators in the BENEFIT 15 study monitored long-term outcomes in people who had CIS and at least two lesions on MRI that were suggestive of MS. In an earlier, related study, those individuals were randomly assigned to receive Betaseron (early-treatment group) or placebo. After either two years or conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS), patients in the placebo group were offered Betaseron (delayed-treatment group). Of the 468 participants who had been randomized in the initial study, 261 enrolled in a follow-up study 15 years later. One hundred and sixty one were in the early-treatment group and 100 were in the delayed-treatment group. In the delayed-treatment group, Betaseron had been initiated an average 1.5 years after randomization. The annualized relapse rate in the full analysis set was 0.18 over 15 years. Notably, however, the risk of relapse in the early-treatment group was 19-percent lower than in the delayed-treatment group, and the risk for conversion to clinically definite MS by Year 15 was 31-percent lower. The researchers concluded that their results “support a sustained benefit of early intervention in reducing the risk of relapse and conversion to CDMS.” Tracking the efficacy of interferon beta-1a for up to 10 years With many people with MS now on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for several years, there is an increasing focus on the long-term safety and effectiveness of those medications. Researchers recently evaluated the ongoing efficacy of one of the first DMTs, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, in 1,240 individuals receiving care at four MS centers throughout Italy. (In the United States, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a is available as Rebif.) The primary endpoint of their study was the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) as measured by clinical relapse, confirmed disability progression, and MRI for brain/spine lesions. Seventy-one percent of the study participants were women, and the participants’ mean age at the start of treatment was 34.6 years. The patients were followed for an average of approximately 7.5 years. Seventy-four percent of patients remained on treatment at two-year follow-up, just under half were still on therapy at the 5-year mark, and 28 percent were on the medication after 10 years of follow-up. At two years, 44 percent of patients did not have evidence of disease activity, while 25 percent were free of disease activity at five years and 19 percent were at 10 years. The researchers concluded that those percentages constitute “further evidence of sustained interferon beta-1a efficacy in modifying the natural course of MS.” Plegridy use in real-world setting consistent with clinical trial findings A post-approval, real-world analysis of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) in 963 patients with relapsing-remitting MS yielded safety and efficacy findings consistent with those from the pre-approval clinical trials of the DMT. The interim analysis from the Plegridy Observational Program included data on 242 newly diagnosed individuals and 721 people who had been diagnosed one year or longer before study entry. The newly diagnosed (ND) patients generally were younger than their non-newly diagnosed (NND) counterparts (mean age 37.7 years versus 46.0 years) and had less disability, but had experienced more relapses in the prior year. Treatment discontinuation rates were similar for the two groups (31 percent for ND patients versus 32 percent for NND patients). The most commonly cited reasons for treatment discontinuation in both groups were adverse effects and lack of efficacy. The most frequently reported adverse effects were redness at the injection site and influenza-like illness. Eighty-two percent of newly diagnosed individuals and 85 percent of those who were non-newly diagnosed were relapse-free up to two years after starting Plegridy.   Glatiramer acetate slows disability progression for up to 10 years Glatiramer acetate, which is marketed as Copaxone and in generic formulations, including Glatopa, showed enduring benefit over the course of 10 years of therapy, making it a cost-effective option for long-term treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, according to British investigators. The researchers drew on clinical data and cost-effectiveness models to assess the impact of glatiramer acetate (GA) on patient health and health-system economics. The analysis included 752 people treated with GA and another 898 people with MS who were not treated. The investigators found that, relative to no treatment, GA use led to a 17-percent reduction in disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Further, among people treated with GA, there was only a 1.2-percent difference in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores in six-year and 10-year data. The study’s authors concluded that the 10-year analysis “continues to support the long-term efficacy of GA in terms of disability, based on EDSS, and utility with no apparent evidence of a waning in treatment effect” making it highly cost-effective based on prevailing prices in the United Kingdom.   Reductions in relapse rate, MRI disease activity after three-to-five years of Ocrevus Two studies of people with relapsing-remitting MS show that use of the disease modifying therapy (DMT) Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) for three-to-five years is associated with reductions in annualized relapse rate (ARR) and several MRI measures of disease activity, according to researchers. The studies followed patients who had participated in the Phase III OPERA I and OPERA II trials that led to FDA approval of Ocrevus. In those 96-week studies, patients were randomized to receive either Ocrevus or interferon beta-1a. Upon completion of the Phase III trials, patients were able to enter an open-label extension study in which they would either continue on Ocrevus, if they had been assigned to receive that medication initially, or switch from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus if they had been in the comparator group. Among those who received Ocrevus during the initial two-year trial and for three years afterwards in the open-label extension, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) declined from 0.13 in the year before the open-label extension to 0.07 at Year 3 of the extension (or five years, in total, from starting Ocrevus). For individuals who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the ARR decreased from 0.20 in the year before switching to 0.07 at three years post-switch. At five-year follow-up, the proportion of people with clinically defined disability progression was lower in those who had been on Ocrevus for five years than for those who had taken the medication for three years. Meanwhile, in people who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the adjusted number of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI was 0.48 lesions/scan prior to switching medications, and decreased to rates of 0.007, 0.004, and 0.004 after one, two, and three years, respectively, on Ocrevus. Individuals on Ocrevus for the full five-year period maintained low numbers of lesions on MRI. Compared to patients who started Ocrevus after two years on interferon beta-1a, those treated with Ocrevus from the outset had less brain atrophy as measured by whole brain volume, grey matter volume, and white matter volume on MRI. No MRI disease activity in most study subjects after six years on Lemtrada Most people with relapsing-remitting MS who began therapy with Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) after having received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in a clinical trial were free of MRI indications of disease activity six years after switching medications, researchers reported. The TOPAZ trial followed 143 patients who initially had received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in the Phase III CARE-MS study. These individuals entered an initial extension study in which they switched to Lemtrada, which was given in doses of 12 mg/day for five days at baseline, and then 12 mg/day for three days 12 months or more later. The participants were then eligible to enter TOPAZ, an additional five-year extension study. In TOPAZ, investigators had the option of giving these patients additional courses of alemtuzumab or another disease-modifying therapy as they thought necessary. Eighty-two percent of the participating patients completed Year 2 of TOPAZ (Year 6 after starting Lemtrada). Fifty-seven percent did not receive an additional dose of Lemtrada or another DMT during those six years. The annualized relapse rate at Year 6 after Lemtrada initiation was 0.19 percent. Further, 69 percent of patients were free of MRI disease activity, and 89 percent did not have new gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Meanwhile, safety results were consistent with those seen in Lemtrada-treated patients in the initial CARE-2 study and its two-year extension. Overall, researchers noted, Lemtrada improved clinical and imaging outcomes in patients who switched to the medication after receiving subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, and those improvements were sustained over six years in the absence of further treatment. Assessing the long-term safety and effectiveness of Tysabri An analysis of more than 6,100 people with relapsing-remitting MS who have taken Tysabri (natalizumab) for several years shows the long-term effectiveness of the medication and indicates that its safety profile remains consistent with ongoing use, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to characterize the Tysabri patient population and assess the medication’s impact on relapses and other measures of MS activity. At the time of the analysis, the program included 6,149 participants. Their median exposure to Tysabri was 38 doses, and median follow-up time was slightly over five years. Fifty-two percent of patients had discontinued the medication. The patients’ annualized relapse rate declined by 89 percent while on Tysabri, from 1.99 prior to starting the medication to 0.21. The greatest reduction was seen in the approximately 10 percent of patients who had not taken another disease-modifying therapy (DMT), but those who had taken one or two prior DMTs saw ARR reductions of 93 percent and 87 percent, respectively. Fourteen percent of these individuals experienced at least one serious adverse effect, with infections/infestations being the most commonly reported issues.   Evobrutinib shows favorable impact on lesion count, relapse rates Evobrutinib, or M2951, is an orally administered compound being investigated as a potential treatment for immune-mediated diseases including MS, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Evobrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the development and function of immune cells, including B lymphocytes and macrophages. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers announced 24-week results of a double-blind, randomized, 48-week, Phase II study of evobrutinib in patients aged 18 to 65 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) with relapses. In the study, 267 participants were randomized to receive evobrutinib 25 mg daily, 75 mg daily, 75 mg twice daily, placebo, or open-label Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate 240 mg twice-daily. (The Tecfidera group served as a reference arm in the study, and no formal comparisons were made between people in that group and those receiving evobrutinib or placebo.) The study’s primary endpoint was the sum of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 24 weeks was a key secondary endpoint, as were safety assessments. The primary analysis comparing the evobrutinib groups to the placebo group was planned to occur when all randomized patients either reached 24 weeks of treatment or had discontinued the study before that point. Ninety-one percent of patients completed 24 weeks of therapy. The study met its primary endpoint, with patients in the evobrutinib 75-mg once-daily and 75-mg twice-daily groups having significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions than placebo patients at each time point studied. For weeks 12-24, the mean total of such lesions was 3.85 in the placebo group, 4.06 in the evobrutinib 25 mg once-daily group, 1.69 in the evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily group, and 1.15 in the evobrutinib 75 mg twice-daily group. The evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily and 75 mg twice-daily groups also had greater reductions in the ARR than placebo. No treatment-associated infections or significant reductions in lymphocyte counts were observed in those receiving evobrutinib. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in more than 5 percent of patients, included increased liver-enzyme levels in patients receiving 75 mg of evobrutinib twice daily, but these changes were reversible and did not cause symptoms. French study details impact of biotin on disability measure, walking speed   Biotin is a vitamin involved in energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, including the activation of an enzyme in myelin synthesis. In the MS-SPI study, a high-dose, pharmaceutical-grade biotin known as MD1003 reversed MS-related disease disability in 13 percent of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). To assess the efficacy and safety of MD1003 in a real-world setting, as opposed to in a clinical trial such as MS-SPI, researchers monitored outcomes in primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients at a clinic in France. From January 2016 through May 2018, 220 individuals with progressive MS who were receiving care at the clinic in Toulouse, France, received 300 mg/day of the oral medication. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented data on the first 91 patients to complete one year of follow-up. Those patients’ mean age at baseline was 59.5 years. Sixty-two percent were females, and 70 percent had SPMS. The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline was 5.9, and their mean timed 25-foot walk time was 50.7 seconds. At the end of one year of treatment with MD1003, 23 percent of the participants had an improvement in their EDSS score and 23 percent had a 20 percent or greater improvement in the time it took them to walk 25 feet. During the one-year period, 11 percent of patients had active disease, such as a clinically defined relapse, a gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesion on MRI, or both. Researchers said, “This real-world study supports the growing body of evidence that MD1003 is an effective and safe treatment for PMS.”  Gauging the impact of ozanimod on early and advanced relapsing-remitting MS Ozanimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulator that targets two cell-surface receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5, suspected of playing a role in multiple sclerosis. The agent was evaluated in two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. In SUNBEAM, individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) received ozanimod on a daily basis (either ozanimod HCl 1 mg or 0.5 mg) or a weekly injection of interferon beta-1a for 12 months or longer. In RADIANCE, the participants were randomized to the same treatments, but for 24 months. More than 2,600 people participated in the trials. A post hoc analysis presented at the 2018 ECTRIMS meeting examined how outcomes in SUNBEAM and RADIANCE differed between patients with early RRMS and advanced RRMS. The designation of early MS was based on a composite baseline profile that included three years or less from diagnosis, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤3.5, and use of one or no disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The early MS group consisted of 1,392 patients, while there were 1,267 people in the advanced MS group. Thirteen hundred and ninety-two patients were included in the early MS group. Key differences between the two groups at baseline included median years since diagnosis (0.5 years for the early group and 5.7 for the advanced group), median EDSS (2.0 versus 3.5), mean relapses within the last year (1.4 versus 1.2), and mean count of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (1.77 versus 1.67). In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) was lower in those who received ozanimod than in patients who received interferon. In the early group, the ARR was 0.149 for those on 1 mg of ozanimod HCI, 0.200 for the ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg patients, and 0.285 for the interferon group. The annualized relapse rates in the advanced RRMS group were 0.217 for ozanimod HCI 1 mg, 0.277 for ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg, and 0.363 for interferon. MRI measures of disease activity also favored ozanimod over interferon. In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, individuals receiving either dose of ozanimod had lower mean numbers of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and new/enlarging T2 lesions at 12 months than patients receiving interferon. Surveying real-world experience with treating MS with rituximab Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and several forms of cancer. Because it depletes B cells, which are key components of the immune system, some neurologists prescribe rituximab to treat MS, although it currently does not have FDA approval specifically for use in MS. Investigators at the University of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain MS Center examined the safety and effectiveness of rituximab in 125 people with MS. The participants had an average age of 44 years and had an MS disease duration of slightly more than 10 years. Seventy-two percent were female; 62 percent had relapsing-remitting MS. With an average follow-up of 40.6 months, most individuals had six or seven rituximab infusions. While on rituximab, 16 percent of participants had infections requiring an emergency department visit, and 11 percent had infections necessitating hospitalization. Thirty-seven percent of patients had an infusion reaction on their first infusion that required interrupting the infusion, but that percentage fell to 14 percent on the second infusion. None experienced an infusion reaction that required hospitalization. Two individuals (1.6 percent of the total) were diagnosed with cancer after starting rituximab. While on rituximab treatment, 5 percent of patients had a clinical relapse, 2 percent had an enhancing lesion on MRI, and – based on detailed analysis – 8 percent of those with available MRI data had a new lesion on T2 imaging. Those findings prompted the researcher to conclude that rituximab appears to be a safe and effective option for long-term MS treatment. Two trials to examine the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS Two Phase III trials will assess the safety and efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody ofatumumab relative to Aubagio (teriflunamide) in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Like Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), ofatumumab targets the CD20 marker on the surface of B cells. The identically designed ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II trials have enrolled a combined total of 1,884 patients in 37 countries. Study participants will be randomized to receive either 20 mg subcutaneous injections of ofatumumab every four weeks (following an initial regimen of three 20-mg subcutaneous doses per week in the first 14 days) or 14 mg of Aubagio taken orally once daily. Annualized rate of confirmed relapses is the primary endpoint for both trials. Secondary outcomes include confirmed disability worsening and MRI-related measures. Enrollment for both studies has been completed. Both employ an adaptive design in which study duration is not fixed over a specified period of time but rather is dependent on reaching a pre-specified number of events. Phase II study to explore impact of opicinumab in targeted population Early-phase research into investigational agents often identifies patient groups that have a better response to treatment than other patient types. That was the case in the Phase II SYNERGY study of opicinumab. Opicinumab is a human monoclonal antibody active against LINGO-1, a protein that exercises an effect on the differentiation and regeneration of central nervous system cells. SYNERGY investigated the infused medication’s safety and efficacy as an add-on therapy to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS. The study found that a patient subpopulation (defined by disease duration and baseline MRI findings) was associated with an enhanced response to treatment. The Phase II AFFINITY trial is following up on those findings by taking a closer look at the impact of opicinumab in that patient population. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers provided an overview of the AFFINITY study’s design and demographics. AFFINITY is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 750 mg of opicinumab administered intravenously every four weeks compared to placebo as an add-on to DMTs. The trial will last for 72 weeks. The population being studied encompasses people aged 18-58 years with relapsing-remitting or secondary-progressive MS who have had MS for 20 years or less and who have Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 2.0 and 6.0. Further, the study’s inclusion criteria specify a clinical relapse in the last four to 24 months or brain MRI evidence of disease activity in the past two years. Because opicinumab is being studied as an add-on therapy, patients must be stable on interferon beta, dimethyl fumarate, or natalizumab for at least six months. Further, the patients must have brain imaging findings indicative of lower myelin content and more preserved tissue integrity in brain T2 lesions. The study’s main endpoint is Overall Response Score, an integrated assessment of disability improvement and worsening based on the EDSS and other measures. The study began in September 2017, and remains open to enrollment. Study investigators noted that AFFINITY is expected to enroll approximately 240 participants at roughly 150 sites in about 25 countries. Cladribine is an oral medication approved for use in several countries for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). It is not approved for that use in the United States. The medication has an unusual dosing pattern in that it is taken for up to 20 days over the course of two years. It also has an unusual mechanism of action: it targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to a reduction in the total count of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented an update on the safety profile of Cladribine Tablets in people with RRMS who took the medication as a monotherapy (without use of other MS agents at the same time). The study assessed data from three clinical trials and a patient registry, and reported information collected through May 2017. The analysis included data on 923 patients who received cladribine at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg and 641 patients who received placebo. It focused on the incidence of adverse events per 100 patient-years. The cladribine group had an average age of 36.5 years at study enrollment; two-thirds of the cladribine patients were women. The rate of serious treatment-emergent adverse events per 100 patient years through May 2017 was 3.88 for the cladribine group and 2.24 for the placebo group. Adverse events occurring at a higher rate in the cladribine group than in the placebo group included abnormally low levels of lymphocytes (a white blood cell) and serious infections, including serious herpes zoster. Study authors concluded that the updated safety profile “was generally consistent with that from two years prior,” adding, “No new major safety findings were identified in the updated dataset, where patients were followed for up to 10 years.”  Elezanumab: Phase I trial supports the need for larger studies A small, early-stage study of a monoclonal antibody directed at a new target in MS showed the medication to be well-tolerated, but did not demonstrate a clear-cut impact on symptoms, highlighting the need for further testing in a larger population, the study’s authors said. Elezanumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa), which has been shown to inhibit key processes in neurologic regeneration and functional recovery following inflammation or trauma. A Phase I placebo-controlled, 29-week study randomized 20 people with MS to one of three treatment groups or to a placebo group. Elezanumab was administered intravenously every four weeks for a total of four doses. Patients in the three active treatment groups received an initial “loading” dose followed by maintenance doses of either 150 mg, 600 mg, or 1800 mg of elezanumab. Twenty-five percent of all participants reported headaches. Most individuals receiving elazanumab did not report a clinically significant improvement in, or worsening of, MS symptoms. However, testing showed that as levels of elezanumab in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased, levels of free soluble RGMA decreased, while total RGMA (both free and antibody-bound) increased in step with CSF elezanumab exposure. Investigators concluded that, “Additional long-term studies are required to elucidate elezanumab efficacy in a more robust patient population.” Survey results reveal people with multiple sclerosis want more information on preventing brain atrophy Cognitive changes are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting more than half of those living with the condition. A new survey examines the topic of brain volume loss, known as brain atrophy, in people with multiple sclerosis. The survey, conducted by the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) and sponsored by Celgene, included more than 1,300 people with multiple sclerosis or someone responding on their behalf. Based on the survey findings that were presented at ECTRIMS 2018, maintaining cognitive function is the second most common concern for respondents. Only the prevention of physical disability progression was reported more often (45 percent). The survey findings also suggest that there is a high level of interest in better understanding how brain atrophy may impact disease progression. Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that they have not talked to any member of their medical team about brain atrophy, and only 20 percent reported being moderately or very satisfied with the amount of information available on potential ways to prevent brain atrophy. These study results indicate that additional education on the topic of brain atrophy is an area of interest to the MS community. Global initiative seeks to improve shared decision-making and communication between healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners Navigating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a global initiative that aims to improve outcomes for people with MS through the global adoption of strategies that optimize therapeutic decision-making. This initiative also aims to improve the way that healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners communicate around benefit and risk in the management and treatment of their disease. In order to better understand the potential barriers to effective communications and shared-decision making, the Navigating MS Steering Committee developed and distributed a survey to MS healthcare professionals and people with MS to identify potential and perceived barriers to successful shared-decision making in MS practice. A total of 73 neurologists, 104 nurses, and 1,184 individuals with MS have responded to the survey. Differences in the perception of neurologists, nurses, and people with MS regarding the adequacy of resources required for successful shared-decision making was demonstrated in the data received. Four main areas of contention were identified: lack of education, resources, time, and variable involvement of the interdisciplinary (healthcare) team. Nurse respondents indicated a perceived proficiency with shared-decision making and adequacy of education and training to fulfil this role. However, 73 percent of people with MS who responded indicated a strong preference for engagement with the neurologist in discussing the benefits and risks of treatment options. There was no clear consensus regarding the degree to which decision-making is accurately a collaborative process within the interdisciplinary team. Half of the nurses stated that the decisions were shared, although people with MS reported a lot of ambiguity and variation in how actively involved they were in the decision-making process. Despite neurologists stating the main barrier to shared-decision making was lack of time, 49 percent of people with MS strongly disagreed that time was a barrier to shared-decision making, with 60 percent of nurses reporting clinic timeframes as adequate. The disagreement in perceptions among clinicians and people with MS demonstrates an ongoing need to educate both healthcare professionals and patients on best practices in adopting a shared-decision making approach to discussions around treatment decisions. The Navigation MS initiative has received funding from Biogen, Celgene, EMD Serono, Genentech, Novartis, and Sanofi Genzyme.  It might seem paradoxical that people who experience fatigue should exert themselves in order to have more energy, but that is exactly what researchers found when conducting a study of 60 individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and fatigue. The 47 females and 13 males participating in the study had an average age of 30 years and a baseline mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score of 56.7. They were divided into two groups, balanced by age, gender and FSS score. People in the first group walked on a treadmill three times a week for six weeks, with the pace increasing from easy to brisk during each session and the duration of exercise increasing from 10-15 minutes initially to 25-32 minutes by the end of the study. People in the second group did not exercise but instead received amantadine, a medication used to treat movement disorders. While the people who did not exercise had no meaningful change in their FSS scores over the 12-week course of the study, those assigned to the exercise group saw their mean FSS score improve to 35.67 (versus 56.7 for all at the start of the study) at six weeks and to further improve to 29.11 at 12 weeks. The researchers concluded, “A specially designed walking exercise program with gradual increments in time and speed for 12 weeks can improve fatigue in RRMS patients. A long-term follow-up is recommended to verify the maintained effect on such improvement.”  Securing the long-term benefits of activity in MS: “Keep going!” Is the improvement in quality of life typically seen in exercise and activity programs for people with MS sustained after those programs end? That is the question a team of investigators posed in a study of 56 women with MS. Their answer: Yes, over the short term; and no, over the long term. The women, who had an average age of 34.5 years, were divided into groups, with some assigned to exercise and others to engaging in leisure-time activities such as making crafts. The women completed surveys to measure their sleep quality, fatigue, and depression, if any, at the start of the study and at several points afterward. Women in both groups showed improvement in sleep, fatigue, and depression at the end of the study and four weeks after its conclusion. By the 20-week mark after the study, however, MS symptoms had begun to increase, leading the researchers to comment that “continuous exercising appears to be of utmost importance for keeping symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances stably low.” There is growing evidence that diet plays a role in the MS disease course, but researchers continue to debate how best to study the issue in a scientifically rigorous manner. One practical concern is whether sufficient numbers of people with MS will be able to adhere to restrictive diets long enough for studies to yield valid results. A six-month pilot study involving 36 women with MS provides encouraging news in this regard. The study assigned 18 of the women to the intervention group – and to following a restrictive, modified Mediterranean diet for six months. The women in this group participated in training sessions with a nutritionist and attended monthly meetings to assess and encourage their adherence to the diet. The other 18 participants acted as a control group; they participated in educational seminars. All 18 women in the intervention group completed the study, with a 90.3-percent mean self-reported rate of adhering to the study diet. At the time of the ECTRIMS meeting in early October, 14 of the 18 women in the control group had completed the six-month study, three more were on track to finish in the weeks just ahead, and there was only one anticipated drop out. Sixteen of the 18 women in the intervention group reported that their overall health had benefited from following the study diet, with 14 women reporting benefit in terms of specific MS symptoms. The intervention group subjects also showed greater improvement than the women in the control group on measures of fatigue and MS impact. The researchers concluded, “It is feasible to enroll MS patients into a rigorous dietary intervention study requiring significant commitment and randomization and reasonable to expect high adherence to this type of dietary program utilizing educational methods to promote adherence.” They added, “Larger-scale clinical trials to assess the role of diet for symptom management and even as a disease modifier in MS are feasible and warranted.” Exploring the impact of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet on MS The benefits of a ketogenic diet – a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan – have long been promoted by some people with MS and their physicians, while others have said that there has not been adequate research to support the approach. A recent pilot study sought to add to the knowledge base on the subject by assessing how following a ketogenic diet for six months affected 20 people with relapsing-remitting MS. Researchers reported that no subjects experienced worsening diseases – as assessed by clinical symptoms and brain MRI – while on the diet. Further, fatigue and depression scores improved from baseline, and body-mass index and insulin levels declined. While additional data is being collected, those findings prompted the investigators to conclude that ketogenic diets appear to be “safe, feasible, and well-tolerated” in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Despite the old saying, misery doesn’t actually appear to love company  The more social support a person with MS enjoys, the less pain is likely to interfere with his or her life – even as the intensity of pain increases. That is the bottom-line finding of a study involving 196 people with MS who reported experiencing pain. Study participants had an average age of almost 54 years; 82 percent were women and 18 percent were men. Researchers assessed the participants’ degree of social support, pain intensity, and pain interference at the start of the study and again after an average of roughly 3.5 years. As would be expected, as the intensity of pain changed, so did the extent to which pain caused interference in a person’s life. However, the study also found that “higher levels of perceived social support [are] associated with subsequent improvements over time in pain interference in individuals with MS and pain, even when controlling for changes in pain intensity.” In simpler language, the more friends, family members, and other meaningful relationships a person has in his or her life, the less he or she will experience interference from pain, even when the pain is intensified. Conversely, the investigators found that “lower levels of social support prospectively predict increases in pain interference.” Commenting that their findings “are consistent with other research indicating multiple health benefits from the presence of social support,” the study’s authors noted the importance of investigating means to enhance such support for people with MS who are experiencing pain. Pain and sleep issues are top reasons for cannabis-based product use in people with MS Roughly one in five people with MS surveyed by researchers at a Canadian hospital reported using cannabis-based products (CBP) on a regular basis, with pain and sleep problems as the most commonly cited reasons for use. Investigators at the University of British Columbia MS clinic distributed surveys on CBP use to 600 patients attending the clinic from January to March 2018. Two hundred and fifty-nine participants completed and returned the survey. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were female, and the most common age range of respondents was 45 to 55 years. Sixty-one percent of respondents reported never using CBP, and another 16 percent said they rarely did so. Of the remainder, 15 percent reported daily use, 4 percent said they used CBP weekly, and 3 percent said they used CBP on a monthly basis. Researchers noted that responder bias might cause overestimation of CBP use. Seventy-one percent of regular CBP users said they sought relief from pain with a cannabis-based product. Help with sleep also was cited by 71 percent of respondents. Other reported reasons for use included mood (44 percent), spasticity (40 percent), tremor (11 percent), and bladder dysfunction (9 percent). Ninety-five percent of regular users said they had obtained relief of symptoms from CBP. More than half (52 percent) had discussed their CBP use with a neurologist; 35 percent had not tried other symptomatic medications. With the increasing liberalization of state laws regarding use of cannabis-based products for both medical and recreational purposes, CBP is likely to be an increasingly accessible option for more and more people with MS. Reassurance on use of DMTs in women pursuing pregnancy “How will this medication affect my ability to conceive, and to deliver a healthy baby?” It’s a question MS clinicians hear frequently when talking with women of child-bearing age about starting a disease-modifying therapy (DMT). A recent retrospective analysis by Israeli researchers provides reassuring news with regard to this important concern. The investigators examined data on 125 women with relapsing-remitting MS who had a total of 219 live births between 2002 and 2017. They divided the women into three groups: those who were not treated with a DMT in the three months prior to becoming pregnant; those who were treated in the three months prior to pregnancy; and those who were treated during pregnancy. After adjusting for factors including age, disease severity, and known fertility problems, the researchers found that use of DMTs shortly before and during pregnancy did not affect fertility or pregnancy outcomes. They found no significant differences between women in the three groups in terms of the need for fertility treatment and time to pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, complications during pregnancy, or incidence of relapses during pregnancy or in the first year following delivery. The investigators concluded, “The decision regarding DMTs treatment in RRMS patients during child-bearing years should not be influenced by the question of pregnancy in the near future.” However, treatment discussions along with pregnancy planning should always be discussed with one’s healthcare team in advance. Additionally, none of the DMTs have been approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy and certain DMTs may present more of a risk than others. Sexual dysfunction common in women with clinically isolated syndrome   More than one-half of women with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a common precursor to MS, experience sexual dysfunction. That is the main finding of a small study in which Egyptian researchers gathered data from August 2011 to June 2017. Noting that sexual dysfunction has been reported in between 40 percent and 80 percent of women with multiple sclerosis, the investigators sought to determine the frequency of the condition in CIS. They had 43 women with CIS complete the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire (MSIQ-19), as well as instruments assessing fatigue, cognitive function, anxiety, and depression. Fifty-six percent of the women reported at least one manifestation of sexual dysfunction. Eight cited a lack of sexual interest or desire, five reported less intense orgasms, and four said they experienced inadequate vaginal lubrication. Beyond those primary aspects of sexual dysfunction, women also reported that symptoms of CIS – such as urinary and bowel problems and difficulty with concentration – interfered with their sexual function. Lack of confidence about sexuality and fear of rejection also was reported to contribute to sexual difficulties. Fatigue and depression were significant predictors of sexual dysfunction. Further, women who reported sexual dysfunction were older than those who did not report such difficulties (27.5 years versus 23.1 years), but the two groups did not differ in terms of occupation, educational level, or location of brain/spine lesions on MRI. The investigators noted that four patients reported experiencing sexual dysfunction before the emergence of neurological symptoms of MS. As researchers continue to “fill in the gaps” on the many facets of CIS, this study points to the importance of patients talking frankly with clinicians about the full range of issues they may be experiencing. Is menopause a turning point for MS disease course? Relapse rates declined but disability increased in the years following menopause among 148 women with relapsing forms of MS, suggesting that “natural menopause could be a turning point to a less inflammatory, progressive phase of disease,” according to researchers. Those findings and conclusions are from an observational study conducted at 16 MS centers across Italy. Women were followed for a period of roughly 3.5 years before and after natural menopause, meaning menopause not brought about by surgical removal of the ovaries. Ninety-three percent of the women received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during that period. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the women declined from 0.22 before menopause to 0.13 following menopause. However, their scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) increased from a median of 2.0 at menopause to 2.27 two years later and to 2.46 four years after menopause. On the EDSS, an increasing score reflects increased disability. The investigators noted that the findings are in keeping with the results of earlier research they have conducted with a smaller group of women. The impact of endocrine (or hormonal) factors on MS is a focus of considerable research, and studies such as this one suggest avenues for further investigation, while also helping clinicians and patients better anticipate changes that may await across one’s lifespan.  Promising results for stem cell therapy in “aggressive MS”  Clinicians long have faced a challenge in treating “aggressive MS” – a term used when one’s MS is marked by frequent relapses and rapid progression of disability. An international study presented at the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting offers hope that removing, treating, and re-infusing a patient’s own hematopoietic (blood-tissue forming) stem cells may be a safe and effective first-line therapy for this uncommon but extremely debilitating type of MS. The study involved 20 patients treated in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, Italy, and the United States. None had received more than three months of standard DMT treatment before undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or AHSCT (with autologous signifying that the cells came from the patient, rather than from a donor). The patients, who ranged in age from 19 to 52 years, had a median EDSS score of 6.5 prior to treatment. They were followed for a median time of 30 months after transplantation. The median improvement in their EDSS score from pre-treatment to last follow-up was 2.5, which was a statistically significant difference. None had a clinical relapse following transplant. Three patients had new lesions on MRI at their first follow-up visit, but no other new or gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen on later scans. The investigators reported that, “There were routine toxicities, but no treatment-related mortality.” The researchers added that the study results demonstrate the potential role of AHSCT as a first-line treatment for aggressive MS. Additional studies will continue to provide answers on the potential benefits and risks of this intriguing experimental treatment. Low immunization rates against respiratory disease in people with MS Pneumonia and influenza pose serious threats in the setting of MS, but more than 70 percent of people with MS in an Argentine study had not been vaccinated against either illness, researchers reported. The investigators noted that age, smoking, severe disability, and use of immunosuppressive medications all increase the risk of respiratory infections, adding that people with MS have a risk three-times higher than that of the general population for contracting community-acquired pneumonia. Against that backdrop, the researchers conducted an online survey of 220 people with MS and 62 healthy controls. The proportion of people not receiving either the pneumococcal pneumonia or influenza vaccine was high in both groups – 71.4 percent of people with MS and 79 percent of the healthy controls. Among the unvaccinated patients with MS, 80 percent were on a DMT medication, 31 percent smoked or had only recently stopped smoking, 22 percent were aged 50 years or older, and 11 percent had severe disability. The investigators concluded that the low vaccination rates combined with the high prevalence of risk factors among MS patients underscores the need to develop consensus policies on immunization in people who have MS. Impact of magnetic stimulation on balance in people with MS Using a coil held over a person’s head to direct magnetic stimulation to the brain improved balance and walking ability in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and a related movement disorder, according to a group of Egyptian researchers. The investigators studied 43 people with RRMS and truncal ataxia, a condition that can diminish balance and the ability to walk. In the first phase of their study, half of the participants received actual magnetic stimulation while the other half received a sham treatment. In the study’s second phase, all subjects received 12 sessions of magnetic stimulation over four weeks every third month, for a total of 48 sessions. Each session lasted several minutes. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and 10-Minute Walk Test (10MWT) were used to measure the impact of treatment, with patients assessed before, during, and at the completion of treatment. The researchers reported that from the pre-treatment baseline to the last session, participants saw a 36-percent improvement in the 10MWT and a 46-percent improvement in BBS score. These individuals also saw improvement on an imaging assessment of white matter in the brain. The investigators said that the adverse effects of treatment were mild and transitory, with two people reporting nausea, two experiencing dizziness, and three having headaches. Based on these findings, the researchers said that non-invasive, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a long-term beneficial effect on improving balance in people with MS and ataxia.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine guidance for people living with MS People living with multiple sclerosis (MS) are seeking peace of mind on the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines. In response, the Society convened a group of expert researchers and medical professionals to review the available science and make fact-based recommendations. We do not know how many people in the vaccine clinical trials had MS, so data on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in those with MS is not yet available. Our guidance is based on data from the general population in the vaccine clinical trials and data from studies of other vaccines in MS. Our guidance will be updated and become more detailed as more is learned from scientific studies of the vaccines. This guidance only applies to the approved mRNA vaccines in the United States, Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna. As there are different vaccines available in other countries, this guidance may not apply to those living outside of the US.  The science has shown us that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Like other medical decisions, the decision to get a vaccine is best made in partnership with your healthcare provider. Most people with relapsing and progressive forms of MS should be vaccinated. The risks of COVID-19 disease outweigh any potential risks from the vaccine. In addition, members of the same household and close contacts should also get a COVID-19 vaccine when available to decrease the impact of the virus. People with progressive MS, those who are older, those who have a higher level of physical disability, those with certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart and lung disease, pregnancy), and Black and Hispanic populations are among groups with the highest risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19. Individuals in these high risk groups are especially encouraged to get the vaccine as soon as it becomes .     These COVID-19 vaccines require two doses. You need to get both doses for it to work. If you’ve had COVID-19 and recovered, you should also get the vaccine. We don’t know how long someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again. who will get the COVID-19 vaccine. The first step to getting your vaccination is finding out when you will be eligible to receive it in accordance with your state’s guidelines. The vaccines do not contain live virus and will not cause COVID-19 disease. The vaccines are not likely to trigger an MS relapse or to worsen your chronic MS symptoms. The risk of getting COVID-19 far outweighs any risk of having an MS relapse from the vaccine. Any vaccine can cause side effects, including a fever. A fever can make your MS symptoms worse temporarily, but they should return to prior levels after the fever is gone. Even if you have side effects, it’s important to get the second dose of the vaccine for it to be effective. Continue your disease modifying therapy (DMT) unless you are advised by your MS healthcare provider to stop or delay it. Stopping some DMTs abruptly can cause severe increase in disability with new lesions on MRI. Based on data from previous studies of other vaccines and DMTs, getting the COVID-19 vaccine while on any DMT is safe. Some DMTs may make the vaccine less effective but it will still provide some protection. For those taking Kesimpta, Lemtrada, Mavenclad, Ocrevus, or Rituxan—you may need to coordinate the timing of your vaccine with the timing of your DMT dose. Work with your MS healthcare provider to determine the best schedule for you. We are in the process of developing considerations for providers to use when making these decisions with you. All of us have a personal responsibility to slow the spread of the pandemic and eliminate the virus as quickly as possible The authorization of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 bring us one step closer to eliminating this pandemic. In addition to getting vaccinated, the science is settled that wearing a face mask, social distancing and washing your hands are the best ways to slow the spread of the virus and should be continued even if you get a COVID-19 vaccine Learn more about the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines from the .

Based upon disease etiology, ON is broadly classified as typical or atypical. Typical ON is strongly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), while atypical ON is unrelated to MS. The two types differ in etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. Successful clinical management depends upon the correct differential diagnosis. Selected typical ON patients may benefit from short-term, high-dose corticosteroids. Disease-modifying drugs may prevent or delay progression to first occurrence or relapse of existing MS, as well as prevent another ON episode. Atypical ON may require both corticosteroids and long-term immunosuppressant therapy, depending on the etiology. Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammatory condition that affects the optic nerves. Typical ON is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), while atypical ON is a manifestation of other diseases or conditions. Although many cases of typical ON resolve with full restoration of vision, some cases may progress to MS, visual abnormality, and/or vision loss. The purpose of this review is to briefly present the current under-standing of ON and its clinical management. Based upon disease etiology, ON is classified as typical or atypical. While typical ON is strongly associated with MS, atypical ON is linked to a wide variety of disorders that are unrelated to MS (refer to ). Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is an inherited form of vision loss, which usually presents in the teens or early twenties, affecting males much more commonly than females. Genetic mutations of mitochondrial proteins may eventually lead to optic nerve cell death and a spectrum of symptoms from no vision loss to profound and permanent loss of central vision. Optic atrophy 1 () and optic atrophy 3 () genetic mutations lead to defective or missing proteins that subsequently result in mitochondrial dysfunction and deterioration of structures that transmit visual infor-mation from the eyes to the brain. A wide variety of bacterial, viral, and upper respiratory tract infections have been associated with atypical ON. Although less common etiologic agents, differential diagnosis must rule out these infectious causes of ON. ON may occur in systemic autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren syndrome, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. In these conditions, the immune system mistakenly targets the myelin sheath covering the optic nerve, and in some cases, other ocular and neurologic structures. Commonly associated with ON, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is characterized by inflammatory lesions in the optic nerves and the spinal cord. The presence of Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies, a biomarker for NMO, is very helpful in establishing a diagnosis of NMO. Although similar to MS, NMO less often involves damage to nerves in the brain. The course of the ON disease process is more severe as compared to MS, with over 50% of patients becoming blind or wheelchair dependent after 5 years. Any tumor that compresses structures relaying visual messages from the retina to the brain may mimic signs and symptoms of ON. Differential diagnosis should eliminate these possible pathologies. While rare, vitamin B deficiencies have been associated with ON. This form of ON is reversible and treatable. Malnourished patients who present with ON symptomatology, and no other identifiable risk factors, should be evaluated for this deficiency. Several chemicals and drugs can elicit signs and symptoms that mimic ON (). These should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ON. The most important aspect of treatment and potential restoration of vision is identification and prompt withdrawal of the offending agent. Geographically, typical ON occurs more frequently among populations dwelling in regions of higher latitude than among those who reside close to the equator. The incidence of typical ON is believed to be lower in Asian countries than in the United States. The incidence of atypical ON is dependent on disease etiology. In general, atypical ON is less prevalent in regions where typical ON is prominent. The risk factors for typical and atypical ON include age, gender, ethnicity, and genetic factors. Typical ON is highly prevalent among those 20 to 55 years of age, and is usually unilateral. However, it is rare in the pediatric population. Typical ON is more prevalent in women than men. Some studies have shown that prevalence among Caucasians is higher than that among Blacks. Finally, some genetic mutations increase the risk of typical ON. In contrast to typical ON, atypical ON is highly prevalent in pediatric patients and adults over 50 years of age, as well as Black, Asian, and Polynesian populations. provides a summary of risk factors associated with typical and atypical ON. Axonal retinal ganglion cells converge at the optic disc and transition into the optic nerves. The optic nerve for each eye crisscrosses at the optic chiasm to the opposite side of the brain. At this point, the optic nerves become the optic tracts. The optic tracts terminate at visual centers in the brain,with the right brain controlling the left eye and the left brain controlling the right eye (). The optic chiasm is located directly above the pituitary gland, accounting for vision problems that may be induced by pituitary gland tumors pressing on the optic chiasm. The function of the optic nerves is to transmit information from the retina to the brain for visual perception. Light striking the photoreceptor cells triggers a neurotransmitter response that generates action potential in the axons of the retinal ganglion cells for transmission to the brain via the optic nerves. The myelin sheath accelerates the conduction of the action potential through the axons of the optic nerves and tracts. Myelin is present in segments along the axons (). This arrangement speeds up conduction of nerve impulses as the action potential jumps from segment to segment along the axons to visual centers in the brain. Several conditions that interfere with optic nerve function may cause ON. Regardless of etiology, the final end point of ON involves axon demyelination, axon damage, or both. The primary pathogenicity in typical ON is optic nerve demyelination associated with inflammation. Pathologic changes involving various retinal structures may precede this occurrence. Destruction of the myelin leads to transmission defects with consequent temporary vision impairment (). Vision loss due to demyelination is usually temporary because the myelin can be regenerated. Unfortunately, some cases involve more severe inflammation accompanied by release of T and B lymphocytic cells and cytokines that cause axonal damage and possible permanent vision loss. The thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) is increased during the acute stage of ON, implying the occurrence of optic nerve swelling. Conversely, after an ON attack, the RNFL is significantly reduced. A thinner than normal layer indicates axonal loss. While the final end point of ON is the same irrespective of etiology, the triggers and resultant processes that lead to these outcomes vary widely depending upon the underlying cause. For example, some infectious causes of ON may be characterized by increased white blood cells, elevated protein concentration, and low glucose concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which are rarely found in cases of typical ON. Pharmacists should be aware of some of the common symptoms associated with ON, as they can facilitate early detection and mitigate lasting damage to the eyes. The clinical signs and symptoms associated with ON include loss of peripheral or central vision, orbital pain that aggravates with eye movement, loss of color vision, and less commonly, , a term that refers to bright, rapid flashes of light associated with eye move-ments. Other signs include loss of visual acuity, visual field defects, reduction in vision contrast and sensitivity, pupillary abnormality, and fundus abnormality. The clinical characteristics of typical and atypical ON are summarized in . Because many diseases may lead to ON, it is very important for the clinician to consider the differential diagnoses to ensure proper clinical management. In general, the diagnosis, treatment, long-term management, and prognosis of ON are dependent on the etiology of the disease. Several tools are utilized to diagnose and monitor ON, irrespective of etiology, including MRI, the visual evoked potential (VEP), and optical coherence tomography (OCT). MRI is used to diagnose ON and monitor its status during treatment. It is further employed to assess the risk of ON converting to MS. VEP assesses the alteration in visual acuity that occurs due to demyelination. OCT is used to measure the thickness of the RNFL and determine the extent of axonal atrophy. Medical follow-up for typical ON includes visual acuity monitoring and visual field testing upon onset and periodically thereafter, as well as referral to an MS specialist to monitor for progression to, or management of, existing MS. In 15% to 20% of patients, ON is the initial symptom of MS, and 50% of MS patients will experience an episode of ON at some time during the course of their disease. Successful treatment depends upon accurately diagnosing ON, while etiology will dictate appropriate therapy goals and drug selection as discussed below. In the short term, the goals of treatment for typical ON are to halt the course of inflammation, speed up the recovery process, and improve vision. Long-term goals are to prevent recurrence of ON and preclude, delay, or ameliorate a subsequent initial MS episode. There is an established role for high-dose IV corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of typical ON. Low-dose corticosteroids, whether used as stand-alone therapy or as a taper to high-dose parenteral therapy, are contraindicated because of an increased risk for ON relapsing. While some studies have demonstrated that high-dose parenteral corticosteroid therapy may hasten vision improvement, other studies have cast doubt on this conclusion. High-dose, short-term IV corticosteroid therapy is associated with few adverse effects; thus, it may be worth trying this therapy in selected patients experiencing acute typical ON. Patients who may benefit from this intervention include those who require rapid vision recovery, such as patients who only have vision in one eye, severe vision loss in both eyes, or occupations that require normal visual acuity. A typical dosing regimen is IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days (refer to for indications and adverse effects). It has been definitively established that regardless of corticosteroid use, there is no change in the long-term visual outcomes of ON. Thus, typical ON is also known as because vision can improve without corticosteroid treatment. Patients with ON and abnormal brain MRIs may be treated with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, which are disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), to expand the intervals between episodes, decrease the number of demyelinating attacks, and slow down disease progression (). Because atypical ON has myriad causes, treatment centers on the underlying pathology. Identification and treatment, or eradication, of infections and compressive tumors, and other etiologies such as nutritional, toxic, and drug-induced causes, should be pursued.Immunosuppressive treatment specific to each autoimmune disease is warranted. Based upon Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group treatment guidelines, various DMDs are indicated for NMO. Azathioprine or rituximab are considered first-line agents, while methotrexate, mitoxantrone, mycophenolate, and tocilizumab are alternative second- or third-line choices (). Long-term corticosteroid treatment is necessary with some of the atypical ON etiologies to prevent relapse. It is pertinent to note that there are no established, definitive treatment guidelines for atypical ON. Evidence is mostly retrospective, observational, and not derived from randomized, controlled clinical studies. This constitutes mainly level IV evidence for clinical studies, on a scale of I to V, with level I being the strongest evidence and level V being the weakest. There are no consensus treatment guidelines; rather, treatment patterns appear to vary based upon local custom. lists some of the more common agents that pharmacists may see used in different dose-combinations based upon physician preference and patient response. Demyelination and axonal loss are the major reasons for vision loss or impairment. Corticosteroids and DMDs cannot reverse these pathologic changes, but they may improve visual function in the short term. Thus, research has focused on investigational drugs to stop the progression of demyelination and axonal loss, repair the existing damage, and lead to better long-term visual outcomes, but to date none have been clinically successful. Typical ON is associated with MS, and corticosteroid therapy may benefit selected patients short term. Therapeutic intervention with DMDs may prevent occurrence of a first MS attack or delay progression to a recurrent episode in existing MS. The etiology of atypical ON varies widely and dictates treatment options. NMO, an autoimmune disorder, is often linked to poor patient outcomes, with over 50% of patients becoming blind or wheelchair bound after 5 years. 1. Toosy AT, Mason DF, Miller DH.

ae976a2d-eb2a-40aa-8c05-f1b85475907a,"The Most Dangerous Psychiatric Drugs: Highest Risk Medications If you’re taking a psychiatric drug, you probably hope that you’re taking the one with the lowest overall risk.  Sure you want the drug to be therapeutic and alleviate your symptoms, but you also don’t want to take a drug with a rapid tolerance onset, debilitating side effects, and crazy withdrawal symptoms.  Many dangerous psychiatric drugs are insidious in that they provide symptomatic relief, but end up resulting in disabling long-term effects; in some cases these effects are permanent. Some of the most extreme dangers associated with psychiatric drugs include: , tardive dyskinesia, brain volume loss, and dementia.  Unfortunately, many patients taking these drugs are not well-informed of the long-term effects.  In fact, some general practitioners remain unaware of the latest research suggesting that certain drugs may be risky long-term treatments from a holistic health perspective. As an example, medicating a patient with a benzodiazepine may be helpful for reducing anxiety, but daily treatment may result in rapid tolerance onset.  Eventually the patient will develop tolerance to the highest dose, and will likely experience side effects from ingestion of such a large dose.  The individual may then need to discontinue the medication, experience debilitating protracted withdrawal symptoms and may even end up with early-onset dementia several years later – all as a result of one psychiatric drug that they thought was helpful. Criteria to Determine the Most Dangerous Psychiatric Drugs When attempting to distinguish the most dangerous psychiatric drugs from the less dangerous (lower risk) ones, it is important to have some criteria.  Since most psychiatrists do not prescribe drugs based on “danger” and have no scale to determine potential dangers, it may be smart to do your own research.  If I were to devise a rating scale, it would incorporate the following aspects of a drug: abuse potential, long-term effects, side effects, tolerance onset, and withdrawal. Dangerous or high-risk psychiatric drugs tend to be those with a high potential for abuse, addiction, and dependence.  While not everyone will abuse them, the fact that there is potential for abuse alone should be considered problematic.  Should someone with an addictive personality get prescribed any agents with a high abuse potential, chances are that they may get abused. When drugs are abused or taken in excess, this could lead to impaired cognitive function, adverse reactions, and in some cases even death.  Prescription drugs with high potential for abuse are commonly referenced as “controlled-substances.”  The lower the number of the “schedule” such as “Schedule II” controlled-substance, the greater the potential for misuse and abuse. We live in an immediate-gratification oriented culture, where everyone is focused on getting immediate, fast-track results with no consideration of the future.  The problem with an immediate-gratification treatment strategy is that you may get immediate relief from debilitating psychiatric symptoms, but long-term effects aren’t considered.  This is best evidenced with drugs like barbiturates and benzodiazepines; they provide potent immediate relief, but may cause neurodegeneration when taken over a long-term. When taking any drug, you should always calculate the likelihood of long-term effects or prognosis associated with a particular treatment.  In some cases (depending on your condition) you may be forced to take a gamble on potential long-term effects (e.g. using antipsychotics for schizophrenia).  That said, you should still make sure you’re working with your psychiatrist to minimize potential of these effects. Many people review side effect profiles of drugs, but are so desperate for symptom relief that they’re willing to put up with some side effects.  Several of the most common side effects associated with dangerous psychiatric drugs include: impaired cognitive function, drowsiness, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction.  While the side effects may be bearable for awhile, frustration associated with weight gain or impaired cognition may continue to mount over time. Imagine if you’re taking a drug that’s making you feel less depressed, but one of the side effects is drowsiness and cognitive impairment.  This may lead to you making more errors at work and could get you fired from a good job.  In other cases, people may find that their romantic partners even become dissatisfied with them due to sexual dysfunction and/or severe weight gain associated with treatment. Whenever considering any psychiatric drug, tolerance onset should always be assessed.  Even if you start with a low dose on an “as-needed” basis, certain drugs are associated with a rapid-tolerance onset.  These are generally “Schedule IV” controlled-substances like psychostimulants and benzodiazepines. The problem with a rapid-tolerance onset is that a person must keep taking greater doses to achieve the same initial therapeutic effect.  Before the individual realizes it, they’ve hit the maximum daily dose or are taking supratherapeutic doses just to get symptomatic relief.  At these high doses, side effects and adverse reactions often occur and discontinuation from the drug creates a neurophysiological fiasco. Many psychiatric drugs are associated with severe withdrawal symptoms, but certain drugs are tougher to discontinue than others.  Safer drugs tend to be less potent, and withdrawal symptoms subside more quickly after discontinuation.  Certain drugs are dangerous to the point that if you discontinue too quickly (e.g. cold turkey), you could end up experiencing seizures or even dying. For this reason, it is important to consider the severity of withdrawal in advance.  Most psychiatric drugs require a gradual titration to reduce the intensity of discontinuation symptoms.  However, some drugs take much longer than others to titrate “off” of.  Someone on high doses of benzodiazepines may take years before they successfully taper off of a high dose and an additional year before they recover. Based on the aforementioned criteria, below is a list of the most dangerous psychiatric drugs.  Keep in mind that this is not a hierarchical list, meaning that what’s listed first isn’t more dangerous than the next item on the list.  Also understand that some individuals may need to take certain drugs due to lack of other options for their particular illness. Antipsychotics are commonly referenced as “neuroleptics” or “major tranquilizers.”  There are two types of antipsychotics, namely: “typical” (older antipsychotics) and “atypical” (newer antipsychotics).  These drugs function primarily as dopamine receptor antagonists, meaning they bind to the dopamine receptor to prevent excess stimulation from dopamine misfiring. : These drugs have an extremely low potential for abuse. Most people that take them wish they had another option.  These are easily among the most unpleasant psychiatric medications to ingest. : The long-term effects associated with antipsychotic usage (especially at high doses) are downright scary. Over a long-term most people gain hundreds of pounds in weight, and there’s a chance they may develop Type 2 diabetes, and tardive dyskinesia (a permanent uncontrollable twitch).  Plus there is substantial evidence to suggest that these cause brain volume loss (both white and grey matter). : If you want to gain weight quickly, antipsychotics are the fastest track method. These drugs increase appetite significantly to the point that you’ll be raiding your fridge in the middle of the night.  The medications also severely impair cognitive function and coordination as a result of anticholinergic-induced drowsiness. : The tolerance onset associated with these medications is relatively slow. Most users can tolerate the same dosage for a long-term before requiring an upward titration. : Discontinuing antipsychotics is certainly no picnic. Withdrawal symptoms are just as severe (if not more severe) than any psychiatric medication.  Various discontinuation symptoms include: insomnia, fatigue, agitation, anxiety, depression, and even psychosis. (Read: Can withdrawal from antipsychotics cause psychosis?). Despite the heavy marketing of these drugs as , they really should be limited to being used by individuals with psychotic symptoms.  Even if they provide relief, they will cause you to lose brain volume.  The side effects are no fun, plus you could end up with permanent Type 2 diabetes, tardive dyskinesia, and even memory impairment as a result of the anticholinergic effects. What’s horrible is that these drugs are being doled out like candy to people with relatively benign conditions like insomnia. (Read: ).  They are approved for schizophrenia and the treatment of bipolar disorder.  That said, even people with bipolar disorder can likely find a safer medication that works than antipsychotics. If you’re looking out for long-term brain health and overall physical health, this is a class of medication to avoid like the plague – unless you have schizophrenia and no other choice.  Those diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and insomnia should seriously consider other options. Benzodiazepines are arguably the single most effective class of medications for alleviating anxiety.  If you’re overly anxious or stressed, you can take a benzodiazepine and literally get immediate relief.  They are very fast-acting drugs, but are associated with some serious problems.  In fact, there is evidence that and possibly permanent memory impairment. : Benzodiazepines have a high potential for abuse, and are thus regarded as a “Schedule II” controlled-substance. Many people end up becoming addicted to their effects and take more than necessary to “get high” or even just to feel calm.  They are regarded as one of the , sporting a 1.83 addiction rating. : The most dangerous long-term effect associated with benzodiazepine usage is that of cognitive impairment. This impairment was considered “moderate” to “large” and appears across all measures of cognitive function, including memory.  The GABAergic effects may also promote neurodegeneration. : Some neuroscientists have argued that while a person takes benzodiazepines, they are unable to learn new information. It is well-documented that they impair cognition, but they may blunt learning abilities as well.  Various side effects include drowsiness, cognitive impairment, confusion, and disorientation.  This is certainly not a favorable side effect profile for those with cognitively demanding jobs, nor those operating heavy machinery. : Those taking benzodiazepines tend to notice rapid-tolerance onset. You may start out at a very low dose, but notice that within a month it’s ineffective.  The next step is increasing the dose, which after another month, that’s no longer effective.  Before you know it, you’re tolerant to the highest dose and side effects are unbearable. : Going through benzodiazepine withdrawal is as severe as any, and can be fatal if high doses are discontinued “cold turkey.” Those that have developed tolerance to high doses usually require an extended tapering period, sometimes lasting well-over 1 year.  Even after the tapering is done, a person will likely still experience (protracted symptoms) characterized by debilitating anxiety, hypersensitivity, etc. – months (or years) after the medication has been stopped. The dangers associated with benzodiazepines can be minimized by taking extremely low doses on an “as-needed” basis.  However, those with addictive personalities may not be able to resist taking more than their prescribed dosage.  Not only do these drugs impair all measures of cognitive function, they inhibit learning ability and may speed up neurodegeneration. Those taking benzodiazepines may find them effective for anxiety or insomnia, but the long-term effects outweigh the immediate relief for most people.  If you aren’t sure what to take besides a benzodiazepine, you may want to consider a safer option like .  I’d also recommend reading the following: “” and “.” The nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics a.k.a. “Z-drugs” (sleeping pills) are commonly prescribed, yet most consumers remain uneducated of the risks associated with treatment.  Sure they’ll help bypass tough cases of insomnia for a good night’s sleep, but the long-term effects as well as side effects are alarming.  According to a 2012 study, people taking sleeping pills increase their risk of early mortality and cancer. : The abuse potential for Z-drugs is considered to be relatively low as “Schedule IV” controlled-substances.  That said, many people find the effects of these drugs similar to benzodiazepines; both drugs influence GABAergic activity.  Due to the effect on GABA, sleeping pills have a higher potential for abuse than often perceived. : The risks associated with long-term usage of sleeping pills are considered similar to those associated with benzos.  You may find that your memory has declined as well as your cognitive performance. Another problematic long-term outcome is an increased likelihood of early mortality and cancer – as evidenced by a 2012 study published in the British Medical Journal. : These drugs carry risk of some serious side effects including: depression, impaired cognitive function, amnesia, and sometimes hallucinations. The side effects alone should steer most people away from these drugs.  Plus they may increase your level of sedation after sleep, making it more likely that your motor skills will be impaired; your likelihood of getting into a car accident increases with Z-drugs. : While the tolerance onset may not be quite as quick with Z-drugs as it is with benzodiazepines, tolerance is quickly established. This means that you’ll constantly need to increase the dosage of your sleeping pill in order to get relief from your insomnia. Continuously increasing the dosage simultaneously increases risk of debilitating side effects. : It is considered challenging to cope with the symptoms associated with sleeping pill discontinuation. If you want some evidence, just read what you’ll experience during .  Many people taking the drug are unable to discontinue due to the array of withdrawal symptoms that arise. If you have insomnia, you should consider sleeping pills a last resort.  While they may be slightly safer than benzodiazepines, they have a relatively similar mechanism of action – acting on the neurotransmission of GABA.  Taking sleeping pills for a long-term is thought to impair cognitive performance and may lead to early onset dementia. Individuals that consider sleeping pills a necessity may want to reevaluate their lifestyle as well as other habits.  Insomnia can generally be corrected by making some habit changes and working with a sleep expert.  Tolerance is quickly established on sleeping pills and withdrawal symptoms aren’t pleasant – just a couple more reasons you may want to avoid them. Psychostimulants are drugs that function by increasing activity in the brain and nervous system.  They stimulate activity, usually via reuptake inhibition of dopamine and/or norepinephrine.  Increasing concentrations of stimulatory neurotransmitters leads to improved cognitive function, increases in physical energy, and relief from symptoms of ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).  Despite the efficacy of psychostimulants, there are potential dangers to consider before taking one. : There is significant potential for abuse associated with psychostimulants. These drugs increase concentrations of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of pleasure, reward, and euphoria.  Individuals may like the initial dopaminergic “high” derived from these drugs, which may lead to drug abuse and ultimately “.” : The long-term effects associated with psychostimulants are a bit difficult to analyze. Most professionals believe that when taken at therapeutic doses by individuals with legitimate ADHD, they may actually have beneficial long-term effects.  Other researchers think that long-term usage may deplete dopamine stores and downregulate dopamine receptors.  Evidence remains conflicting regarding long-term effects: one study reported nothing significant, a second reported slight benefit, and a third reported modest harm. : The side effects associated with psychostimulants are generally favorable. Not only does cognitive performance improve, but a person has more physical energy as a result of these drugs.  Unfavorable side effects include: hypertension, dizziness, headaches, anxiety, and insomnia.  That said, many people find that these drugs increase libido, improve mood, and contribute to weight loss; all of which are considered favorable. : Tolerance is rapidly established on psychostimulants, which is why many people need to constantly increase their dosage for therapeutic effect. A person may quickly build up tolerance to a low dose, and find that they need to continuously increase their dosage to achieve the same initial therapeutic effect.  In a relatively short timeframe, a person will have likely doubled their dosage.  The problem is that when a person reaches high doses, the side effects may become severe and ultimately lead to discontinuation. : It is extremely difficult for most people to deal with the symptoms that arise upon discontinuation from psychostimulant drugs. Many people have reported that following , they experienced extreme fatigue, sleepiness, weight gain, and impaired cognitive function.  Think of the withdrawal period from psychostimulants as being mostly the polar opposite of being on the drugs. Compared to antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, the psychostimulant drugs aren’t considered nearly as dangerous.  They don’t appear to significantly impair cognitive function over the long-term.  That said, people who abuse these drugs may end up developing physical health problems as well as problems with cognitive function such as and downregulated receptors. For individuals who use psychostimulants responsibly and/or on an intermittent (“as needed”) bases will likely minimize many of the potential risks associated with long-term use.  Additionally, some evidence suggests that if you have legitimate ADHD, the long-term effects could actually be beneficial.  It should also be noted that there are many effective “” that you may want to consider prior to using a psychostimulant. Various anti-manic medications include: depakote, lamictal, lithium, and tegretol.  These medications are generally safe for most people with bipolar disorder over the long-term, assuming patients are carefully monitored.  That said, these drugs may be more dangerous than antidepressants due to the fact that they can cause liver damage and thyroid dysfunction. : Mood stabilizers have a low potential for abuse. They are commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder to help reduce manic symptoms.  They will not produce an intoxicating high – all they do is “stabilize” a person’s mood. : The long-term effects associated with mood stabilizers may be subject to both individual variation and the specific medication taken.  Potential long-term concerns include liver problems, pancreatitis, and thyroid abnormalities. In some cases a person may experience cognitive impairment as well – depending on the drug taken. : The side effects associated with mood stabilizers are generally subject to individual variation. Some side effects may include: hair loss, weight changes, depression, thirst, or itching.  Some people may not be able to cope with hair loss and may feel as if the drugs are toxic to their body. : Most people find that they don’t develop tolerance to mood stabilizers. Many people are able to stay on the same dosage for years with sustained efficacy.  Even if an increase in dosage is required to boost efficacy of the medication, tolerance onset is gradual. : Those discontinuing mood stabilizers like Lithium may end up dealing with discontinuation symptoms. (Read: ). The withdrawal may be more severe with certain medications than others, and subject to individual variation.  That said, the withdrawal from mood stabilizers is considered mild compared to most other psychiatric drugs. Those with bipolar disorder benefit from taking mood stabilizers because they balance a person’s mood, preventing manic highs and depressive lows.  These drugs are considerably safer than antipsychotics when used over a long-term from a holistic health perspective.  They have a considerably milder withdrawal period as well. Using a mood stabilizer could be justified among those with treatment-resistant depression, particularly Lithium – which has a favorable track record as an adjunct.  That said, these drugs should generally be taken only by those with conditions that warrant their usage (e.g. bipolar disorder). Most people know that antidepressants are associated with unwanted side effects and difficult withdrawal symptoms.  That said, most newer antidepressants are considered relatively safe, even when taken over the long-term.  By comparison to antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, taking an antidepressant won’t impede your cognitive function and memory; certain antidepressants may even improve your ability to focus. : Most antidepressant medications have no significant abuse potential. This means they cannot be taken for a pleasurable, intoxicating effect.  People aren’t buying Prozac on the streets to get high, whereas they may buy benzodiazepines and/or psychostimulants. : A majority of antidepressant medications are considered safe when taken over the long-term. There is evidence that some medications may cause health conditions over a long-term such as: tinnitus, chronic fatigue, and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.  However, the effects of antidepressants (assuming they aren’t anticholinergic) over the long-term are of modest concern. : Most are generally of moderate concern. They are not considered harmful, but may be problematic from a holistic perspective.  Weight gain and sexual dysfunction happen to be among the two most common side effects.  Should a person experience one or both of these side effects, they may end up becoming more depressed as a result. : It is well known that as a result of tolerance. Fortunately the tolerance is relatively slow in that it usually takes at least 6 months before an individual needs to increase their dosage to achieve the same therapeutic effect.  Some people are able to remain on the same dose for years without tolerance, so there is some evidence that tolerance is subject to individual variation. : The absolute worst aspect of antidepressant treatment is the discontinuation period. For years it was speculated that there were no significant withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping antidepressants.  Now it is well-known that people experience things like: , dizziness, headaches, increased depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts when they stop their medication.  Unfortunately, many of these symptoms can persist for months after the drug has been fully cleared from the body. It should be noted that antidepressants are far safer than antipsychotics and tend to improve long-term outcomes for individuals with major depression.  Based on the type of antidepressant and mechanisms of action, some drugs are safer than others.  The , , and various are considered safe.  The certain may be geneotoxic and/or anticholinergic – potentially causing detriment to long-term health. Various are also known to have a dangerous interaction with tyramine, meaning if you eat too many foods with tyramine while taking an MAOI, you could end up in the hospital.  Most psychiatrists explain this, but it is a risk that should be considered if you aren’t disciplined enough to monitor your dietary intake. Which of these psychiatric drug classes is the most dangerous? The argument could be made that antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are both the most dangerous.  Though they have different mechanisms of action, they are both risky long-term treatments.  Benzodiazepines have a greater potential for abuse and may disrupt cognitive function more significantly than antipsychotics depending on the dosage administered. Despite the fact that your brain may function slightly better on an antipsychotic than a benzodiazepine, the physical side effects associated with antipsychotics are worse than those associated with benzodiazepines.  You may be unable to stop eating, and become clinically obese – leading to a cascade of other health problems including hypertension and Type 2 diabetes as a result. This leads you to end up on even more pills just because you’ve been taking an antipsychotic.  Many of the physical health effects also influence the health of your brain; it’s a symbiotic relationship.  The withdrawal is perhaps more dangerous from benzodiazepines, but discontinuation of antipsychotics may be equally as debilitating. Individuals taking benzodiazepines intermittently at very low doses likely won’t experience the same dangers as someone taking an extended-release version every day.  The frequency of administration and the respective dosing of each drugs dictates the harm potential, but both drug classes should be avoided unless all practical options have been pursued without therapeutic benefit. Conducting a risk-benefit analysis: Do benefits outweigh risks? If you are taking any of the drugs listed above, it is important to consider whether the risks outweigh the benefits you’re getting from the drug.  If you’re getting great symptomatic relief from a “risky” psychiatric drug, you may be willing to endure any potential dangers associated with treatment.  On the other hand, if you’re not getting any relief and are experiencing debilitating side effects – you may want to consider switching to a different medication. It may be a tougher situation for someone who finds an antipsychotic working well to treat their depression, but is gaining significant weight and is concerned about long-term brain volume loss.  Assuming they’ve explored all other options and they feel as if nothing else will work, the usage of an antipsychotic may be justified.  Similarly, someone with refractory anxiety may decide that the short-term boost in quality of life from benzodiazepines is worth the risk of dementia. What can be done to minimize risks of these drugs? To minimize the risk associated with the most dangerous psychiatric drugs, it is recommended to only take them when necessary (e.g. benzodiazepines on an “as-needed” basis).  In addition to reducing the frequency of usage, you should also be taking the .  In other words, you should slowly titrate your dosage up from the lowest possible dose until you get therapeutic benefit. : If you need to take one of these drugs, it is recommended to take the minimal amount that provides symptomatic relief. By taking the minimal dosage, you decrease your risk for side effects and long-term effects. : Certain drugs like benzodiazepines and sleeping pills can be taken on an “as-needed” basis rather than daily. With these drugs, you should be taking them only when absolutely necessary; reduce your frequency of usage as much as possible. If you are taking more than the minimally effective amount, you’ll develop quicker tolerance to the drug and the exogenous chemicals will make more significant changes to your physiology.  The combination of quicker tolerance and greater physiological change equals an increased risk of adverse effects, severe side effects, and/or debilitating long-term effects. Considering individual variation vs. potential dangers Understand that not everyone taking psychiatric medications associated with dangers will experience them.  Many people take medications such as benzodiazepines for a long-term and end up with no cognitive impairment and/or end up fully restoring their cognitive function.  Others may take mood stabilizers for decades with no adverse reactions as evidenced by their consistent blood tests. That said, many people do end up experiencing adverse reactions (e.g. tardive dyskinesia from antipsychotics) and wish they had known of these potential dangers prior to taking their medication.  Understand that the potential dangers shouldn’t scare you away from taking a drug if you need it, but they maybe should scare you away if there are safer options.  In other words, “off-label” use of these drugs shouldn’t be considered until all other options have been explored. To get a better idea of whether you’re more prone to these adverse reactions, you may want to consider getting some genetic testing (e.g. GeneSight). Genetic tests will help you determine how likely you are to respond to a certain drug and tolerate it with minimal side effects.  The more knowledge you have regarding how you’re likely to react, the better. The Catch-22: Necessity of Drugs vs. Potential Dangers If you have schizophrenia, you’ll probably need to take an antipsychotic to alleviate your symptoms.  If you struggle with incessant and are , the most effective treatment is likely to be an antipsychotic that acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist.  This helps reduce dopaminergic activity and provides symptomatic relief.  Unfortunately, most are not nearly as effective as pharmaceutical options. The major catch-22 is that despite getting symptomatic relief, a person may gain a significant amount of weight, experience high blood pressure, and even develop permanent Type 2 diabetes – all because of their medication.  This means that you’re left to choose between: symptomatic relief and medication-induced adverse effects. For some individuals, the adverse effects are a serious concern.  Despite the fact that illnesses like schizophrenia are severely debilitating, so are conditions like Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and brain volume loss associated with the medication.  In regards to schizophrenia, most evidence suggests that long-term health outcomes are superior among those adhering to treatment compared to those who discontinue. The goal for most people with severe mental illness should be to get it under control, which will increase their ability to function in society and improve their quality of life.  At a certain point, medication adjustments may be warranted as a result of side effects and adverse reactions.  That said, when faced with a Catch-22, it is usually better to err on the side of symptom control. Determining whether you could be using a safer drug… Always work with your psychiatrist to determine whether there is a safer treatment option than the drug you’re currently taking (for whatever condition you have).  Many people fail to investigate the array of low risk treatment options that exist.  If you are concerned about the drug that you’re currently taking, do a bit of research and read up on the . If you have an up-to-date psychiatrist, chances are that he or she will know the safest possible options for your condition; even if they are considered “off-label.”  Explain that you are concerned about the long-term effects and/or side effects of your current treatment and determine the other possible options.  While some people may be limited in their treatment options, others may find a drug with considerably lower risk compared to their current medication.

Safest Psychiatric Drugs: Low Risk, Effective Medications 30+ New Antidepressants (2018): Drugs In Clinical Trials This site is useful but this article is 100% wrong on SSRIs. They are very dangerous. They cause neurotoxicity, dementia, suicide, Serotonin Syndrome death and more. I have diagnosed neurotoxicity from them and in a wheelchair. Whoever is feeding the media BS that they are safe isn’t looking at the thousands in Facebook support groups from them. The worst side effect in my opinion with the antipsychotics is not weight gain or diabetes, but insomnia. If you come off of the medications your blood work will likely correct itself. Insomnia may not correct itself even afterwards if you are taking a high dosage sedative. I have a Mother who has Bi-Polar 2 disorder, the one categorized as the worst one. She began taking lithium at age 49 and nineteen years later was hospitalized for lithium toxicity. She also had been on other drugs. At age 72, she looks far worse than she should. She has developed balance problems, she has fallen and hit her head, she has high blood pressure! That is not even in my family because my family has some great genetic traits with low BP. She has always preferred medications to cope with her inability to sleep plus issues with “feelings of grandeur”. This has caused me to question many things. I do blame her doctor for prescribing the pills. Would you go this route based on these facts? People think drugs are easy to switch around, but then it is very hard. She was offered a rehab but claimed people will not treat her, for all kinds of excuses. So alas, these drugs can very well be addicting. If I had a magic wand, I would have helped her find a way to live more honestly, deal with her diet, deal with a lot of issues with her health and make sure she did not get started with psychiatrists. Oh and I will add this particular one is so obsessed with keeping her, he has stated her drug hangover symptoms are imagined and there are NO side effects. So it’s a tie between her not wanting to get better help, and this manipulative doctor that has changed the course of her entire existence. I will share with you something doctors will not. Many times, mould allergies and problems with good bacteria in the body cause neurological problems and interrupt our natural feel-good chemical processes in our bodies. This is one of the actual underlying reasons for many patients to have problems with their mood. I do not aim to be an expert I only aim to state how people need to look at the big picture of why people might feel desperate and think a drug is going to cure or help them when I have seen the opposite first hand. Good Luck. I was on benzos for two and a half months, 0.5mg twice every day. They helped me tremendously with my anxiety and I had no problem getting off them. I know a ton of people who have taken them long-term and had no problem getting off of them. There is the potential for abuse but these are much less problematic meds than they are made out to be unless you’re on a very high dose for a long time. It sounds like whoever wrote this article has a bewilderingly preferential perspective of SSRIs, which is interesting given they have caused more suicide than any other psychiatric medication and are notorious for their extremely adverse side effects. Who’s paying you, seriously? SSRIs are “relatively safe”? How can a med that has suicide or Serotonin Toxicity listed as a symptom be considered safe? The research is flawed. They cause permanent brain damage. Neurotoxicity, hyponatremia (permanent condition caused by both SSRIs and brain injury), dementia, suicide, etc. SSRIs are considered “safe” because they typically don’t cause death in case of overdose (not the case for tricyclics and MAOIs) – serotonin syndrome can happen but it’s pretty rare. SSRIs are pretty well tolerated with other types of drugs–again not the case with the other two classes. This is according to my doctor when I asked about switching to a tricyclic when SSRIs became ineffective. Seroquel XR prescribed by Psychiatrist after a 20 minute interview. Lithium added by mental health Certified Nurse Practitioner. Zoloft added by same mental health Certified Nurse Practitioner. No drug or diagnosis information provided at all. Left on cocktail for 5 years. Off of cocktail now for 5 years. Worst 10 years of my life. Emotional and physical dysregulation off the charts. (I was taking care of my terminally ill child when “they” gave me these to help). Was NEVER like this before the medications. NO ONE BELIEVES ME! Lobotomy in a pill cocktail. Cannot wait until this is fully recognized as an iatrogenic condition induced by psychiatrists, mental health providers, and medical practitioners. May become an anti-neuroleptic advocate. Is kissing someone that is taking antipsychotics dangerous? I found almost zero info about it. Can saliva and other bodily fluids contain enough traces of antipsychotics as to mess with the brain/body of someone that never had to take these meds but is exchanging bodily fluids with that person? Since some of these side effects are permanent and include psychosis itself, why does no one talk about it? My psychiatrist has me on no less than meds including 3 benzos. Some were increased in June and slowly I have felt side effects such as dizziness, incoordination, blurry vision, confusion (to the point where I won’t even drive in my small town where I have lived for 14 years because I got lost 3 times)., memory loss, continuous migraines, total loss of appetite and nausea. I have lost 40 lbs. since June. I started to research the meds I was on about 2 months ago and didn’t like what I read so I asked my psychiatrist to reduce some, but he in fact wanted to increase one and add another and said if I wasn’t feeling well to drop my vitamins. So, I went to my GP and she was shocked at what I am on and wants me off them ASAP. The only problem is I cannot get into see another psychiatrist until March! I feel like I will melt into a puddle on the floor. This is a scary scenario for me. I feel betrayed by my psychiatrist whom I have been seeing for over 12 years. I am on sizodon 0.5mg (risperidone) for last 12 years due to drug abuse-related psychosis. First I was on risdone 1mg for 6 years and then titrated to 0.5mg. My left eye twitches involuntarily most of the time and I can’t remember smallest details… like where I have kept my reading glasses or when I brushed my teeth. My cognitive performance deteriorated so much that I have been jobless for more than a decade and my erectile dysfunction has created differences between me and my wife of 10 years. Moreover, my child has been born with a low IQ. Also I suffer from extreme weight gain, high lipids and have a mad look on my face. It is the worst drug of mankind. I was on every class of psychiatric drugs for 15 years. As more drugs and the dosages increased I became more confused. The psychiatrist ignored how debilitated I became and the horrific physical side effects I was enduring. By chance I had a consult with a neurologist who said I had the worst drug-induced Akathisia he had ever seen. I had no idea what Akathisia was. When I told my psychiatrist about this (with a letter from neurologist) the psychiatrist looked dumbfounded. How could I have gone to a so-called physician all these years who never really looked at me? I’d also been in the ICU with Seroquel induced acute pancreatitis. All this happen within 10 weeks and it was my wake-up call to taper off all the psychiatric drugs. I found out later my psychiatric diagnosis was bogus because other psychiatrists said there was nothing wrong with me. How could I be told I was psychotic when I was on heavily prescribed psychiatric drugs and when I went off of them I was told I was normal? The most dangerous psychiatric drugs? It has to be the neuroleptics hands down. There’s no way these drugs should ever be prescribed and if they are the the side effects (damage) should be explained in detail to wherever they’re prescribed to and that person’s family and friends. If my psychiatrist thinks his client is this mentally ill then he should bring in as many of this persons support system to discuss options. How can a prescribing psychiatrist give drugs to someone who doesn’t understand about informed consent? I have adult ADD and was deeply depressed from being in a failed marriage and a religious cult. Over a period of 18 years I was prescribed SSDIs, and was subsequently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, wrongly, as it turns out. I was put on high levels of Lithium, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics. I eventually developed drug induced Parkinsonism and went on disability. I was also on high levels of L-dopa and Caridopa for the Parkinsonism. After finally divorcing, I met a woman whom I had known 32 years previously, and she had me re-evaluated. My neurologist recognized the DIP, and my psychiatrist said was misdiagnosed, so together they titrated me off all drugs, and within 8 months all symptoms disappeared. I underwent another brain scan after this and the Parkinsonism was gone. We married, and I began working again part time, although I’m trying to explain a 3 year absence to potential employers, which is a challenge. To be succinct, I was fed drugs like candy and consented, because, after all, the doctors surely had to be experts. I have my life back after 27 years of a failed marriage and 18 years of misdiagnosis. To say I’m grateful is a bit of an understatement. I’ll never trust a drug from a doctor again. This is a 100% true story. Oh yes, I left the cult too when I divorced. Forgot to mention that. I met yesterday for the third time with my wife’s RN who writes the prescriptions for her bi-polar. She was taking very high doses with very adverse reactions until 6 weeks ago. If I had not gone with her to her appointment, I am sure that dosages would have been increased. Two weeks ago she was again given seroquel which she can not tolerate. I went with her to her appointment yesterday and when I mentioned having discussed her medications with three different pharmacists I was told not to ever come back. The pharmacists all thought that dosages and combinations were dangerous. Is this a common occurrence in the psychiatric field? Thank you. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. .

18cd42ca-b49d-48e5-b94c-433738bcab5e,"The Most Dangerous Psychiatric Drugs: Highest Risk Medications If you’re taking a psychiatric drug, you probably hope that you’re taking the one with the lowest overall risk.  Sure you want the drug to be therapeutic and alleviate your symptoms, but you also don’t want to take a drug with a rapid tolerance onset, debilitating side effects, and crazy withdrawal symptoms.  Many dangerous psychiatric drugs are insidious in that they provide symptomatic relief, but end up resulting in disabling long-term effects; in some cases these effects are permanent. Some of the most extreme dangers associated with psychiatric drugs include: , tardive dyskinesia, brain volume loss, and dementia.  Unfortunately, many patients taking these drugs are not well-informed of the long-term effects.  In fact, some general practitioners remain unaware of the latest research suggesting that certain drugs may be risky long-term treatments from a holistic health perspective. As an example, medicating a patient with a benzodiazepine may be helpful for reducing anxiety, but daily treatment may result in rapid tolerance onset.  Eventually the patient will develop tolerance to the highest dose, and will likely experience side effects from ingestion of such a large dose.  The individual may then need to discontinue the medication, experience debilitating protracted withdrawal symptoms and may even end up with early-onset dementia several years later – all as a result of one psychiatric drug that they thought was helpful. Criteria to Determine the Most Dangerous Psychiatric Drugs When attempting to distinguish the most dangerous psychiatric drugs from the less dangerous (lower risk) ones, it is important to have some criteria.  Since most psychiatrists do not prescribe drugs based on “danger” and have no scale to determine potential dangers, it may be smart to do your own research.  If I were to devise a rating scale, it would incorporate the following aspects of a drug: abuse potential, long-term effects, side effects, tolerance onset, and withdrawal. Dangerous or high-risk psychiatric drugs tend to be those with a high potential for abuse, addiction, and dependence.  While not everyone will abuse them, the fact that there is potential for abuse alone should be considered problematic.  Should someone with an addictive personality get prescribed any agents with a high abuse potential, chances are that they may get abused. When drugs are abused or taken in excess, this could lead to impaired cognitive function, adverse reactions, and in some cases even death.  Prescription drugs with high potential for abuse are commonly referenced as “controlled-substances.”  The lower the number of the “schedule” such as “Schedule II” controlled-substance, the greater the potential for misuse and abuse. We live in an immediate-gratification oriented culture, where everyone is focused on getting immediate, fast-track results with no consideration of the future.  The problem with an immediate-gratification treatment strategy is that you may get immediate relief from debilitating psychiatric symptoms, but long-term effects aren’t considered.  This is best evidenced with drugs like barbiturates and benzodiazepines; they provide potent immediate relief, but may cause neurodegeneration when taken over a long-term. When taking any drug, you should always calculate the likelihood of long-term effects or prognosis associated with a particular treatment.  In some cases (depending on your condition) you may be forced to take a gamble on potential long-term effects (e.g. using antipsychotics for schizophrenia).  That said, you should still make sure you’re working with your psychiatrist to minimize potential of these effects. Many people review side effect profiles of drugs, but are so desperate for symptom relief that they’re willing to put up with some side effects.  Several of the most common side effects associated with dangerous psychiatric drugs include: impaired cognitive function, drowsiness, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction.  While the side effects may be bearable for awhile, frustration associated with weight gain or impaired cognition may continue to mount over time. Imagine if you’re taking a drug that’s making you feel less depressed, but one of the side effects is drowsiness and cognitive impairment.  This may lead to you making more errors at work and could get you fired from a good job.  In other cases, people may find that their romantic partners even become dissatisfied with them due to sexual dysfunction and/or severe weight gain associated with treatment. Whenever considering any psychiatric drug, tolerance onset should always be assessed.  Even if you start with a low dose on an “as-needed” basis, certain drugs are associated with a rapid-tolerance onset.  These are generally “Schedule IV” controlled-substances like psychostimulants and benzodiazepines. The problem with a rapid-tolerance onset is that a person must keep taking greater doses to achieve the same initial therapeutic effect.  Before the individual realizes it, they’ve hit the maximum daily dose or are taking supratherapeutic doses just to get symptomatic relief.  At these high doses, side effects and adverse reactions often occur and discontinuation from the drug creates a neurophysiological fiasco. Many psychiatric drugs are associated with severe withdrawal symptoms, but certain drugs are tougher to discontinue than others.  Safer drugs tend to be less potent, and withdrawal symptoms subside more quickly after discontinuation.  Certain drugs are dangerous to the point that if you discontinue too quickly (e.g. cold turkey), you could end up experiencing seizures or even dying. For this reason, it is important to consider the severity of withdrawal in advance.  Most psychiatric drugs require a gradual titration to reduce the intensity of discontinuation symptoms.  However, some drugs take much longer than others to titrate “off” of.  Someone on high doses of benzodiazepines may take years before they successfully taper off of a high dose and an additional year before they recover. Based on the aforementioned criteria, below is a list of the most dangerous psychiatric drugs.  Keep in mind that this is not a hierarchical list, meaning that what’s listed first isn’t more dangerous than the next item on the list.  Also understand that some individuals may need to take certain drugs due to lack of other options for their particular illness. Antipsychotics are commonly referenced as “neuroleptics” or “major tranquilizers.”  There are two types of antipsychotics, namely: “typical” (older antipsychotics) and “atypical” (newer antipsychotics).  These drugs function primarily as dopamine receptor antagonists, meaning they bind to the dopamine receptor to prevent excess stimulation from dopamine misfiring. : These drugs have an extremely low potential for abuse. Most people that take them wish they had another option.  These are easily among the most unpleasant psychiatric medications to ingest. : The long-term effects associated with antipsychotic usage (especially at high doses) are downright scary. Over a long-term most people gain hundreds of pounds in weight, and there’s a chance they may develop Type 2 diabetes, and tardive dyskinesia (a permanent uncontrollable twitch).  Plus there is substantial evidence to suggest that these cause brain volume loss (both white and grey matter). : If you want to gain weight quickly, antipsychotics are the fastest track method. These drugs increase appetite significantly to the point that you’ll be raiding your fridge in the middle of the night.  The medications also severely impair cognitive function and coordination as a result of anticholinergic-induced drowsiness. : The tolerance onset associated with these medications is relatively slow. Most users can tolerate the same dosage for a long-term before requiring an upward titration. : Discontinuing antipsychotics is certainly no picnic. Withdrawal symptoms are just as severe (if not more severe) than any psychiatric medication.  Various discontinuation symptoms include: insomnia, fatigue, agitation, anxiety, depression, and even psychosis. (Read: Can withdrawal from antipsychotics cause psychosis?). Despite the heavy marketing of these drugs as , they really should be limited to being used by individuals with psychotic symptoms.  Even if they provide relief, they will cause you to lose brain volume.  The side effects are no fun, plus you could end up with permanent Type 2 diabetes, tardive dyskinesia, and even memory impairment as a result of the anticholinergic effects. What’s horrible is that these drugs are being doled out like candy to people with relatively benign conditions like insomnia. (Read: ).  They are approved for schizophrenia and the treatment of bipolar disorder.  That said, even people with bipolar disorder can likely find a safer medication that works than antipsychotics. If you’re looking out for long-term brain health and overall physical health, this is a class of medication to avoid like the plague – unless you have schizophrenia and no other choice.  Those diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and insomnia should seriously consider other options. Benzodiazepines are arguably the single most effective class of medications for alleviating anxiety.  If you’re overly anxious or stressed, you can take a benzodiazepine and literally get immediate relief.  They are very fast-acting drugs, but are associated with some serious problems.  In fact, there is evidence that and possibly permanent memory impairment. : Benzodiazepines have a high potential for abuse, and are thus regarded as a “Schedule II” controlled-substance. Many people end up becoming addicted to their effects and take more than necessary to “get high” or even just to feel calm.  They are regarded as one of the , sporting a 1.83 addiction rating. : The most dangerous long-term effect associated with benzodiazepine usage is that of cognitive impairment. This impairment was considered “moderate” to “large” and appears across all measures of cognitive function, including memory.  The GABAergic effects may also promote neurodegeneration. : Some neuroscientists have argued that while a person takes benzodiazepines, they are unable to learn new information. It is well-documented that they impair cognition, but they may blunt learning abilities as well.  Various side effects include drowsiness, cognitive impairment, confusion, and disorientation.  This is certainly not a favorable side effect profile for those with cognitively demanding jobs, nor those operating heavy machinery. : Those taking benzodiazepines tend to notice rapid-tolerance onset. You may start out at a very low dose, but notice that within a month it’s ineffective.  The next step is increasing the dose, which after another month, that’s no longer effective.  Before you know it, you’re tolerant to the highest dose and side effects are unbearable. : Going through benzodiazepine withdrawal is as severe as any, and can be fatal if high doses are discontinued “cold turkey.” Those that have developed tolerance to high doses usually require an extended tapering period, sometimes lasting well-over 1 year.  Even after the tapering is done, a person will likely still experience (protracted symptoms) characterized by debilitating anxiety, hypersensitivity, etc. – months (or years) after the medication has been stopped. The dangers associated with benzodiazepines can be minimized by taking extremely low doses on an “as-needed” basis.  However, those with addictive personalities may not be able to resist taking more than their prescribed dosage.  Not only do these drugs impair all measures of cognitive function, they inhibit learning ability and may speed up neurodegeneration. Those taking benzodiazepines may find them effective for anxiety or insomnia, but the long-term effects outweigh the immediate relief for most people.  If you aren’t sure what to take besides a benzodiazepine, you may want to consider a safer option like .  I’d also recommend reading the following: “” and “.” The nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics a.k.a. “Z-drugs” (sleeping pills) are commonly prescribed, yet most consumers remain uneducated of the risks associated with treatment.  Sure they’ll help bypass tough cases of insomnia for a good night’s sleep, but the long-term effects as well as side effects are alarming.  According to a 2012 study, people taking sleeping pills increase their risk of early mortality and cancer. : The abuse potential for Z-drugs is considered to be relatively low as “Schedule IV” controlled-substances.  That said, many people find the effects of these drugs similar to benzodiazepines; both drugs influence GABAergic activity.  Due to the effect on GABA, sleeping pills have a higher potential for abuse than often perceived. : The risks associated with long-term usage of sleeping pills are considered similar to those associated with benzos.  You may find that your memory has declined as well as your cognitive performance. Another problematic long-term outcome is an increased likelihood of early mortality and cancer – as evidenced by a 2012 study published in the British Medical Journal. : These drugs carry risk of some serious side effects including: depression, impaired cognitive function, amnesia, and sometimes hallucinations. The side effects alone should steer most people away from these drugs.  Plus they may increase your level of sedation after sleep, making it more likely that your motor skills will be impaired; your likelihood of getting into a car accident increases with Z-drugs. : While the tolerance onset may not be quite as quick with Z-drugs as it is with benzodiazepines, tolerance is quickly established. This means that you’ll constantly need to increase the dosage of your sleeping pill in order to get relief from your insomnia. Continuously increasing the dosage simultaneously increases risk of debilitating side effects. : It is considered challenging to cope with the symptoms associated with sleeping pill discontinuation. If you want some evidence, just read what you’ll experience during .  Many people taking the drug are unable to discontinue due to the array of withdrawal symptoms that arise. If you have insomnia, you should consider sleeping pills a last resort.  While they may be slightly safer than benzodiazepines, they have a relatively similar mechanism of action – acting on the neurotransmission of GABA.  Taking sleeping pills for a long-term is thought to impair cognitive performance and may lead to early onset dementia. Individuals that consider sleeping pills a necessity may want to reevaluate their lifestyle as well as other habits.  Insomnia can generally be corrected by making some habit changes and working with a sleep expert.  Tolerance is quickly established on sleeping pills and withdrawal symptoms aren’t pleasant – just a couple more reasons you may want to avoid them. Psychostimulants are drugs that function by increasing activity in the brain and nervous system.  They stimulate activity, usually via reuptake inhibition of dopamine and/or norepinephrine.  Increasing concentrations of stimulatory neurotransmitters leads to improved cognitive function, increases in physical energy, and relief from symptoms of ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).  Despite the efficacy of psychostimulants, there are potential dangers to consider before taking one. : There is significant potential for abuse associated with psychostimulants. These drugs increase concentrations of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of pleasure, reward, and euphoria.  Individuals may like the initial dopaminergic “high” derived from these drugs, which may lead to drug abuse and ultimately “.” : The long-term effects associated with psychostimulants are a bit difficult to analyze. Most professionals believe that when taken at therapeutic doses by individuals with legitimate ADHD, they may actually have beneficial long-term effects.  Other researchers think that long-term usage may deplete dopamine stores and downregulate dopamine receptors.  Evidence remains conflicting regarding long-term effects: one study reported nothing significant, a second reported slight benefit, and a third reported modest harm. : The side effects associated with psychostimulants are generally favorable. Not only does cognitive performance improve, but a person has more physical energy as a result of these drugs.  Unfavorable side effects include: hypertension, dizziness, headaches, anxiety, and insomnia.  That said, many people find that these drugs increase libido, improve mood, and contribute to weight loss; all of which are considered favorable. : Tolerance is rapidly established on psychostimulants, which is why many people need to constantly increase their dosage for therapeutic effect. A person may quickly build up tolerance to a low dose, and find that they need to continuously increase their dosage to achieve the same initial therapeutic effect.  In a relatively short timeframe, a person will have likely doubled their dosage.  The problem is that when a person reaches high doses, the side effects may become severe and ultimately lead to discontinuation. : It is extremely difficult for most people to deal with the symptoms that arise upon discontinuation from psychostimulant drugs. Many people have reported that following , they experienced extreme fatigue, sleepiness, weight gain, and impaired cognitive function.  Think of the withdrawal period from psychostimulants as being mostly the polar opposite of being on the drugs. Compared to antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, the psychostimulant drugs aren’t considered nearly as dangerous.  They don’t appear to significantly impair cognitive function over the long-term.  That said, people who abuse these drugs may end up developing physical health problems as well as problems with cognitive function such as and downregulated receptors. For individuals who use psychostimulants responsibly and/or on an intermittent (“as needed”) bases will likely minimize many of the potential risks associated with long-term use.  Additionally, some evidence suggests that if you have legitimate ADHD, the long-term effects could actually be beneficial.  It should also be noted that there are many effective “” that you may want to consider prior to using a psychostimulant. Various anti-manic medications include: depakote, lamictal, lithium, and tegretol.  These medications are generally safe for most people with bipolar disorder over the long-term, assuming patients are carefully monitored.  That said, these drugs may be more dangerous than antidepressants due to the fact that they can cause liver damage and thyroid dysfunction. : Mood stabilizers have a low potential for abuse. They are commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder to help reduce manic symptoms.  They will not produce an intoxicating high – all they do is “stabilize” a person’s mood. : The long-term effects associated with mood stabilizers may be subject to both individual variation and the specific medication taken.  Potential long-term concerns include liver problems, pancreatitis, and thyroid abnormalities. In some cases a person may experience cognitive impairment as well – depending on the drug taken. : The side effects associated with mood stabilizers are generally subject to individual variation. Some side effects may include: hair loss, weight changes, depression, thirst, or itching.  Some people may not be able to cope with hair loss and may feel as if the drugs are toxic to their body. : Most people find that they don’t develop tolerance to mood stabilizers. Many people are able to stay on the same dosage for years with sustained efficacy.  Even if an increase in dosage is required to boost efficacy of the medication, tolerance onset is gradual. : Those discontinuing mood stabilizers like Lithium may end up dealing with discontinuation symptoms. (Read: ). The withdrawal may be more severe with certain medications than others, and subject to individual variation.  That said, the withdrawal from mood stabilizers is considered mild compared to most other psychiatric drugs. Those with bipolar disorder benefit from taking mood stabilizers because they balance a person’s mood, preventing manic highs and depressive lows.  These drugs are considerably safer than antipsychotics when used over a long-term from a holistic health perspective.  They have a considerably milder withdrawal period as well. Using a mood stabilizer could be justified among those with treatment-resistant depression, particularly Lithium – which has a favorable track record as an adjunct.  That said, these drugs should generally be taken only by those with conditions that warrant their usage (e.g. bipolar disorder). Most people know that antidepressants are associated with unwanted side effects and difficult withdrawal symptoms.  That said, most newer antidepressants are considered relatively safe, even when taken over the long-term.  By comparison to antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, taking an antidepressant won’t impede your cognitive function and memory; certain antidepressants may even improve your ability to focus. : Most antidepressant medications have no significant abuse potential. This means they cannot be taken for a pleasurable, intoxicating effect.  People aren’t buying Prozac on the streets to get high, whereas they may buy benzodiazepines and/or psychostimulants. : A majority of antidepressant medications are considered safe when taken over the long-term. There is evidence that some medications may cause health conditions over a long-term such as: tinnitus, chronic fatigue, and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.  However, the effects of antidepressants (assuming they aren’t anticholinergic) over the long-term are of modest concern. : Most are generally of moderate concern. They are not considered harmful, but may be problematic from a holistic perspective.  Weight gain and sexual dysfunction happen to be among the two most common side effects.  Should a person experience one or both of these side effects, they may end up becoming more depressed as a result. : It is well known that as a result of tolerance. Fortunately the tolerance is relatively slow in that it usually takes at least 6 months before an individual needs to increase their dosage to achieve the same therapeutic effect.  Some people are able to remain on the same dose for years without tolerance, so there is some evidence that tolerance is subject to individual variation. : The absolute worst aspect of antidepressant treatment is the discontinuation period. For years it was speculated that there were no significant withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping antidepressants.  Now it is well-known that people experience things like: , dizziness, headaches, increased depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts when they stop their medication.  Unfortunately, many of these symptoms can persist for months after the drug has been fully cleared from the body. It should be noted that antidepressants are far safer than antipsychotics and tend to improve long-term outcomes for individuals with major depression.  Based on the type of antidepressant and mechanisms of action, some drugs are safer than others.  The , , and various are considered safe.  The certain may be geneotoxic and/or anticholinergic – potentially causing detriment to long-term health. Various are also known to have a dangerous interaction with tyramine, meaning if you eat too many foods with tyramine while taking an MAOI, you could end up in the hospital.  Most psychiatrists explain this, but it is a risk that should be considered if you aren’t disciplined enough to monitor your dietary intake. Which of these psychiatric drug classes is the most dangerous? The argument could be made that antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are both the most dangerous.  Though they have different mechanisms of action, they are both risky long-term treatments.  Benzodiazepines have a greater potential for abuse and may disrupt cognitive function more significantly than antipsychotics depending on the dosage administered. Despite the fact that your brain may function slightly better on an antipsychotic than a benzodiazepine, the physical side effects associated with antipsychotics are worse than those associated with benzodiazepines.  You may be unable to stop eating, and become clinically obese – leading to a cascade of other health problems including hypertension and Type 2 diabetes as a result. This leads you to end up on even more pills just because you’ve been taking an antipsychotic.  Many of the physical health effects also influence the health of your brain; it’s a symbiotic relationship.  The withdrawal is perhaps more dangerous from benzodiazepines, but discontinuation of antipsychotics may be equally as debilitating. Individuals taking benzodiazepines intermittently at very low doses likely won’t experience the same dangers as someone taking an extended-release version every day.  The frequency of administration and the respective dosing of each drugs dictates the harm potential, but both drug classes should be avoided unless all practical options have been pursued without therapeutic benefit. Conducting a risk-benefit analysis: Do benefits outweigh risks? If you are taking any of the drugs listed above, it is important to consider whether the risks outweigh the benefits you’re getting from the drug.  If you’re getting great symptomatic relief from a “risky” psychiatric drug, you may be willing to endure any potential dangers associated with treatment.  On the other hand, if you’re not getting any relief and are experiencing debilitating side effects – you may want to consider switching to a different medication. It may be a tougher situation for someone who finds an antipsychotic working well to treat their depression, but is gaining significant weight and is concerned about long-term brain volume loss.  Assuming they’ve explored all other options and they feel as if nothing else will work, the usage of an antipsychotic may be justified.  Similarly, someone with refractory anxiety may decide that the short-term boost in quality of life from benzodiazepines is worth the risk of dementia. What can be done to minimize risks of these drugs? To minimize the risk associated with the most dangerous psychiatric drugs, it is recommended to only take them when necessary (e.g. benzodiazepines on an “as-needed” basis).  In addition to reducing the frequency of usage, you should also be taking the .  In other words, you should slowly titrate your dosage up from the lowest possible dose until you get therapeutic benefit. : If you need to take one of these drugs, it is recommended to take the minimal amount that provides symptomatic relief. By taking the minimal dosage, you decrease your risk for side effects and long-term effects. : Certain drugs like benzodiazepines and sleeping pills can be taken on an “as-needed” basis rather than daily. With these drugs, you should be taking them only when absolutely necessary; reduce your frequency of usage as much as possible. If you are taking more than the minimally effective amount, you’ll develop quicker tolerance to the drug and the exogenous chemicals will make more significant changes to your physiology.  The combination of quicker tolerance and greater physiological change equals an increased risk of adverse effects, severe side effects, and/or debilitating long-term effects. Considering individual variation vs. potential dangers Understand that not everyone taking psychiatric medications associated with dangers will experience them.  Many people take medications such as benzodiazepines for a long-term and end up with no cognitive impairment and/or end up fully restoring their cognitive function.  Others may take mood stabilizers for decades with no adverse reactions as evidenced by their consistent blood tests. That said, many people do end up experiencing adverse reactions (e.g. tardive dyskinesia from antipsychotics) and wish they had known of these potential dangers prior to taking their medication.  Understand that the potential dangers shouldn’t scare you away from taking a drug if you need it, but they maybe should scare you away if there are safer options.  In other words, “off-label” use of these drugs shouldn’t be considered until all other options have been explored. To get a better idea of whether you’re more prone to these adverse reactions, you may want to consider getting some genetic testing (e.g. GeneSight). Genetic tests will help you determine how likely you are to respond to a certain drug and tolerate it with minimal side effects.  The more knowledge you have regarding how you’re likely to react, the better. The Catch-22: Necessity of Drugs vs. Potential Dangers If you have schizophrenia, you’ll probably need to take an antipsychotic to alleviate your symptoms.  If you struggle with incessant and are , the most effective treatment is likely to be an antipsychotic that acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist.  This helps reduce dopaminergic activity and provides symptomatic relief.  Unfortunately, most are not nearly as effective as pharmaceutical options. The major catch-22 is that despite getting symptomatic relief, a person may gain a significant amount of weight, experience high blood pressure, and even develop permanent Type 2 diabetes – all because of their medication.  This means that you’re left to choose between: symptomatic relief and medication-induced adverse effects. For some individuals, the adverse effects are a serious concern.  Despite the fact that illnesses like schizophrenia are severely debilitating, so are conditions like Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and brain volume loss associated with the medication.  In regards to schizophrenia, most evidence suggests that long-term health outcomes are superior among those adhering to treatment compared to those who discontinue. The goal for most people with severe mental illness should be to get it under control, which will increase their ability to function in society and improve their quality of life.  At a certain point, medication adjustments may be warranted as a result of side effects and adverse reactions.  That said, when faced with a Catch-22, it is usually better to err on the side of symptom control. Determining whether you could be using a safer drug… Always work with your psychiatrist to determine whether there is a safer treatment option than the drug you’re currently taking (for whatever condition you have).  Many people fail to investigate the array of low risk treatment options that exist.  If you are concerned about the drug that you’re currently taking, do a bit of research and read up on the . If you have an up-to-date psychiatrist, chances are that he or she will know the safest possible options for your condition; even if they are considered “off-label.”  Explain that you are concerned about the long-term effects and/or side effects of your current treatment and determine the other possible options.  While some people may be limited in their treatment options, others may find a drug with considerably lower risk compared to their current medication. What do you think is the most dangerous class of psychiatric drugs? If you have an opinion regarding the most dangerous class of psychiatric drugs, feel free to share it in the comments section below.  Mention whether you’ve endured any of the side effects, adverse reactions, discontinuation symptoms, or long-term effects discussed in the article.  If you think a particular drug is more dangerous than others in its classification, provide some reasons explaining why in the comments section. Safest Psychiatric Drugs: Low Risk, Effective Medications 30+ New Antidepressants (2018): Drugs In Clinical Trials This site is useful but this article is 100% wrong on SSRIs. They are very dangerous. They cause neurotoxicity, dementia, suicide, Serotonin Syndrome death and more. I have diagnosed neurotoxicity from them and in a wheelchair. Whoever is feeding the media BS that they are safe isn’t looking at the thousands in Facebook support groups from them. The worst side effect in my opinion with the antipsychotics is not weight gain or diabetes, but insomnia. If you come off of the medications your blood work will likely correct itself. Insomnia may not correct itself even afterwards if you are taking a high dosage sedative. I have a Mother who has Bi-Polar 2 disorder, the one categorized as the worst one. She began taking lithium at age 49 and nineteen years later was hospitalized for lithium toxicity. She also had been on other drugs. At age 72, she looks far worse than she should. She has developed balance problems, she has fallen and hit her head, she has high blood pressure! That is not even in my family because my family has some great genetic traits with low BP. She has always preferred medications to cope with her inability to sleep plus issues with “feelings of grandeur”. This has caused me to question many things. I do blame her doctor for prescribing the pills. Would you go this route based on these facts? People think drugs are easy to switch around, but then it is very hard. She was offered a rehab but claimed people will not treat her, for all kinds of excuses. So alas, these drugs can very well be addicting. If I had a magic wand, I would have helped her find a way to live more honestly, deal with her diet, deal with a lot of issues with her health and make sure she did not get started with psychiatrists. Oh and I will add this particular one is so obsessed with keeping her, he has stated her drug hangover symptoms are imagined and there are NO side effects. So it’s a tie between her not wanting to get better help, and this manipulative doctor that has changed the course of her entire existence. I will share with you something doctors will not. Many times, mould allergies and problems with good bacteria in the body cause neurological problems and interrupt our natural feel-good chemical processes in our bodies. This is one of the actual underlying reasons for many patients to have problems with their mood. I do not aim to be an expert I only aim to state how people need to look at the big picture of why people might feel desperate and think a drug is going to cure or help them when I have seen the opposite first hand. Good Luck. I was on benzos for two and a half months, 0.5mg twice every day. They helped me tremendously with my anxiety and I had no problem getting off them. I know a ton of people who have taken them long-term and had no problem getting off of them. There is the potential for abuse but these are much less problematic meds than they are made out to be unless you’re on a very high dose for a long time. It sounds like whoever wrote this article has a bewilderingly preferential perspective of SSRIs, which is interesting given they have caused more suicide than any other psychiatric medication and are notorious for their extremely adverse side effects. Who’s paying you, seriously? SSRIs are “relatively safe”? How can a med that has suicide or Serotonin Toxicity listed as a symptom be considered safe? The research is flawed. They cause permanent brain damage. Neurotoxicity, hyponatremia (permanent condition caused by both SSRIs and brain injury), dementia, suicide, etc. SSRIs are considered “safe” because they typically don’t cause death in case of overdose (not the case for tricyclics and MAOIs) – serotonin syndrome can happen but it’s pretty rare. SSRIs are pretty well tolerated with other types of drugs–again not the case with the other two classes. This is according to my doctor when I asked about switching to a tricyclic when SSRIs became ineffective. Seroquel XR prescribed by Psychiatrist after a 20 minute interview. Lithium added by mental health Certified Nurse Practitioner. Zoloft added by same mental health Certified Nurse Practitioner. No drug or diagnosis information provided at all. Left on cocktail for 5 years. Off of cocktail now for 5 years. Worst 10 years of my life. Emotional and physical dysregulation off the charts. (I was taking care of my terminally ill child when “they” gave me these to help). Was NEVER like this before the medications. NO ONE BELIEVES ME! Lobotomy in a pill cocktail. Cannot wait until this is fully recognized as an iatrogenic condition induced by psychiatrists, mental health providers, and medical practitioners. May become an anti-neuroleptic advocate. Is kissing someone that is taking antipsychotics dangerous? I found almost zero info about it. Can saliva and other bodily fluids contain enough traces of antipsychotics as to mess with the brain/body of someone that never had to take these meds but is exchanging bodily fluids with that person? Since some of these side effects are permanent and include psychosis itself, why does no one talk about it? My psychiatrist has me on no less than meds including 3 benzos. Some were increased in June and slowly I have felt side effects such as dizziness, incoordination, blurry vision, confusion (to the point where I won’t even drive in my small town where I have lived for 14 years because I got lost 3 times)., memory loss, continuous migraines, total loss of appetite and nausea. I have lost 40 lbs. since June. I started to research the meds I was on about 2 months ago and didn’t like what I read so I asked my psychiatrist to reduce some, but he in fact wanted to increase one and add another and said if I wasn’t feeling well to drop my vitamins. So, I went to my GP and she was shocked at what I am on and wants me off them ASAP. The only problem is I cannot get into see another psychiatrist until March! I feel like I will melt into a puddle on the floor. This is a scary scenario for me. I feel betrayed by my psychiatrist whom I have been seeing for over 12 years. I am on sizodon 0.5mg (risperidone) for last 12 years due to drug abuse-related psychosis. First I was on risdone 1mg for 6 years and then titrated to 0.5mg. My left eye twitches involuntarily most of the time and I can’t remember smallest details… like where I have kept my reading glasses or when I brushed my teeth. My cognitive performance deteriorated so much that I have been jobless for more than a decade and my erectile dysfunction has created differences between me and my wife of 10 years. Moreover, my child has been born with a low IQ. Also I suffer from extreme weight gain, high lipids and have a mad look on my face. It is the worst drug of mankind. I was on every class of psychiatric drugs for 15 years. As more drugs and the dosages increased I became more confused. The psychiatrist ignored how debilitated I became and the horrific physical side effects I was enduring. By chance I had a consult with a neurologist who said I had the worst drug-induced Akathisia he had ever seen. I had no idea what Akathisia was. When I told my psychiatrist about this (with a letter from neurologist) the psychiatrist looked dumbfounded. How could I have gone to a so-called physician all these years who never really looked at me? I’d also been in the ICU with Seroquel induced acute pancreatitis. All this happen within 10 weeks and it was my wake-up call to taper off all the psychiatric drugs. I found out later my psychiatric diagnosis was bogus because other psychiatrists said there was nothing wrong with me. How could I be told I was psychotic when I was on heavily prescribed psychiatric drugs and when I went off of them I was told I was normal? The most dangerous psychiatric drugs? It has to be the neuroleptics hands down. There’s no way these drugs should ever be prescribed and if they are the the side effects (damage) should be explained in detail to wherever they’re prescribed to and that person’s family and friends. If my psychiatrist thinks his client is this mentally ill then he should bring in as many of this persons support system to discuss options. How can a prescribing psychiatrist give drugs to someone who doesn’t understand about informed consent? I have adult ADD and was deeply depressed from being in a failed marriage and a religious cult. Over a period of 18 years I was prescribed SSDIs, and was subsequently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, wrongly, as it turns out. I was put on high levels of Lithium, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics. I eventually developed drug induced Parkinsonism and went on disability. I was also on high levels of L-dopa and Caridopa for the Parkinsonism. After finally divorcing, I met a woman whom I had known 32 years previously, and she had me re-evaluated. My neurologist recognized the DIP, and my psychiatrist said was misdiagnosed, so together they titrated me off all drugs, and within 8 months all symptoms disappeared. I underwent another brain scan after this and the Parkinsonism was gone. We married, and I began working again part time, although I’m trying to explain a 3 year absence to potential employers, which is a challenge. To be succinct, I was fed drugs like candy and consented, because, after all, the doctors surely had to be experts. I have my life back after 27 years of a failed marriage and 18 years of misdiagnosis. To say I’m grateful is a bit of an understatement. I’ll never trust a drug from a doctor again. This is a 100% true story. Oh yes, I left the cult too when I divorced. Forgot to mention that. I met yesterday for the third time with my wife’s RN who writes the prescriptions for her bi-polar. She was taking very high doses with very adverse reactions until 6 weeks ago. If I had not gone with her to her appointment, I am sure that dosages would have been increased. Two weeks ago she was again given seroquel which she can not tolerate. I went with her to her appointment yesterday and when I mentioned having discussed her medications with three different pharmacists I was told not to ever come back. The pharmacists all thought that dosages and combinations were dangerous. Is this a common occurrence in the psychiatric field? Thank you. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. .

8ae5757c-45d8-4f3f-a080-d480d9d358ad,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies This edition of MSAA’s “What’s New in MS Research” provides highlights from this year’s European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. Experts from throughout the world gathered in Stockholm, Sweden in mid-September to share and discuss the latest research into the causes, diagnosis, course, and treatment of multiple sclerosis. Those investigators and clinicians were gathered for the 35th annual Congress of ECTRIMS, a key forum for presenting the findings that help advance evidence-based management of MS. This article focuses on more than a dozen studies with significance for people living with MS. The studies featured obviously constitute a very small sampling of the research unveiled in Stockholm. However, they provide a good sense of the depth, breadth, and innovation that mark the current state of research into multiple sclerosis. Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies Ofatumumab: Favorable Phase III results set stage for seeking FDA approval Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that people with relapsing-remitting MS could inject at home once a month. This experimental medication demonstrated positive Phase III study results, which were announced at the ECTRIMS 2019 meeting. Based on those results, the pharmaceutical company Novartis said it will file paperwork with the FDA by the end of this year seeking approval for use of ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS. The medication is already approved for the treatment of certain forms of leukemia under the brand name Arzerra. Two identically designed Phase III trials, ASCLEPIOS I and ASCEPLIOS II, compared ofatumumab to Aubagio (teriflunomide). More than 1,800 patients from 37 countries were enrolled in the trials. Those people were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either 20 mg of ofatumumab injected subcutaneously every four weeks, or daily, oral doses of 14 mg of Aubagio, for up to 30 months. The primary endpoint of both trials was impact on the annualized relapse rate, or ARR. In both studies, the ARR for patients receiving ofatumumab was less than half that of those receiving Aubagio. Ofatumumab also demonstrated greater suppression of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions on MRI – an indication of inflammatory activity – compared with Aubagio, and reduced the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression by roughly one-third relative to Aubagio. Meanwhile, safety data in the trial were comparable with that seen in earlier studies of the agent. Mayzent and delay in time to disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Mayzent (siponimod) helps patients with secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) delay the time until they need to use a wheelchair, according to a team of international researchers. In March 2019, the FDA approved Mayzent as the first oral drug to treat SPMS with active disease. The FDA’s approval was based on results of the Phase III EXPAND trial. Researchers drew on data from that trial to assess the impact that Mayzent had on people reaching an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 7.0, which reflects an inability to walk beyond a few steps and the need for wheelchair use. Analysis of data on more than 1,100 study participants found that, compared to placebo, Mayzent lengthened the median time to reaching an EDSS score of 7 or greater by 4.3 years (12.0 years for placebo vs 16.3 years for Mayzent). The reduction in risk of need for a wheelchair was greatest in people with more significant disability. In more than 400 study participants with an EDSS score of 6.5 at the study’s start, Mayzent cut the risk of needing a wheelchair by 28% to 36%, depending on the type of analysis employed. Impact of extending Tysabri dosing interval on relapse rates Tysabri (natalizumab) has demonstrated its efficacy in treating relapsing-remitting MS, but the standard dosing schedule of a 300-mg infusion every four weeks is associated with increased risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious and potentially life-threatening disease. In an effort to continue providing people with MS with the benefits of Tysabri while reducing their risk for PML, researchers have explored whether extending the period between infusions can preserve the disease-modifying effects of the drug while diminishing the chances of developing PML. With earlier research showing that extended interval dosing (EID) lowers the risk of PML compared to standard interval dosing (SID), a large, long-term observational study presented at ECTRIMS 2019 examined the differences in effectiveness when extending the time between treatments. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to compare 135 pairs of patients. One patient in each pair had received Tysabri on the standard-interval schedule, while the other had extended-interval dosing. The researchers found no significant difference in annualized relapse rate (ARR) or risk of relapse between the two groups. They added that a randomized, prospective study comparing the two treatment approaches is needed to provide more-definitive evidence. What’s the risk of “rebound” disease activity after stopping Gilenya? People with MS may decide to stop a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for any number of reasons, ranging from side effects or a perceived lack of effectiveness to a desire to switch to another agent or to be “treatment-free” for a period of time. The importance of consulting with a clinician before stopping treatment is underscored by the risk for rebound disease activity, or RDA, which can occur once a medication that is taken to control MS is discontinued. Investigators recently examined the records of 117 patients to determine the risk for RDA after stopping Gilenya, and to see if any factors made people more prone to experiencing “rebound.” The group included 86 women and 31 men. Nine of the 117 patients, or 7.7%, had RDA after stopping Gilenya, with the rebound activity marked by severe clinical relapses with exaggerated MRI lesions compared to their level of disease activity before starting the DMT. Compared to patients who did not experience RDA upon stopping treatment, those who did have rebound activity had a higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) before initiating Gilenya, and also had a shorter interval between their last relapse and their first dose of the medication. The duration of Gilenya treatment did not appear to affect the likelihood of rebound. The researchers added that eight of the nine people experiencing RDA had stopped treatment abruptly. In an observation that again reinforces the importance of working closely with a clinician when considering any change to treatment approach, the investigators concluded, “Our results indicate that [a] fingolimod every-other-day cessation strategy may help to prevent RDA.” Patients at the Cleveland Clinic’s Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis had lower rates of adverse events (AEs) with Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) than did patients in the Phase III clinical trials that led to the disease-modifying therapy’s approval in March 2017, according to Mellen Center researchers. In the Mellen Center cohort, 3.3% had a serious adverse event, while 21% had an infection – typically a urinary tract infection or upper respiratory infection – and 18% had an infusion-related reaction. By contrast, in the OPERA I and OPERA II trials of Ocrevus in RRMS, 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively, of patients receiving Ocrevus had a serious adverse event, 56.9% and 60.2% had an infection, and 30.9% and 37.6% had at least one infusion-related reaction. Similarly, in the ORATORIO trial of Ocrevus in PPMS, 20.4% of Ocrevus patients had a serious adverse event, and 39.9% had one or more infusion-related reactions. The Mellen Center researchers noted that the lower rates of adverse events that they recorded may have been due to differences in reporting. They also observed that patients at their institution had longer average disease duration and fewer enhancing lesions at baseline than clinical trial participants. The real-world findings are, nonetheless, welcome and reassuring. FDA approves Vumerity™, a fumarate medication designed to address GI tolerability Clinicians know that the medications that work best are those that patients take regularly. For this reason, the tolerability of an agent can be as important as its effectiveness. In a nod to this reality, Biogen and Alkermes developed Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) to provide the efficacy already demonstrated by Biogen’s disease-modifying therapy Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but with fewer of the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects reported with the latter medication. In late October, a few weeks after MS researchers returned from ECTRIMS 2019, the FDA announced that it had approved Vumerity for use in relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. In pursuing FDA approval for Vumerity, Biogen provided data from the EVOLVE-MS-1 study, an ongoing, Phase III, single-arm, open-label, two-year safety study enrolling patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Interim results from the study submitted to the FDA showed that 6.3% of patients had stopped Vumerity due to adverse events, with fewer than 1% stopping because of gastrointestinal events. In the clinical trials leading to approval of Tecfidera, 18% of patients reported abdominal pain, 14% reported diarrhea, 12% cited nausea, and 9% reported vomiting. A tilt toward monoclonal antibody therapy as first-line MS treatment Neurologists’ top choice of an initial multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment has shifted from interferon-based medications to monoclonal antibodies. That was the main finding of an analysis of data on more than 1,000 people with MS who began their first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in late 2018 or early 2019. In December 2018 and January 2019, investigators drew on records from 213 U.S. neurologists to examine those physicians’ prescribing of MS medications over the prior three months. They then compared that 2018-2019 information with comparable data on the first medications prescribed to more than 1,000 “treatment-naïve” patients (individuals who had never taken a DMT previously) in early 2018, and another 1,020 patients who received their first DMT in 2017. Researchers found that in late 2018-early 2019, 18% of treatment-naïve patients started a monoclonal antibody medication as their first DMT, compared with 8% in 2017. Conversely, the proportion of newly treated patients receiving an interferon-based medication declined from 26% in 2017 to 17% in 2019. The investigators noted that greater prescribing of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) drove much of the increase in monoclonal antibody use, and was accompanied by a quantitatively measured increase in neurologists’ comfort level with using Ocrevus for relapsing-remitting forms of MS. They added that the 2017 approval of a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate, or GA) also had significantly affected neurologists’ choice of a first-line DMT, with branded GA seeing its share of first-line prescriptions declining from 27% in 2017 to 18% in 2019, while generic GA went from accounting for 4% of first-line prescriptions in 2017 to 13% in 2019. Further evidence supporting early initiation of disease-modifying therapy Increasing age, duration of multiple sclerosis (MS), and greater disability detract from the effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies, according to an analysis of data on more than 14,000 patients. While those findings may seem intuitive, the researchers went further and quantified the extent to which medication therapy was diminished per year, per 1-point change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and other measures. The study drew on the MSBase Registry, examining data for 14,717 people who had been followed for at least one year. Seventy-two percent of the patients were female. The mean age at first visit was 36 years, and the patients had a mean duration of disease of 5.7 years and a median EDSS score of 2. Roughly three-quarters had clinically definite MS, while 20% had a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The researchers found that patients receiving treatment were 39% more likely to experience confirmed improvement of disability than their untreated counterparts. However, this effect of therapy declined with age (-2% per year), disease duration (-6% per year), and disability (-8% per EDSS step). In an observation that reinforces the value of early initiation of treatment, the investigators concluded, “Immunotherapies exert their maximum effect in young patients with shorter disease course, mild disability and a previous stability on treatment.” Tracking changes in use of DMTs as well as complementary and alternative interventions People with MS are drawing on both disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions in managing their health, according to a recent survey of more than 1,100 patients in Oregon and southwest Washington. Fielded from September 2018 to April 2019, the survey identified respondents’ use of both prescription medications for MS and interventions such as herbs and supplements, cannabis, dietary plans, and yoga. In addition to assessing current approaches to MS, researchers compared results from the 2018-2019 questionnaire with answers to a similar survey conducted in 2001. Those investigators found that the proportion of people taking a DMT at the time they were surveyed increased from 47% in 2001 to 69% now. Use of CAM at time of survey response also increased during that period, from 68% to 93%. Eighty-six percent of respondents to the 2018-2019 survey reported having employed exercise in managing their MS, with the proportion of people who have tried yoga increasing from 23% in 2001 to 46% in the recent survey. The proportion of people reporting having used meditation also increased, 16% to 39%. A majority of respondents to both surveys reported having used diet to manage their MS, with a slight increase from 59% in 2001 to 66% more recently. Low-carbohydrate and anti-inflammatory diets were the most commonly followed approaches in both surveys. Researchers noted that they will further analyze their data to explore differences in perceived benefit of DMTs between CAM users and nonusers. Three key take-aways emerge from this research. First, more people are doing more than ever before to take a pro-active approach to dealing with their MS. Second, many people have rejected the false dichotomy of either using only a prescription medication or rejecting such agents in favor of exclusive reliance on alternative approaches. Third, as use of alternative approaches grows, it is important for patients to talk openly with their clinicians about all interventions they are employing or considering, particularly given the potential for interaction between herbs and some supplements and prescription medications. Ninety-three percent of the 81 MS patients to undergo stem-cell transplantation at a Swedish center between 2004 and February 2019 remained progression free over an average follow-up period of 3.9 years, and none have died since undergoing the procedure. The investigators presenting that heartening news at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting added that 87% of the patients had not experienced a relapse since transplantation, and that the annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the entire group was 0.022. By comparison, the group’s mean ARR for the year prior to the procedure was 2.2. The patients consisted of 56 women and 25 men. Their median age was 29 years, and 95% had relapsing-remitting MS. Conversely, stem-cell transplantation did not reduce the number of active lesions seen on MRI after 24 weeks of treatment in a major international study, but did show promise in reducing the relapse rate, one of the investigation’s lead researchers told the press in discussing preliminary results presented at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting. The MESEMS trial (MEsenchymal StEm cells for Multiple Sclerosis) was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over phase II trial examining the impact of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Most of the 144 patients randomized for treatment had relapsing-remitting MS, while roughly 20% had secondary-progressive MS, and a little over 10% had primary-progressive MS. The study’s authors noted that the results presented at ECTRIMS were preliminary, and that further analysis is needed. Assessing the impact of plasma exchange when steroids don’t help with relapses Therapeutic plasma exchange – or plasmapheresis – is a technique clinicians sometimes employ when steroids aren’t helping to resolve an MS relapse. The process involves withdrawing whole blood from a vein, separating the plasma – or liquid portion of the blood – from the red and white blood cells, and then transfusing the red and white blood cells back into the patient, along with plasma replacement fluid. This “blood cleansing” approach is fairly uncommon, so Austrian and German researchers recently analyzed 14 years’ worth of data on 133 patients at their MS clinics to better understand its effectiveness. The investigators assessed clinical response to plasma exchange, with a marked clinical response defined as ≥1 step improvement in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and mild clinical improvement – which was characterized by improvement in neurological examination with change of EDSS <1 step. They also identified patients who had no improvement. Seventy-six percent of patients undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) saw improvement, with 36% having marked improvement and 40% experiencing mild improvement. In general, TPE was more effective in younger patients, those with a shorter duration of disease, and with a shorter interval between relapse and receiving TPE. By exploring how often and to what extent TPE helps patients who have not benefited sufficiently from steroids during relapses – and by identifying which patients are likely to have the best response to the treatment – the researchers have provided clinicians with valuable insights on a less commonly employed treatment option. A team of Canadian researchers showed in a small study that blood levels of a protein called serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) measured in the first five years after onset of symptoms can provide important insights on a patient’s likely course over the next 15 years. In analyzing data on 64 people with MS, they found that patients with a serum NfL level greater than 7.62 pg/mL had a nine-times greater risk of developing secondary-progressive MS over the following several years than people with lower blood levels of the protein. Similarly, when they divided patients into three groups, based on whether they had low, medium, or high NfL levels, they found that those with the highest level had more aggressive disease progression, with their Expanded Disability Stats Scale (EDSS) score increasing by 0.16 per year, reflecting greater impairment. Similarly, patients in the lowest NfL levels were 5.3-times less likely than others to reach an EDSS of 4.0 or greater. The researchers noted that their findings were consistent across the adult age range and in both men and women. They concluded that their study “demonstrates an association between early disease serum NfL and long term clinical outcomes over the longest follow-up to-date. Whether the course of such patients can be altered by earlier treatment will require further study.” In another study, a Spanish investigator has developed evidence indicating that the presence and prevalence of certain types of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can serve as predictive factors in assessing the long-term course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other molecules found in the gastrointestinal tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system, and in recent years has emerged as a focus of intense study in MS. Earlier research indicates that people with MS or at heightened risk for MS have imbalances in the mix of bacteria normally found in the GI tract of healthy people. The study reported at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting involved using molecular sequencing of stool samples to study the gut microbiota – or composition of bacterial species – of 16 people with RRMS and 15 healthy controls. The investigators then followed the people with MS over 24 months. They found that levels of family of bacteria, and particularly two types of bacteria within that family known as and were associated with an increased risk of relapses and new lesions appearing on MRI. While this was a small study whose findings need to be explored on a larger scale, it points to the many ways researchers are homing in on factors that help chart the likely course of disease – and that eventually will help patients and their clinicians formulate treatment plans accordingly. People with MS have elevated risk for other conditions even before their MS diagnosis Even before they are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, people with MS are more likely than others to have bladder problems, eye issues, and other conditions, according to a Swedish study involving more than 6,600 people with MS and almost 62,000 healthy controls. The people ultimately identified as having MS had a higher pre-diagnosis incidence of epilepsy (1.5% vs. 0.8%), autoimmune disease (1.3% vs 0.7%), bladder dysfunction (1.2% vs 0.2%), and retinal disorders (2.4% vs 1.2%) compared with controls. After MS diagnosis, the patients continued to have considerably higher rates of epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, and bladder dysfunction, as well as of toxic liver disease. The research team concluded, “Before a diagnosis of MS, patients already displayed an increased rate of comorbidity compared with MS-free controls. After diagnosis, patients with MS continued to display increased risk of several comorbidities, some of which may be explained by surveillance bias due to more frequent contact with healthcare.” Measuring the toll of MS on women’s physical, mental function Multiple sclerosis accelerates age-related physiologic decline in physical and mental function by 10-20 years in women with MS compared to their same-age counterparts. That is the unwelcome but important conclusion of researchers who drew on data from the large-scale Nurses Health Study and Nurses Health Study II and compared participants’ physical function and cognitive function scores with those of 582 women with confirmed MS. They found that women with MS who were ages 36 to 41 years had, on average, physical function comparable to that of unaffected women aged 58 to 62 years. Middle-aged women with MS were about three-times more likely than their age peers to report a slower walking pace and more than twice as likely to report almost daily urine leaks. At higher ages, women with MS were five-times more likely than unaffected peers to report problems with balance. Among women over age 75 years, women with MS were less likely to report good cognitive function than women without MS. The results, while not encouraging, are not entirely surprising either, and underscore the importance of pursuing overall good health through clinician-approved diet and exercise programs in order to optimize well-being. Recurrent demyelinating events in children: Identifying frequency and risk factors Two-thirds of children who have a first demyelinating event (FDE) will go on to have at least one more such event, with older age at FDE, presence of more than five lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and symptoms suggestive of a brainstem syndrome being among several risk factors for further events. Those were the key findings to emerge from an observational cohort study involving 75 children who had an FDE between 1999 and 2018. The children included 46 girls and 29 boys; their median age was 12 years. In 80% of cases, the FDE involved a single neurological symptom. Thirty-six had optic neuritis, while 15 had transverse myelitis, and 14 had symptoms indicative of a brainstem syndrome. Final diagnoses included multiple sclerosis (32 children), relapsing optic neuritis (7), and syndromes including polyphasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and neuromyelitis optica. Fifty-six percent of the children experienced a relapse within 60 months of their FDE, and the overall risk of relapse was calculated at 65%. A clinical presentation indicating a brainstem syndrome was associated with a 10-fold higher risk for a second demyelinating event compared with other clinical presentations, while being age 11 years or older at the time of the FDE more than doubled the risk of recurrence compared to younger children. MRI findings of periventricular, subcortical, brainstem, and lateral spinal lesions also were associated with increased risk. As investigators better understand the risks of – and risk factors for – recurrent demyelinating events in young people, clinicians can formulate their counseling approaches, diagnostic strategies, and treatment decisions accordingly to enhance care and help children and their families know what to anticipate.

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF, Tecfidera) was approved by the US FDA in March 2013 as an oral disease modifying treatment for relapsing forms of MS. Combined data from a Phase II study and two Phase III trials showed that DMF reduces relapses, disability progression, MRI lesion activity. The exact mechanism of action of DMF is not known but may include direct inhibition of proinflammatory pathways and effects on dendritic cell differentiation. DMF may also act through the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) like 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant response pathway. DMF is administered as a single 240mg capsule, twice per day (once in the morning and once in the evening; it does not need to be taken exactly 12 hours apart.) A seven-day starter-pack of 120m mg capsules twice per day is available and recommended to help improve tolerability. Food does not alter DMF's absorption. Therefore, DMF can be taken without regard to meals, although gastrointestinal tolerability may be improved by taking it with food. Missed doses should be skipped and do not need to be made up. However, if a few days are missed, patients may have a recurrence of their side effects. DMF was approved to treat relapsing forms of MS. DMF is also an appropriate treatment option for patients with ongoing disease activity, intolerable side effects, or logistical issues with other MS therapies. DMF is approved as first line therapy (i.e. patients are not required to have tried other medications before DMF), although long-term experience with its use is limited. Note that some insurances will not approve this as first line therapy but may insist that patients use other medications first. We often have patients check with their insurance before beginning the paperwork for DMF. Q: Should patients switch from a previously-available injected medication to DMF? We anticipate many patients currently on an injectable therapy will be attracted to DMF's oral route of administration. However, if a patient is stable clinically and radiographically, and he/she is not experiencing significant adverse effects, in general, we recommend not switching therapy. For JC virus antibody-positive patients on Tysabri who are concerned about the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, DMF is a reasonable consideration. As with anyone on an MS medicine, we do consider switching medicines in the following situations: Intolerance or specific side effects of present medicine. Risk of major side effects such as PML with present medicine Continued relapses above 'acceptable' level of activity (there are no well defined criteria but more than one relapse per year or functionally meaningful relapses often prompt us to change medicine) Continued MRI activity (New T2 lesions or enhancing lesion). Again there is some low level of new disease activity which would be expected on all of the medicines and a judgment call is necessary to decide when a change makes sense. Q: What side effects and safety issues does DMF have? DMF is generally safe and well tolerated. DMF typically lowers the lymphocyte count. The FDA recommends a complete blood count prior to initiating treatment, and then again annually and when clinically indicated. The main side-effects of DMF are skin flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms. Although uncommon, when it is seen, skin flushing typically occurs 30 minutes to several hours after taking DMF. Pruritis and erythema are sometimes reported, too. A placebo-controlled study found that aspirin can significantly reduce flushing. Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting can be seen between 30 minutes and several hours after taking DMF. Symptoms are most common in the first few weeks after starting DMF and typically reduce significantly by one month of treatment. Symptomatic therapies can be used in patients, where needed, including H2/proton pump inhibitors, metoclopramide, bismuth subsalicylate, loperamide, as needed depending upon the gastrointestinal symptoms. The enteric formulation of DMF makes it mostly like to be absorbed int he intestines. Accordingly, patients who have received gastric bypass are not expected to have altered tolerability. Some patients have reported a benefit for the GI symptoms using an anecdotal list of foods: Q: Can the dosing schedule be changed to reduce the risk of GI side effects? Different dosing strategies have been applied to try to reduce GI side effects. At the Mellen Center we have been using the following modification of the dosing strategy for MG: Third and Fourth week: DMF 240mg with the largest meal, and one 120mg with opposite meal (breakfast and dinner) An alternative regimen tested by NYU medical center (presented ACTRIMS meeting September 2014): Q: Is there a risk of PML with DMF and if so how do I risk stratify and monitor appropriately? Although DMF is a potent immunomodulatory drug and reversibly lowers blood lymphocyte counts, the clinical trials did not observe an increased rate of either routine infections or opportunistic infections. This decline in the lymphocyte count tends to progress over the first year of treatment and counts remain low throughout the course of treatment. However, lymphocyte counts can be quite variable over time, too. Lymphocyte counts may take from 12-16 weeks to return to normal after treatment with tecfidera. There have been case reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with another fumaric acid preparation (Fumaderm), which is available in Germany. Most of these cases were on another immune-suppressing medication prior to or at the time of DMF therapy or had persistently low lymphocyte counts. In October 2014 a single case was reported with DMF of PML which was fatal. This patient was enrolled in ongoing clinical trials of DMF and has not been on immunosuppressive medications prior to this trial. The patient experienced persistently low absolute lymphocyte counts for 3.5 years of treatment (< 500), and was not recognized as having PML until late in the disease course. On the basis of this case, at the Mellen Center, we now recommend a CBC with differential every 6 months while patients are on dimethyl fumarate. If the absolute lymphocyte counts are 500-750. we recheck in 3 months then every 3 months until the count rises about 750. If the absolute lymphocyte count is under 500, we recheck BC monthly and obtain JCV serology. If the absolute lymphocyte count is persistently < 500 and the patient is JCV seropositive, we consider an alternative treatment. Q: How long should a patient wait after stopping another disease modifying therapy before starting DMF? there is no data regarding optimal wash out times. The theoretical increased risk of complications from incomplete wash out from the previous therapy needs to be balanced against the risk of return of MS disease activity during a wash out period. In some patients, the return of disease activity can be very severe. Decisions regarding wash out are influenced by the treatments and the patients underlying disease activity. We have adopted the following wash out periods before starting DMF: Interferon, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide: No wash out period Fingolimod: 2-3 week wash out (so that lymphocyte counts normalize) Prior to therapy, a complete blood count (CBC) is recommended. We have also begun to do JCVirus antibodies on patients starting natalizumab, fingolimod, or dimethyl fumarate due to the case reports of PML on the latter two medications and due to the known propensity of natalizumab to cause PML. Q: Are there any restrictions on who can take DMF? There are no contraindications for using DMF. Patients with nausea and diarrhea at baseline should use DMF with caution, as it may aggravate those symptoms. there are no reports of complications related to surgery in patients receiving DMF, so we do not recommend stopping DMF for surgery. Q: Does the risk of infection relate to peripheral blood, white blood cell, or lymphocyte counts? There is no clear relationship between the level of lymphocyte reduction and the incidence (or severity) of infections. See above discussion of risk mitigation for PML. The effectiveness and safety of DMF in primary and secondary progressive MS are not known. Based on animal studies, DMF potentially causes fetal harm and is classified as Pregnancy Category C. Women should use effective contraception while taking DMF and for some time after stopping it. Women should discontinue DMF prior to attempting to become pregnant. There is no known effect of DMF on sperm. Q: Can DMF be used in combination with other MS disease therapies? There are no data concerning the safety or utility of combining DMF with other MS disease therapies. Co-Administration of DMF with immunosuppressant medications would be expected to increase the risk of infection. Q: Can DMF be combined with MS symptom medication? DMF can be combined with MS symptom medications without a problem. There are no specific medications which are contraindicated while patients are on DMF. Q: Can DMF be combined with medications for other conditions? There are no medications known to interact with DMF. Q: Can the dose of DMF be increased beyond 240mg twice daily? The approved dose of DMF is 240mg twice daily (480mg total per day). 240mg thrice daily (720mg total per day) were tested in the DMF Phase II and Phase III trials, but there was no greater efficacy at this dose. Lower dose of DMF (i.e. 240mg once daily) have not been evaluated and so are not currently recommended. Gold R, Kappos L, Arnold DL, et al.

eb639367-de32-494c-9be5-e566e6b94233,"Corticosteroids are a class of drug that lowers inflammation in the body. They also reduce immune system activity. Because corticosteroids ease swelling, itching, redness, and allergic reactions, doctors often prescribe them to help treat diseases like: Corticosteroids resemble cortisol, a hormone naturally produced by the body’s adrenal glands. The body needs cortisol to stay healthy. Cortisol is a major player in a wide range of processes in the body, including metabolism, immune response, and stress. Doctors prescribe corticosteroids for a number of reasons, including: This occurs when your body doesn’t make enough cortisol. Corticosteroids can make up the difference. Corticosteroids help suppress the immune system and reduce the likelihood of organ rejection. In cases when inflammation causes damage to important organs, corticosteroids can save lives. Inflammation occurs when the body’s white blood cells are mobilized to protect against infection and foreign substances. Sometimes the immune system doesn’t work correctly, and people develop inflammatory conditions that cause damage instead of protection.Corticosteroids decrease the inflammation and prevent this damage. They also affect how white blood cells work and reduce the activity of the immune system. They’re often used to treat these conditions as well: Corticosteroids can be systemic or localized. Localized steroids target a specific part of the body. These can be applied through: Systemic steroids move through the blood to assist more parts of the body. They can be delivered through , with an IV, or with a needle into a muscle. Localized steroids are used to treat conditions like asthma and hives. Systemic steroids treat conditions such as lupus and multiple sclerosis. While corticosteroids can be called steroids, they’re not the same as . These are also called . There are a number of corticosteroids available. Some of the most common brand names include: Some side effects can occur with topical, inhaled, and injected steroids. However, most side effects come from oral steroids. Side effects from inhaled corticosteroids can include: Topical corticosteroids can lead to thin skin, acne, and red skin lesions. When injected, they can cause: Not everyone will develop side effects. The presence of side effects varies from person to person. High doses for long periods of time increases the likelihood of having side effects. It’s important to talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of using this medication. If they’re used for a short period (from a few days to a few weeks), it’s possible to have no side effects. Corticosteroids can be a life-changing or life-saving medication, but long-term use can cause health risks. Despite negative side effects, some conditions do require long-term use. Here are a few things to consider: might be more likely to develop issues with high blood pressure and osteoporosis. Women have a higher chance of developing this bone disease. may experience stunted growth. Corticosteroids can also cause measles or chickenpox infections that are more serious than those in children not taking them. should use steroids with caution. They may cause issues with growth or other effects for the baby. Make sure to let your doctor know if you’ve had any negative reactions to a medicine before. Also tell your doctor about any allergies you may have. Certain medical conditions may affect the use of this medication. Tell your doctor if you have any health conditions. It’s particularly important to tell them if you have: Corticosteroids can also alter the effects of other medications. However, the likelihood of interactions happening with steroid sprays or injections is low. Be careful what you eat when taking this medication, too. Certain steroids shouldn’t be taken with food, as interactions may occur. Avoid taking this drug with grapefruit juice. Tobacco and alcohol can also cause interactions with certain medications. Make sure to talk to your doctor about the effect these may have on corticosteroids. The use of this medication may be the best option for your situation. While there are risks associated with corticosteroids, there are ways to minimize your side effects. Here are some tips to consider: Talk to your doctor about low or intermittent dosing. Make healthy lifestyle choices, like a healthy diet and exercising more often than not. Slowly taper dosage when stopping therapy if you’ve been using this medication for a long time. This allows your adrenal glands time to adjust. Monitor your blood pressure and bone density, and get treatment if needed. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory medications that can treat diseases like asthma, arthritis, and lupus. They can come with some serious side effects. Make sure to talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of corticosteroids, other conditions or diseases you have, and ways to minimize side effects.

Common relapse syndromes include unilateral optic neuritis, focal brainstem or cerebellar syndromes, or partial myelitis. Atypical symptoms that would warrant further evaluation include encephalopathy, complete ophthalmoplegia, headache, or isolated fatigue. A typical MS relapse evolves over 24-48 hours and reaches a nadir in several days. More sudden or gradual symptoms should prompt evaluation of alternative diagnoses. Most patients experience some spontaneous recovery though it is variable and affected by other factors such as comorbidities, functional status prior to the relapse, and age.  Q: What is the differential diagnosis for a MS relapse? A: MS can manifest with a wide array of new or worsening symptoms and they do not all constitute a relapse. A pseudorelapse is a temporary recrudescence of prior neurological deficits usually in the setting of certain stressors such as an infection, heat exposure (including fever or exercise), or adverse psychosocial event.  Common paroxysmal syndromes include trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte sign which is an electrical sensation elicited with neck flexion or Pulfrich phenomenon which is an illusionary, binocular disturbance where object moving across the visual field is perceived as travelling along a curved trajectory. Uhthoff phenomenon specifically refers to transient visual blurring with exercise in patients with a history of optic neuritis though other motor or sensory symptoms can exhibit the same phenomenon. Disability accrual in MS can also occur independent of relapses (ie progression). The most common phenotypic presentation is gradual worsening myelopathy. This can be a challenging diagnosis because this qualifier is made retrospectively over time and patients can have overlying relapses. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can be very difficult to distinguish from a MS relapse especially early in PML. Clinicians should be vigilant in MS patients treated with certain therapies associated with PML infection, particularly natalizumab. In patients being treated with highly effective therapies, there is usually a low risk of breakthrough disease so PML as the cause of new symptoms should be considered, especially if they include seizures, behavioral changes or cognitive abnormalities; if they evolve subacutely or do not respond to corticosteroids. MRI can assist in differentiating a PML lesion from a MS relapse. A: The evaluation of a relapse should be tailored to the clinical scenario. In the setting of an established diagnosis of MS, new neurologic symptoms compatible with those caused by MS, and no symptoms or history suggesting an intercurrent condition, no further ancillary testing may be needed. When symptoms are atypical of a relapse, a targeted work-up should be pursued to identify the cause. For example, if a patient presents with reemergence of remote neurological deficits concerning for a pseudorelapse they should undergo basic laboratory testing before consider pharmacological treatment for a relapse. This includes a urinalysis with culture since occult urinary tract infections are common in MS, along with a complete cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel. Based on the clinical history, further investigative measures can be ordered if symptoms suggest an intercurrent condition or alternative medical condition. An infection or other derangement does not exclude a concomitant relapse, but identification and correction of the possible trigger should be managed before the relapse is treated. A: In general, neuroimaging is not necessary to diagnose a relapse, which is a clinical diagnosis. MRI can be a useful adjuvant to screen for other mimics such as PML or stroke. MRI can also be helpful if there is diagnostic uncertainty as radiographic activity in the context of new neurological symptoms would support the diagnosis of a MS relapse. The prototypical MRI finding in a relapse is gadolinium enhancement reflecting blood brain barrier breakdown. Gadolinium enhancement is observed in most but not all new lesions and resolves over the course of several weeks. Clinicians should be aware that potential treatment such as corticosteroids can alter these radiographic findings. Enhancing lesions can also occur without obvious clinical signs or symptoms. A: In general, we treat relapses, as they cause significant morbidity and symptoms typically interfere patients’ ability to function. Mild relapses such as non-disabling sensory symptoms or those already exhibiting spontaneous improvement may not require intervention as the risk of therapy may outweighs potential benefit of treatment. Ultimately, treatment decisions are made jointly between the patient and provider using a shared decision-making model. Mild, asymptomatic MRI lesion activity does not require treatment as the rationale for pharmacological treatment is to decrease the duration and intensity of neurological symptoms. We often treat in the setting of multiple asymptomatic active lesion as those patients are at increased risk for clinical worsening. New clinical or radiographic disease activity may warrant a change in disease modifying therapy. Please refer to the Mellen Center Approach (MCA) on switching disease modifying therapies for more information on that topic. A: Corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment option for MS relapses. High dose corticosteroids offer rapid symptom relief and hasten neurologic recovery. While there has been much debate about intravenous vs oral administration, it has been demonstrated that dose rather than the route of administration is the most important factor in terms of efficacy.10 We typically use intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP 1000mg daily) or an equivalent dose of intravenous of high dose oral prednisone (1250mg daily which equates to twenty-five 50mg tablets) for 3-5 days for relapses. Multiple studies have shown that high-dose, oral corticosteroid and high-dose, IV methylprednisolone are bioequivalent with a similar side effect profile and equivalent MRI /clinical outcomes. If the oral regimen is selected, we advise patients that they do not need to take all the pills at one time but they take the pills earlier in the day to prevent potential sleep disturbance.  To lessen side effects, we typically prescribe a proton pump inhibitor or H2 antagonists along with a sleep aid (typically melatonin or diphenhydramine) to proactively manage the impact of the high dose corticosteroids. In addition, steroids are associated with rare yet serious complications including aseptic necrosis of the shoulder or hip and hepatic failure. If patients experience severe psychiatric manifestations including mania, depression or psychosis we have a higher threshold for prescribing corticosteroids as those symptoms are difficult to mitigate and could be life threatening. Corticosteroid-induced psychosis usually self-resolves once the medication is stopped but discontinuation is not always possible. Symptoms can be managed with short courses of atypical antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medications though we would encourage treatment coordination with a mental health professional. Hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids are rare yet serious adverse reaction that providers should also be aware of. Reactions seem to be attributable to the specific formulation (i.e. the salt or preservative agent) rather than the steroid itself. A different corticosteroid preparation can be tried again in a controlled setting where emergency medications and personnel are present. A steroid taper can be considered based on relapse severity and clinical context (i.e. comorbidities) but is not required. There is no clear evidence that a taper contributes to recovery or that a short course of high dose corticosteroids significantly suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which would necessitate a taper in most patients.   Q: What treatments options are available for relapses with incomplete recovery? A: We will consider a second course of corticosteroids if a patient has an incomplete response to the initial treatment though we have a low threshold to escalate therapy as incomplete symptom resolution is a major cause of early disability in MS. We typically use plasmapheresis for treatment of severe or refractory relapses with an incomplete response to the corticosteroids. The length of treatment can vary between 3-7 sessions depending on the treatment response and tolerance. The most common treatment period is 5 sessions over 7-10 days. Plasmapheresis is usually well tolerated but there are a number of potential side effects clinicians should be aware of including infection (specifically related to the venous catheter), deep venous thrombosis, , hypotension, and hypoalbuminemia. Most of these side effects are easily managed and do not require plasmapheresis discontinuation, though close coordination with the plasmapheresis administration team is essential. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment has been approved for use in MS relapses since the 1960s though it was supplanted in clinical practice by corticosteroids in the 1980s. There has been some recent, renewed interest in ACTH given its effects on melanocortin receptors on circulating lymphocytes. There is no conclusive evidence that ACTH has any additional benefits when compared to corticosteroids or improves the recovery of patients with incomplete response to corticosteroids. Clinical trials are currently underway to further investigate. Current evidence does not support intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a treatment for acute MS relapse. IVIG could be considered if a patient was intolerant to both IVMP and PLEX but we do not typical prescribe it at the Mellen Center. Please refer to the MCA on IVIG for more information regarding that specific therapy. A: Relapses are typically managed in the outpatient setting unless circumstances necessitate inpatient treatment such as an inability for the patient to perform self-care, loss of ability to ambulate, or comorbidities that increase the risk of corticosteroid-related complications. Given the challenges of arranging out-patient plasmapheresis, we usually admit these patients to the hospital for expedited central venous line placement and treatment, though sometimes outpatient therapy can be arranged. Acute treatment in the inpatient setting also is considered if subsequent inpatient rehabilitation is anticipated. Q: What adjunctive methods can be used to manage a relapse? A: We believe rehabilitation is an integral part of relapse management. Our patients engage with a multidisciplinary team to focus on their physical and emotional wellbeing when being treated for a relapse or pseudorelapse. This team encompasses physiatrists, psychologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists. Rehabilitation can focus on motor impairment, gait instability or cognitive dysfunction. These services can also focus on a broader range of functions including an ability to perform activities of daily living, improve mobility, or a return to work. Management of the relapse symptoms can also lead to improved quality of life for patients. For example, treating painful sensory disturbances with a neuropathic pain medications or addressing disabling fatigue with pharmacological and non- pharmacological methods. Q: How are relapses managed during pregnancy or breastfeeding? A: Typically, disease modifying therapy is discontinued during pregnancy and while breast feeding, which increases the risk of disease activity. Fortunately, MS disease activity decreases during this time though women with highly active disease before pregnancy are at higher risk for a relapse, especially for three to four months postpartum. Women undergoing an assisted reproductive technique may also have a higher relapse risk due to the hormone changes induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. We typically use the standard treatment strategy for relapses during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. We do have a higher threshold for treatment in the first trimester as there is some evidence for adverse fetal outcomes with corticosteroids, including cleft palate and low birth weight. Generally, relapses during the second and third trimesters can be treated safely with corticosteroids. Ultimately, a joint decision is made between the patient, provider and obstetrician (OBGYN). Corticosteroids can cross into the breast milk so we recommend patients to avoid breast feeding for several hours after their treatment.  For disabling, corticosteroids-refractory relapses, plasmapheresis can be considered. For more information regarding MRIs during pregnancy and breast feeding please refer to the MCA on MRI Activity.  References: Thompson AJ, Banwell BL, Barkhof F, et al.

20541b8e-1c50-48af-9b22-72a0ef0e6e4e,"Highlights from the American Academy of Neurology’s 2015 Annual Meeting Highlights from the American Academy of Neurology’s 2015 Annual Meeting The American Academy of Neurology’s (AAN’s) 67th Annual Meeting took place in Washington, DC April 18th-25th. The AAN is an association of more than 27,000 neurologists and neuroscience professionals dedicated to advancing the care of individuals with neurologic disease. Every year, these professionals gather to hear the latest findings in research and treatments for neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS). To follow are some important highlights. Daclizumab high-yield process (HYP) is a new therapy that has been studied in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD25, a receptor on T cells that is thought to become activated in MS. Daclizumab is believed to work by selectively targeting these activated T cells without causing general T-cell depletion. This therapy results in a “reversible modulation” of the immune system. This means that while the medication alters the immune-system response to slow the attack caused by MS on myelin and nerves (axons) of the brain and spinal cord, it does so without causing permanent changes to immune system function. DECIDE was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study (“active-controlled” denotes that the control group was given an existing treatment that has already been shown to be effective, versus a placebo, which has no active ingredients). This study compares DAC HYP 150mg injected subcutaneously once every four weeks, to intramuscular interferon once weekly. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). A total of 1,841 patients were randomized into the study. Treatment with DAC HYP versus interferon resulted in a 45-percent reduction in the ARR and a 41-percent reduction in the proportion of patients who relapsed. MRI outcomes were also positive favoring DAC HYP as this agent brought about a 54-percent reduction in the number of new/enlarging T2 lesions (more intense lesions, which are areas of inflammation). Furthermore, DAC HYP reduced the risk of confirmed disability by 16 percent. The benefits of this drug compared to interferon were seen in many subgroups of patients – men, women, both older and younger than 35, and irrespective of prior treatment with interferon. The authors concluded that DAC HYP demonstrated superior efficacy compared with weekly interferon across key clinical, radiographic, and patient-reported MS outcome measures in relapsing MS patients. A variety of side effects and adverse events were seen with this agent. Infections, significant skin reactions, and liver effects were observed. The side-effect profile and safety issues will warrant careful monitoring if this medication is approved. Immediately following the AAN meeting, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) requesting marketing approval of Daclizumab HYP for relapsing forms of MS. If approved, this will be marketed under the brand name Zinbryta™. Gilenya is an FDA-approved oral treatment for MS that blocks lymphocytes from exiting lymph nodes and reaching the nervous system. It is approved for RRMS, and was studied in a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial called INFORMS, to assess efficacy in patients with primary-progressive MS (PPMS). A novel primary composite endpoint was used, based on increase in disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the 25-Foot Timed-Walk Test (T25FW), and the 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT). Other key endpoints were the formation of new lesions and percent brain volume change (PBVC), or brain atrophy (the shrinking or reduction of brain volume). INFORMS was a three-year trial that randomized 970 patients, and was adequately powered (that is, enough patients were included and enough measurements were made) to assess the primary endpoint. Unfortunately, none of the endpoints were met. Gilenya did not prevent the accumulation of disability in patients with PPMS any greater than placebo. Furthermore, PBVC did not differ between the Gilenya and placebo groups. Unsurprisingly, given this agent’s success in preventing relapses and new MRI lesions in RRMS patients, there were fewer new MRI lesions seen in the Gilenya-treated patients. The safety results were generally consistent with fingolimod in prior MS trials. It is disappointing that Gilenya did not significantly slow disease progression in PPMS. These findings have important implications for the understanding of PPMS, and will no doubt allow researchers to refine how PPMS is studied moving forward. Biotin is a vitamin involved in key steps of energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, though most people think of it as being “good for hair and nails.” Among other actions, biotin activates an enzyme in myelin synthesis. Using this hypothesis and building upon data from a small, open-label pilot study, MD1003, a high-dose biotin preparation of 300 mg/day, was studied in a Phase III trial of patients diagnosed with secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) or PPMS. (This dose is hundreds of times higher than what can typically be purchased as a supplement of this vitamin.) In a relatively small study, 154 patients were randomized to high-dose biotin or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the proportion of patients who improved at nine months, with a confirmation of the improvement at 12 months. Improvement was defined as either a decrease in EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) or an improvement in T25FW (timed 25-foot walk) of at least 20 percent. The primary endpoint was met, with 12.6 percent of patients in the MD1003 arm showing an improvement of EDSS or T25FW at nine months and confirmed at 12 months, compared to none of the patients in the placebo arm. The primary endpoint was supported by secondary analyses showing evidence for a decrease in the risk of disease progression. These numbers are encouraging, although it is important to note that the decrease in disability experienced by the MD1003 group, and the disease progression seen in the placebo group, were both so small, they would be virtually undetectable in clinical practice. MD1003 was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar across the two groups. One patient treated with MD1003 died from suicide; however, this event was not considered to be related to the drug. These results suggest a possible therapeutic effect of high-dose biotin in progressive MS, and merit further study. Though this trial gives initial support for its potential use, a larger trial will need to be done to truly understand whether biotin is an effective treatment in progressive MS. Noting that the dose of biotin studied would require taking hundreds of commercially-available pills of this vitamin, it is certainly not recommended that patients begin such a regimen at the present time. Studies also need to determine if any toxic effects could result from taking such high doses of this vitamin. Anti-LINGO-1 is an agent under investigation for its potential remyelinative properties, after animal studies showed that it blocks this protein responsible for stopping the growth of myelin. Agents aimed at remyelination would repair or regrow myelin, the protective covering of the nerves, which is damaged by MS. RENEW was a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of Anti-LINGO-1 in subjects experiencing their first episode of acute optic neuritis (AON). An equal number of subjects were randomized to receive either a placebo or anti-LINGO-1 (100 mg/kg) once every four weeks for six total doses. Follow-up extended 12 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome of RENEW was an assessment of recovery of optic-nerve function measured by the speed at which the nerve conducts visual signals. This was studied by evaluating a test called Full Field Visual Evoked Potential (FF-VEP) in participants treated with anti-LINGO-1, compared with placebo. Patients who were treated with at least five of the six doses of anti-LINGO-1 showed a 34-percent improvement in optic-nerve conduction latency (delay in the speed of the visual signal) at week 24, compared with placebo. Further recovery in optic-nerve conduction was observed at the last study visit (week 32), with a statistically significant 41-percent improvement. Together, the data demonstrate evidence of treatment effect with continuous improvement observed 12 weeks following the last study dose. There was no effect on key secondary endpoints, including actual recovery of visual function. These data are the first evidence of functional remyelination in patients treated with anti-LINGO-1, and justify further study in the ongoing SYNERGY trial, in which 396 subjects with active RRMS or SPMS will be randomized to intravenous (IV) infusions of this experimental medication or placebo. All subjects will also receive once-weekly injections of Avonex. Results will provide clinical information about this drug’s efficacy for neuroprotection or repair within the central nervous system (CNS), which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. The results will also address two fundamental questions: 1) Are the effects seen in the optic neuritis study replicable in other areas of the nervous system? And 2) Does this translate to improved function in patients with MS either in the short or long term? Phenytoin is an anti-epileptic medication that has been available for decades. It has also been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental models of inflammatory demyelination. A Phase II clinical trial assessed whether phenytoin could be neuroprotective in acute optic neuritis (AON). The study was comprised of 86 people with AON randomized within two weeks of symptom onset to receive either phenytoin (4 mg/kg/day) or placebo for three months. The primary outcome of this AON study was an evaluation of the structure of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular volume (MV) at six months. Visual function, optic-nerve imaging, and visual evoked potentials were also measured. Of the original 86 participants, 81 were followed to study end. In these patients, the average adjusted affected eye RNFL thickness at six months was higher in the active group versus placebo, resulting in a 30-percent protective-treatment effect. Adjusted MV (macular volume) showed a 34-percent protective-treatment effect. Vision generally recovered well, with no significant difference in visual outcomes between the treatment groups. This is an intriguing study that may have broad implications, as it found that the administration of a well-known, relatively safe drug seemed to be neuro-protective in the period directly following optic neuritis. Similar to anti-LINGO-1, further studies will need to be done to clarify whether this effect is translatable to other areas of the nervous system and whether this will, in turn, lead to preservation of neurologic function. Lemtrada® (alemtuzumab) – Update from the Care MS II Extension for RRMS Lemtrada is a monoclonal antibody given by IV infusion that was approved by the FDA in 2014 for the treatment of relapsing MS. In the CARE-MS II trial, Lemtrada had superior benefit versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, including improved MRI outcomes over two years, in RRMS patients who had relapsed on prior therapy. A total of 393 (92.9 percent) CARE-MS II Lemtrada-treated patients entered the extension study; data are available through four years from the first treatment, and follow-up is ongoing. Through four years, 67.7 percent of patients received only the initial two courses of treatment, 24.2 percent received the initial two treatments plus one additional course, and 7.4 percent received the initial two treatments plus two additional courses. In Year 3 and Year 4, almost 90 percent of patients were free of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and two-thirds of patients did not have new T2 lesions. Aubagio®’s (teriflunomide) 14-Year Extension Study for RRMS Aubagio is a once-daily oral immunomodulator approved for the treatment of RRMS. In the core Phase II study, patients with relapsing MS were randomized equally to Aubagio 14mg, Aubagio 7mg, or placebo. After completing the 36-week core study, patients could enter the long-term open-label extension. In the extension, patients who were taking one of the two doses of Aubagio continued on their same therapy; those previously treated with placebo were reallocated in equal numbers to Aubagio 14mg or 7mg. Of the 179 patients originally randomized, 147 entered the extension study. Including treatment in the core and extension studies, patients received Aubagio for up to 576 weeks (11 years). During the study, annualized relapse rates (ARR) remained low in both groups, and the percentage of patients free from relapse during the extension was greater in the 14-mg group (51.5 percent) versus the 7-mg group (39.5 percent). Patients had minimal increases in EDSS score following up to 528 weeks (more than 10 years) of treatment. No new/unexpected adverse events were identified following long-term Aubagio treatment, and the safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other clinical studies. Although long-term extension trials are always limited by the fact that patients who are doing well on a particular treatment are more apt to stay on it, this study provides support for the use of Aubagio — one of the more recently approved therapies — over the long term. Relapse rates remained low in both treatment groups that were followed up to 12 years, and patients in both groups had minimal progression, similar to what was seen in the Phase III trials. Anti-JCV Antibody Index in Tysabri® (natalizumab)-Treated Patients Multiple risk factors are now known for developing Tysabri-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a viral brain infection caused by the JC virus. These risk factors include the presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and duration of Tysabri treatment — especially beyond two years. In previous analyses, the anti-JCV antibody index was able to differentiate the risk of PML in patients who were positive for the anti-JCV antibody, but without a history of immunosuppressant use. This current analyses involved data from clinical studies and post-marketing sources as of March 2014. Data were available for 101 Tysabri-treated PML patients with blood samples collected six months prior to PML diagnosis. For patients with no history of immunosuppressant use, with anti-JCV antibody index at or below thresholds of 0.9 to 1.5, PML risk was approximately 0.1 to 0.2 per 1,000 patients during the first two years of Tysabri treatment; it ranged from 0.5 to 1.1 per 1,000 patients who had taken Tysabri for more than two years and up to four years; and from 0.6 to 1.4 per 1,000 patients who had taken Tysabri for more than four years and up to six years. For patients with no history of immunosuppressant use with an index greater than 1.5, PML risk was approximately 1.2 per 1,000 patients during the first two years of Tysabri treatment, 8.8 per 1,000 patients between two and four years, and 10.1 per 1,000 patients between four and six years. Consistent with previous findings, this updated analysis suggests the anti-JCV antibody index may differentiate PML risk in anti-JCV antibody positive patients with no history of immunosuppressant use. Patients with a JC index less than 1.5 maintained a low risk for developing PML over the course of the study, as opposed to those with a high index where the risk was seen to increase greatly over time. “Doctor, can I stop my medicine?” – Analysis of disease course after stopping disease-modifying therapy in stable MS patients Little data are available on MS disease course after disease-modifying treatment (DMT) discontinuation. MSBase, a 30,000-patient global, observational MS registry, provides a unique opportunity for such a study. Patients were included who, at the time of DMT discontinuation, were: 40 years of age or older; had no relapses and a stable EDSS for five or more years; were on DMT continuously for three or more years; and, after stopping DMT, were followed for three or more years. Predictors of when patients would restart their DMT, as well as time-confirmed progression of disability, were analyzed. A total of 198 (65.4 percent) of 303 eligible patients restarted DMT following discontinuation after only one month, on average. The rate of restarting DMT decreased by 25 percent for every 10-year increase in age, meaning that the older patients were less likely to restart their DMT as quickly as the younger ones. Patients who restarted DMT experienced a 46-percent reduction in the rate of subsequent three-month confirmed disability progression, versus those who did not restart their treatment. Overall, the authors concluded that high rates of DMT restart occurred in this group of stable, older MS patients who discontinued DMT. Younger age (within this group of older MS patients) and lower EDSS predicted an increased rate of restarting treatment. Importantly, even in this group of stable patients, DMT restart was associated with reduced rates of disability progression. It is important to note that in the years following DMT discontinuation, there was evidence in a large percentage of patients for either relapse or progression despite five previous years of good disease control. Knowing the time when someone who is clinically stable “no longer needs to be treated” remains elusive, and more work will need to be done before evidence can guide a decision to stop a DMT. Epidemiology, Environmental Factors, and Disease Course The GEMS Project – Genetics and Environment in MS Investigation of MS prevention requires early identification and understanding of the incidence in the high-risk population. The Genes and Environment in Multiple Sclerosis (GEMS) project has a goal of early detection in first-degree relatives of MS patients. Each subject submits saliva for targeted genotyping and completes detailed web-based questionnaires that capture demographics and risk factors. For each subject, a weighted genetic and environmental risk score (GERS) was calculated. It includes 64 genetic variants, as well as the individual’s gender, whether or not he or she had infectious mononucleosis, and if the person has a history of smoking. By leveraging patient-advocacy groups and social media, the GEMS investigators were able to recruit more than 2,600 first-degree relatives from across the United States. In an analysis of the initial 1,696 subjects (1,583 without symptoms and 113 with MS at enrollment), investigators found that 27 percent of the individuals with MS and 25 percent of the asymptomatic subjects have a history of infectious mononucleosis, both doubling that of the general population. This higher proportion of infectious mononucleosis in asymptomatic family members is not attributable to known MS-genetic susceptibility. MS subjects have a significant excess of current smokers than asymptomatic subjects. Four out of the initial 1,583 asymptomatic subjects developed MS after enrollment, providing an incidence estimate (123 cases per 100,000 first-degree relative annually) 30-times greater than the incidence of sporadic MS in the United States. The average follow-up duration of the study was two years. The GEMS study highlights the role of electronic communication, e.g., using social media and web-based questionnaires, in rapid and large-scale subject recruitment of first-degree relatives. It also provides a first estimate of the incidence of MS among this high-risk population, critically informing the design of a prospective study of high-risk family members. Identification of patients at the highest risk for MS may lead to opportunities for intervention before the condition becomes clinically apparent. The vast collection of organisms that inhabit the human gut, the microbiome, has been demonstrated to influence immune responses and modulate susceptibility to chronic diseases. Recent studies have related gut dysbiosis (an imbalance of bacteria) to Crohn’s disease, type 1 diabetes, obesity, and autism. Additionally, animal model work suggests an important role in MS. The Multiple Sclerosis Microbiome Consortium (MSMC) is a multi-disciplinary collaboration composed of two translational MS Centers (Mount Sinai and UCSF). Together, they have initiated a microbiome-oriented basic/experimental program and sequencing/bioinformatics Core. The MSMC is currently analyzing hundreds of samples by bacterial DNA sequencing aimed at identifying group differences at the genus-level. Tracked variables include demographics, Body Mass Index (BMI), medical history, MS clinical course and phenotype, disease-modifying therapy, and diet. The MSMC has successfully implemented IRB-approved protocols to recruit MS patients and controls, as well as to process and analyze their blood and stool samples. Initial results show significant genus-level differences in the microbiomes of patients treated with Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate) compared to untreated subjects. Female patients showed significant enrichment of members of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria, compared to gender-matched controls. Geographical differences were noted as well. Strikingly, when transferred into germ-free mice, gut microbiota from an MS patient resulted in more severe EAE (a mouse model of MS) than microbiota from a healthy control. This may be the most intriguing result from this project to date. Observed differences between cases and controls suggest a biological effect and warrant further investigation, as do effects of geographic, demographic, and dietary factors. Study of the human microbiome has the potential to yield important insights in understanding the pathophysiology of MS as well as possible treatment strategies. A separate study of microbiome in MS looked at differences in Vitamin D levels predicting alterations in gut bacteria. Analysis of 43 subjects showed increased abundance of a type of helpful bacteria called Ruminococcaceae in untreated MS patients with a serum Vitamin D level above 40 ng/mL, versus patients with a Vitamin D level below 40. The authors conclude that high levels of Vitamin D in untreated MS patients are associated with increased amounts of Ruminococcaceae in the gut. This has relevance to MS, as a decreased amount of Ruminococcaceae has previously been associated with Crohn’s disease. Hence, lower amounts of Ruminococcaceae might be linked to increased inflammation in MS. Further studies are underway to explain the mechanism by which Vitamin D regulates the composition of the microbiota in MS. Caffeine intake has been associated with reduced odds (or risk) of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, but previous studies done on caffeine consumption and MS risk have been inconclusive. The study team, led by Ellen Mowry, used two population-based case-control studies – a case-control group from Sweden and a case-control group from Northern California – to look for an association of coffee consumption prior to disease onset with the odds of developing MS. In the Swedish cohort, consuming at least six cups of coffee daily over the course of one year was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for MS of 0.67, which represents a modestly reduced risk of developing MS. In the Northern California study, among those who consumed four or more cups of coffee daily prior to the year of the study, the odds ratio for MS was also 0.67. It is important to note that the study finding was only significant at the highest levels of coffee intake. Also, no association was found for other types of caffeine. The study authors postulated that coffee may have a direct immunomodulatory effect, although it is possible that this association is present due to other unmeasurable factors. Further work will be needed to investigate this association, and it is not yet recommended that people (with or without MS) commence drinking six cups of coffee per day. The “Topographical Model” of MS was proposed by Dr. Krieger as a way of visualizing disease course in a more individualized way than the typical simple graphs of relapsing or progressive forms of MS. This model is based on the observation that it is difficult to apply our current disease-course categories – RRMS, SPMS, and PPMS – to individual patients, and that even when someone has an apparently progressive disease, progression can take a variety of forms and sometimes stop altogether. Instead of these separate categories, the Topographical Model proposes encompassing the mix of factors underlying the MS disease course in a unified way across a pattern of relapses, progression, both, or neither. “Topography” refers to mapping the locations in the nervous system where MS has caused damage, and from where an individual’s symptoms are derived. The model itself was depicted as a series of 3D animated videos, showing the emergence of signs (such as lesions) and symptoms of MS above a “clinical threshold,” where a physician can observe changes… as well as lesions that can be seen on MRI but don’t cause obvious symptoms, as existing “under the threshold,” so that a physician could not observe changes. Progression is depicted as that threshold slowly drops, representing a loss in function that can occur in progressive disease. It also helps to show why during episodes of fever, or being overheated, patients may often experience a worsening or return of many of their same prior MS symptoms. In this model, these symptoms are transiently being “revealed” (in these 3D animated videos) above the clinical threshold during periods of depleted reserve, and then recede back under the threshold when the fever resolves. The model depicts one’s disease course in a clinically nuanced way that complements the clinical-course categories. It attempts to capture the broad range of experiences of the disease – the unique “disease topography” experienced by an individual person – so that clinical course can be shown and understood to a more personalized degree. The Topographical Model remains to be empirically tested, and may have clinical research implications.

Those who receive this treatment are slightly less likely to progress than those who are untreated. For relapsing-remitting , several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate, slow the formation of new lesions, and potentially reduce risk of brain atrophy and disability accumulation. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting include injectable and oral medications. These drugs are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat . They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You'll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. This medication may help block your immune system's attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You'll need to have your heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include rare serious infections, headaches, high blood pressure and blurred vision. This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis. This twice-daily capsule is similar to dimethyl fumarate but typically causes fewer side effects. It's approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of . This once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects. This drug is associated with birth defects when taken by both men and women. Therefore, use contraception when taking this medication and for up to two years afterward. Couples who wish to become pregnant should talk to their doctor about ways to speed elimination of the drug from the body. This drug requires blood test monitoring in a regular basis. Research shows that this once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate and help slow progression of . It's also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include viral infections, liver problems and low white blood cell count. Other possible side effects include changes in heart rate, headaches and vision problems. Siponimod is harmful to a developing fetus, so women who may become pregnant should use contraception when taking this medication and for 10 days after stopping the medication. Some might need to have the heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis This medication is generally prescribed as second line treatment for those with relapsing-remitting . It was also approved for secondary-progressive . It is given in two treatment courses, spread over a two-week period, over the course of two years. Side effects include upper respiratory infections, headaches, tumors, serious infections and reduced levels of white blood cells. People who have active chronic infections or cancer should not take this drug, nor should women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Men and women should use contraception when taking this medication and for the following six months. You may need monitoring with blood tests while taking cladribine. This humanized monoclonal antibody medication is the only approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary-progressive forms of . Clinical trials showed that it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrelizumab is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Infusion-related side effects may include irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, a fever and nausea, among others. Some people may not be able to take ocrelizumab, including those with a hepatitis B infection. Ocrelizumab may also increase the risk of infections and some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a potentially serious viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in people who are positive for antibodies to the causative agent of JC virus. People who don't have the antibodies have extremely low risk of . This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells. But it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders, including a high risk of thyroid autoimmune diseases and rare immune mediated kidney disease. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. Alemtuzumab is usually recommended for those with aggressive or as second line treatment for patients who failed another medication. Physical therapy can build muscle strength and ease some of the symptoms of . A physical or occupational therapist can teach you stretching and strengthening exercises and show you how to use devices to make it easier to perform daily tasks. Physical therapy along with the use of a mobility aid when necessary can also help manage leg weakness and other gait problems often associated with . You may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in your legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal, Gablofen), tizanidine (Zanaflex) and cyclobenzaprine may help. Onabotulinumtoxin A treatment is another option in those with spasticity. Amantadine (Gocovri, Osmolex), modafinil (Provigil) and methylphenidate (Ritalin) may be helpful in reducing -related fatigue. Some drugs used to treat depression, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be recommended. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) may help to slightly increase walking speed in some people. People with a history of seizures or kidney dysfunction should not take this medication. Medications also may be prescribed for depression, pain, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, and bladder or bowel control problems that are associated with .

It affects quality of life and correlates with worsened disease outcome. Out approach is to try to systematically identify and treat this problem early and effectively. Q: How common are cognitive disorders present in MS? The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MS is estimated to be between 40 and 65 percent (Bobholz and Rao, 2003; Benedict, Zivadinov, 2011). The cognitive abilities most often affected include episodic memory (recall of previously studied information, like a shopping list or story), working memory (temporary on-line maintenance and manipulation of information), divided attention (multi-tasking ability), and speed processing. Language, executive, and visuospatial functions are relatively spared. However, there is considerable variation in the neuropsychological presentation of MS patients. For example, one study identified six distinct cognitive profiles among patients with relapsing MS entering a trial of interferon-β1a (Fischer, 1999). The largest subgroup, which included 34% of the sample, was cognitively intact. Only 2% showed global cognitive impairment across multiple cognitive domains. The remainder showed circumscribed deficits in two to three cognitive domains. At the Mellen Center, we specifically inquire about the presence of cognitive symptoms at each visit. This is done both in our previsit screening questionnaire and as part of our review of symptoms for each visit. If this is an issue for the patient or their families, we inquire more deeply into this issue. Q: What other factors need to be considered when a patient states they have cognitive problems? (Differential diagnosis) Early in the process of cognitive evaluation for MS patients, other facts should be considered. Standard assessment of laboratory parameters used for general cognitive disorders should be undertaken (For example, thyroid indices and vitamin B12 level). The patient should have an assessment for depression to ensure that the problem is not primarily related to an emotional disorder (see below). Questions about sleep disturbance should be asked as sleep disorders are common in MS and may affect cognitive abilities. The medication the patient is taking should be evaluated for negative impact on cognition. Q: Do physical disability, disease course, and disease duration correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Level of physical disability, as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), has at best a modest correlation with severity of cognition in MS. This is not surprising since the EDSS is heavily influenced by non-cognitive signs and symptoms, such as ambulation. Several studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction is greater in secondary progressive than in relapsing-remitting MS (Gaudino, Chiaravalloti et al.,2001). Cross-sectioning studies have found only a modest relationship between duration of the disease and the extent of cognitive impairment. As noted above, this is likely due to the inter-patient variability in the presentation of cognitive disorders. It is important to note that cognitive changes can occur early in the course of the disease (Deloire, Salort et al.,2005) and, in some patients, may never occur. Longitudinal neuropsychological studies of MS patients studied over an extended period of time suggest that approximately 5-10 percent of patients experience a discernible worsening of cognitive functioning over the course of a year (Amato et al., 2001). Unlike patients with progressive dementias, MS patients with cognitive impairment can be stable for years. In addition, recent cases reports have noted cognitive impairment as a sole manifestation of relapse of MS, with cognitive declines correlating with new lesion formation on MRI imaging. For the above reasons we also do not assume that patients with physical disabilities are cognitively impaired, now do we assume that those without physical impairment are cognitively intact. Q: Do abnormalities detected on brain MRI scans correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Compared to demographic and disease variables, neuroimaging indices correlate relatively well with cognition in MS. Several studies have demonstrated an inverse relation between cognitive performance and the number of volume of lesions on conventional MRI, including T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging (Rovaris and Filippi, 200). Regionally specific relations between lesion volume and cognition have been reported. For example, one study showed specific relations between frontal lobe involvement and executive functions, like conceptual reasoning (Arnett, Rao et al., 1994). Some studies have suggested that brain atrophy is a better predictor of cognitive impairment in MS than lesion volume (Bermel, Bakshi et al., 2002; Benedict, Weinstock-Guttman et al., 2004). Longitudinal studies have shown a relation between progressive brain atrophy and cognitive changes patterns in MS (Hohol, Buttman et al., 1997). There are occasional patients with subacute cognitive changes that correlate with the presence of new lesions, so that a new complaint of cognitive dysfunction may prompt further imaging to assess for disease activity (Pardini, 204). Recent studies indicate that cortical lesions are not only present in early clinical MS, but may be as common as white matter lesions (Lucchinetti 2011). Such lesions and associated tract degeneration may underly some component of the cognitive dysfunction in MS. Note that in addition there are patients with prominent cognitive symptoms with limited lesion burden or atrophy on brain imaging. In such patients, we would assess carefully for other factors such as medication, sleep disturbance, and depression masquerading as cognitive deficits (See below). Q: Do cognitive disorders correlate with other factors related to MS (for example, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders)? Emotional problems, sleep disorders, and fatigue are significantly more common in individuals with MS than in the general population. Although the relationship among these symptoms may be complex, depression has been reported to affect cognitive test performance in the areas of rapid information processing, working memory, and executive function in MS patients (Arnett, Higginson et al., 2001). Although subjective reports of fatigue do not necessarily correlate with observable deficits in cognitive function, decrements in cognitive performance occur during sustained mental effort and after completion of cognitively challenging tasks in MS patients (Krupp and Elkins, 2000; Schwid, Tyler et al., 2003). It is reasonable to assume that patients' performance may be compromised if they are significantly depressed, fatigued, or sleep deprived during cognitive testing. There are many medicines used in MS care that may have a negative impact on cognition. We assess these medicines in our patients with cognitive deficits and consider whether they can be changed to alternative medicines or whether they can be weaned off. Medicines that have such an impact include steroids (particularly IV high dose solumedrol), anticholinergics such as oxybutynin, tricyclic antidepressants, sedatives, beta blockers, muscle relaxants, etc. In addition, the chronic use of marijuana and related substances can have a negative effect on cognition. Sleep disorders may be seen with MS and may affect daytime cognitive performance. We do inquire about sleep at the Mellen Center and consider expert evaluation depending on symptoms presented (for example, snoring, restless leg, periodic leg movements, repeated awakenings, etc). There are documented events where subacute cognitive impairment is the only clinical manifestation of a relapse documented by a decline in neuropsychological function and imaging findings of new lesion formation. A subacute decline in cognition should prompt both a search for factors such as infection, new medications, or emerging illness, or imaging to assess for new lesion activity. Q: How can cognitive disorders be detected in the clinical setting? A: We note that patient self-report of cognitive deficits in unreliable. Patients with MS who are depressed will report cognitive impairment, while patients with cognitive deficits may under report their deficits. An informant (family member, close friend) is critical to assist in giving history to document cognitive impairment. One method for identifying cognitive dysfunction is to administer rating questionnaires to patients and their family members. One such scale is the MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ), a 15-item self-informant-report inventory (Benedict, Cox et al., 2004). Results suggest that informant ratings of cognitive problems are more likely to correlate with objective neuropsychological tests than patient self-reports. Unfortunately, informant ratings are not always available in the clinical setting. An alternative approach is to use a brief cognitive screening examination. One commonly used test, the Mini-Mental State Examination, has been found to be insensitive to the cognitive impairments in MS. Performing extensive cognitive testing can be too time consuming for centers with limited staff, yet performing an annual cognitive screen may be necessary as part of ongoing MS care. Langdon and others (2012) extensively reviewed the literature on neuropsychological measures in MS. They determined that the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), with the possible addition of the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised learning trials, is a reasonable screen. Their expert panel judged these studies to be preferred over others when rated on psychometric qualities (reliability, validity, and sensitivity), an international application, ease administration, feasibility in the specified context, and acceptability to patients. The SDMT consists of single digits paired with abstract symbols. The patient must say the number corresponding with each symbol. The test can be administered and scored within 5 minutes. It is a sensitive test of information processing speed that is preferentially affected in MS patients. It is well validated against multiple MRI measures and has minimal practice effect. One problem with the standard SDMT is that there are not multiple versions, so as a repeated measures test this would be subject to a training effect. The California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition comprises a 16 item word list, with four items belonging to each of 4 categories. This is read aloud 5 times in the same order to the patient at a rate slightly slower than 1 per second. This test can be completed in 5-10 minutes including instructions, testing, and responses. This test has also been validated with brain MRI measures. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised Learning T1-3 requires the patient to inspect a 2x3 stimulus array of abstract geometric figures. There are three learning trials of 10 seconds, then the stimulus is removed and the patient is required to draw the array from memory. This study also correlates with a variety of MRI measures. Other measures which could be used include the PASAT, MOCA test, and others. At the Mellen Center we screen both with items on a self-reported quality of life scale as well as in our review of symptoms. We have not systematically used screening tools in out entire population though this would be a reasonable approach as well. Q: What is the role of neuropsychology in ascertaining and monitoring cognition? The brief cognitive screening batteries described above could be administered by a non-neuropsychologist to determine if an MS patient is experiencing some form of cognitive dysfunction. Such a result is of limited importance, however, if not tied into specific clinical management. For this to happen, it is common to refer MS patients for a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment performed by a board certified clinical neuropsychologist. Such as assessment typically entails three to four hours of testing and includes a clinical interview. Comprehensive assessments can provide detailed baseline and follow-up data as well as information that pertains to complex matters such as differential diagnosis (e.g. MS dementia versus Alzheimer's disease in an elderly patient), guidance for rehabilitation or therapies, or determination of disability status. Neuropsychology testing can be particularly helpful if work or school related performance has been questioned, potentially leading to recommendation for accommodations (for example, breaks between tasks, more time for examinations, quieter workspace, part time work, etc.) Referral to a clinical neuropsychologist, board-certified by the American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, is recommended. Q: What non-medication interventions exist for cognitive dysfunction? Non pharmacologic treatment for cognitive impairment in MS, variously described as cognitive retraining, cognitive remediation, or cognitive rehabilitation among other labels, includes three main approaches: (1) restorative therapies that aim to improve specific abilities, (2) compensatory approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of cognitive strategies, and (3) adaptive approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of external aids and modifications (Amato and Zipoli, 2003). Recent studies have begun to assess interventions specifically designed to improve targeted aspects of learning and memory in MS (Chiaravalloti, DeLuca et al., 2005). A recent Cochrane Review found low level evidence for the benefit of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS patients (Rosti-Otajarvi 2004). Variations in study design and conduct precluded a strong recommendation for such rehabilitative strategies. In addition to the direct treatment of cognition, it is useful to detect and treat comorbidities such as depression and fatigue that can influence cognition and quality of life (Amato and Zipoli, 2003; Bagert, Camplair et al., 2002; Bakshi, 2003). Cognitive-behavioral counseling based in neuropsychological principles has been shown to improve insight and social skills, leading to a reduction in disinhibition and social aggressiveness in cognitively impaired MS patients (Benedict, Shaprio et al., 2001) In addition, a single study indicated reduced brain atrophy in patients actively exercising, which might have an impact on cognition (Lovera, 2010). Compensatory strategies may be helpful. These include a simplified schedule of activities, reminder lists or other strategies, reducing clutter in the household, among others. Where available, vocational rehabilitation may be useful to counsel the patient on alternatives or adaptions which might assist them in the workplace. In general populations, various preventive strategies to spare cognition have been supported by epidemiological or clinical trials data. These may be worth discussing with patients concerned about preventing cognitive decline: Treating hypertension, diabetes, and other vascular risk factors Data on brain training is limited at the present time. Q: What medication approaches are there for cognitive dysfunction? Treatment of cognitive problems in MS has received relatively little clinical or empirical attention in the past. However, recent years have seen the emergence of studies of pharmacologic interventions that have undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny in well-designed clinical trials (Doraiswamy and Rao, 2004). Prevention of cognitive impairment in MS is an important target of therapy. Some disease-modifying medications have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognition (e.g., Fischer, Priore et al. 2000). Pharmacologic strategies used to treat cognitive impairment in other disorders may have a beneficial effect on MS. A randomized, placebo-controlled study demonstrated a modest but statistically significant benefit of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil on memory test performance in MS (Krupp, Christodoulou et al., 2004). However, a larger multicenter study of donepezil did not confirm this finding (Krupp et al 2011). It may also be helpful to minimize, when possible, the use of medications with potential adverse cognitive consequences, such as bladder-control medications with anticholinergic effects (Tsao and Heilman, 2005). A randomized multicenter study of memantine 10mg bid in MS patients with cognitive symptoms shows more fatigue and neurological adverse events than patients on placebo and no positive effect on cognition. Higher doses of memantine may have more cognitive side effects in this population as well. Other medications considered for use in this population have not been tested in a randomized trial way. These include activating antidepressants, stimulants, and modafinil. There is limited data to support the use of these medications in this situation. Q: What do families need to think of when there are cognitive disorders? Independent of the severity of physical disability, cognitive dysfunction can have a major impact on employment and activities of daily living in MS (Rao, Leo et al., 1991). Severity of cognitive impairment, as measured by neuropsychological testing, is predictive of ability to drive (Schultheis, Garay et al., 2002), employment status (Benedict, 2005; Rao, Leo et al., 1991), success in rehabilitation (Langdon and Thompson, 1999), and social skills (Knight, Devereux et al., 1997). It is critical that patients and family members receive accurate information and psychosocial counseling to assist them in coping with these sometimes intractable consequences of MS. There are specific recommendations available on the assessment and management of cognitive impairment in MS which may be useful to families and patients with such impairment (Benedict Zacharia, et al., 2006). Specific considerations to discuss with families include safety (to avoid falls, wandering, injury); financial oversight; and driving safety. Bobholz, JA and Rao, SM (2003).

Hendin, MD, MSAA Chief Medical Officer The last few years have seen plenty of welcome news regarding pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS). In 2018, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children and adolescents. Several other DMTs already approved for use in adults are in late stages of evaluation for pediatric MS. Researchers are investigating a role for stem-cell therapy, and are pursuing new classes of drugs that would restore the nerve-protecting myelin sheath that becomes damaged in MS. Experts report that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of pediatric MS is declining, which means that the medical community is considering the possibility of an MS diagnosis in young patients at an earlier time. Clinicians have more knowledge than ever about the course of MS in children and adolescents, risk factors for relapse, how to manage symptoms, and other aspects of medical management. Risk Factors for Pediatric MS Coming into Sharper Focus Clinical Trials: The Key to Progress in Treating Pediatric MS Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS Mary Karpinski, LMSW, reviews those encouraging developments when she meets with the parents of a young person recently diagnosed with MS, but the most reassuring message she delivers concerns something that can’t be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or quantified in an annualized relapse rate. “I remind parents that children are incredibly resilient. I explain that I’ve found young people with MS to be particularly strong, and that they can get through pretty much anything so long as parents give them the building blocks to succeed, and do not let their own worries lead them to impose well-intentioned but overly restrictive limits on what their child can do.” Ms. Karpinski speaks from considerable experience. For the past 13 years she has served as the single point of access for young people with MS receiving care at the Pediatric MS Center of the UBMD Neurology/Jacobs Neurological Institute of the University at Buffalo. “I’ve been privileged to work with and assist many young people with MS as they’ve moved from childhood into adulthood. When parents first learn that their child has MS, one of the questions they inevitably ask is, ‘What will the future hold?’ I tell them about the many young people I’ve worked with who have earned college degrees, married, built meaningful careers, and had children of their own. Some have faced more challenges than others, and everyone’s path is different, but these children – and their parents – are the most inspiring people I have met,” the social worker says. This cover story examines the progress that has been made in helping these young people deal with MS, developments on the near horizon, the key unanswered questions about pediatric MS, and experts’ advice on enhancing the health and quality of life for young people with MS. Latest information about the course of pediatric MS Exploring how – and why – pediatric MS is similar to and different from MS in adults has been a major focus of researchers. These investigators are analyzing the commonalities and contrasts for insights into everything from the factors that trigger the onset of MS in young people, to the way therapies approved for use in adults are likely to affect the course of MS in children and adolescents. While relapsing-remitting MS is by far the most common form of the disease in newly diagnosed adults, it appears to be even more predominant in children and adolescents, representing 93% or more of all pediatric cases. Meanwhile, researchers at Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center in Boston have found that young people have relapses two to three times more often than adults, and that this difference persists over at least the first six years from onset of symptoms. However, there is evidence that young people generally recover from relapses more quickly than adults. Research suggests that pediatric-onset MS takes longer to diminish physical abilities than does adult-onset MS, and also is slower to develop into secondary-progressive MS. British researchers who examined long-term outcomes in more than 2,000 MS patients found that those who developed the disease before 18 years of age, took on average, 23.8 years to reach an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4 (on the scale, 0 represents no disability, while progression toward higher numbers leading up to 10, indicates increasing disability) versus 15.5 years for people who developed MS as adults. Similarly, time to development of secondary-progressive MS was 32 years for pediatric-onset patients and 18 years for adult-onset patients. Conversely, compared to adult-onset MS, pediatric-onset MS appears to have a greater impact on cognitive function in the years following onset of symptoms. Italian investigators who studied 48 pediatric MS patients found that 31% had some degree of cognitive impairment on initial evaluation, and that this proportion increased to 38% over five years. Meanwhile, a recent study of more than 5,700 adults with MS found that those who developed the disease as children or adolescents were roughly 1.5-times more likely to have cognitive impairment in adulthood than people whose symptoms began when they already were adults, and that this increased risk was independent of the person’s age or duration of MS. Given these findings, Emmanuelle Waubant, MD, recommends neuropsychological testing of children and adolescents who are newly diagnosed with MS. “Getting a baseline is very helpful, and can help inform approaches to working with the child’s school and other aspects of comprehensive care,” explains Dr. Waubant, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with extensive clinical and research expertise in pediatric MS. She advises follow-up testing two-to-three years later, unless a concern in the interim warrants earlier re-evaluation. Ms. Karpinski notes that the testing can help parents identify areas of strength and need – and, as a result – better understand the challenges their child may be facing, set realistic expectations, and advocate effectively for their son or daughter. She adds, however, that it is important for parents to meet with the specialist who evaluated their child to review the test results and their implications. “The reports containing the test results can be difficult to read, both in terms of the technical language employed, and sometimes, in terms of what the evaluation identified. Rather than trying to puzzle that out on their own, parents should sit with the specialist and get the background needed to avoid misunderstandings and put the results in context,” she says. Parents also need to be aware of the heightened presence of anxiety and mood disorders in young people with MS, and to include mental-health professionals in their care team, as needed, Ms. Karpinski adds. A study of 23 young people aged 6 to 17 who had MS or another demyelinating disorder found that 48% met the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, with almost one-third having anxiety disorders and about 10% having depression. Another study, this one involving 45 young people, found that cognitive impairment is more common among pediatric MS patients with mood and anxiety disorders than among those without a psychiatric diagnosis. Eighty percent of the study participants who had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a depressive disorder, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had evidence of cognitive impairment. By contrast, 55% of the 20 participants who did not have a psychiatric disorder demonstrated cognitive impairment on testing. In exploring why the course of pediatric MS often differs from that of adult MS, researchers have noted that disease onset in young people is marked by a higher disease burden and more disease activity on MRI than is seen in adults. In a study of 41 individuals with pediatric-onset MS and 35 individuals who developed MS as adults, Dr. Waubant and colleagues found that the children had a median 21 T2-bright lesions, as opposed to six in adults, and had more T2-bright areas generally and focal points in enhancing lesions, indicating greater disease activity. Another study involving 19 children and 12 adults with MS found that the pediatric patients hadw more extensive acute damage to the axons that carry electrical impulses from the central nervous system’s main type of cell, the neuron. Those and other findings suggest that pediatric MS is more inflammatory in nature than adult-onset MS. Meanwhile, another age-related aspect of MS may offer important insights into factors contributing to onset of disease. While less than 1% of all cases of MS develop before age 10 to 12 years, the condition affects boys and girls in that age group in roughly equal proportion. By age 12 and older, however, the female:male ratio in pediatric MS shifts to 2.8:1, a gender split similar to that seen in adult-onset patients. Tanuja Chitnis, MD, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and pediatric MS expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, noted in a 2013 article that this shift suggests a role for puberty in MS risk. E. Ann Yeh, MD, MA, FCRPC, says that just 15 years or so ago, the main challenge in diagnosing pediatric MS wasn’t necessarily obtaining an MRI to see what happening in a brain. Rather, she explains, the bigger issue often was what was happening in a brain. “Pediatricians, and even child neurologists, just weren’t trained to think in terms of children having MS. We were given the impression in residency and fellowship that MS did not occur in children, or that if it did, it was so rare that MS should not be high on the list of possibilities to consider when a young person presented with symptoms that could reflect a demyelinating event,” recalls Dr. Yeh. Today, as director of the MS and Demyelinating Disorders Program at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, the physician sees dozens of children with MS from across Ontario and nearby Canadian provinces and American states. Greater awareness that pediatric MS is a real – albeit quite uncommon – condition has contributed to significant improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of diagnosis, according to Dr. Yeh, who is also a senior associate scientist in Neurosciences & Mental Health at SickKids and a professor of pediatrics (Neurology) at the University of Toronto. Factors such as increased access to MRI and the development of a diagnostic pathway by the International Pediatric MS Study Group (IPMSSG) have been particularly important in this regard, notes Dr. Yeh, who estimates that the average child with MS is now diagnosed within about six months of symptom onset. The IPMSSG guidance is intended to help clinicians evaluate young people who present with indications of a possible acquired demyelinating syndrome, meaning symptoms suggesting that the myelin sheath that coats nerves in the central nervous system has been damaged. Such symptoms may include visual loss, double vision, sensations of tingling or numbness, weakness, abnormal or uncoordinated movements, and urinary issues, similar to adults who develop relapsing-remitting MS. Acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) in pediatric patients include acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), and multiple sclerosis. Beyond distinguishing between the conditions within that group of disorders, however, pediatric neurologists also need to consider other conditions that may cause the same symptoms seen with demyelinating syndromes. “The differential diagnosis for pediatric MS is quite broad, and includes a number of ‘MS mimics’ that are different from those that have to be considered when evaluating potential adult-onset MS,” notes Dr. Waubant. To help narrow that differential diagnosis, which essentially is a list of possible causes, the IPMSSG’s 2016 evaluation pathway identifies red flags that suggest a child may not have a demyelinating syndrome. The document also recommends a protocol for employing blood tests, assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), imaging, and other steps to identify specific demyelinating syndromes, including MS. The IPMSSG notes that a diagnosis of pediatric MS is warranted when a child or adolescent has two or more episodes presumed to be caused by inflammatory demyelination that do not represent ADEM and that occur more than 30 days apart. The episodes must involve more than one site in the central nervous system. The group also identifies three other, less-common scenarios that justify the diagnosis. However, Dr. Waubant notes that an intriguing, related question remains unanswered. “In the last 10 years or so, we’ve tended to see more patients with pediatric MS than we did previously. Greater awareness of the condition and improved diagnosis clearly play roles in this, but we just don’t know whether – beyond those factors – there also has been an increase in the actual number of children and adolescents who are developing MS,” she explains. Dr. Yeh agrees, and notes that as physicians become more skilled at making an early diagnosis, along with greater patient access to magnetic resonance imaging, the proportion of cases of pediatric MS that go unrecognized will be reduced. According to Dr. Yeh, “We should be able to tell what’s happening.” She adds that even accounting for such issues, “the numbers do seem to be going up.” (See “Risk Factors for Pediatric MS Coming into Sharper Focus.”) Recent study-based estimates of the incidence – or number of new cases per year – of pediatric MS vary from 0.07 to 2.9 per 100,000 children. Even the higher figure in that range represents an extremely small percentage of young people, however, and it is estimated that there are fewer than 5,000 pediatric MS patients in the United States. More treatment options and more patients receiving treatment The FDA has approved 17 DMTs for use in adults with MS. Eight, including the longest-approved agents, are administered by injection, while five are taken orally, and four are infused intravenously. Only one of those medications, the oral-agent Gilenya (fingolimod), is also approved for use in children and adolescents aged 10 years and older. The FDA expanded Gilenya’s indication to include pediatric MS patients in May 2018. Even before that approval, many pediatric MS specialists prescribed DMTs for their patients in an attempt to prevent relapses and disease progression. However, they often proceeded hesitantly because of a lack of data on the agents’ optimal dosing and safety profile in children and adolescents. Recent years have seen that hesitancy yields to a more pro-active approach, according to Dr. Waubant. “There has been a trend over time to treat pediatric MS more aggressively,” she notes, explaining that several factors are propelling the trend. One, she notes, is growing evidence that early intervention in the MS-disease process can favorably impact not only a patient’s current health, but also long-term well-being. At the same time, clinical trials, observational studies, and patient registries are providing reassuring data about the safety profiles of DMTs in children and adolescents. Expanded options, particularly in terms of route of administration, also has helped. “Teenagers very often are reluctant to consider agents that require an injection, but are willing to take an oral agent,” the pediatric MS expert notes. The fact that one agent has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adolescents, and that other DMTs approved for adults are in late stages in clinical evaluation in pediatric populations, has also made both parents and payers (insurance companies) more receptive to DMTs for young patients, Dr. Waubant adds. Gilenya secured its pediatric indication on the basis of the Phase III PARADIGMS trial, which studied more than 200 young people with pediatric MS. Other pediatric studies of DMTs already approved for use in adults include ongoing Phase III trials of Aubagio (teriflunomide) and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumaric acid), an ongoing open-label trial of Lemtrada (alemtuzumab), and completed open-label trials of Tysabri (natalizumab) and Tecfidera. However, Dr. Waubant and several of her colleagues belonging to the IPMSSG note that enrollment challenges and other obstacles mean that “Phase III trials for every newly approved therapy for adult MS in the pediatric MS population are simply not feasible.” Writing in the journal earlier this year, they noted, “In the last years, convincing evidence has emerged that the biological processes involved in MS are largely shared across the age span. As such, treatments proven efficacious for the care of adults with MS have a biological rationale for use in pediatric MS given the relapsing-remitting course at onset and high relapse frequency. There are also ethical considerations on conducting clinical trials in this age group including the use of placebo owing to highly active disease. It is imperative to reconsider study design and implementation based on what information is needed.” The group went on to propose recommendations that would enable future studies to adequately assess the safety of DMT use in pediatric patients while avoiding some of the trial-design issues that made it difficult to obtain timely, meaningful results. (See ) Such studies are all the more important given the above-referenced trend toward the increased use of DMTs in children and adolescents. An analysis of 748 pediatric MS patients receiving care at practices in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers found that 78% had received a DMT before reaching 18 years of age. However, there are indications that the more-proactive approach being taken by clinicians at pediatric MS centers is not being uniformly adopted nationwide. An analysis of claims data for 288 children and adolescents diagnosed with pediatric MS from 2010 to 2017 found that 65% did not receive a DMT in the 12 months following their diagnosis. Other research into treatment of pediatric MS is looking beyond DMTs. Several small studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of Rituxan (rituximab) in pediatric MS. This monoclonal antibody, which depletes certain types of B cells, primarily is used in the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. It is not approved for use in either adult or pediatric MS, but has been employed by some clinicians to treat multiple sclerosis. Investigators are also exploring the role that stem-cell therapy may play in treating pediatric MS, and are pursuing other treatments that would have remyelinating and neuroprotective effects. “One of the greatest unmet needs in pediatric MS relates to the fact that we don’t have a sufficient understanding of why there is disease progression even with adequate control of inflammation. Figuring out a way to control that progression is super important,” says Dr. Yeh. She adds that agents with mechanisms of action different from those of current DMTs will likely be needed to halt the disease progression not driven by inflammation and, hopefully, to exercise a regenerative effect. Promoting wellness for the whole person as well as for family members “Yes, MS is a part of your life, but it needn’t define your life,” Ms. Karpinski tells the young people she works with at UBMD Neurology in Buffalo. Often, she adds, parents need to hear that message more than their children do, given a parent’s increased concerns. The concerns that parents have for a child newly diagnosed with MS are often accompanied by a tendency to be over-protective, and even to feel a sense of guilt, experts say. “Parents often ask, ‘Did I do something that put my child at risk for this?’” notes Dr. Yeh. Beyond allaying parents’ unfounded fears that they are responsible for their child’s MS, she uses the question to refocus parents on ways to optimize their daughter’s or son’s health. The pediatric neurologist explains that those steps include participating in physical activity, ensuring sufficient sleep, and eating a balanced diet while avoiding extreme eating plans not supported by scientific evidence. “I particularly stress the importance of the child staying active and leading a normal life. If parents unnecessarily limit a child’s activities because of concerns about their MS, it can have a negative impact in terms of forging friendships and developing socially,” she adds. Dr. Waubant counsels parents along the same lines, and notes the importance of having a smoke-free household, and also recommends Vitamin D supplementation. In many cases, she adds, the parents’ concerns about MS extend to their newly diagnosed child’s siblings. When asked about the chances that another of their children will also develop MS, Dr. Waubant explains to parents that people who have a first-degree relative with MS have a 2% to 3% lifetime chance of having MS. “Where is my child going to be 10 years from now?” is another question Dr. Waubant hears frequently. “I explain that children with MS are less likely to have problems with physical disability than adults and, for reasons we don’t entirely understand, children are better able to recover from relapses,” the neurologist says. She also urges parents to connect with support networks for families affected by MS. (See “Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS”) Ms. Karpinski agrees that these support groups and networks are valuable resources for parents, and can help them obtain insights into handling practical issues. One example is to work with school officials to accommodate their child’s educational needs. “School districts often have many children with a diagnosis of ADHD or seizure disorder, and so they have experience with formulating educational plans centered around those conditions. But it is not unusual for a child at our clinic to be the only student in his or her district with multiple sclerosis, and educators may not appreciate the need for certain accommodations, such as extended time for test-taking or standing permission to use the restroom,” says Ms. Karpinski. After more than a decade of working with children at UBMD, Ms. Karpinski has helped several patients make the adjustment from grammar school to high school, and then to college. Along the way, she has addressed issues ranging from compliance with medication regimens to what and how a teen with MS may want to tell classmates, or a boyfriend or girlfriend, about the condition. She also has worked with patients and parents on family dynamics and practical approaches to dealing with symptoms such as fatigue and heat sensitivity. The experience, she says, has left her in awe of children with MS. “It is a privilege to work with them, and to see them flourish. They’re just amazing people, and they give me so much hope.” Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS Learning that your child has a serious, lifelong condition can be overwhelming. When that condition is so uncommon that you do not know of anyone else in the same situation, a sense of isolation can add to a parent’s anxiety. Resources including the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) are available to assist. Parents may call MSAA’s toll-free Helpline at , to speak to an MSAA specialist. Parents and others also can obtain information from MSAA’s Helpline by emailing , and by using the online MS Chat feature on MSAA’s website at . MSAA’s website also has numerous other resources of interest to people of all ages who are coping with the challenges of MS. Other MS advocacy organizations also offer resources and support for young people with MS and their relatives. One group – the Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Alliance – is dedicated exclusively to connecting, supporting, and advocating for children and adolescents with MS and their families. The Alliance’s website, at , includes a directory of centers specializing in pediatric MS, a resource center where visitors can download parents’ guides to understanding the condition, information about camps for young people with MS, and more. This organization also helps the parents of children with MS connect with one another online. Jeong A, Oleske DM, Holman J.

Management of multiple sclerosis (MS) has traditionally focused on disease modifying therapies (DMTs) and treatment of chronic symptoms. There is now a growing interest in wellness practices that incorporate a comprehensive approach to health and well-being of those living with MS starting at the time of diagnosis. These practices augment rather than replace traditional MS management. The Mellen Center has a comprehensive approach to Wellness practices for our patients; Mellen Center In person, telehealth or Shared Medical Appointment Wellness Visits Comprehensive rehabilitation services: Physical therapy, Occupational therapy and Speech therapy Wellness related research trials, see Ecoach, complementary 6 month health coach supported healthy living program... Wellness Institute with comprehensive programming. The Mellen Center captures MS wellness related parameters at each medical visit: primary care doctor status, nicotine use, BMI, blood pressure, pulse, mood disorder screens and annual vitamin D levels. Objective and longitudinal measures of disability, biomarkers as well as MRI measurements are captured through technology enabled assessments at each visit. MS Partners advancing Technology and health solutions, MS PATHS, uses advances in technology to generate and collect standardized patient data during routine office visits. The technology enabled assessments are completed through the MS PATHS platform which uses technology enabled objective comprehensive assessment of our MS patients including neuroperformance tests, patient- reported outcomes measures and MRI measurement (Baldassari et al. 2020). These routine assessments of our patients’ wellness and MS disease parameters provides the opportunities to guide and intervene as needed to enhance the health and hopefully long term outcomes of our patients. Abiding by a healthy diet, exercising routinely, maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels, abstaining from tobacco or nicotine use, incorporating stress management techniques, remaining active in the community, and engaging in health maintenance are all ways in which persons living with MS can help improve their overall health and potentially impact their risk of long term disability. The literature has not determined the one diet for all MS patients. We recommend a Mediterranean-style diet as outlined in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The Mediterranean diet limits sugar and processed foods, limits sodium intake, and emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins such as fish. This diet is recommended for the general population and may have added benefits for people with MS by helping to prevent vascular risk factors that have been linked with worse long-term outcomes. In addition to the Mediterranean diet, other diets have been proposed for MS, some of which are currently being tested in clinical trials. There have been a few small randomized dietary trials in MS patients completed and a few meta-analysis leading to a general recommendation of a healthy diet (Sofi et al. 2008). One of the completed trials includes a randomized controlled trial comparing anti- inflammatory diet and standard diet showing improved fatigue, QOL scores and isolated serum inflammatory marker in the anti-inflammatory diet cohort. (Mousavi-Shirazi-Fard et al. 2020) A very low fat plant based randomized-controlled, assessor-blinded, one-year long study showed good adherence and significant improvements in fatigue, BMI and metabolic biomarkers (Yadav et al. 2016). There have been feasibility studies of ketogenic and paleolithic studies in MS patients and their ability to maintain ketosis (Lee et al. 2020). There was also a prospective Danish study showing no correlation with diet quality and risk of getting late onset MS (Pommerich et al. 2020) herefore the role of diet in the risk of getting MS remains elusive. More disease progression, less activity and more obesity was seen in a large survey of MS patients who followed no specific diet, when a healthy diet was followed, to any degree, the patients had improved physical abilities (Fitzgerald et al. 2018). We therefore continue to recommend following a general healthy nutrition plan, such as the Mediterranean diet. Q: Is exercise safe and helpful in patients living with MS?  Exercise is safe and helpful in people living with MS and is important for everyone to maintain fitness and overall health. In addition, many clinical trials suggest that exercise can lead to small but clinically important improvements in fatigue, cognition, depression, walking, balance, and overall quality of life in those living with MS (Edwards and Pilutti 2017). Exercise may also provide benefits for comorbidities, health related QOL and participation in social roles. (Motl et al. 2018) Studies have suggested that pediatric and adult MS patients have low levels of exercise even without physical disability from MS (Elizabeth Morghen and Robert W 2020). We recommend our patients with MS, with no physical disability, follow the American Heart Association, AHA, guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate level of activity each week. We recommend that all adults age 18-64 with mild to moderate disability get at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity twice a week and do strength training exercises for major muscle groups twice a week, consistent with the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines. At the Mellen Center we counsel adults 65 and older to continue to exercise under the supervision of their primary physician. The appropriate intensity of exercise can be difficult for people with MS to judge. Exercise should not be painful, and we do not recommend overexertion. As a general rule, if a person feels fatigued for more than 2 hours after completing an exercise session, they should decrease the amount or intensity of the physical activity. In addition, all MS patients should take rest breaks when exercising, 30-120 seconds at a time, and stay cool, using cooling equipment if necessary. Please see the Q: Why is vitamin D supplementation important to MS? We recommend vitamin D supplementation to maintain 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels between 40 and 70 ng/mL. Levels below 30 ng/mL are associated with osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures (Rodney, Rodney, and Millis 2020). In addition, in several key observational studies, lower vitamin D levels were associated with increased disease activity and worsening disability(Miclea et al. 2020).  Refer to the Mellen Center Approach on Multiple Sclerosis and Vitamin D for more details. Q: Why should MS patients abstain from tobacco and all forms of nicotine use? In addition to its other harmful side effects, tobacco smoking and likely vaping is associated with worsening disability and increased mortality in people with MS. Long-term outcomes are better for people who quit smoking compared to active smokers. We recommend that all MS patients who smoke or use nicotine in any form be encouraged and assisted to quit. Brain volume has been shown to be less in smokers and in those with other vascular risk factors providing yet another reason to support our patients in smoking and nicotine cessation. (Pichler et al. 2019) Please refer to the Q: What is the best strategy to help people stop smoking? Optimal strategies in smoking cessation use both behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. Behavioral interventions include written materials containing advice on quitting, multisession group therapy programs, and individual counseling (Siddiqui, Huque, and Dogar 2016). Pharmacologic therapies include nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, bupropion, cytisine, and nortriptyline. Combination therapies, such as varenicline with nicotine replacement, may be more effective than either treatment alone. Cleveland clinic offers , a smoking cessation program, through health coach support and many resources exist to support patients such as the . Q: Is social engagement important for people with MS? Multiple studies suggest an association between social engagement and lower risk of all-cause mortality. MS is associated with an increasing burden on the social network of the patient and the caregivers. The social relationships of the people with MS are at a risk of stress leading to high rates of loneliness (A. Hakim et al. 2000). Higher “social capital” or social support is associated with less physical and psychological symptoms of MS (Reyes et al. 2020) therefore addressing the social network of our patients is linked to their overall outcomes. The Mellen Center offers many opportunities for patients to gain social support; Social Work consultation for patient, families and or caregivers Behavioral Medicine Groups in-person and virtually: MS Wellness Shared Medical Appointments in-person or virtually Comorbidity refers to a coexisting disease state other than the condition of interest and is distinct from complications of the pre-specified disease. In line with a holistic approach to health and well-being, there is a growing interest in the impact of comorbidities on disease-related outcomes in MS. Most studies have focused on obesity, vascular comorbidities, and psychiatric disorders in MS. Estimates of the prevalence of obesity in the MS population have varied widely. In the largest survey, which included 8,983 responders, a quarter of participants were obese and close to one-third were overweight(Ruth Ann Marrie, Cohen, et al. 2015). This may be an underestimate of the true prevalence of overweight and obesity, as respondents tend to under-report their true weight in self-reported evaluations(Ruth Ann Marrie 2017). At the Mellen Center our data show a similar range, we have 38% obese and 28% overweight, showing an opportunity to help with weight management. Cleveland Clinic has many resources for weight management: Ecoach, Weight management clinics and the Wellness institute with a plethora of programming to support healthy weights. We collect the weight of the patients at each visit through our MS Paths program to help guide the patient to overall health. Q: What is the impact of obesity on disease activity and worsening disability in MS? Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support a clear relationship between weight status and disease activity or worsening disability in MS (Pinhas‐Hamiel et al. 2015) (So and Kalron 2020). There is a link with adolescent obesity and both pediatric and adult onset MS risk and adipokines, obesity related markers, have been shown to be related to Pediatric MS risk and disease course. (Keyhanian et al. 2019) Results from observational studies have shown conflicting results, and there have been no controlled clinical trials to date (Pilutti, McAuley, and Motl 2012). There is a recent study looking at retinal cell layer and higher BMI is associated with worsening neurodegeneration (Filippatou et al. 2020) and worsening cognitive performance (Owji et al. 2019). Obesity may indeed be related to the risk of MS, neurodegeneration and the disease course, more information is needed. Maintaining a healthy weight has other important benefits and is part of overall health and wellness. Q: What is the prevalence of vascular risk factors and vascular comorbidities in MS? Estimates of the prevalence of vascular risk factors and vascular comorbidities have varied widely, as have the quality of studies used to make these estimates. In a recent systematic review, the prevalence range for common vascular risk factors and comorbidities was provided for included studies: 6.75% to 8.57% for diabetes type II, 3.0% to 47.8% for hyperlipidemia, 0% to 47.8% for hypertension, 0.78% to 22.2% for coronary artery disease, 1.2% to 1.4% for ischemic stroke, and 1% to 4% for peripheral vascular disease (Marrie et al. 2015). Are certain vascular risk factors or vascular comorbidities more common in MS populations compared to the general public? Ischemic heart disease appears to be more common in MS populations compared to the general public, but the data for other vascular risk factors and comorbidities is inconsistent. A recent English matched cohort suggests that MS is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease that is not fully explained through traditional vascular risk factors (Palladino et al. 2020). Q: What is the impact of vascular risk factors and vascular comorbidities on MS disease activity and worsening of disability? Some studies have suggested an association between vascular risk factors and MRI lesion burden and brain volume in MS. Vascular risk factors were associated with lower brain volumes event early in the disease course. (Pichler et al. 2019) There is also some evidence that vascular risk factors and vascular comorbidities are associated with faster progression of disability including both physical and cognitive. (R. A. Marrie et al. 2010) The presence of multiple vascular risk factors may increase the risk of disability more than any one risk factor alone. These findings again reinforce the support and need for healthy living for our patients from early on in the disease course.  Several randomized controlled trials suggest a potential role for stress management programs in MS. Most trials were focused on improving depression, fatigue, or quality of life, but one trial also demonstrated a reduction in MRI markers of disease activity. A randomized trial of stress management therapy (SMT) did show a significant Class 1 evidence that SMT reduced the number of gad enhancing lesions in 6 months yet with no corresponding clinical effect and another trial showed beneficial effect of SMT on a secondary analysis of quality of life (Agland et al. 2018) (Mohr et al. 2012). A mindfulness based stress management trial improved emotional wellbeing yet did not improve the primary outcomes (Senders et al. 2019). Various models of stress management have shown a lasting beneficial effect on emotional health (Khayeri et al. 2016) . Various stress management techniques such as mindfulness training can be offered to interested patients. The Mellen Center Behavioral Medicine team offers a 4 visit stress management visit series to support our patients living with MS. Q: What is the prevalence of psychiatric disorders as a comorbidity in MS? Reports on the prevalence of depression, bipolar disorder (BPD), and anxiety disorders in the MS population have varied widely. In a recent systematic review, reports of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders ranged from 4.98% to 58.9% for depression, 0% to 16.2% for BPD, and 1.2% to 44.6% for anxiety disorder (Ruth Ann Marrie, Reingold, et al. 2015). Depression diagnosed at the time of diagnosis was high in all ages and both sexes and should be screened for at all MS visits. (Persson et al. 2020) Depression and anxiety have been reported to be common symptoms of the MS prodrome, the symptoms preceding the diagnosis of MS. (Yusuf et al. 2020) All studies of depression and BPD that included a comparator population found a higher prevalence of mood disorders in the MS population therefore mood disorder screens and routine consultations with Health Psychology and other mental health services should be offered to MS patients as needed. Q: What is the impact of psychiatric disorders on quality of life in MS? Depression and anxiety disorders as well as other Psychiatric disorders have a major impact on quality of life in MS and potentially healthy living with MS. Depression, which has been studied the most, can affect multiple functional domains including energy, cognition, perception of health, healthy aging and sexual function and thereby effect the quality of life of the person living with MS.(The Health, Lifestyle and Aging with MS Canadian Consortium et al. 2020) Moreover, patients with MS who have depression may have worse long-term disease-related outcomes as a result of decreased adherence to DMTs. (Zettl et al. 2017) Routine mood disorder screening and consultations to mental health professionals are regularly needed in MS care. In a 2012 systematic review investigating the association between MS and suicidal behavior, the majority of included studies found rates of completed suicide 1.6- to 14-times higher than the general public.(Pompili et al. 2012) A Veterans study has shown risks for suicide in MS include male, depression and alcohol abuse (Kellerman et al. 2020). Suicide ideation has been associated with fatigue, poor social support and poor sleep quality, these should be preemptively addressed in the routine clinical care of the MS (Mikula et al. 2020). Q: How should MS providers address depression in clinical practice? Depression is often under-recognized and undertreated in MS. We recommend regular depression screening in clinical practice. Many screening tests have been validated. The PHQ9 is a free widely used tool to screen for mood disorders. (Patrick and Connick 2019) At the Mellen Center we use technology enabled comprehensive assessment of MS patients including patient- reported outcome measures (PROM) to regularly screen for mood disorders (Baldassari et al. 2020). Mood disorders are addressed per our Psychology and Psychiatry team as needed. Management of psychiatric disorders should follow general practice guidelines. A: In addition to treatment and regular monitoring from a neurologist with MS experience, MS patients need a primary care doctor to help with age-appropriate health screening, staying up-to-date with immunization, and management of medical comorbidities. As mentioned previously, some of these comorbidities are of particular importance for people with MS. At the Mellen Center we encourage our patients to regularly see a primary physician. Q: What vaccinations are acceptable in MS patients? Primary care doctors will manage the needed vaccinations for our MS patients. We will review the timing and the type of vaccination as it relates to the type of DMT. Please refer to the and to the AAN guidelines on Vaccines and MS. Hakim, E., A. M. O. Bakheit, T. N. Bryant, M.

McFarlin The cellular immune response to measles virus, as measured by lymphocyte proliferation in normal individuals, is considerably lower than that to mumps or vaccinia viruses, and stable multiple sclerosis patients do not differ significantly from the norm. The response to these viruses was studied in 28 twin sets both concordant and discordant for multiple sclerosis. Normal responses to mumps and vaccinia viruses occurred throughout. Seven affected twins manifested a persistently elevated response to measles virus, whereas the unaffected twins had a (normal) low response. The differences were unrelated to differences in T cell subsets, unusual kinetics of the response, or differential susceptibility of lymphocytes to the effects of measles virus infection in vitro. The specificity of the response resides in an E subpopulation, and the addition of low-responder E cells to high-responder E cells failed to identify an active low-responder suppressor population.

The plasma is then discarded and replaced with a colloid fluid, combined back with the cellular components, and returned to the same patient. The colloid fluid is typically a combination of human serum albumin and/or fresh frozen plasma. Typically, a large-bore, double-lumen catheter is used to provide a sufficient volume of blood to perform plasmapheresis over several hours. Q: Where is plasmapheresis used in MS and related disorders? Plasmapheresis is used as a second-line therapy (after systemic corticosteroids) in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses (or “attacks”) and other central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, idiopathic transverse myelitis, idiopathic optic neuritis, and neuromyelitis optica. Plasmapheresis is occasionally used inpatients who are intolerant of high-dose corticosteroids or who have medical contraindications to high-dose corticosteroids. Q: Are there clinical trials showing efficacy of plasmapheresis? Two controlled trials evaluated the effect of plasmapheresis. One study of 116 MS patients in an acute exacerbation randomized patients to 11 courses of plasmapheresis or sham treatment over eight weeks. This treatment was added to oral cyclophosphamide and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). There was no overall difference between the two groups, although there was a trend at one month in favor of plasmapheresis. A second randomized, sham-controlled trial evaluated 22 patients with severe deficits from a variety of CNS inflammatory disorders who had been refractory to high-dose corticosteroids. Those 13-NEU-536 Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research 216.444.8600 randomized to plasmapheresis were more likely to improve, and the improvement was sustained after treatments stopped. There is no set number of plasma exchanges performed, although typically patients receive between three and seven exchanges, each of which takes 2-4 hours. The number of treatments can be guided by the clinical recovery, or sometimes a preset number of exchanges are performed. For management of natalizumab-related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, five exchanges are recommended. Q: What types of patients are more likely to improve following plasmapheresis? A retrospective study found that 44% of patients treated with plasmapheresis had moderate or marked improvement. Improvement was more likely in a patient with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and Marburg variant MS. In addition, an improvement was seen more commonly in men, those with preserved reflexes, and when treatment was started within 20 days of onset. Another study confirmed many of these observations. At the Mellen Center, we consider plasmapheresis in patients with less than 1-2 months of severe neurologic impairment secondary to CNS demyelination or inflammation. Q: Is plasmapheresis used in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)? NMO is a rare (~1% the incidence of typical MS) inflammatory disease manifest as longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, and occasionally atypical brain lesions. A highly specific auto-antibody to the aquaporin-4 water ion channel is seen in the majority of patients with NMO continued on next page 2 syndrome. High-dose corticosteroids are the typical first-line treatment for acute attacks of NMO, but corticosteroids are often insufficiently effective in NMO. Given the probable pathogenic role of antiaquaporin-4 antibodies in serum, it is not surprising that plasmapheresis has been reported to be effective in NMO. Repeated courses of plasmapheresis have also been reported to be effective in patients who did not respond to oral immunosuppressive therapies alone. Case series report improvement following plasmapheresis in patients with ADEM, too. Several trials have evaluated plasmapheresis in progressive MS. A meta-analysis of six trials found modest evidence for reducing the odds of worsening over 12-36 months. However, the control groups were not all comparable and other immunosuppressive treatments were administered, making it difficult to assess the efficacy of plasmapheresis. Given marginal data on efficacy, the logistical challenges of administering plasmapheresis, and the cost of plasmapheresis, we do not generally recommend plasmapheresis in the treatment of progressive MS. How is plasmapheresis used in the management of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? When PML is associated with treatment with a monoclonal antibody (i.e. natalizumab), plasmapheresis is typically recommended to accelerate the removal of the therapeutic antibody with the goal of accelerating immune reconstitution. This immune reconstitution is thought to help the immune system fight the CNS infection which causes PML. In the setting of natalizumab therapy, plasmapheresis has been found to accelerate the removal of natalizumab, accelerate desaturation of the α4-integrin receptors, and improve leukocyte transmigration across an in vitro blood brain barrier. However, it remains unclear if this treatment improves the ultimate outcome of PML in this setting. Plasmapheresis is a specialized medical procedure, typically performed in a dedicated plasmapheresis unit. It requires large-bore intravenous catheters to provide sufficient rate of blood flow through the machine. At our institution, Quinton catheters are typically used and have provided reliable intravenous access and excellent safety. Large-bore catheters are typically placed by Interventional Radiology. Outpatient treatment is possible, although most patients who need plasmapheresis for CNS demyelination are hospitalized because of the complications of their underlying condition. Because there are few randomized trials of plasmapheresis, insurance coverage of the procedure is sometimes difficult. Several reactions may occur during plasma exchange, including fainting, dizziness, or nausea, all of which are caused by hypotension. To reduce the risk of hypotension, patients should be encouraged to drink 6-8 glasses of non-caffeinated fluids each day starting three days before the first treatment. Rarely, patients report paresthesias because of a reaction to the blood thinner, which is treated with extra calcium. Fatigue is sometimes reported by patients after plasma exchange, but typically goes away the next day. Other risks include bleeding or an allergic reaction (itching, wheezing, or rash) to the solutions used to replace the plasma or the sterilizing agents used for the tubing. Excessive suppression of the immune system can temporarily occur due to plasma exchange, which can increase the risk of infection. Rarely, the blood may clot in the machine, making return to the patient impossible. Very rarely, deaths have been reported with plasma exchange, usually from infection or the underlying condition for which plasma exchange treatment was used. Weiner H, Dau P, Khatri B, et al.

The Answers May Surprise You The jury is still out on the wide-ranging health benefits of marijuana, though some studies have shown surprising results. Now that recreational marijuana use is legal in some states, studies investigating the short- and long-term health effects of lighting a fatty are everywhere. Here’s a roundup of some of the scientifically documented advantages: A study published in the in 2012 found that smoking marijuana may improve lung capacity and even reverse lung damage caused by tobacco. Marijuana can help to quell pain and nausea, but indicated that these effects may actually be a by-product of marijuana’s sedative effects. Higher doses can have the opposite effect on users. found that when epileptic rats were given synthetic marijuana and marijuana extract, they didn’t have seizures for 10 hours. Red eyes? So what.When smoked, , potentially preventing glaucoma, an eye disease that can cause blindness. Cannabidiol, a compound found in weed, may make cancer cells less likely to spread. Researchers found that cannabidiol turned off a gene that cancer cells make copies of to spread. A study published in 2006 in reported that THC slows the formation of plaques related to Alzheimer’s disease. Marijuana may help to alleviate symptoms of , , , and treatment-related side effects of diseases including and . While marijuana isn’t a cure, it may help to ease pain-related symptoms. Harm reduction research suggests that marijuana may be a less harmful substitute for alcohol, prescription, and illegal drug addicts. Though marijuana is addictive, it doesn’t cause as much damage to the body as other addictive substances. Sound too good to be true? Of course it is. As with any drug, there are risks associated with weed use. Here are a handful of the known ones, as indicated in : Yup, the forgetful stoner is a real thing. This is why you should never, ever drive while stoned. Smoking weed can increase your risk of injury. High doses can lead to anxiety, paranoia, and psychosis. Long-term and especially daily use can cause addiction. Approximately 9% of marijuana users become addicted. Marijuana is associated with increased likelihood of dropping out of school among adolescents. Adolescent use was also linked to altered brain development, and cognitive impairment and lower IQ. It can contribute to a diminished sense of achievement and overall life satisfaction. Marijuana use may increase your risk of mental health disorders such as schizophrenia in persons who are predisposed to those disorders. So, will smoking a little pot every now and then cause you to keel over in your early fifties? Probably not. Can hitting a bong six times a day impact you in the long term? Unless you suffer from one of the health conditions listed above, it’s probably not the best idea ever. Maybe there simply is no definitive answer as to whether pot is good or bad for you. The key is to weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and make a choice that makes sense for you. {{ oPromoboxArticle.title }} {{ oItem.title }} {{oArticle.title}} | | | Copyright © 2000-2021 MH Sub I, LLC dba Internet Brands.

Thousands of researchers and clinicians worked for many years to reach that milestone, but in the end, it was attained by the courage and commitment of 215 young people and their parents. Those children and adolescents participated in PARADIGMS, a Phase III study that assessed the safety and effectiveness of Gilenya relative to interferon beta-1a (given in a dose of 30 ug weekly). The study found that while both medications reduced the relapse rate from patients’ baseline experience, Gilenya cut relapses to a much greater extent than the other agent. Further, the study showed that the side effects seen with Gilenya in pediatric patients were similar to those in adults. PARADIGMS was a large trial, involving more than 80 study sites in 25 countries. Despite that worldwide scope, it took researchers three years to enroll 215 patients. Another international study with 77 sites in 22 countries took 3.5 years to enroll 166 patients. Emmanuelle Waubant, MD, says that while several factors pose obstacles to conducting clinical trials in children and adolescents with MS, those challenges must be overcome if pediatric patients are going to benefit from a range of safe, effective therapies. The small size of the pediatric MS population is one of the most significant impediments to trial recruitment, notes Dr. Waubant, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and expert in pediatric MS. She explains that there are fewer than 5,000 pediatric MS patients in the United States, and perhaps only 10,000 or so children and adolescents with MS worldwide. Further, because the median age for onset of symptoms in pediatric MS is 15 years, most patients can only participate in pediatric trials for a few years before they reach adulthood. To help overcome those and other obstacles, the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (IPMSSG) convened a meeting of 14 pediatric MS experts in New York City in January 2018. As chair of the IPMSSG’s Clinical Trial Task Force, Dr. Waubant led the proceedings. She explains that the goal was to identify study designs and best practices that would generate high-quality evidence on the safety of MS therapies in children and adolescents, and to help remove regulatory and insurance barriers to obtaining treatment. The recommendations, which were published in the online version of Neurology this May, include calls for: conducting pediatric pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies for all new MS therapies for which such testing is feasible to identify the appropriate dose in children avoiding placebo-controlled trials of immunomodulatory agents already proven to be effective in adults allowing open-label studies that focus on safety and pharmacology to be sufficient to approve the pediatric use of an MS therapy that already has been well-studied and approved in adults and that has been shown through analyses to have a strong likelihood of efficacy in children and adolescents when a Phase III, controlled trial is required, employing MRI findings rather than clinical events as the primary endpoint whenever possible, because a strong correlation between the two has been demonstrated and using MRI findings allows for a shorter trial period considering the addition of teenagers to some Phase III trials of investigational MS therapies being assessed in adultss enrolling pediatric MS patients in registries to monitor the long-term safety of medication choosing approaches for testing that minimize inconvenience to patients and their families “The aim is to ensure the safety of medications that may be used to treat MS in children and adolescents, but to do so in a way that leverages thoughtful study designs and the large database we have in adult patients,” Dr. Waubant explains. No matter how innovative its design, however, a study can only be meaningful if enough patients enroll to make its findings statistically reliable. For that reason, Dr. Waubant urges parents and patients to talk with their MS clinician about clinical trials, and to consider participating. MSAA can also help parents and patients find MS clinical trials.

45e2a7c3-40e3-45c5-b12f-e198e53b9f64,"by Michele R. Berman, MD, and Mark S. Boguski, MD, PhD Actor David Lander, known for his role as Andrew ""Squiggy"" Squiggman on the sitcom ""Laverne & Shirley,"" died at the age of 73 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, from complications of multiple sclerosis. In a to , ""David's family hopes his fans will remember him for all the laughter he brought into the world."" Lander was originally diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1984, a year after ""Laverne & Shirley"" ended its 8-year run. He began to experience dizziness and numbness in his hands and feet. A spinal tap revealed his diagnosis, but he kept it a secret to all but his family, as he thought it would end his career in Hollywood. In 1999, he publicly revealed his diagnosis in a memoir entitled, ""Fall Down Laughing: How Squiggy Caught Multiple Sclerosis and Didn't Tell Nobody."" In 2000, the National MS Society named Lander one of their National Ambassadors. He toured the country and became an advocate for patients with MS, speaking at conventions and fundraisers. He particularly wanted to educate patients about early intervention for those newly diagnosed. In a 2007 with , Lander explained how much the outlook on MS changed since he was diagnosed: ""When I was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, there was nothing you could do about it. Doctors would say, 'diagnose and adios.' Now, there are many treatments available to control this progressive disease."" His doctor originally painted a bleak picture, saying he wasn't sure that Lander would ever walk again. After trials of corticosteroid and interferon-beta-1a, Lander was able to live a very full life. In addition to his MS advocacy work, he was a scout for baseball's Seattle Mariners, did voice-over work for a number of television shows and video games, and wrote reviews of handicap-accessible areas in ballparks. We first wrote about multiple sclerosis for in December 2010. The , which included Lander, also pointed out a number of public figures (including Michelle Obama's father) who were diagnosed with the disease. Quite a bit has changed in the treatment of MS since that time. MS is a neuroinflammatory disease that affects myelin, nerve cell bodies, and the axons in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. The term multiple sclerosis refers to the distinctive areas of scar tissue (sclerosis or plaques) that are visible in the white matter of people who have MS. MS is the most common disabling neurological disease of young adults with symptom onset generally occurring between the ages of 20 to 40 years. In MS, the immune system cells that normally protect us from viruses, bacteria, and unhealthy cells mistakenly attack the protective myelin sheath of nerves in the central nervous system. According to the , MS is thought to affect more than 1 million people in the U.S. As with most autoimmune disorders, twice as many women as men are affected by MS. In addition, MS is more common in colder climates: the further from the equator, the higher the risk. The symptoms of MS usually begin over one to several days, but in some forms, they may develop more slowly. They may be mild or severe and may go away quickly or last for months. Sometimes the initial symptoms of MS are overlooked because they disappear in a day or so and normal function returns. Most people with MS have a relapsing-remitting form of the disease, in contrast to a more slowly developing form called primary progressive MS. Progressive MS can also be a second stage of the illness that follows years of relapsing-remitting symptoms (called secondary progressive MS). Relapsing-remitting MS accounts for approximately 85%-90% of cases at onset. Secondary progressive MS usually occurs 10-20 years after the onset of the disease. Primary progressive MS is characterized by progressive disability from the onset of the disease with occasional plateaus or temporary minor improvements. The mean age of onset is 40. A diagnosis of MS is often delayed because MS shares symptoms with other neurological conditions and diseases. Vision problems such as blurred or double vision, or optic neuritis, which causes pain with eye movement and a rapid loss of vision Muscle weakness, often in the hands and legs, and muscle stiffness accompanied by painful muscle spasms. It may be severe enough to affect walking or standing Tingling, numbness, or pain in the arms, legs, trunk, or face Clumsiness, particularly difficulty staying balanced when walking Mental or physical fatigue which accompanies the early symptoms during an attack Mood changes such as depression or difficulty with emotional expression or control Cognitive dysfunction -- problems concentrating, multitasking, thinking, learning, or difficulties with memory or judgment There is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can reduce the number and severity of relapses and delay the long-term disability progression of the disease. Corticosteroids, such as intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed for courses of 3 to 5 days. Intravenous steroids quickly and potently suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. They may be followed by tapered doses of oral corticosteroids. Clinical trials have shown that these drugs hasten recovery from MS attacks, but do not alter the long-term outcome of the disease. Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) can treat severe flare-ups in people with relapsing forms of MS who do not have a good response to methylprednisolone. This treatment has not been shown to be effective for secondary progressive or chronic progressive MS. Current therapies approved by the FDA are designed to modulate or suppress the inflammatory reactions of the disease. They are most effective for relapsing-remitting MS at early stages of the disease. drugs (Rebif, Betaseron, others) are among the most common medications to treat MS. Interferons are signaling molecules that regulate immune cells. Potential side effects of these drugs include flu-like symptoms (which usually fade with continued therapy), depression, or elevation of liver enzymes. Some individuals will notice a decrease in the effectiveness of the drugs after 18 to 24 months of treatment. If flare-ups occur or symptoms worsen, doctors may switch treatment to alternative drugs. changes the balance of immune cells in the body, but how it works is not entirely clear. Side effects are usually mild and consist of local injection site reactions or swelling. is administered intravenously once a month. It works by preventing cells of the immune system from entering the brain and spinal cord. It is very effective but is associated with increased risk of a called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Natalizumab is generally recommended only for individuals who have not responded well to or who are unable to tolerate other first-line therapies. is administered intravenously every six months and treats adults with relapsing or primary progressive forms of MS. It is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy for primary progressive MS. The drug targets the circulating immune cells that produce antibodies, which also play a role in the formation of MS lesions. Side effects include infusion-related reactions and increased risk of infections. Ocrelizumab may increase the risk of cancer as well. is administered for 5 consecutive days followed by 3 days of infusions one year later. It targets proteins on the surface of immune cells. Because this drug increases the risk of autoimmune disorders, it is recommended for those who have had inadequate responses to two or more MS therapies. , which is administered intravenously four times a year, has been approved for especially severe forms of relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS. Side effects include the development of certain types of blood cancers in up to 1% of those with MS, as well as with heart damage. This drug should be considered as a last resort to treat people with a form of MS that leads to rapid loss of function and for whom other treatments did not work. is a once-daily medication that reduces the MS relapse rate in adults and children. It is the first FDA-approved drug to treat MS in adolescents and children as young as 10. The drug prevents lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes and entering the blood, brain, and spinal cord. Fingolimod may result in a slow heart rate and eye problems when first taken. Fingolimod can also increase the risk of infections, such as herpes virus infections, or in rare cases be associated with PML. is a twice-daily medication used to treat relapsing forms of MS. Its exact mechanism of action is not currently known. Side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, and lowered white blood cell count. is a once-daily medication that reduces the rate of proliferation of activated immune cells. Teriflunomide's side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, liver damage, and hair loss. is administered as two courses of tablets about one year apart. Cladribine targets certain types of white blood cells that drive immune attacks in MS. The drug may increase the risk of developing cancer and should be considered for individuals who have not responded well to other MS treatments. is a twice-daily drug similar to dimethyl fumarate but with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Scientists suspect these drugs, which have been approved to treat secondary progressive MS, reduce damage to the brain and spinal cord by making the immune response less inflammatory, although their exact mechanism of action is poorly understood. is taken orally and has a similar mechanism of action to fingolimod. Siponimod has been approved by the FDA to treat secondary progressive MS. Clinical trials have shown that cladribine, diroximel fumarate, and dimethyl fumarate decrease the number of relapses, delay the progress of physical disability, and slow the development of brain lesions.

GM-CSF and CXCR4 define a T helper cell signature in multiple sclerosis   ,   ,   ,   ,     , –() Cytokine dysregulation is a central driver of chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we sought to determine the characteristic cellular and cytokine polarization profile in patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). Using a combination of neural network-based representation learning algorithms, we identified an expanded T helper cell subset in patients with MS, characterized by the expression of granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4. This cellular signature, which includes expression of very late antigen 4 in peripheral blood, was also enriched in the central nervous system of patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis. In independent validation cohorts, we confirmed that this cell population is increased in patients with MS compared with other inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. Lastly, we also found the population to be reduced under effective disease-modifying therapy, suggesting that the identified T cell profile represents a specific therapeutic target in MS.

Multiple Sklerose: Kognitive Defizite haben hohe Relevanz für den Alltag Multiple Sklerose: Kognitive Defizite haben hohe Relevanz für den Alltag Dtsch Arztebl 2017; 114(37): [12]; DOI: 10.3238/PersNeuro.2017.09.15.02 Der Erhalt der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit stellt eine der Herausforderungen bei Patienten mit multipler Sklerose dar. Immunmodulatorische Arzneimittel und nichtpharmakologische Maßnahmen können einen positiven Einfluss haben. Neben den klassischen physischen Symptomen, die im Rahmen einer multiplen Sklerose (MS) auftreten, existieren „verborgene Symptome“, zu denen kognitive Veränderungen, Fatigue und emotional-affektive Aspekte wie Depression und Angststörungen zählen. Die Betitelung als „verborgen“ oder „soft“ führt oftmals zu Irritationen, sind diese Beeinträchtigungen doch für die Patienten oftmals zentral und deutlich sichtbar. Mittlerweile gilt es als unbestritten, dass sich die Trias „Fatigue, Depression/Angst und kognitive Störungen“ stark negativ auf die Lebensqualität betroffener Patienten und ihre Berufsfähigkeit auswirkt () . Verborgene Symptome der MS und ihr Einfluss auf Lebensqualität und Berufsfähigkeit Eine kürzlich erschienene Studie zum Einfluss der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit auf den Grad der Arbeitsfähigkeit konnte sehr deutlich zeigen, dass die Arbeitsfähigkeit eine direkte Funktion der kognitiven Leistung ist. Dieser Effekt blieb über verschiedene kognitive Domänen hinweg stabil, sodass dieser enge Zusammenhang als gesichert angesehen werden kann (). Ein weiteres starkes Argument dafür, die Kognition im Rahmen der MS als gewichtig anzusehen, lässt sich aus der jüngsten Publikation zur Schätzung der Kostenbelastung durch MS in Europa ableiten (). Hier zeigt sich sehr deutlich, dass Kognition neben Fatigue einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Belastung leistet, da diese Symptome von Beginn an unabhängig vom Behinderungsgrad präsent sein können und die Produktivität der Patienten negativ beeinflussen. Die Folgekosten in Anbetracht der Betroffenheit oftmals noch sehr junger Patienten sind enorm und schließen vor allem häufige Arbeitsausfälle und Frühverrentung ein. Es sei daher bereits an dieser Stelle betont, dass eine Sensibilisierung seitens der behandelnden Ärzte (vor allem Neurologen und Hausärzte) für die unsichtbaren Symptome dringend angezeigt ist, um durch den Einsatz frühzeitiger Immun- und symptomatischer Therapie das kognitive Netzwerk so lange wie möglich funktionstüchtig zu halten. Die kognitiven Veränderungen bei Patienten mit MS fokussieren sich auf 3 wesentliche Bereiche: kognitive Verlangsamung (Einschränkung in der Informations­verarbeitungs­geschwindig­keit), Beeinträchtigungen der exekutiven Funktionen (z. B. eingeschränktes Multitasking, eingeschränkte mentale Flexibilität). Als hat sich die herausgestellt. Diese Verlangsamung lässt sich oftmals bereits zum Krankheitsbeginn mit sensitiven Testverfahren objektivieren und führt häufig dazu, dass auch andere kognitive Teilleistungen in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden. Zudem ist eine gute kognitive Geschwindigkeit in unserer Hochleistungsgesellschaft von besonderer Bedeutung: Wer in kurzer Zeit viel leistet und dabei noch eine gute Qualität abliefert, hat beruflichen Mitstreitern etwas voraus. Wer aber für eine gute Qualität doppelt so viel Zeit benötigt, fällt rasch aus dem Rahmen. Letzteres ist genau das, was MS-Patienten nicht selten passiert. Gibt man im testpsychologischen Kontext genügend Zeit, sind die Patienten häufig in der Lage, 100 % Qualität zu erbringen. In zeitgebundenen Testverfahren sieht man häufig ein Scheitern, weil die Quantität einfach in der vorgegebenen Zeit nicht erreicht werden kann. Neben der Verlangsamung treten Probleme der auf, und zwar dahingehend, dass die Aufmerksamkeit nicht anhaltend auf dem gleichen Niveau gehalten werden kann, sondern . Das eingeschränkte Multitasking wirkt sich zudem negativ auf die Leistungsfähigkeit im Alltag aus, da nicht mehr parallel, sondernabgearbeitet werden können. Somit haben die kognitiven Domänen, die bei der MS im Speziellen beeinträchtigt sind, eine hohe Alltagsrelevanz und stellen zu jedem Zeitpunkt der Erkrankung eine beachtliche Belastung für die Betroffenen dar. Zur Evolution der kognitiven Veränderungen über die Zeit liegen nur wenige Daten aus longitudinalen und cross-sektionalen Studien vor. Diese aber sprechen kongruent für eine deutlichere Progression in den ersten 5 Jahren nach Krankheitsbeginn und eine Abschwächung im weiteren Verlauf (, ). In jedem Fall unterscheidet sich der Verlauf sehr deutlich von dem der klassischen neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen. Dies ist ein wesentlicher Punkt in der Kommunikation mit den Patienten, da oftmals die Angst im Vordergrund steht, dement zu werden. Letztere Sorge führt häufig zu einer generellen Ablehnung, den eigenen kognitiven Status erheben zu lassen. Daher ist eine frühzeitige Aufklärung der Patienten hinsichtlich der Entwicklung von kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen sehr wichtig. Die Frage nach den konkreten Ursachen für das Auftreten kognitiver Störungen bei MS kann nicht mit Sicherheit beantwortet werden. Dennoch haben sich im Laufe der letzten 20 Jahre Hypothesen aus Studienergebnissen ableiten lassen: Zum einen zeigen bildgebende Daten, dass es nicht primär auf die Anzahl der Läsionen in der weißen und grauen Substanz ankommt, sondern vielmehr auf die Lokalisation (, ). Liegen auch nur wenige Läsionen in für die Kognition strategischen Hirnregionen, kann daraus ein kognitives Defizit resultieren. Neben der Lokalisation der Läsionen spielt die Hirnatrophie eine entscheidende Rolle. Es gilt als gesichert, dass das kortikale Gesamthirnvolumen bei kognitiv beeinträchtigten Patienten kleiner ist als bei Personen mit intakter Kognition (). Darüber hinaus gibt es Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitig auftretende atrophische Veränderung in den ersten beiden Jahren nach Diagnosestellung als Prädiktor für einen ungünstigen kognitiven Verlauf in den Folgejahren zu werten ist (). Mit Korrelationskoeffizienten von 0,5 und größer stellt die zum kognitiven Status dar. In diesem Zusammenhang sei explizit auf den Thalamus verwiesen, da es Evidenz dafür gibt, dass MS-Patienten bereits in frühen Krankheitsstadien eine thalamische Atrophie entwickeln können () und dass sowohl Struktur als auch Funktion des Thalamus maßgeblich die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit beeinflussen (). Aus den kernspintomografisch gefundenen Resultaten lässt sich gesamthaft ableiten, dass sich ein struktureller und funktioneller Schaden negativ auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und therapeutische Ansätze möglichst frühzeitig zum Einsatz kommen sollten, solange das Netzwerk noch Ressourcen zur Kompensation besitzt. Aufgrund der Bedeutsamkeit der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit für das Berufs- und Sozialleben der Patienten ist eine regelmäßige angeraten. Diese Dokumentation dient dazu, dem Patienten zum einen zu signalisieren, dass er von seiner Therapie profitiert und auch hinsichtlich der Kognition stabil ist, zum anderen sollte ein sich deutlich verschlechternder kognitiver Status auch immer Anlass dazu geben, die gegenwärtige Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Ein empfehlenswertes Instrument, um den kognitiven Status im Rahmen der klinischen Routine zu erfassen, ist die (). Sie besteht aus 3 Testverfahren: dem VLMT (verbaler Lern- und Merkfähigkeitstest) () und dem Die Durchführungszeit für die gesamte Screeningbatterie liegt bei circa 20 Minuten. Steht dafür nicht ausreichend Zeit zur Verfügung, empfiehlt es sich, zumindest den SDMT regelmäßig einmal pro Jahr durchzuführen. Die Durchführung nimmt nur 90 Sekunden in Anspruch, und die Aussagekraft des Tests ist dabei äußerst gut. Vor allem das Defizit in der kognitiven Prozessierungsgeschwindigkeit und im Arbeitsgedächtnis kann mit diesem Verfahren sehr zuverlässig erfasst werden. Selbstverständlich ersetzen Screeninginstrumente keine elaborierte neuropsychologische Untersuchung. Sie sollen eher dazu dienen, eine Sensibilisierung für die Kognition zu entwickeln, und können bei deutlich abfallender Leistung im Vergleich zum individuellen Vortest frühzeitig eine kognitive Verschlechterung aufzeigen. Die Behandlung der kognitiven Störungen bei MS ist eine , da es keine wirksame, evidenzbasierte symptomatische Therapie gibt, die jedem betroffenen Patienten empfohlen werden könnte. Zu den verlaufsmodifizierenden Immuntherapien liegen nur wenige Daten zur Kognition vor. Für die Interferone und Glatiramerazetat konnte gezeigt werden, dass sie sich nicht nachteilig auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirken, sondern Patienten unter der Therapie deutlich besser abschneiden als solche unter Placebo (–). Zu Natalizumab liegen Ergebnisse aus 2 Studien vor, die eine signifikante Verbesserung der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit in entscheidenden Domänen dokumentieren (, ). Fingolimod und Dimetylfumarat () wirken sich ebenfalls stabilisierend auf die Kognition aus, konnten aber in bisherigen Studien keine klinisch relevante Verbesserung zeigen. Eine solche Verbesserung konnte jüngst eindrücklich für Daclizumab vorgestellt werden. Im direkten Vergleich zum Interferon beta-1a i.m. schnitten die Patienten über einen Zeitraum von 144 Wochen deutlich besser ab. Hinzu kam, dass die Leistung im SDMT nach dem genannten Beobachtungszeitraum als klinisch relevante Verbesserung im Vergleich zur Baseline-Untersuchung zu werten ist (). Zur symptomatischen Behandlung der kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen muss leider konstatiert werden, dass es keine hinreichende Evidenz für die Wirksamkeit der untersuchten Medikamente gibt, zu denen Modafinil, 4-Aminopyridin, Amantadin, L-Amphetamin, Methylphenidat, aber auch Antidementiva wie Donepezil, Rivastigmin und Memantin zählen (, ). Zu den ist zu sagen, dass sich moderates Ausdauertraining positiv auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und eine Studie zur Frage der Intensität gezeigt hat, dass intensives, moderates und leichtes Training sich gleichsam positiv auswirken. Dies bedeutet, dass Patienten sich durchaus auch körperlich fordern können, sie aber die Trainingsintensität ihrer jeweiligen Verfassung anpassen sollten. Wichtig ist, dass überhaupt körperliche Aktivität durchgeführt wird (, ). Neben sportlicher Aktivität ist auch Hirnleistungstraining eine Maßnahme, von der viele Patienten profitieren (, ). Das Training sollte allerdings spezifisch auf die jeweiligen im Vordergrund stehenden Defizite zugeschnitten sein und nicht einen Rundumschlag darstellen im Sinne von „viel hilft auch viel“. Kognitive Defizite sind ernst zu nehmende Symptome der MS mit hoher Relevanz für den Alltag und die Berufsfähigkeit der Betroffenen. Das Erheben des kognitiven Status sollte bereits im Rahmen der Diagnosestellung erfolgen, um einen Verlauf über die Zeit und einen Vergleich zu einem Ausgangswert bei deutlicher Verschlechterung dokumentieren zu können. Es gibt Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitige Immuntherapie auch als Benefit im Hinblick auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit über die Zeit zu werten ist. Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung kann Anzeichen eines Schubes sein (kognitive Schübe sind keine Chimäre!). Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung (z. B. > 4 Punkte im SDMT) sollte in der Gesamtschau mit anderen Befunden (vor allem MRT) Anlass dazu geben, die bestehende Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Prof. Dr. phil. Dipl.-Psych.

82746404-75a8-42df-af53-fd0b70a5f2d7,"Reprogrammed human skin cells highly effective in treating myelin disorders A study out today in the journal shows that human brain cells created by reprogramming skin cells are highly effective in treating myelin disorders, a family of diseases that includes multiple sclerosis and rare childhood disorders called pediatric leukodystrophies. The study is the first successful attempt to employ human (hiPSC) to produce a population of cells that are critical to neural signaling in the brain. In this instance, the researchers utilized cells crafted from human skin and transplanted them into animal models of myelin disease. ""This study strongly supports the utility of hiPSCs as a feasible and effective source of cells to treat myelin disorders,"" said University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) neurologist Steven Goldman, M.D., Ph.D., lead author of the study. ""In fact, it appears that cells derived from this source are at least as effective as those created using embryonic or tissue-specific stem cells."" The discovery opens the door to potential new treatments using hiPSC-derived cells for a range of neurological diseases characterized by the loss of a specific cell population in the central nervous system called myelin. Like the insulation found on electrical wires, myelin is a fatty tissue that ensheathes the connections between nerve cells and ensures the crisp transmission of signals from one cell to another. When myelin tissue is damaged, communication between cells can be disrupted or even lost. The most common myelin disorder is multiple sclerosis, a condition in which the body's own immune system attacks and destroys myelin. The loss of myelin is also the hallmark of a family of serious and often fatal diseases known as pediatric leukodystrophies. While individually very rare, collectively several thousand children are born in the U.S. with some form of leukodystrophy every year. The source of the myelin cells in the brain and spinal cord is cell type called the oligodendrocyte. are, in turn, the offspring of another cell called the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell, or OPC. Myelin disorders have long been considered a potential target for cell-based therapies. Scientists have theorized that if healthy OPCs could be successfully transplanted into the diseased or injured brain, then these cells might be able to produce new oligodendrocytes capable of restoring lost myelin, thereby reversing the damage caused by these diseases. However, several obstacles have thwarted scientists. One of the key challenges is that OPCs are a mature cell in the central nervous system and appear late in development. ""Compared to neurons, which are among the first cells formed in human development, there are more stages and many more steps required to create glial cells such as OPCs,"" said Goldman. ""This process requires that we understand the basic biology and the normal development of these cells and then reproduce this precise sequence in the lab."" Australian stinging tree could pave way for novel painkillers Study looks at childbirth experiences during COVID-19 in the USA Research suggests importance of vitamin D for good health in the context of COVID-19 Another challenge has been identifying the ideal source of these cells. Much of the research in the field has focused on cells derived from tissue-specific and . While research using these cells has yielded critical insight into the biology of stem cells, these sources are not considered ideal to meet demand once stem cell-based therapies become more common. The discovery in 2007 that human skin cells could be ""reprogrammed"" to the point where they returned to a biological state equivalent of an embryonic stem cell, called induced pluripotent stem cells, represented a new path forward for scientists. Because these cells - created by using the recipient's own skin - would be a genetic match, the likelihood of rejection upon transplantation is significantly diminished. These cells also promised an abundant source of material from which to fashion the cells necessary for therapies. Goldman's team was the first to successfully master the complex process of using hiPSCs to create OPCs. This process proved time consuming. It took Goldman's lab four years to establish the exact chemical signaling required to reprogram, produce, and ultimately purify OPCs in sufficient quantities for transplantation and each preparation required almost six months to go from skin cell to a transplantable population of myelin-producing cells. Once they succeeded in identifying and purifying OPCs from hiPSCs, they then assessed the ability of the cells to make new myelin when transplanted into mice with a hereditary leukodystrophy that rendered them genetically incapable of producing myelin. They found that the OPCs spread throughout the brain and began to produce myelin. They observed that hiPSC-derived cells did this even more quickly, efficiently, and effectively than cells created using tissue-derived OPCs. The animals were also free of any tumors, a dangerous potential side effect of some stem cell therapies, and survived significantly longer than untreated mice. ""The new population of OPCs and oligodendrocytes was dense, abundant, and complete,"" said Goldman. ""In fact, the re-myelination process appeared more rapid and efficient than with other cell sources."" The next stage in evaluating these cells - clinical studies - may not be long in the offing. Goldman, along with a team of researchers and clinicians from Rochester, Syracuse, and Buffalo, are preparing to launch a clinical trial using OPCs to treat multiple sclerosis. This group, titled the Upstate MS Consortium, has been approved for funding by New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM). While the consortia's initial study - the early stages of which are scheduled to begin in 2015 - will focus cells derived from tissue sources, Goldman anticipates that hiPSC-derived OPCs will eventually be included in this project.

Optic neuritis (ON) is a common manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS), and refers to inflammation of the optic nerve. It can be the initial demyelinating event in up to 20% of patients, and occurs in almost half of patients with MS.1 ON associated with demyelinating disease is generally characterized by acute to subacute, painful, and monocular vision loss. Vision typically worsens over hours to days (not months), and recovery is expected to begin within 1 month of symptom onset. The pain that occurs with optic neuritis is usually ocular, retroocular, periorbital, or a frontal headache. This pain is generally exacerbated with extraocular movements, and occurs in the vast majority of patients with typical ON.2 Patients with features atypical of ON, such as those that suggest other etiologies (i.e. abrupt onset of vision loss suggestive of a vascular etiology), warrant ophthalmology evaluation. The diagnosis of ON involves primarily clinical, electrophysiologic, and imaging evaluations. Clinically, patients typically describe central (less commonly arcuate, cecocentral, or hemianopic) vision loss that progresses over hours to days. Examination is commonly notable for impaired visual acuity, red desaturation, and an afferent pupillary defect. Funduscopic examination can appear normal acutely, but disc edema can be present in approximately one-third of patients (particularly those with anterior optic neuritis).1, 2 Optic disc pallor is generally seen weeks to months following onset of typical optic neuritis. The presence of hemorrhages or exudates on funduscopic examination is more suggestive of other, non-demyelinating etiologies of optic neuropathy and warrants ophthalmology evaluation. Imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of optic neuritis include orbital MRI and optical coherence tomography (OCT). These tools can be particularly helpful if the clinical history or physical examination findings are atypical for ON. Orbital MRI with and without contrast, performed with fat saturation sequences, generally reveals enlargement and enhancement of the affected optic nerve in the acute setting. The enhancement and edema seen on MRI generally improves over time with classic demyelinating ON. OCT evaluates the optic nerve axonal integrity by measurement of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and is generally used to evaluate for evidence of prior ON. The pattern of RNFL thinning most specific to MS is temporal.3 RNFL can appear normal in the acute setting but starts to decline within 4 weeks of ON. OCT at onset of ON is also potentially confounded by edema of the optic disc, which may lead to overestimates of baseline RNFL.4 Ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness, another OCT measure, is not confounded by disc edema but declines in a similar time frame to RNFL and therefore may be more useful as a baseline measurement. The decrease in RNFL is thought to continue for 6 months following ON onset. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) can also provide valuable information regarding optic nerve impairment in ON. VEPs evaluate optic nerve function by calculating P100 latency and amplitude, which are generally abnormal in the setting of acute and remote optic neuritis. Prolonged P100 latency is a characteristic of remote optic neuritis. In terms of other clinical testing, low contrast letter acuity has also emerged as a highly sensitive means by which to detect and quantify visual dysfunction following ON. Such modalities were not available for use in the ONTT, and therefore we are now able to evaluate visual impairment with greater sensitivity following ON. Once primarily ophthalmological causes of monocular vision loss (i.e. CRAO, CRVO, uveitis, glaucoma, retinal pathology, trauma, or corneal pathology) have been ruled out, the differential diagnosis of optic neuropathy, of which optic neuritis is a cause, can be broad. Vascular, inflammatory/autoimmune, infectious, neoplastic, and metabolic causes are considerations. A clinician should further narrow the diagnosis based on the timing of symptoms and associated features (Below). Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), arteritic or nonarteritic Older patients, sudden onset, lack of pain, severe vision loss with prolonged/limited recovery, hemorrhages present, altitudinal defect; see vasculitides below if arteritic Vasculitides (polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, temporal arteritis) Check ANCA, ESR, CRP; generally vascular presentation (acute onset) Temporal arteritis generally associated with Arteritic ION Systemic lupus erhythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome Check ANA, cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies Painful, acute to subacute vision loss associated with red desaturation Painful, acute to subacute vision loss associated with red desaturation Can be associated with other signs of intraocular/intraorbital inflammation (anterior uveitis, dry eye, other cranial neuropathies, glaucoma, optic nerve sheath enhancement) Painless vision loss, optic disc edema, Anti-CRMP5 (CV-2) antibodies CRION (chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy) Granulomatous inflammation, generally responsive to steroids, can be bilateral, painful Acute viral infections (EBV, HSV, VZV, West Nile Virus, CMV) Optic nerve sheath meningioma, but can have paraclinoid or sphenoid wing meningiomas causing compression Progressive vision loss over >10-14 days, young men Usually presents in childhood, bilateral and symmetric optic atrophy Associated nausea, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, usually bilateral Longstanding tobacco and alcohol dependence, generally bilateral, may be related to nutritional deficiencies Insidious, slowly progressive visual loss, with prolonged disc swelling Slowly progressive vision loss, 6-24 months after radiation therapy What is an appropriate diagnostic evaluation for secondary causes of unilateral optic neuritis? When a patient presents with unilateral acute optic neuritis, one should obtain a brain MRI with and without gadolinium contrast in order to evaluate for other signs of central nervous system demyelinating disease, specifically multiple sclerosis. Spinal cord MRI can also be considered to evaluate for subclinical spinal cord lesions, or to investigate further if a history suggestive of myelitis is reported. Laboratory evaluation could include testing for the previously mentioned differential diagnosis of ON: HIV, RPR, ACE, ESR, CRP, aquaporin-4 antibody, Bartonella testing, ANA, ENA, and Lyme testing.4 Testing should be expanded depending on relevant history and findings, as outlined in the table of differential diagnostic considerations above. In the appropriate clinical setting (i.e. when MS, NMOSD, neurosarcoidosis, or CNS infections are suspected), evaluation could include lumbar puncture for assessment of CNS oligoclonal bands, pleocytosis, elevated protein, and/or specific infectious studies. At the Mellen Center, we typically do not perform an extensive evaluation for typical demyelinating optic neuritis, unless a patient’s history or examination is suggestive of other potential etiologies. Atypical features, including lack of eye pain, systemic symptoms, atypical fundus findings, and bilateral disease, generally prompt a more extensive evaluation. How should this evaluation change if the optic neuritis is bilateral? More extensive evaluation is warranted if ON is bilateral, and this should include toxic/metabolic causes as outlined in the Table above. Bilateral optic neuritis can be a presenting symptom of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) syndrome, sarcoidosis, paraneoplastic optic neuropathy (CRMP-5), infections, and chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION). If a patient has bilateral optic neuritis and aquaporin-4 antibody testing is negative, anti-MOG antibody testing should be completed at the Mayo Clinic Laboratory. However, seronegative NMOSD is a possibility and should be considered in the appropriate clinical context, particularly in the setting of severe vision loss with poor recovery.10 If symptoms worsen following a steroid taper, sarcoidosis should be more strongly considered, and chest CT should be completed to evaluate for hilarlymphadenopathy. If paraneoplastic or metastatic disease is suspected, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be completed, and a serum paraneoplastic antibody evaluation should be performed via the Mayo Clinic Laboratory to test for the presence of CRMP-5 antibodies. How should this evaluation change if the optic neuritis is recurrent? Optic neuritis can be recurrent, and potential causes include NMOSD, anti-MOG syndrome, CRION, and sarcoidosis. Therefore, the evaluation for recurrent ON is similar to that of bilateral ON. In any patient with unilateral ON, we generally test for aquaporin-4 antibodies. If this is negative and recurrent ON occurs, aquaporin-4 antibody testing can be repeated in 6 months, as this positive result would change management. Another consideration is anti-MOG syndrome, an increasingly recognized cause of optic neuritis. When a patient presents with acute inflammatory ON, treatment includes possible methylprednisolone, 1000mg IV daily for 3-5 days, followed by prednisone taper (60mg for 4 days, 40mg daily for 4 days, then 20mg daily for 4 days). However, a clinician may opt to defer steroids based upon the patient’s clinical characteristics. In the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), visual recovery was faster in patients receiving IV methylprednisolone compared to those receiving placebo or oral prednisone. However, long-term visual outcomes were not significantly different between these groups. If a patient has visual acuity worse than 20/40, use of IV methylprednisolone followed by a prednisone taper is recommended. If visual acuity is better than 20/40, treatment with IV methylprednisolone should be considered if a patient has baseline visual impairment in the fellow eye, severe pain, scotoma, or an occupation that demands visual precision.13 If a patient’s brain MRI demonstrates gadolinium enhancing lesions, the impetus to treat with IV methylprednisolone is higher. What is the prognosis for recovery of vision after optic neuritis? Following an episode of typical ON, patients can be followed using several clinical and imaging modalities to monitor recovery. Visual acuity tends to recover over a period of weeks, and begins 2-4 weeks after onset.1 Monitoring of RNFL and GCL thinning following an episode of ON generally reveals RNFL thinning as early as 4 weeks, but up to 6 months after the clinical episode. The prognosis for subjective visual recovery after acute demyelinating optic neuritis due to MS is generally good, and recovery begins within 2 to 4 weeks. However, objective evidence including low contrast letter acuity and OCT measures demonstrate longstanding evidence of damage following each ON episode.6 Optic neuritis due to other etiologies (infectious and inflammatory (including NMOSD)) is variable. If a patient does not meet criteria for MS or NMOSD at the time of optic neuritis and no other causes are found, what is the appropriate monitoring and treatment strategy? Following an episode of typical optic neuritis, as reported in the ONTT, 35% of patients developed recurrent ON at ten-year follow-up. This recurrence was more common in patients with abnormal brain MRI. The risk of MS was higher for patients who had brain MRI lesions typical for MS at baseline, and generally lower for males, normal brain MRI at ON presentation, optic disc swelling, and atypical clinical features of ON. Given this risk of developing MS or other neuro-inflammatory disorders following ON, brain MRI should be repeated in 6 months, then after 1 year, to evaluate for the development of lesions that could indicate the development of MS via dissemination in time following a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Patients should be followed clinically for development of new neurological symptoms that could be consistent with a demyelinating event. If a patient is diagnosed with CIS at the time of optic neuritis typical for MS, with risk of MS development, a decision should be made whether initiation of disease modifying therapy is warranted. It is established that MS disease modifying therapies reduce the risk of MS development following a clinically isolated syndrome.17 Such a decision is based upon characteristics of an individual patient, including presence of brain MRI lesions. If a patient has recurrent optic neuritis not meeting MS or NMOSD criteria, what is the appropriate management strategy? If a patient has recurrent optic neuritis, an underlying cause cannot be identified, and steroid responsiveness is apparent, the diagnosis of CRION should be considered. CRION refers to a relapsing form of optic neuritis characterized by inflammation. Patients with CRION tend to have recurrent ON upon steroid withdrawal, so chronic immunosuppression is generally advised with medications including azathioprine, methotrexate, or IVIG. Another consideration in recurrent ON is anti-MOG syndrome, an increasingly recognized etiology of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including optic neuritis. Commercial testing for anti-MOG antibodies is available, and could be conducted if aquaporin-4 antibody testing is negative. The management of anti-MOG syndrome is thought to be similar to that of NMOSD. If a patient with known multiple sclerosis presents with monocular vision loss, what etiologies should be considered? Although optic neuritis is more common earlier in the course of MS, patients with MS can have optic neuritis at any point in their disease. The diagnosis of ON should therefore be considered in an MS patient who reports monocular vision loss, but other etiologies should be considered as well. Such diagnoses include temporal arteritis and ischemic optic neuropathy, which can be seen in older patients; these possible etiologies warrant emergent ophthalmological evaluation in a patient with sudden onset vision loss, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, or new onset headaches. If the patient reports halos, ophthalmology evaluation is warranted to rule out uveitis, which can be associated with MS. Patients with MS who are on disease modifying therapies may also experience vision issues related to these medications. Specifically, patients on fingolimod are at risk for macular edema and can present with blurry or wavy central vision. Patients on natalizumab who are JC virus antibody-positive and therefore at risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can present with hemianopsia that they may perceive as monocular vision loss. Migraines are also common in patients with MS, and visual aura can often be misinterpreted as optic neuritis by patients. If a patient had previous optic neuritis and reports recurrence of symptoms that are not as severe as their initial episode, a pseudoexacerbation should be considered and the patient should be evaluated for infection. Additionally, patients with prior ON can experience Uhthoff’s phenomenon, with worsening of visual function associated with heat. Graves J and Balcer LJ.

0edc0e4a-c422-47de-915a-4b21a07a5ae6,"An Update of Current Cannabis-Based Pharmaceuticals in Pain Medicine An Update of Current Cannabis-Based Pharmaceuticals in Pain Medicine   , , –() Cannabis users have long reported therapeutic properties of the plant for a variety of conditions, some of which include nausea, emesis, seizures, cancer, neurogenic diseases and pain control. Research has elucidated many cannabinoid pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, expanding the potential use of cannabinoids as a medical therapy. Due to the inconsistent delivery and control of the active components involved with smoking, pharmaceutical companies are investigating and prioritizing routes other than smoke inhalation for therapeutic use of cannabinoids. In this relatively new field of pharmaceutical development, ongoing drug development promises great benefit from targeted endocannabinoid receptor agonism. Available in Canada and Europe, nabiximols, a specific extract from the plant, has demonstrated great benefit in the treatment of pain related to spasticity in multiple sclerosis, cancer and otherwise chronic pain conditions. The cannabidiol oral solution Epidiolex®, which is available in the USA, is indicated for management of refractory epilepsy but may offer therapeutic relief to chronic pain conditions as well. Current investigative drugs, such as those developed by Cara Therapeutics and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, are synthetic cannabinoids which show promise to specifically target neuropsychiatric conditions and chronic pain symptoms such as neuropathy and allodynia. The objective of this review is to provide clinicians with an update of currently available and promising developmental cannabis pharmaceutical derivatives which may stand to greatly benefit patients with otherwise difficult-to-treat chronic conditions. With the progressive worldwide liberalization of cannabis and its pharmaceutical derivatives for medicinal use, healthcare providers’ understanding of cannabis efficacy continues to evolve concomitantly. The effects of cannabis and its synthetic variants are due to the presence of cannabinoids, the biologically active components, in the plants and their interaction with cannabinoid receptors. Cannabis is most commonly obtained, both for recreational and medical purposes, from the and plants (family: Cannabaceae). Both of these plants contain the two most prominent ligands at cannabinoid receptors, namely, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), but it is believed the proportion of cannabinoid composition differs between these plants [, ]. THC and CBD are also the most prominent ligands for the therapeutic use of cannabis []. There are two isotypes of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, CB1 and CB2. These isoforms of cannabinoid receptors can be found throughout the human body in various organs and tissues []. THC is most often associated with the psychotropic effects of cannabis, and CBD, which lacks these psychotropic effects, is associated more with anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic and anti-emetic effects, as well as other effects [,,,]. In general, it is believed that tends to carry a higher proportion of CBD and that has a higher proportion of THC, although the proportions of THC to CBD have been noted to vary markedly []. Consumption of cannabis can be achieved through a variety of modalities, but the most traditional and common route of consumption is via smoke inhalation. When inhaled as a smoke, the components of cannabis are absorbed in the endothelial lining of the alveoli of the lungs and delivered to the central nervous system []. However, the amount of active compounds absorbed through smoke inhalation is highly dependent on the smoking dynamics of the individual user. Consequently, the ability to control or dose cannabinoid delivery via smoke inhalation is problematic []. As a result of the variable distribution and control of active components involved with smoking, pharmaceutical companies are investigating and prioritizing routes other than smoke inhalation for the therapeutic use of cannabinoids. Cannabis users have long reported therapeutic properties of the plant for a variety of conditions, some of which include the treatment of nausea, emesis, seizures, cancer, neurogenic diseases and pain control []. Research has elucidated many cannabinoid pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, expanding its potential use as a medical therapy []. To date, three cannabinoid drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. One of these is Epidiolex® (GW Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, UK), which is also the only plant-derived cannabinoid currently approved in the USA. Epidiolex® is a CBD extract that is used to treat epileptic disorders. GW pharmaceuticals also produces the drug nabiximols (Sativex®), which is a marijuana extract currently approved in the UK to treat neuropathic pain, pain due to spasticity, overactive bladder and other symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). GW Pharmaceuticals is currently planning to conduct phase three trials for nabiximols in the USA. However, the intersection of cannabis safety, efficacy and therapeutic use with changing public attitudes means that the medical community is entering an unknown era of medical cannabis use. And while there are concerns over the relatively unknown long-term consequences of cannabis use, its use in medical management is surely to continue. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors. Nabiximols (Sativex®) is an oromucosal cannabinoid spray approved in Canada and many European countries for use as add-on therapy to reduce spasticity in patients with MS []. It contains a 1:1 ratio of THC:CBD; the THC component acts as a partial agonist of the CB1 and CB2 receptors, while the CBD component acts as an antagonist of these receptors []. This addition of CBD to THC has been shown to potentiate the beneficial effects of THC while attenuating some of its adverse effects, and may even reduce the risk of dependence [,,]. Each spray delivers a dose of 2.7 mg of THC and 2.5 mg of CBD and is to be administered to the buccal mucosa. Patients with MS use a median of eight sprays per day, and it is recommended that the daily dose not exceed 12 sprays []. It has been shown that nabiximols is effective at reducing patient-reported MS-related spasticity (MSS) and that it can provide other beneficial effects, such as sleep improvement and reduced urinary incontinence [, , ]. A 2014 study by Yadav et al. reported nabiximols to be effective as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for controlling the symptoms of MSS []. Because of its efficacy on MSS, nabiximols is further under investigation for use in treating other sources of spasticity, such as that in post stroke syndrome []. In addition to controlling the spasticity associated with MS, nabiximols has also been shown to reduce MS-related pain. In a monocentric study by Ferre et al., MS patients taking nabiximols reported a significantly lower pain level on the pain numeric rating scale (NRS) at 4 weeks of treatment, which continued to drop after 14 weeks of treatment []. Two-thirds of the patients in this study achieved ≥ 20% reduction on the Scripps Neurologic Rating Scale after 4 weeks of therapy, although the investigators did note that they could not exclude the possibility that this reduction in pain was due to a reduction in spasticity. A double-blind randomized study by Langford et al. on this subject showed mixed results []. One phase of the study showed no significant difference between patients receiving the THC/CBD oromucosal spray and those on placebo, while the other phase found a better response rate on those using the active drug, with a significant change in the pain NRS score favoring the THC/CBD arm. These investigators suggested that because their patient population had long-standing pain (mean > 5 years), they may represent an especially treatment-resistant group, and they also noted that those with a shorter history of neuropathic pain (< 4 years) appeared to respond better []. Given the apparent efficacy of nabiximols in treating MSS and MS-related pain, nabiximols has also been studied to determine its effects on other etiologies of chronic pain, such as cancer-related chronic pain, which occurs in up to 90% of those with advanced disease []. Opioids are a mainstay of treatment for pain in these patients, and alternative therapies are widely sought after to avoid drug-related adverse effects associated with long-term opioid use or pain refractory to opioid therapy. Animal models have shown that cannabinoid receptor agonists can act synergistically with opioids in chronic pain models, leading to THC becoming a subject of interest in the management of these patients []. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of nabiximols by Lichtman et al. sought to determine whether nabiximols could serve as effective add-on therapy for the management of chronic pain in cancer patients, with their primary endpoint being improvement in daily pain. These investigators found a nonsignificant improvement in daily pain NRS scores in patients receiving nabiximols compared to those on placebo []. Despite this, the study did find improvement in some of their secondary endpoints, including improvement in sleep disruption and higher scores on the Patient Satisfaction, Subject Global Impression of Change and Physician Global Impression of Change questionnaires. Interestingly, the study also found that its US participants demonstrated greater improvement on nabiximols than did participants from outside the USA. It was postulated that this difference may have been due to the US participants being on an average of a > 25% lower opioid dose than non-US participants, resulting in a reduced downregulation of opioid receptors in the US participants and, subsequently, in a greater synergism between opioid and cannabinoid receptors []. Other studies of nabiximols for the treatment of cancer-related pain have also failed to find significant improvement in baseline pain scores [, ]. However, in the study by Portenoy et al., the secondary endpoint (comparing proportion of responders in the active drug arm vs. placebo arm) did demonstrate that nabiximols had an improved analgesic effect in patients on low- and medium-dose therapy (defined as 1–4 sprays per day and 6–10 sprays per day, respectively). The low-dose nabiximols group in this study demonstrated the greatest analgesic effect, with a 26% improvement in pain compared to baseline, while the high-dose group (defined as 11–16 sprays per day) did not demonstrate significant analgesic effects and was found to have poor tolerability []. A common finding in these aforementioned studies is that nabiximols therapy tends to improve sleep in patients with chronic cancer-related pain, suggesting that even if nabiximols does not greatly improve pain scores, it may still provide benefit to patients with chronic pain who experience sleep disturbances [, , ]. The authors of a recent review concluded that there is modest evidence for the benefit of nabiximols in the treatment of chronic pain and suggested that the decision to add this therapy be a discussion between patient and provider when first- and second-line therapy has failed []. Overall, nabiximols appears to have some benefit for patients experiencing chronic cancer-related pain, including mild pain improvement and improved sleep. Sample sizes in the studies currently available tend to be small, so further investigation is required to determine whether the relatively small improvements on the pain scale ratings are significant on a wider scale. The use of THC/CBD oromucosal spray has also been considered as treatment for non-cancer-related chronic pain conditions, such as chronic neuropathic pain due to dysfunction or lesion of nerves or spinal cord, inflammation caused by various arthritic conditions and migraine headaches. A study published in 2007 by Nurmikko et al. showed promising results to this end, reporting effective relief of peripheral neuropathic pain when nabiximols was given as an add-on to existing therapy []. This study showed that 26% of patients receiving nabiximols therapy experienced a > 30% improvement of pain on the NRS scores. Sleep and allodynia were also both significantly improved on nabiximols therapy []. Subsequent studies have been less conclusive about the positive effects of nabiximols on the management of chronic non-cancer pain, but still reported improved analgesic effects. A 2016 review by Rapid et al. concluded that there is evidence for improved analgesia in THC:CBD oromucosal spray, but long-term effects still need further investigation []. These authors note that the evidence is based on moderate-quality studies and recommend that caution be exercised when making decisions about its use in the clinical setting. Other ongoing subjects of investigation include the efficacy of nabiximols in pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) by Blake et al., investigators demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pain and quality of sleep with the use of nabiximols in patients with RA compared to placebo []. These authors note that the suppression of the Disease Activity Score-28 for Rheumatoid Arthritis (DAS28), a measure of inflammation in RA, demonstrates the known effect of THC/CBD in attenuating inflammation. They also explain that the effect of nabiximols on their primary endpoint, the suppression of pain on movement, shows its usefulness in providing peripheral analgesia []. In this way, nabiximols can help control RA through two different mechanisms. In another study by Blake et al. aimed at determining the effects of nabiximols on chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, improvements in pain were observed in patients on the active drug versus those on placebo []. Although the power of the study was low and the results not statistically significant, many patients in the study did experience clinically significant improvement in their pain which the authors suggest warrants further investigation with a larger sample size. The authors of a recent review concluded that there is evidence for a potential role of nabiximols in the management of chronic pain and noted that its classification as a Schedule 1 drug has made investigation difficult []. Further studies are required to establish the efficacy and safety guidelines, but with its relatively safe side effect profile, nabiximols shows promise as adjunctive therapy for patients refractory to other methods of pain management. The safety and long-term efficacy of nabiximols have also been a subject of investigation. In general, nabiximols has demonstrated a mild side effect profile. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse effects include dizziness, confusion, dry mouth, headache and fatigue [, , , ]. Most adverse effects have been considered to be mild/moderate in severity, and they are often transient effects that occur during the titration period. It is important to note, however, that cannabis use has less commonly been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric side effects, especially the development of schizophrenia []. To examine the safety and efficacy of Sativex® over a longer period of time, Serpell et al. followed patients who had participated in a 6-week parent RCT and agreed to take part in an extension study []. The patients in this study continued Sativex® treatment for a mean duration of 334 days, with 59 patients (40% of the original study population) continuing treatment for > 1 year. The investigators found that treatment with nabiximols during this time frame was not associated with increased incidence of adverse effects and that the therapeutic benefit was maintained without the need for an increased dose []. Another study by Johnson et al. that also examined the long-term efficacy of THC/CBD spray had a shorter median duration of treatment (25 days), but it followed several subjects for > 1 year and reported similar results of continued efficacy with a steady or decreasing incidence of adverse effects []. Overall, considering that nabiximols may provide therapeutic benefit to patients whose pain is poorly controlled by conventional means, and given its generally favorable side effect profile, it has been suggested that nabiximols be considered for use as a third-line agent following poor responsiveness to other regimens []. For patients who achieve suboptimal pain control through first-line agents (antidepressants and anticonvulsants) and second-line agents (opioid products), THC/CBD may be a consideration as an additional therapy to provide relief of chronic pain. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a white to pale-yellow crystalline solid purified from the plant. It is the second-most abundant cannabinoid found in this species, behind THC, and is non-psychoactive agent. While it is considered to be a Schedule I controlled substance by the US Drug Enforcement Administration, it is available for over-the-counter purchase at cannabis dispensaries throughout the USA. In an anonymous, voluntary survey of self-reported CBD users, 62% of responders indicated that they use it to treat a medical condition rather than general well-being []. The top conditions for which CBD was used in this cohort were chronic pain, anxiety and depression, with 36% of these users reporting CBD alone was an efficacious intervention in symptom reduction. Under the brand name Epidiolex®, it is prepared as a liquid solution at a concentration of 100 mg/mL CBD for oral intake. The common adverse reactions (those reported by ≥ 10% of users) include somnolence, diarrhea, fatigue, decreased appetite and elevated transaminases. Due to potential hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to monitor transaminase levels and consider reducing doses of Epidiolex® in patients on other agents associated with hepatocellular injury []. Babalonis et al. demonstrated that the use of CBD, when compared to smoked marijuana, was associated with virtually no signals of abuse-related effects when administered in therapeutic doses []. There is significant debate on the specific route by which CBD elicits analgesia. While originally thought to function through indirect agonism of supraspinal CB1 and CB2, CBD has since been demonstrated to have direct agonistic activity on many cell-surface receptors, including the serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT), the adenosine A2 receptor and the peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma (PPAR-γ) receptor, all of which are associated with anti-inflammatory pathways []. Recent literature has pointed towards the latter as the analgesic pathway of CBD. In a study by Ward et al., CBD was shown to reduce pain in rats with chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CIPN) []. The administration of 5.0 mg/kg CBD prior to paclitaxel therapy significantly reduced the development of thermal and mechanical sensitivity, an effect that was found to be reversible through the administration of WAY100635, a 5-HT receptor antagonist. In contrast, the addition of CB1 or CB2 antagonists resulted in no reduction in this analgesic effect. The authors concluded that CBD’s mechanism of producing analgesia is related to serotonergic agonism in the rostroventral medulla and that that this action is most likely extrinsic to the cannabinoid receptor pathway []. A separate study by Rodriguez-Munoz et al. suggests that supraspinal analgesia is achieved through indirect antagonism of -methyl--aspartate acid receptors (NMDAR), resulting in potentiation of opioid analgesic activity []. CBD avidly inhibits sigma 1 receptors (σ1R), which, when antagonized, inhibit G-protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPCR55) activation of NMDAR. In another study, the administration of CBD 10 min prior to treatment with opioids resulted in 83.4% of the maximum analgesic effect, compared to 57.8% in the control group receiving opioids alone. These effects were almost completely reversed with administration of a σ1R agonist, suggesting σ1R to be a significant target for CBD []. Multiple studies have analyzed the effects of CBD in rats with osteoarthritis (OA) induced by joint injections of monoiodoacetate (MIA). OA is associated with increased rates of movement-associated depolarization of joint afferent fibers. This phenomenon has been re-created successfully with MIA injection, with the subsequent administration of low-dose CBD found to significantly decrease afferent firing and raise pain thresholds in mice with OA. Phillpott et al. suggested that CBD desensitizes the joint afferent fibers responsible for mechanosensitive nociception []. This study also showed that CBD treatment of MIA-injected joints attenuated the future development of tactile pain, suggesting a prophylactic role in the progression of OA []. One of the well-documented targets of CBD is the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRP) superfamily, the members of which are receptors found in nociceptive fibers. TRPA1 is a specific member of this family that is found on nociceptors that produce calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP), a potent vasodilator and pro-inflammatory agent. It has been demonstrated that TRPA1 plays a central role in the development of OA, as TRPA1 knockout mice show no response to the administration of MIA, failing to develop joint pain or cartilage damage. Furthermore, wild-type mice treated with a direct TRPA1 inhibitor do not develop characteristic OA symptoms after MIA exposure []. A study by Hammel et al. analyzed the effects of CBD on inflammatory markers associated with OA in mice, including CGRP and OX42 (a marker associated with microglial activation) []. Pretreatment with transdermal CBD resulted in reduced immunohistologic staining of both markers in spinal cord tissue. With previous studies illustrating the role of TRPA1 in the pathogenesis of OA, Hamel et al. hypothesized that CBD’s agonist role results in activation–desensitization of these receptors, decreasing the peripheral inflammatory response to noxious stimuli []. In a separate study, Hongbo et al. simulated traumatic spinal injuries in mice, finding that CBD treatment following such injuries reduced CD4 T-cell counts and associated inflammatory marker concentrations in spinal tissue []. These rats had significantly decreased thermal sensitivity when compared to the control rats, suggesting an additional route through which CBD quells the immune response following noxious insult []. While still not completely understood, the central and peripheral analgesic effects of CBD have been documented. Its modulation of various supraspinal pathways is thought to be responsible for both the inhibition of descending pain fibers as well as the attenuation of opioid-induced analgesia. Peripherally, CBD actively inhibits pathways responsible for neurogenic inflammation in response to nociceptor activation. While there is a large collection of evidence from animal models, the analgesic effects of CBD have not been studied extensively in humans. One randomized, cross-over pilot study by Lynch et al. showed promising results for the use of an oral spray containing CBD and other cannabinoids in the management of CIPN []. Using a 0- to 10-point NRS for pain intensity (NRS-PI), these investigators found that active treatment with this oral spray resulted in a statistically significant 2.6 point drop in mean NRS-PI score, compared to the 0.6 drop in the placebo group ( = 0.001). The needed number to treat (NNT) is a metric used to compare analgesic effects in a wide range of medications, with tricyclic antidepressants and opioids having the lowest NNT in treating neuropathic pain (2.1 and 2.6, respectively). The oral spray used in this study was found to have a NNT of 5.0, which is comparable to many routine agents used in treating neuropathic pain, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (NNT 5.0) and gabapentin (NNT 6.4) []. Further studies are required to assess the efficacy of CBD in the management of neuropathic pain associated with a variety of conditions. Over 30% of patients with OA have associated neuropathic pain, and CBD appears to have both acute analgesic and prophylactic properties against disease progression []. Cannabinoid compound CR701 is a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist being investigated by Cara Therapeutics (Stamford, CT, USA). Research has already established cannabinoid receptors as potential targets to manage various conditions, some of which include chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, inflammation and pain [, ]. Specifically, Cara Therapeutics is investigating the potential of CR-701 to treat neuropathic pain and its ability to decrease hyperalgesia, a process by which nerve endings are hypersensitized to stimulation, and allodynia, which is the sensation of pain from innocuous stimulation []. By restricting its agonistic effects to peripherally located cannabinoid receptors, namely, the CB2 receptors, and by avoiding interaction at the CB1 receptors located in the central nervous system, CR701 may offer a therapeutic option that utilizes the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties of CB2 without any psychotropic side effects [, ]. Preliminary studies of the drug have shown that when administered in oral form, there was a substantial decrease in hyperalgesia and allodynia in a rat model, determined by animal response to thermal and tactile stimuli []. Likewise, other studies, such as that of Malan et al., suggest synthetic cannabinoid agonists may act synergistically with both opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) in controlling pain, thus potentiating use of smaller opioid and NSAID doses and avoiding adverse side effects associated with their use []. Studies aimed at highlighting the safety profile of cannabinoid receptor agonists found that detrimental side effects, of which the most prominent are catalepsy and hypothermia, were only present at supratherapeutic doses of > 3 mg/kg body weight, a dose which was found to be the therapeutic dose []. Additionally, studies by Mingyue Zang et al. found that cannabinoids carry the advantage of no found risk of dependence or tolerance, similar to that found in opiate use []. Treatment for neuropathic pain is plagued by inconsistent efficacy and traditional treatments beset with unfavorable side effect profiles. CR701 may not only offer stand-alone therapeutic benefits in controlling the inflammation, nociception, hyperalgesia and allodynia associated with various conditions, but may also be associated with the added benefit of potential synergistic action with several other pre-existing treatment options [, , , ]. These unique properties of CR701 may decrease the necessary dose of traditionally used neuropathic pain medications and subsequently decrease the likelihood of adverse side effects []. Although CR701 is still in the preclinical development stage, progress in the preliminary data will be met with both excitement and hopefulness. If the results of continued studies on the efficacy and safety of CR701 replicate those of preliminary studies, there is reason to believe that CR701 may become a suitable option for therapeutic treatment of neuropathic pain. ZYN002 (Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Devon, PA, USA), a pharmaceutically-produced CBD, is being promoted as a therapeutic option for various neuropsychiatric disorders. The company highlights ZYN002 as being the first and only permeance-enhanced synthetic CBD gel in use for disorders such as fragile X syndrome, adult refractory focal epilepsy and developmental and epileptic encephalopathies []. Oral administration of CBD is associated with several pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues, including first pass metabolism, varying serum levels, and low levels of bioavailability []. When applied by gel, ZYN002 is able to deliver increased consistency in plasma levels of CBD, avoid first pass metabolism and increase the bioavailability of active compounds [, ]. Additionally, when in the presence of high acidity, CBD has been shown to degrade into THC, a compound that can impose unwanted psychoactive effects, some of which include anxiety and altered conscious perception []. By eliminating contact of CBD with a high acidity environment like that found in the stomach, a gel form of CBD diminishes the potential of having those unwanted psychotropic effects and thus decreases any potential compounding of pre-existing neuropsychiatric disorders, all the while maintaining higher levels of active CBD in the system [, ]. Zynerba Pharmaceuticals tested their permeance-enhanced gel over the course of a 12-month trial, named the STAR 2 trial, and reported that there was a clinically relevant reduction in the frequency of focal seizures with use of both the 195 mg and 390 mg transdermal gel []. Longer term use of the drug was also found to increase the anti-epileptic effects of the drug, and the drug was found to be well tolerated over the 12-month trial []. Cannabinoids have long been anecdotally touted as effective anti-epileptic remedies, although it has only been relatively recent that the mechanisms of their anti-epileptic properties have become somewhat elucidated. Several studies have found that CBD, more so than THC, may act as a neuromodulator at CB1 receptors located at the presynaptic terminal, which controls the influx of G-protein voltage-gated calcium channels and enhances pre-synaptic potassium conduction [, ]. Action at these particular receptors may play a pivotal role in the neuromodulation of neuronal activity. Prior studies have shown that upregulation of CB1 receptors, together with agonistic activity at CB1 receptors, may have strong anti-epileptic activity [, ]. CBD has also been shown to decrease the breakdown of anandamide, a neurotransmitter, an action which appears also to have protective effects against epilepsy [, ] Overall, the totality of the effects of CBD on seizure and epileptic conditions is still unknown. However, as political and social attitudes on cannabis and synthetic cannabis changes, further research is surely to reveal further mechanisms and effects. With the relatively new wave of cannabis products now available, Zynerba Pharmaceutical’s novel transdermal gel may improve upon more traditional methods of cannabis administration. Likewise, by working on a synthetic cannabinoid, methods of processing, production and quality may be enhanced upon from conventional cannabis plant extracts []. It is Zynerba Pharmaceuticals hope to improve on the class of synthetic cannabinoids through their innovative route of administration and their production processes. Further studies investigating the efficacy and safety of ZYN002 will need to be published, but if shown to be as efficacious and safe as the preliminary studies seem to suggest, ZYN002 has the potential to be a breakthrough treatment option for various neuropsychiatric disorders. With the shift in legislature in the USA and other countries towards an acceptance of the medicinal use of cannabis, further research has granted us a better understanding of how cannabis may provide therapeutic benefit to patients. Moreover, delineation of the molecular mechanisms by which these benefits are achieved has led to the ongoing development of pharmaceutical derivatives of cannabis which may offer targeted therapeutic benefit without associated adverse effects. Epidiolex® is one such compound, currently available in the USA, which excludes the psychotropic effects of cannabis use via isolation of CBD from the cannabis plant. In this relatively new field of pharmaceutical development, ongoing drug development promises benefit from an approach of targeted endocannabinoid receptor agonism for the management of chronic pain conditions. Despite this, the overall quality and clinical significance of available evidence are limited; thus it is difficult to offer a strong recommendation in favor of the routine clinical use of cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals until further clinical trials are performed.

05d271c4-abe8-434d-80e9-8c8f5ab5e14f,"— — Neuralgia is a stabbing, burning, and often severe pain due to an irritated or damaged nerve. The nerve may be anywhere in the body, and the damage may be caused by several things, including: Treatment for the pain of neuralgia depends on the cause. This type of neuralgia occurs as a complication of shingles and may be anywhere on the body. is a viral infection characterized by a painful rash and blisters. Neuralgia can occur wherever the outbreak of shingles was. The pain can be mild or severe and persistent or intermittent. It can also last for months or years. In some cases, the pain may occur before the rash. It will always occur along the path of a nerve, so it’s usually isolated to one side of the body. This type of neuralgia is associated with pain from the trigeminal nerve, which travels from the brain and branches to different parts of the face. The pain can be caused by a blood vessel pressing down on the nerve where it meets with the brainstem. It can also be caused by , injury to the nerve, or other causes. Trigeminal neuralgia causes severe, recurrent pain in the face, usually on one side. It’s most common in people who are older than 50 years. Pain from the glossopharyngeal nerve, which is in the throat, is not very common. This type of neuralgia produces pain in the neck and throat. The cause of some types of nerve pain is not completely understood. You may feel nerve pain from damage or injury to a nerve, pressure on a nerve, or changes in the way the nerves function. The cause may also be unknown. An infection can affect your nerves. For example, the cause of postherpetic neuralgia is , an infection caused by the virus. The likelihood of having this infection increases with age. An infection in a specific part of the body may also affect a nearby nerve. For example, if you have an infection in a tooth, it may affect the nerve and cause pain. (MS) is a disease caused by the deterioration of myelin, the covering of nerves. Trigeminal neuralgia may occur in someone with MS. Pressure or compression of nerves may cause neuralgia. The pressure may come from a: The pressure of a swollen blood vessel is a common cause of trigeminal neuralgia. Many people with have problems with their nerves, including neuralgia. The excess glucose in the bloodstream may damage nerves. This damage is most common in the hands, arms, feet, and legs. If the cause of neuralgia isn’t infection, MS, diabetes, or pressure on the nerves, it may be from one of many less-common factors. These include: fluoroquinolone antibiotics, used to treat some infections The pain of neuralgia is usually severe and sometimes debilitating. If you have it, you should see your doctor as soon as possible. If you don’t already have a provider, our can help you connect to physicians in your area. You should also see your doctor if you suspect you have shingles. Besides neuralgia, shingles also causes a red, blistering . It’s usually on the back or the abdomen, but it may also be on the neck and face. Shingles should be treated as soon as possible to prevent complications. These can include , which can cause debilitating and lifelong pain. When you see your doctor for neuralgia, you can expect to be asked a series of questions about your symptoms. Your doctor will want you to describe the pain and to tell them how long the pain has been a problem. You will also need to inform them of any medications you take and any other medical issues you have. This is because neuralgia may be a symptom of another disorder, such as diabetes, MS, or shingles. Your doctor will also perform a physical exam to pinpoint the location of the pain and the nerve that’s causing it, if possible. You may also need to have a dental exam. For example, if the pain is in your face, your doctor may want to rule out other possible dental causes, such as an abscess. To find an underlying cause of your pain, your doctor may order certain tests. You may need to have blood drawn to check your blood sugar levels and kidney function. A can help your doctor determine if you have MS. A test can determine nerve damage. It shows how fast signals are moving through your nerves. If your doctor can pinpoint the cause of your neuralgia, your treatment will focus on treating the underlying cause. If the cause is not found, treatment will focus on relieving your pain. better control of blood sugar levels in people with diabetes-caused neuralgia nerve block, which is an injection directed at a particular nerve or nerve group and that is intended to “turn off” pain signals and reduce inflammation such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline, which are effective in treating nerve pain such as carbamazepine, which is effective for trigeminal neuralgia short-term narcotic pain medications, such as codeine There is no cure for neuralgia, but treatment can help improve your symptoms. Some types of neuralgia improve over time. More research is being done to develop better treatments for neuralgia. — — With neuropathic pain, the body sends pain signals to your brain unprompted.

34a39146-9f66-4ade-a2e7-fb73e1590bdb,"Are you sure your patient has demyelinating disease? What are the typical findings for this disease? Demyelinating diseases are a class of related disorders in which the immune system, both B- and T-cells, inappropriately targets myelinated neurons and resulting in damage to the myelin sheath around neurons, injury to the glial cells supporting the myelin, and even the neurons themselves can also be damaged or even killed in the most severe manifestations of the disease. As a whole, these diseases are sporadic, generally acute or sub-acute in onset and in their fulminant presentation their symptoms are readily correlated with neuroimaging of the affected central nervous system tissue which will usually reveal evident white matter lesions. These diseases can be treated with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and eventually degrade the autoimmune response; chronic manifestations of these diseases have many emerging therapies but the mainstay of treatment is immune suppression. In general, the following symptoms are shared to varying degrees across all demyelinating diseases but all symptoms may not be present in a given patient at the same time: Reduced visual acuity or blindness in the affected eye(s) Often, multiple neurological deficits will be present initially. Clinical examination, radiological findings, and serial follow-up are typically needed to differentiate between specific sub-types of these demyelinating diseases as discussed below. Taxonomy and Descriptions of Demyelinating Diseases The initial presentation of a demyelinating disease entity, without encephalopathy and devoid of findings specific to variants (see below) is termed a “clinically isolated syndrome.” The presence of encephalopathy is required for a diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM.) A child with multiple sclerosis, or a clinically isolated syndrome, often will present with solitary or multiple neurological findings, and based on retrospective studies these findings would typically include some combination of weakness, sensory changes, visual changes, and/or cerebellar findings. Demyelinating diseases of the nervous system in children includes multiple sclerosis (“MS”) and its various progressions and variants, including the following: Balo’s concentric sclerosis is a rare multiple sclerosis variant notable for the appearance of rings of demyelination within the visualized lesions of the affected brain. Clinically, patients will resemble others with multiple sclerosis or a clinically isolated syndrome and this diagnosis requires neuroimaging. Serologic testing of the CSF may reveal pleocytosis without oligoclonal bands in these forms. Balo’s concentric multiple sclerosis disease has a benign course described in the few published studies of longitudinal follow-up in children. Marburg variant multiple sclerosis (also termed “Marburg’s Disease”) is typified by multiple demyelinating lesions noted deep within the white matter of the brain. There are no published studies of Marburg variant multiple sclerosis in children but the published data from adult patients would suggest that a child presenting with variant would have multiple neurological findings and a more severe clinical phenotype. Based on adult data, mortality or chronic disability would be predicted outcomes. Laboratory studies are typically unrevealing and not specific to this disease, and the diagnosis is based on clinical appearance (typically more severe than typical multiple sclerosis) and (possibly serial) radiological findings. Opticospinal multiple sclerosis is a multiple sclerosis variant described in Asian populations characterized by a higher proportion of patients with involvement of the optic nerves and the spinal cord. This disease has been described in Asian children and patients presenting with visual changes and neurological findings localizable to the spinal cord. Testing for the aquaporin-4 antibody can distinguish this MS variant from Neuromyelits Optica (see below). Schilder’s disease also referred to as “myelinclastic diffuse sclerosis” or merely “diffuse sclerosis” is a benign multiple sclerosis variant seen in children discussed in its own chapter. Briefly, Schilder’s disease is typified by open ring enhancing solitary lesions of the brain and requires adrenal function testing to rule out adrenoleukodystrophy which is a known mimic. Other demyelinating diseases include the following: Neuromyelitis optica (“NMO”, also referred to as “Devic’s Disease”) is a neuroimmune disease with an identified serological marker, auto-antibodies directed against the aquaporin-4 molecule. In children, the typical presentation is severe, rapidly progressive optic neuritis with possible spinal cord lesions, predominantly in the cervical spinal cord. Severe longitudinal transverse myelitis is not atypical. Transverse myelitis and its variants will present with acute or sub-acute onset of weakness, numbness, loss of bowel or bladder control readily localized to the spinal cord. Optic neuritis is described at length in its own chapter. Patients will present with deterioration of, change in, or total loss of vision in one or both eyes. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is discussed at length in its own chapter. This diagnosis requires the presence of encephalopathy with other neurological symptoms including, most typically, weakness and sensory changes which follow an infection or vaccination. Schilder’s disease and ADEM are discussed in separate entries. What other disease/condition shares some of these symptoms? Aside from the overlap in symptoms and manifestations between the demyelinating diseases themselves, other conditions can mimic their appearance. Encephalitis, brain malignancy, granulomatous disease, cerebral vasculitis, cerebral manifestations of sarcoidosis or lupus, mitochondrial diseases, and adrenaleukodystrophy can also mimic demyelinating disease presentations. In a survey of consultations for demyelinating disease referrals, migraines, major depressive disorder, and arteriovenous malformations were also potential mimics. The use of clinical criteria (i.e., the McDonald Criteria, the Poser’s criteria), severity of the presentation, progression, and the appearance of brain and spinal lesions on neuroimaging can assist in differentiating demyelinating diseases from these other conditions though there is clinical and radiological overlap even among demyelinating diseases themselves that can sometimes cloud definitive diagnosis. The precise cause for the acute onset of demyelinating diseases is unknown. Younger patients acquiring these diseases do so without regard for the usual ethnic (e.g., genetic) distribution seen in adults, and this observation has led to speculation a specific environmental trigger plays a more prominent role in children. The genesis of demyelinating diseases is thought to represent destructive autoimmunity. The animal model of demyelinating diseases is the “Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis” (“EAE”) model in which experimental animals receive injections of purified brain homogenates with outcomes of clinical and brain pathology similar to demyelinating diseases. Based on this model and other pathological studies, what is thought to occur in demyelinating diseases is a combination of autoimmunity possibly attributable to a prior infection and loss of regulation of the native immune response. In the majority of cases, what is believed to occur is a form of “molecular mimicry” in which a preceding infection has antigens that resemble self-derived epitopes, which in turns leads to inappropriate immune activation against both invading and native structures. Preceding infection can also disrupt the normal process of prevention of self-immunity by removing regulatory cells that would otherwise have prevented inappropriate autoimmune responses. Finally, some viruses have been shown to directly damage or even inhabit myelin and therefore lead to identification of myelin as an appropriate immune target. What laboratory studies should you request to help confirm the diagnosis? How should you interpret the results? In most cases, laboratory testing will fail to yield a primary cause for presentation of a demyelinating disease and diagnosis will be derived largely from history, physical examination, and radiology findings. It is important, however, to assess for such causes as, when identified, they can provide potential treatment options. In the case of parainfectious demyelinating diseases like ADEM, testing is imperative given the morbidity and mortality of potentially treatable encephalitis. Transverse myelitis has a differential diagnosis that includes several treatable causes and thus the diagnosis of this disease mandates additional testing. For other diseases such as multiple sclerosis, the diagnostic criteria include serologic findings, though no specific marker exists to differentiate MS and its variants from ADEM. Finally, in cases of NMO, there is a specific and sensitive marker for diagnosis. Tests to consider if a diagnosis of a demyelinating disease is suspected to be secondary to another diagnosis may include the following, divided into sub-categories to guide assignment of resources: The following should be obtained in any patients presenting with demyelinating disease: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies including white blood cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain, and culture. These studies are usually normal in optic neuritis although a CSF pleocytosis and mildly elevated protein can be present in cases of fulminant disease. Oligoclonal bands and IgG Index will be abnormal as a requirement of MS diagnostic criteria, but these are less likely to be positive in MS presenting in childhood or early adolescence than in adulthood. Vitamin D (25-hydroxy-vitamin D). Vitamin D deficiency has a complex role in adult demyelinating disease and deficiencies have been identified in pediatric patients with MS. The following should be evaluated in any patient with spinal cord and/or optic nerve pathology: Aquaporin-4 antibody. This is a specific assay for NMO, a demyelinating disease which typically presents with optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. The test can be obtained for serum or CSF antibody, with the latter being diagnostic if serum antibodies are absent. To rule out readily treatable cause of transverse myelitis: Copper level. Copper deficiency is a rare but treatable cause of myelopathies that sometimes mimic transverse myelitis symptoms. Vitamin E level. Vitamin E deficiency rarely produces a myelopathic appearance. Blood culture and a viral studies (if available): especially important in ADEM to identify potential etiology. Specific viruses of interest include influenza and para-influenza species as these are known risk factors for development of ADEM. Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR. There are reports of mycoplasma-related transverse meylitis. Bartonella henselae IgM of serum if cat scratch disease is suspected based on exposure to domestic or wild felines. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR). If syphilis is suspected this is a necessary diagnostic test. Anti-treponemal antibody titer in CSF would be required for a diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Complete blood count with differential to assess for leukocytosis and presence of infection or active autoimmune process. C-reactive protein (CRP). If elevated, this study is further evidence of infection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) which, if markedly elevated, may indicate a systemic inflammatory process. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) screen, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid antibodies. An elevated, significant autoantibody titer is suggestive of a systemic rheumatologic disease with neurological manifesations. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). An elevated ACE is suggestive of a neurological manifestation of sarcoidosis, especially with other systemic findings such as lung granulomas. Ferritin and triglycerides. An elevated fasting triglyceride level of >265 mg/dL and a serum ferritin >500 ng/ml are diagnostic of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS), a rare cause of systemic autoimmune activation. Serum lactate, serum acelycarnitine profile, serum amino acids, urine organic acids, CSF lactate, CSF neurotransmitters. If a mitochondrial disease or amino acidopathy is suspected, these optional assays would be useful diagnostically. A biopsy of muscle or skin fibroblasts may be necessary to confirm or to identify enzymatic-based disease. Adrenal gland function testing (serum cortisol, 24-hour urine cortisol, ACTH baseline and stimulation test) is required to exclude the possibility of weakness or sensory changes being attributable to adrenaleukodsytrophy. The diagnosis of Schilder’s disease requires these studies be normal. Very long chain fatty acids. The diagnosis of Schilder’s disease requires these studies be normal. An abnormality in this study would indicate an adrenaleukodystrophy. Would imaging studies be helpful? If so, which ones? Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast of brain usually will demonstrate one or multiple hypointense lesions on T1 sequences; these lesions will be hyperintense on T2 sequences. It is helpful to acquire sequences using a specific protocol for multiple sclerosis if available at the time of imaging. Contrast enhancement of the lesions’ rings may be present in acute disease states. Fluid attenuated inversion recover (FLAIR) sequences will demonstrate hyperintense lesions. Leptomeningeal enhancement is not typical in demyelinating diseases and suggests presence of a malignancy or a vasculitis. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can show lactate peaks and evidence of axonal injury/loss in severe cases of acute demyelination. There are not specific markers for particular demyelinating diseases as yet. The lesions in demyelinating diseases can be visualized on computed tomography (CT) scan and typically appear as hypodense lesions with ring enhancement and mass effect. The lesions of Marburg variant MS are typically within the deeper white matter of the brain. Balo’s concentric sclerosis typically features concentrically arranged ringed lesions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new investigative technique which allows direct non-invasive measurement of a cross-sectional thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer. This measurement can be used serially to assess thinning of that layer which would be a finding consistent with an acute optic neuritis and, if progressive, confirm a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis. If it is available, it would be helpful to obtain for longitudinal follow-up. Visual evoked responses (VER) examination, in which the latency between a visual stimulus and a sensory response in the occipital lobe is measured, can be used to confirm mild optic neuritis in cases where the clinical and neurological examinations are inconclusive and other modalities such as OCT (see above) are unavailable. If there is any historical or physical examination evidence to suggest that sarcoidosis is in the differential diagnosis, a chest CT scan with contrast is needed to assess for evidence of sarcoidosis. The following algorithm is suggested by Yeh et al. (2009) as a diagnostic framework for the diagnosis of demyelinating diseases. See Figure 1. The McDonald (Modified) Criteria for Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis are as followed from Polman et al. (2011) See Figure 2. The Poser criteria are typically used to define Schilder’s Disease. These six criteria are as follows: One or 2 roughly symmetrical large plaques are manifest, and if more than 1 is present, 1 should be in each brain hemisphere, chiefly in the centrum semiovale. Plaques are greater than 2 cm in 2 of 3 dimensions. No other lesions are demonstrable by clinical, paraclinical, or imaging data. No abnormalities of the peripheral nervous system are demonstrable. Pathological analysis by autopsy or biopsy demonstrates histologic changes consistent with subacute or chronic myelinoclastic diffuse sclerosis, changes which in essence cannot be distinguished from those of multiple sclerosis. There are no definitive nor widely utilized diagnostic criteria for transverse myelitis. The distinction of MS variants is described above but there are no definitive established criteria. If you are able to confirm that the patient has demyelinating disease, what treatment should be initiated? The mainstay of acute treatment of all demyelinating diseases in the initial phase or during relapses, is immune suppression. The most common treatment to achieve adequate immunosuppression leading to symptomatic improvement is corticosteroids which are prescribed for all acute presentations or exacerbations of demyelinating diseases including ADEM. In the hospital setting, intravenous methylprednisolone (20-30 mg/kg per day or a maximum dose of 1000 mg daily) is the usual treatment for 3-5 days. There is no empiric or reliable evidence for a course of 5 days being superior in any metric of outcome to a duration of 3 days, but generally if little to no clinical improvement is seen at 3 days a 5-day course is advised. In ADEM treatment, a 3-day course is usually sufficient. After high dose methylprednisolone is completed, oral corticosteroids should be given to for 4-6 weeks of treatment following completion of IV therapy. Shorter durations of oral corticosteroid tapers have been associated with higher relapse risk in optic neuritis. Initial starting dose of oral steroids is recommended at 1 mg/kg/day and can be administered either as prednisolone suspension or as prednisone tablets or a maximum starting dose of 60 mg daily. There is no established taper protocol, but a reduction of 5 mg every 3 days from the initial 60 mg dose would achieve the desired goal duration of treatment in a safe manner. This same regimen (3-5 days IV methylprednisolone followed by 28 or more days of oral steroids is advised for recrudescence of optic neuritis even in the presence of other treatments for primary causes. There are case reports for effectiveness of ACTH and dexamethasone, but typically the prohibitive cost and lack of availability of ACTH has markedly reduced the utility of this treatment option and methylprednisolone has a more favorable side effect profile than dexamethasone. As a primary treatment, there are limited data that suggest plasma exchange can ameleriorate some disability in severe demyelinating disease exacerbations. However, many more retrospective studies have established plasma exchange is an appropriate secondary treatment option in cases of demyelination refractory to initial treatment with steroids. Therefore, plasma exchange is proposed as a “rescue” option that improves outcomes acutely and long-term in several studies of adult patients. There is no definitive guideline to direct practitioners regarding when to consider plasma exchange. Plasma exchange appears to yield improvements in patients without evidence of clinical response to several doses of steroids, with worsening of symptoms despite several doses of steroids administered, or when elevated titers of auto-antibodies are thought to be causal. This treatment should be initiated as soon as possible and could be considered as early as 3 days into steroid treatment. There is no established exchange volume (1:1), frequency (daily versus every 2 days), or total number of exchanges though typically 2-5 total exchanges of at least 1:1 volume on an alternating day basis are effective. Multiple studies have confirmed that unlike steroid treatment, a single course of plasma exchange does not prevent future relapses. Therefore, steroid treatment can and likely should continue concurrently while plasma exchange occurs. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is reported to be an effective alternative option in the treatment of MS in children, specifically steroid-refractory or malignant (Marburg variant) forms or when patients are unable to tolerate steroid or plasma exchange treatments. Intravenous immunoglobulin (400-500 mg/kg) is an option for steroid refractory cases of neuroimmunological diseases in which plasma exchange is contraindicated by renal insufficiency or is simply not available. Duration of IVIG therapy reported to be effective for ADEM is 5 consecutive days, and generally a 5-day treatment course is employed for any neuroimmunological disease entity. It may also have particular effectiveness when combined with steroids in atypical ADEM with a predominant involvement of the peripheral nervous system. IVIG is not an effective treatment of optic neuritis in children. There are no published reports of IVIG treatment of Schilder’s disease, Marburg variant MS, or opticospinal MS in children; there are isolated case reports of IVIG use in NMO and pediatric MS. In addition to corticosteroids, one must consider the state of the patient as the brain lesions of any demyelinating disease can result in severe short-term disability. Obviously, appropriate medical management of these patients includes ensuring adequate ventilation capability is and remains present, maintaining euvolemia and vascular tone, providing adequate nutrition, whether by oral or parenteral routes, monitoring for electrolyte status, and surveillance for infection. There are reports of the need for surgical decompression in cases of ADEM, multiple sclerosis, and Schilder’s disease due to brain edema; thus, neurosurgical consultation can be considered for extreme instances. Seizures are infrequent sequelae of neuroimmunological diseases. Appropriate treatment for acute onset of seizures in the inpatient setting would include intravenous preparations of phenobarbital (in infants and children less than 2 years of age), fos-phenytoin (in children > 12 months of age,) valproate (in children > 2 years of age.) Levetiracetam, which is available in intravenous and oral preparations, is also often used for seizure management in children owing to its favorable side effect profile and lack of known interactions with other medications, but rarely can cause agitation or even psychosis and thus should be used cautiously in the setting of encephalopathy. Long-term treatment of demyelinating diseases can include so-called disease modifying drugs for which there are only case reports of efficacy in children. These medications work by modifying the ability of the immune residents of the central nervous system to mount all immune responses but particularly the autoimmunity at the root cause of these diseases. The first line therapies for chronic demyelinating diseases that have published data to support their usage in children are interferon preparations and glatiramer acetate. These medications are injectable (intramuscular or subcutaneous) and vary from daily to weekly administration. The doses and treatment frequencies are as follows: interferon beta-1a IM (30 mcg IM weekly), interferon beta-1a SC (44 mcg 3 times/week), interferon beta-1b SC (0.25 mcg every other day), and glatiramer acetate SC (20 mg daily). Second line therapies for pediatric multiple sclerosis include azathioprine, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide. These immunosuppressive treatments are supported by Class IV evidence and individual case reports in most cases. Two monoclonal antibodies, rituximab and natalizumab, are used in refractory adult MS and effectively by depleting B-cell populations throughout the body and within the CSF compartment, respectively. All of these therapies are reserved for refractory disease and should be initiated only by practitioners with experience in their use and side effects. These medications are not approved for usage in children for demyelinating diseases. What are the adverse effects associated with each treatment option? The side effects of corticosteroids and ACTH are well-documented and include hyperglycemia, hypertension, psychosis/mood changes, gastrointestinal ulceration/bleeding, hypokalemia, insomnia, and opportunistic infections. These side effects are thankfully uncommon and are not typically serious enough to cause a need for early termination of treatment. There is evidence for prevention of gastrointestinal ulceration while taking corticosteroids through the use H2-antagnosists and proton pump inhibitors. Plasma exchange is generally a safe and well-tolerated procedure in children. It requires surgical implantation of a catheter suitable for exchange, which has the usual surgical risks of bleeding, infection. Long-term the catheter is a potential infectious and embolic source. There are patients in whom plasma exchange is contraindicated. Hemodynamically unstable patients, or patients with cardiovascular compromise as a result of myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or coronary artery disease are contraindicated from exchange. Severe, uncorrectable coagulopathies are also a contraindication. Patients with severe hepatic failure and renal failure are also not appropriate for plasma exchange therapy. During therapy, there are multiple complications reported, but most are easily corrected through readily available means. Hypotension and bradycardia are frequently encountered and may require fluid support. Hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities can also require intervention and electrolytes should be monitored. Coagulopathy, anemia, and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism are also serious, potentially mortal, complications in rare instances. The most common adverse effects associated with interferons are flu-like symptoms such as myalgias and fatigue. These symptoms may be more pronounced in children. A transaminitis can occur, and after initiation of treatment these should be monitored at least once within the first 3 months of therapy. Glatiramer acetate is typically well-tolerated with local site injection reactions and allergic reaction being the most commonly reported issues. Natalizumab and rituximab are not approved for use in children for demyelinating diseases, and there are few anecdotal reports of efficacy. There is no published safety data for natalizumab in children. Azathioprine, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide all share common risk of immune suppression leading to opportunistic infection risk. They can also suppress other bone marrow derived cell lines leading to complications related to anemia and thrombocytopenia. Cyclophosphamide can acutely cause hemorrhagic cystitis if administered without proper precautions. There is also a small risk of causing a secondary malignancy associated with long-term use of these medications. What are the possible outcomes of demyelinating diseases? The overwhelming majority of pediatric multiple sclerosis cases conform to a relapsing-remitting pattern of relapses, meaning they will have periods of relative stability interspersed with acute relapses. There is considerable variability in progression in pediatric patients and no reliable marker for outcomes. In general, there is a lag of approximately 10 years from diagnosis to some measurable disability. Given recent treatments however this timetable may be in the process of elongating. However, it is still the reality that children diagnosed with multiple sclerosis will certainly accrue disabilities over time except in exceptional cases. ADEM is considered a monophasic illness with, at worst, a 40% risk of evolution into a relapsing disease. Schilder’s Disease is also associated with relatively benign outcomes. Acute pediatric transverse myelitis can cause serious lifelong disability in up to 50% of cases surveyed at follow-up. Generally cases with worse clinical appearance at presentation (larger/longer spinal cord lesion, back pain, need for ventilatory support) have worse outcomes. It can recur in up to 25% of cases and rarely evolves into multiple sclerosis. Pediatric NMO studies reveal variable outcomes reported in longitudinal studies. While severe NMO can cause blindness and paralysis, there are also reports of benign outcomes with no or minimal disability. Clinical course is the best determinant of outcome and initial presentation is not prognostic unless yielding a very severe disability refractory to treatment. Acutely, treatment of relapses with steroids is the standard of care and the benefit in terms of improving short-term disability is without debate. Obviously frequent usage of steroids should be a signal to pursue disease modifying therapies and improvement of baseline disease treatments. When considering treatment of refractory demyelinating diseases, the chemotherapeutics are certainly a very risky option with regard to toxicity during treatment and long-term risk of malignancy induction. These decisions require careful thought and fully informed consent. There is scant data regarding ultimately if these are truly beneficial when weighed against their multiplicity risks. The immune modulator therapies are generally benign and devoid of long-term side effects, but they are not as well tolerated in pediatric patients as adults. Pediatric multiple sclerosis cases are rare, comprising 2-10% of all cases of multiple sclerosis worldwide. There are no reliable genetic and no known seasonal associations. Unlike adult demyelinating diseases, it appears that environmental, not genetic, factors predominantly influence the manifestation of demyelinating diseases in early life. Specifically, while in adults longer distance from the equator and a European ethnic background appear to be positively correlated with disease, these same factors do not correlate with disease in children. There are case reports of familial NMO with multiple family members with aquaporin-4 autoimmunity. There may also be mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms that increase likelihood of manifesting optic neuritis. Unlike other manifestations of demyelinating disease, there is no consistent report of immune-related genetic spans such as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) regions conferring increased risk of isolated optic neuritis as well as multiple sclerosis, but larger studies are not available to confirm a distinct genetic predisposition. Schilder’s disease, Marburg variant, and Balo’s concentric sclerosis are exceedingly rare in pediatric multiple sclerosis on the order of less than total fifty published cases of each type in the extant pediatric literature. Acute transverse myelitis is estimated at an incidence of 1 to 30 per million cases. NMO is very rare in children and estimated to have an incidence of less than 1 per million. How do these pathogens/genes/exposures cause the disease? In theory, autoimmune diseases occur as a result of an environmental exposure, usually an illness, causing a cascade of immune responses that, in turn, cause an inappropriate recognition of excluded “self” antigens in the host. The immune response transforms from eradication of the disease to destruction of healthy tissues, in demyelinating diseases, the inappropriately targeted tissue is mainly white matter. What is thought to occur in ADEM and other acute demyelinating diseases is a combination of autoimmunity and loss of regulation of the native immune response. In the majority of ADEM cases, what is believed to occur is a form of “molecular mimicry” in which the preceding infection has antigens that resemble self-derived epitopes, which in turns leads to inappropriate immune activation against both invading and native structures. Preceding infection can also disrupt the normal process of prevention of self-immunity by removing regulatory cells that would otherwise have prevented inappropriate autoimmune responses. Finally, some viruses have been shown to directly damage or even inhabit myelin and therefore lead to identification of myelin as an appropriate immune target. What complications might you expect from the disease or treatment of the disease? Short-term complications of treatment are discussed above. Corticosteroids can cause long-term weight gain, a potential risk of developing diabetes mellitus type II in already at risk individuals, but these risks should not affect any decision to treat. The most concerning long-term effect of a chemotherapy medication such as cyclophosphamide would be the possible risk of inducing another malignancy, but, again, this small risk should be weighed against the significant consideration of the consequences of not treating the condition. Long term data on disease modifying agents in multiple sclerosis are not known in the pediatric population. Are additional laboratory studies available; even some that are not widely available? Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new investigative technique using near infra-red spectrum light which allows direct non-invasive measurement of a cross-sectional thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer. This measurement can be used serially to assess thinning of that layer which would be a finding consistent with an acute optic neuritis and, if progressive, confirm a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis. If it is available, it would be helpful to obtain for longitudinal follow-up. Visual evoked response (VER) examinations, in which the latency between a visual stimulus and a sensory response in the occipital lobe is measured, can be used to confirm mild optic neuritis in cases where the clinical and neurological examinations are inconclusive and other modalities such as OCT (see above) are unavailable. Presently, there are no known or available prophylactic treatments for demyelinating diseases. There are no certain genetic predispositions that would mandate genetic counseling prior to or after birth of an affected child. There is a historical and recently reinvigorated interest in Vitamin D intake and its relationship to multiple sclerosis with individuals having low vitamin D being at increased risk of diagnosis with MS. Cigarette smoke exposure is also a possible pathogenic trigger.

Ongoing controversies regarding etiology, diagnosis, treatment The diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of demyelinating diseases in children remains an area of active investigation. The application of adult diagnostic criteria and adult pathogenesis models remains problematic. As more cases accumulate in larger data bases, our learning will expand, but these diseases fortunately remain rare and thus the standards of care are derived from adult treatments and outcome analyses.

A: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disorders (MOGAD) is an idiopathic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). MOG is a glycoprotein uniquely expressed in oligodendrocytes in the CNS. MOG antibodies were originally thought to be involved in multiple sclerosis (MS), but subsequent studies found it to be a distinct disease. MOGAD have many similarities to neuromyelitis optica but several studies have demonstrated they have unique clinical features, treatment response, and prognosis. MOGAD were initially identified in NMOSD antibody negative patients. Pathologically NMOSD is classified as am astrocytopathy, while MOGAD are classified as oligodendrogliopathies. A: The exact incidence and prevalence of MOGASD is not known. The typical age of onset is in the 20-30s, but it can occur in both pediatric and older patents. Recent studies  show an equal prevalence in males and females. Most patients are Caucasian. MOG IgG associated disorders are generally regarded as a non-familial disease. A: MOGAD have several clinical presentations. One of the most common presentations is similar to neuromyelitis spectrum disorder (NMOSD) with recurrent optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or both. In one adult clinical cohort study the combination of optic nerve, spinal cord, or a combination accounted for >90% of cases.  The associated optic neuritis can be unilateral or bilateral. Another common presentation is that of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). ADEM can present with typical symptoms of encephalitis including decreased consciousness, headache, and behavioral changes. Seizures can also occur in the context of MOGAD associated ADEM presentations and occur at varying rates. Other presentations include brainstem syndrome and short segment transverse myelitis. In general, older patients are more likely to present with optic neuritis and younger patients are more likely to present with encephalomyelitis. A: In patients that present with an isolated myelitis many have a longitudinally extensive lesions (≥3 contiguous vertebral segments). Longitudinally extensive lesions were seen in 84.4% of patients with isolated myelitis and 55.6% of patients with myelitis plus optic neuritis at MOGAD presentation. There is no known unique radiographic pattern for MOG, but leptomeningeal enhancement, thalamic lesions, pontine lesions, deep white matter lesions, tumefactive, poorly defined lesions, and cortical lesions were more common in MOGAD than NMOSD or non-MOG antibody cases. The lesions also typically have dramatic improvement or resolution over time. The MRI findings in the setting of ADEM are the typical diffuse signal changes in the cortical and deep grey matter and subcortical and deep white matter on T2-weighted and FLAIR images. There have also been reports of scattered linear or nodular enhancement in active lesions with restricted diffusion. A: There is significant clinical overlap  with NMOSD. MOGAD has been reported to account for 40% of seronegative NMOSD. Compared to NMO aquaporin 4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) patients, MOG patients are younger, lack the female predominance, more frequently have a monophasic course, more often present with ADEM and often have a better outcome. The optic nerve is more commonly affected in MOG disease and more likely to have simultaneous affection of both optic nerves. In a UK series seizures were more frequently observed in MOG (14.7%) compared to AQP4 IgG patients (1%). Pathologically NMOSD is classified as an astrocytopathy, while MOG IgG associated disorders are classified as oligodendrogliopathies. A: Although the clinical presentation is closer to NMOSD there still is overlap with MS as optic neuritis and myelitis are common in all three conditions. The underlying immunopathological features of MOGAD are more closely related to MS than NMO. Since MOG is a more ubiquitous protein than AQP4 and expressed on CNS myelin sheaths there is more associated demyelination similar to MS. MOGAD patients are slightly younger and have less of a female predominance than MS. Although MOG patients often will have abnormalities on brain MRI these lesions have a distinct appearance that is different from MS lesions. Q: What are the unique features in pediatric patients with MOGAD? A: In the pediatric population, MOG IgG is often associated with an ADEM presentation preceded by infection. Pediatric patients are also more likely to have transient titer elevation which predicts a monophasic course. Persistent elevation predicts a recurrent course; therefore pediatric patients should be monitored. A: Recently developed cell based assays are available to test for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting MOG. Specifically a live cell-based methodology is preferred because it was shown to have a superior positive predictive value to the fixed cell assays. The exact sensitivity and specificity depends on the assay and are still being defined. CSF can have lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal or mildly elevated protein, and rare oligoclonal bands.  It is not helpful to test for MOG in the CSF. A: Recently proposed diagnostic criteria for MOG IgG associated disorders must meet the 3 following criteria: Laboratory finding: serum positive MOG-IgG by cell based assay Clinical findings of any of the following presentations: Optic neuritis, including chronic relapsing optic neuropathy (CRION) Brain or brainstem syndrome compatible with demyelination A: We consider  testing any patient with any of these clinical presentations: ADEM, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis. We will also test MOG IgG in patients with brain or brainstem lesions atypical for MS. A: In patients who test positive and presented with an optic neuritis or transverse myelitis we do not routinely re-test MOG IgG. For patients that present with an initial presentation of ADEM, especially in the pediatric population seropositivity can be transient and repeat testing may be of value. In one cohort 8 (4 adults and 4 children) of 51 patients had transient positivity and only 1 adult of those 8 patients had a relapse. This finding suggests that in patients with an ADEM presentation it would be reasonable to re-test for MOG IgG 6 months after initial presentation to aide with determining likelihood of recurrent disease. If a patient has an initial positive test and converts to negative this is more likely to indicate a monophasic course; whereas persistent positive results predicts recurrence. In a patient who presented with a syndrome typical of MOG IgG disease who tested negative at presentation we often consider retesting 6 months after initial testing or in the setting of recurrent disease. Q: What is the expected course and prognosis of MOGAD? A: MOG IgG may present as a monophasic or relapsing condition. In the context of ADEM as the presenting symptom it can be monophasic, especially in the pediatric population. There are now many reports of recurrent disease in the setting of positive MOG IgG. High and persistent MOG antibody titers are more likely to predict a relapsing course. The rate of relapsing disease varies by series, but has been reported to be as high as 72-88%. The overall prognosis of MOG is favorable compared to AQP4 positive disease with better recovery and less disability. Q: What is the general approach to a MOGAD relapse? A: The current approach to relapses is the same as an in NMOSD. Intravenous corticosteroids are our initial acute treatment. The typical Mellen Center regimen is methylprednisolone 1000mg IV as a single daily dose on 3-5 consecutive days followed by a prolonged steroid taper. We use varying taper regimens anywhere from 2-6 months depending on the severity of presentation and planned long term regimen. We consider plasmapheresis or IVIG as a second line treatment for patients not steroid responsive. Most reported cases showed excellent response to treatment with full recovery. A: There is limited data on long term management of recurrent MOG IgG associated disorders and there are no randomized trials to guide therapy. As with acute treatment our approach is similar to NMOSD maintenance therapy. There have been successful reports with the use of rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil, IVIG, and azathioprine.

Multiple-Sklerose-Register in Deutschland Multiple Sclerosis Registry in Germany – Results of the Extension Phase 2005/2006 Dtsch Arztebl 2008; 105(7): ; DOI: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0113 ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Unter Federführung der Deutschen Multiple Sklerose Gesellschaft (DMSG), Bundesverband e.V. wurde 2001 ein flächendeckendes MS-Register eingerichtet. Ziel war es, epidemiologische Daten zur Zahl an multipler Sklerose (MS) erkrankter Menschen, zur Verlaufsform der Erkrankung und zur Versorgungssituation in Deutschland zu erhalten. Nach Abschluss der zweijährigen Pilotphase wurden der Basisdatensatz modifiziert und neue Zentren rekrutiert. Diese Zentren erhoben zwischen 2005 und 2006 insgesamt 5 821 Datensätze. Nach einer zweistufigen Qualitätskontrolle konnten 5 445 Datensätze (93,5 %) ausgewertet werden. Im Durchschnitt dauerte es 3,5 Jahre, bis die Diagnose gestellt wurde. Mehr als 70 % der Patienten wurden immuntherapeutisch behandelt. Demgegenüber wurden symptomatische Therapien wesentlich seltener verordnet. Zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2006 nahmen 57 Zentren am MS-Register teil: 29 Akutkliniken, 11 Rehabilitationskliniken, 13 Schwerpunktpraxen und 4 regionale MS-Zentren. Das MS-Register liefert wertvolle Informationen über die Versorgungssituation von MS-Patienten. Diese Daten liefern die Grundlage für gezielte Maßnahmen zum Ausgleich von Unter- und Fehlversorgung und tragen dazu bei, die Lebenssituation von MS-Patienten zu verbessern. Dtsch Arztebl 2008; 105(7): 113–9 DOI: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0113 multiple Sklerose, Register, Epidemiologie, Datenbanken, Therapie, Erwerbsfähigkeit Die multiple Sklerose (MS) ist eine chronisch-entzündliche Erkrankung des zentralen Nervensystems. Sie ist die Erkrankung, die im jungen Erwachsenenalter am häufigsten zu einer dauerhaften Behinderung führt. In Deutschland sind schätzungsweise 120 000 bis 140 000 Patienten davon betroffen; die genaue Zahl ist nicht bekannt. Ebenso wenig weiß man über die Verteilung auf die einzelnen Verlaufsformen oder den Schweregrad der dauerhaften Behinderung (). Trotz der hohen volkswirtschaftlichen Bedeutung mit Krankheitskosten von 40 000 Euro pro Patient und Jahr () ist die Versorgungssituation von MS-Patienten nur unzureichend bekannt. Deshalb ist auch unter gesundheitsökonomischen Aspekten und im Hinblick auf den zielgerichteten Einsatz begrenzter Ressourcen ein flächendeckendes Register wünschenswert. Eine systematische Erhebung existiert für Deutschland bisher nicht. Aus diesem Grund wurde unter Federführung der Deutschen Multiplen Sklerose Gesellschaft (DMSG), Bundesverband e.V. im Jahr 2001 ein MS-Register initiiert, das Querschnittsdaten zur Häufigkeit der Erkrankung und deren Unterformen in Deutschland liefern soll. Ferner erhofft man sich Aufschluss über die Verteilung innerhalb der einzelnen Schweregrade, den Einfluss der Erkrankung auf die Berufs- und Arbeitsfähigkeit und die Versorgung mit immunmodulierenden, symptomatischen und nicht medikamentösen Therapien. Nach der zweijährigen Pilotphase, an der 3 223 Patienten () teilnahmen, werden nun die Ergebnisse der Extensionsphase präsentiert. In der Pilotphase wurden alle MS-Patienten eingeschlossen, die in der Zeit vom 7. Januar 2002 bis 31. Dezember 2003 in den teilnehmenden Zentren behandelt wurden und die nach ausführlicher Aufklärung einer zentralen Auswertung des erhobenen Basisdatensatzes schriftlich zustimmten. Die Art der Datenerhebung, -speicherung und -auswertung erfolgte gemäß den aktuell gültigen Datenschutzbestimmungen der Bundesländer. Beteiligt waren 5 Zentren mit besonderer Erfahrung in der Betreuung von MS-Patienten, die unterschiedliche Versorgungsstufen und geografische Gegebenheiten aufwiesen und verschiedene Regionen Deutschlands repräsentierten (). Basierend auf den Erfahrungen der Pilotphase wurde die Eingabemaske () modifiziert. Dabei wurden Parameter entfernt, wenn sie entbehrlich schienen, oder ergänzt, wenn sie unvollständig waren, und präzisiert, wenn die Eingaben missverständlich aufgefasst werden konnten. Damit war der Basisdatensatz zum einen verschlankt, zum anderen aber auch ausreichend präzise und eindeutig. Das vollständige Erhebungsinstrument ist bei den Autoren erhältlich. Die Dokumentation erfolgte vor Ort in den Zentren durch die behandelnden Ärzte. Zur zentralen Qualitätskontrolle und Auswertung wurden die Datensätze pseudonymisiert und alle 3 Monate auf Datenträger zur MS-Forschungs- und Projektentwicklungs-gGmbH Hannover (MSFP) gesandt. Dort wurden Vollständigkeit (Alter, Geschlecht, Behinderungsgrad und Diagnosesicherheit) und Inkonsistenzen überprüft und auffällige Datensätze zur Korrektur zurückgegeben. Doppelte Datensätze, die im Erhebungszeitraum entweder in einem Zentrum mehrfach (Längsschnittuntersuchung) oder in mehreren Zentren konsekutiv (zum Beispiel bei akut-stationärer und nachfolgender rehabilitativer Behandlung) erhoben wurden, konnten anhand eines eindeutigen Schlüssels sicher identifiziert werden. Für die Querschnittsanalyse wurde nur der jeweils letzte Datensatz verwendet. In der zweijährigen Pilotphase wurden 3 458 standardisierte Basisdatensätze dokumentiert, von denen nach der Qualitätskontrolle 3 223 (93,2 %) für die weiteren Analysen verwendet werden konnten (). Seit dem 15. März 2005 nehmen kontinuierlich neue Zentren am Register teil. Zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2006 hatten 57 Zentren ihre Bereitschaft zur standardisierten Dokumentation erklärt (). Von 35 Zentren wurden bisher insgesamt 5 821 Datensätze erhoben (). Nach der Qualitätskontrolle standen 5 445 Datensätze zur Verfügung (93,5 %). Die übrigen teilnehmenden Zentren lieferten die Daten erst nach dem Stichtag, sodass diese für die Auswertung noch nicht berücksichtigt werden konnten. Da nicht alle Datensätze bezüglich aller Parameter komplett waren, ergeben sich für die einzelnen Auswertungen unterschiedliche Bezugsgrößen. Das durchschnittliche Alter (± Standardabweichung) zum Zeitpunkt der Erhebung betrug 44,2 ± 11,5 Jahre, im Mittel waren die Patienten 12,7 ± 9,2 Jahre erkrankt. Das Alter bei Krankheitsbeginn war 31,4 ± 10,2 Jahre (7 bis 75 Jahre), überwiegend manifestierte sich die MS zwischen dem 20. und 40. Lebensjahr (70 %), trat aber auch bei 9 Patienten erstmals vor dem 10. Lebensjahr (0,2 %) und bei 44 Patienten nach dem 60. Lebensjahr (0,9 %) auf. 4,9 % der Patienten erkrankten erstmals nach dem 50. Lebensjahr. Bei der Diagnosestellung waren die Patienten 34,8 ± 10,7 Jahre alt. Damit dauerte es durchschnittlich 3,4 ± 5,5 Jahre, bis die Diagnose „MS“ gestellt wurde. Dieser Zeitraum war auch bei Neudiagnosen ab dem Jahr 2000 nahezu unverändert (3,6 Jahre). Frauen waren 2,5-mal häufiger betroffen als Männer (72 versus 28 %). Ein schubförmiger Verlauf war bei 55 % zu verzeichnen, 32 % litten an einer sekundär chronisch-progredienten Verlaufsform, und 9 % hatten von Krankheitsbeginn an einen chronisch-progredienten Verlauf. Bei 1 % handelte es sich um eine Erstmanifestation. Der klinische Zustand war bei 16,9 % der Patienten im letzten Jahr stabil geblieben, wohingegen 17,1 % mehr als einen Schub beziehungsweise eine rasche Progression aufwiesen. Die Mehrzahl der Patienten (56,0 %) hatte eine langsame Progression beziehungsweise weniger als einen Schub pro Jahr. Die Verteilung der EDSS („Expanded Disability Status Scale“), die international standardmäßig zur Quantifizierung des Behinderungsgrades verwendet wird (), zeigt die . Die mediane EDSS betrug 3,5; 51 % der Patienten waren noch uneingeschränkt gehfähig (EDSS < 4), 28 % benötigten eine Gehhilfe, um 100 m weit zu gehen (EDSS ≥ 6), und 6 % waren ständig auf den Rollstuhl angewiesen (EDSS ≥ 8). Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, einen Behinderungsgrad von 4,0 beziehungsweise 6,0 auf der EDSS in Abhängigkeit vom Lebensalter zu erreichen, ist in dargestellt. Daraus lässt sich beispielsweise ablesen, dass 60 % der Patienten im Alter von 50 Jahren und 40 % der Patienten im Alter von 60 Jahren noch keine Gehhilfe benötigten, um 100 m weit zu gehen. Voll berufstätig waren nur noch 1 183 Patienten (27,9 %), 1 671 Patienten (39,4 %) waren vorzeitig berentet, 6,0 % arbeitslos gemeldet, nur 0,7 % führten MS-bedingt eine Umschulungsmaßnahme durch. Der Anteil der vorzeitig Berenteten war stark vom Lebensalter abhängig (). Die zeigt die Abhängigkeit vom Behinderungsgrad: Es ist auffällig, dass der Verbleib im Erwerbsleben zwar vom Schweregrad der körperlichen Behinderung abhing, aber ein nicht unerheblicher Teil (14,8 %) der vorzeitig Berenteten eine EDSS < 3,5 aufwies, also noch uneingeschränkt gehfähig war. Immunmodulatorische und symptomatische Therapiemaßnahmen 71 % der Patienten wurden immunmodulatorisch behandelt, dabei wurden am häufigsten die Interferone eingesetzt (). Die Eskalationstherapie mit Mitoxantron wurde ebenfalls vergleichsweise häufig angewendet. Andere Therapieoptionen inklusive intravenöse Immunglobuline wurden nur selten genutzt. 670 Patienten (20 %) wurden nicht immunprophylaktisch behandelt, dazu zählten vor allem sekundär chronisch-progrediente Patienten mit langsamer Progression. Allerdings wiesen auch 98 der immuntherapeutisch unbehandelten Patienten (14,9 %) eine rasche Progression beziehungsweise häufige Schübe auf. gibt einen Überblick über die Behandlung häufiger MS-Symptome. Vor allem die schnelle Erschöpfbarkeit („Fatigue“) und kognitive Störungen, obwohl oft vorhanden, blieben größtenteils unbehandelt. Demgegenüber wurden Schmerzen und Depression vergleichsweise häufig medikamentös therapiert. Ein erheblicher Anteil der Patienten, die an Spastik oder Blasenstörung litten, war weder mit medikamentösen noch mit nicht medikamentösen Maßnahmen versorgt. Nach dem erfolgreichen Abschluss der Pilotphase konnte in der nun folgenden zweiten Phase des Projekts die Datenerhebung ausgeweitet und in knapp zwei Jahren 5 445 neue Datensätze registriert werden. Charakteristisch für die MS ist das unvorhersehbare und rezidivierende Auftreten von Krankheitssymptomen („schubförmiger Verlauf“), mit dem bei 90 bis 95 % der Fälle die Erkrankung beginnt. In 5 bis 10 % der Fälle kommt es zu einer schleichenden Verschlechterung insbesondere des Gehvermögens („primär chronisch-progredienter Verlauf“). Nach etwa 10 bis 15 Jahren geht die MS bei 30 bis 40 % der Patienten nach initial schubförmigen Verlauf in die chronische Phase über („sekundär chronisch-progredienter Verlauf“) (). Die vorliegenden Ergebnisse zeigen im Vergleich mit der Pilotphase () einen höheren Anteil chronisch-progredienter Patienten und eine Verschiebung zu höheren Behinderungsgraden. Dieses Resultat dürfte in erster Linie durch die zunehmende Rekrutierung von Rehabilitationskliniken, aber auch niedergelassenen Praxen bedingt sein. Die hier dargestellten Ergebnisse entsprechen denen aus populationsbasierten epidemiologischen Untersuchungen (–) und unterstreichen, dass mit der Ausweitung des Registers zunehmend repräsentative Daten gewonnen werden. Während in früheren Untersuchungen zum natürlichen Krankheitsverlauf 50 % der Patienten nach einer Krankheitsdauer von etwa 15 Jahren auf eine Gehhilfe angewiesen waren, um 100 m zurückzulegen (EDSS 6,0) (, ), deuten neuere Untersuchungen mit einer medianen Zeit von 20 beziehungsweise 29 Jahren bis zur EDSS 6,0 nun eine weitaus günstigere Prognose der MS an (, –). Da der genaue Beginn der Erkrankung oftmals schwer festzulegen ist, ist eine Betrachtung, bei der man die Abhängigkeit des Schweregrades der Behinderung vom Lebensalter zugrunde legt, für die individuelle Beratung der Patienten hilfreicher. Im Alter von 50 Jahren beziehungsweise von 60 Jahren konnten noch 60 % beziehungsweise 40 % der Patienten eine Strecke von 100 m noch ohne Hilfe gehen, vergleichbar den Ergebnissen aus British Columbia, Kanada (). Im MS-Register war ein Großteil der Patienten bereits über mehrere Jahre immuntherapeutisch behandelt, sodass diese prognostisch günstigen Zahlen nicht den natürlichen Krankheitsverlauf, sondern eher den Verlauf unter der derzeitigen Versorgung mit krankheitsmodifizierenden Medikamenten und verbesserten symptomatischen Therapiemaßnahmen widerspiegeln. Trotz verbesserter technischer Möglichkeiten und neuer Diagnosekriterien, die prinzipiell die Diagnosestellung innerhalb eines Monats nach Symptombeginn erlauben (), ist die durchschnittliche Zeit von der Erstmanifestation bis zur Diagnosestellung mit 3,4 Jahren wie in der Pilotphase vergleichsweise lang. Dies betrifft auch die ab dem Jahr 2000 diagnostizierten Patienten. Es bleibt abzuwarten, ob durch die intensivere Aufklärung über Verlauf und frühe Behandlungsmöglichkeiten und mit der weiteren Umsetzung der diagnostischen Kriterien die Diagnose künftig früher gestellt und damit eine längere diagnostische Unsicherheit vermieden werden kann – wie es die Daten des NARCOMS-Register der nordamerikanischen MS-Zentren für andere Länder belegen (). Hier sei besonders an Hausärzte, Augenärzte, Orthopäden und Urologen appelliert, junge Patienten mit nicht eindeutig durch eine periphere Ursache erklärbaren neurologischen Ausfällen rasch einer neurologischen Diagnostik zuzuführen, um bei subklinisch aktivem Verlauf frühzeitig mit der erforderlichen Behandlung beginnen zu können (, ). Nach einer Krankheitsdauer von knapp 13 Jahren bezogen fast 40 % der Patienten bei einem mittleren Alter von 44 Jahren Rentenleistungen aufgrund einer Erwerbsminderung. Nur 28 % der Patienten waren noch in Vollzeit berufstätig. Ähnliche Zahlen sind auch aus anderen Untersuchungen bekannt (, , ) und – wie bei dem höheren Anteil schwerer betroffener MS-Patienten zu erwarten – ungünstiger als in der Pilotphase (). Der relativ niedrige Anteil an Arbeitslosen in der Gruppe der MS-Patienten im Vergleich zu der Arbeitslosenquote von 10 bis 12 % in der Gesamtbevölkerung dürfte widerspiegeln, dass in den Fällen schwerer Vermittelbarkeit bei eingeschränkter Leistungsfähigkeit die Indikation zur Berentung großzügig gestellt wird. Obwohl der Anteil der vorzeitig Berenteten erwartungsgemäß mit dem Ausmaß der körperlichen Behinderung zunahm (, , ), waren immerhin 15 % der erwerbsunfähigen Patienten noch uneingeschränkt gehfähig. Dies bedeutet, dass noch andere Faktoren als die körperliche Funktionseinschränkung für die vorzeitige Berentung verantwortlich sein müssen. Insbesondere kognitive Einschränkungen und die Fatigue-Symptomatik werden mit der EDSS nicht adäquat abgebildet, und gerade diese beiden Faktoren sind wahrscheinlich ein wesentlicher Grund für die eingeschränkte berufliche Leistungsfähigkeit (). Daher ist es dringend notwendig, die Ursachen zu identifizieren, die zum vorzeitigen Ausscheiden aus dem Arbeitsprozess führen und gezielte therapeutische Strategien zu entwickeln, um langfristig die berufliche Leistungsfähigkeit bei guter Lebensqualität zu erhalten (). Eine verlaufsmodifizierende Behandlung wurde – in Übereinstimmung mit der Pilotphase und dem NARCOMS-Register () – bei mehr als 70 % der Patienten durchgeführt. Knapp die Hälfte der Patienten erhielt eine immunmodulatorische Basistherapie (Interferon-b und Glatiramerazetat) nach dem Stufenschema der Multiple Sklerose Therapie Konsensusgruppe (MSTKG) (, , ). Der im Vergleich zur Pilotphase höhere Anteil von Mitoxantron- und regelmäßigen Steroid-Pulstherapien erklärt sich mit dem höheren Anteil chronisch-progredienter Patienten, bei denen diese Therapieformen die einzig verfügbaren Optionen sind. Da Natalizumab erst Mitte 2006 zugelassen wurde, sind bisher nur wenige Behandlungen damit dokumentiert. Andere Immuntherapeutika, auch intravenöse Immunglobuline, wurden nur selten angewendet. Art und Häufigkeit der eingesetzten Substanzen sprechen also dafür, dass die evidenzbasierten Empfehlungen der MSTKG, die mittlerweile in die Leitlinien der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Neurologie übernommen wurden (), tatsächlich im klinischen Alltag umgesetzt werden. Dennoch werden viele Patienten, trotz vorhandener Krankheitsaktivität, das heißt rasche Progression und/oder mehr als ein Schub pro Jahr, nicht immunprophylaktisch behandelt. Noch auffälliger ist die Unterversorgung mit symptomorientierten Therapiemaßnahmen: hier wurden die meisten Patienten, insbesondere bei kognitiven Störungen, Fatigue oder Ataxie, nicht zielgerichtet behandelt. Damit ist für MS-Patienten im Allgemeinen und besonderes im Hinblick auf die Therapie der Symtome (, –) eine deutliche Unterversorgung festzustellen. Die Gründe hierfür sind vielfältig. Eine Erklärung könnte darin liegen, dass Patienten in den Zentren mit der Frage nach einer geeigneten Therapiemöglichkeit vorgestellt wurden und die Behandlung möglicherweise erst nach der Dokumentation geändert wurde, also noch nicht erfasst ist. Hierüber können nur Folgeuntersuchungen Aufschluss geben. Eine andere Schlussfolgerung wäre, dass Patienten, die an multipler Sklerose erkrankt sind, in Deutschland häufiger eine Therapie ablehnen beziehungsweise eine Behandlung frühzeitiger abbrechen als in anderen europäischen Ländern, obwohl sie grundsätzlich indiziert wäre. Daher ist eine umfassende Aufklärung und Beratung über Nutzen und Risiken einer Behandlung und die Vereinbarung realistischer Therapieziele dringend notwendig (). Für einige Symptome der multiplen Sklerose wie beispielsweise Fatigue oder kognitive Störungen gibt es entweder keine eindeutig wirksamen Therapiemaßnahmen oder aber keine Versorgungsstrukturen, die zum Beispiel eine ambulante neuropsychologische Behandlung erlauben würden. Hier besteht dringender Bedarf an weiterer klinischer Forschung, aber auch an strukturellen Anpassungen, um eine adäquate Versorgung von MS-Betroffenen sicherzustellen. Bei der vorliegenden Erhebung wurden nicht nur die Neuerkrankungen registriert, sondern alle Patienten, die im Erhebungszeitraum ein Zentrum aufgesucht hatten. Diese Vorgehensweise ist bei einer chronischen Erkankung wie der multiplen Sklerose mit hoher Prävalenz und vergleichsweise niedriger Inzidenz () sinnvoll, weil gerade zu Krankheitsbeginn eine hohe diagnostische Unsicherheit und starke psychische Belastungen bei den Betroffenen bestehen. Die Erhebung ist nicht populationsbezogen, sondern zentrumsbasiert, sodass ein Selektionsbias vorliegen könnte. Die wünschenswerte, vollständige Erfassung hätte die Teilnahme aller an der Versorgung von MS-Patienten Beteiligten vorausgesetzt und wäre nur mithilfe einer gesetzlichen Verpflichtung wie zum Beispiel in Dänemark möglich. Die mit populationsbasierten epidemiologischen Studien vergleichbaren demografischen Daten lassen aber den Schluss zu, dass die Ergebnisse dennoch repräsentativ für die Gesamtheit der MS-Population sind. Das MS-Register beschreibt nur die Versorgungssituation von MS-Patienten im Querschnitt; Informationen über den Krankheitsverlauf vor Therapieeinleitung liegen nicht vor. Somit können also keine Aussagen über eine differenzielle Wirksamkeit der Therapien getroffen werden. Dies wird erst bei den geplanten Verlaufsuntersuchungen möglich sein. Trotz dieser Einschränkungen liefert das MS-Register wertvolle Informationen über die Versorgungssituation von MS-Betroffenen, die die Grundlage für gezielte Maßnahmen zum Ausgleich von Unter- und Fehlversorgung bilden und so die Lebenssituation von MS-Patienten in Deutschland insgesamt verbessern können. Das deutsche MS-Register bildet die Basis für ein europaweites MS-Register im Rahmen eines von der EU geförderten Projektes, das derzeit in Trägerschaft der Europäischen MS-Plattform (EMSP) durchgeführt wird. Das Projekt wird in Trägerschaft der MS-Forschungs- und Projektentwicklungs gGmbH (MSFP) mit der DMSG, Bundesverband e.V., durchgeführt. Finanziert wird das MS-Register von der Deutschen-Multiple-Sklerose(DMS)-Stiftung, die offizielle Stiftung der DMSG. Die DMS-Stiftung erhält freie Spenden von Privatpersonen, Organisationen und der pharmazeutischen Industrie. Eine Einflussnahme auf die Inhalte der geförderten Projekte erfolgt nicht.

This project aimed at collecting epidemiological data and information on health care provision for MS patients in Germany. Methods: After a 2-year pilot phase, the original sample was modified, and new centers were recruited, resulting in the registration of a total of an additional 5821 patients in 2005 and 2006. Following a 2 stage process of quality control, standardised data sets of 5 445 patients (93.5%) were able to be analysed. Results: Mean duration from onset of disease to diagnosis was 3.5 years. More than 70% of patients received immunomodulatory drugs, whereas symptomatic treatments were less commonly administered. The number of participating centers as at 31. December 2006 was 57 (29 neurological hospitals, 11 rehabilitation units, 13 specialized practitioners, and 4 regional MS centers). Discussion: The MS registry provides valuable data on the health care situation of MS patients, and may help to improve service provision and overall quality life for these patients in Germany.

A: Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, antibody-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that predominantly targets the optic nerves, brainstem and spinal cord. The term neuromyelitis optica was first described by Devic and Gault in 1894 (1). The disease was, therefore, previously referred to as Devic’s disease. It was considered for years as a variant of multiple sclerosis but, more recently, demonstrated to represent a distinct clinical and pathophysiologic entity. Moreover, the identification of a serum autoantibodies specific for the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) (2), a water channel present on astrocytic foot processes heavily expressed in the optic nerves, brainstem, and spinal cord, unified a spectrum of NMO-related disorders and distinguished them from multiple sclerosis (MS). NMOSD encompasses patients who fulfill the diagnostic criteria below and are either AQP4 seropositive or AQP4/myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) seronegative (testing discussed below). A: The reported incidence and prevalence of NMOSD are dependent on geographical location and ethnicity. The prevalence in the United States and Europe range between 3.9-4.1/100,000 but higher in African and Asian populations. Females are more affected than males (3:1–9:1) (3). The median age at presentation is 39 years, but 18% of cases occur in children or the elderly (4). It is generally regarded as a non-familial disease. A: NMOSD has three cardinal manifestations: optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, and area postrema syndrome. Optic neuritis is often associated with severe bilateral vision involvement, and incomplete recovery. Transverse myelitis in NMOSD is typically complete with profound bilateral motor weakness, prominent dysesthesias, a sensory level, and sphincter dysfunction (5). Other useful clinical clues include pain, pruritis, and tonic spasms (brief recurrent, usually painful episodes of increased muscle tone with abnormal posturing of the affecting limb). NMOSD transverse myelitis is often disabling and associated with poor recovery despite treatment. The third common presentation is area postrema syndrome, which is characterized by nausea, vomiting with or without hiccup, and patients are often evaluated first by gastroenterologists. It may occur in isolation, have other accompanying brainstem features, or evolve into a myelitis episode. Other less common presentations include symptomatic diencephalic syndrome (narcolepsy, autonomic dysfunction, anorexia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), symptomatic cerebral syndrome with presentation similar to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), myalgia and hyperCKemia. A: NMOSD is commonly associated with organ specific autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (pernicious anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis and type 1 diabetes) and non-organ specific autoimmune disease or their autoantibody biomarkers such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (6). The presence of any core manifestations of NMOSD in any patient with these diseases is likely due to NMOSD rather than neurological manifestations of connective tissue disease and should promote testing for AQP4-IgG. NMOSD can rarely be a paraneoplastic presentation. A: Although NMOSD has distinct immunopathogenesis and treatment options, both NMOSD and MS may have similar clinical presentations and imaging features. It is essential to differentiate NMOSD and MS, especially in patients with both optic nerve and spinal cord involvement, as some MS therapies (e.g. interferon beta, natalizumab, fingolimod) can exacerbate NMOSD. Optic neuritis is generally more severe, and recovery poorer in NMOSD than in MS, with complete remission in only 32%. Transverse myelitis in NMOSD is usually extensive, with complete clinical remission in only 17% of attacks (7). Unlike MS, the disability in NMOSD is mostly driven by relapses rather than disease progression. MRI of the brain is usually normal or shows changes that differ from MS (See below). The longitudinally extensive cord lesions (typically 3 vertebral segments long) characteristic of NMO are rarely seen in MS (MS lesions are usually one vertebral segment long).  CSF may show a striking lymphocytic pleocytosis or a neutrophilic predominance, whereas a CSF pleocytosis >50 cells/mm3 is rare in multiple sclerosis. Oligoclonal bands are found in only 15-30% with NMO versus 90% with MS (8). A: Brain MRI is abnormal in 55-80% of patients with NMOSD, but only 10% to 20% will satisfy Barkhof MS criteria (9). Typical brain involvement in NMOSD occurs at regions of high AQP4 expression (periaqueductal, hypothalamic, and periventricular regions) but can also involve the deep and subcortical white matter. Different patterns of white matter involvement have been reported in NMOSD, such as marbled appearance of the acute callosal lesion, involvement of the entire thickness of the corpus callosum (arch bridge appearance), tumefactive lesion and spindle-like appearance following white matter tracts. On occasion, lesions ascending from the spinal cord into the brainstem can occur. In addition, different patterns of enhancement have been reported to be typical for NMO, such as pencil-thin linear ependymal enhancement (thin ependymal enhancement of lateral ventricular surfaces), leptomeningeal enhancement, and cloud-like poorly marginated enhancement. Cases of PRESS have also been reported in association with NMOSD. MRI findings of NMOSD optic neuritis include extensive T2 hyperintense lesions, commonly bilateral, extending over the posterior part of the optic nerve or involving the optic chiasm, with enhancement usually extending more than half the length of the nerve (11). Imaging of the acute myelitis of NMOSD typically reveals a longitudinally extensive T2-hyperintense lesion spanning three or more contiguous vertebral segments. However, lesions are short in 14% of first myelitis episodes (92% long at relapse) (10). Extensive cord edema, central cord involvement with necrosis and cavitation, and a long segment cord atrophy are other common features with NMOSD. A: Patients suspected of having NMOSD should be tested for AQP4-IgG antibodies. AQP4-IgG binds to AQP4, which is located on the end-feet of astrocytes, initiating a cascade of immune-mediated inflammation resulting in secondary demyelination. Blood testing is recommended for AQP4-IgG and should be performed during the attack, before immunotherapy. Of available AQP4-Ab assays, the live cell-based assay has the highest sensitivity (76.7%) and specificity (99.8%) (12). The older-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique is less sensitive and more prone to yield false-positive results. With the most sensitive assays, testing is negative in 10-25% of clinically diagnosed NMO. Up to 25% of patients with seronegative NMOSD will have antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG). Please refer to the Mellen Center Approach (MCA) on Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disorders for more information on that topic. CSF findings in NMOSD typically include a mixed pleocytosis (lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes) with a median cell count of 19 cells/μl (range: 6-380) and elevated protein, especially in the setting of relapse. Positive oligoclonal bands are found in less than 30 % of patients with AQP4-IgG. Testing for AQP4-IgG in the CSF is less useful and is not the preferred method. A: We test any patient with any of these clinical presentations: longitudinally extensive or severe transverse myelitis, severe unilateral, recurrent, or bilateral optic neuritis. We also test AQP4-IgG in patients with intractable vomiting, hiccup, vertigo, unusual brain or brainstem lesions or undiagnosed inflammatory CNS disorder. Q: What are the criteria for the diagnosis of NMOSD? A: Revised consensus criteria published in 2015 base the diagnosis of NMOSD on the presence of core clinical characteristics, AQP4 antibody status, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuroimaging features (13). Positive test for AQP4-IgG using best available detection method (cell-based assay strongly recommended) Diagnostic criteria for NMOSD without AQP4-IgG or NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG status 1. At least two core clinical characteristics occurring as a result of one or more clinical attacks and meeting all of the following requirements: a. At least one core clinical characteristic must be optic neuritis, acute myelitis with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), or area postrema syndrome b. Dissemination in space (two or more different core clinical characteristics) c. Fulfillment of additional MRI requirements, as applicable 2. Negative tests for AQP4-IgG using best available detection method, or testing unavailable Area postrema syndrome: Episode of otherwise unexplained hiccups or nausea and vomiting Symptomatic narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions Symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical brain lesions Additional MRI requirements for NMOSD without AQP4-IgG and NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG status 1. Acute optic neuritis: Requires brain MRI showing (a) normal findings or only nonspecific white matter lesions,  (b) optic nerve MRI with T2-hyperintense lesion or T1-weighted gadolinium enhancing lesion extending over more than one-half the optic nerve length or involving optic chiasm 2. Acute myelitis: Requires associated intramedullary MRI lesion extending over ≥3 contiguous segments (LETM)  ≥3 contiguous segments of focal spinal cord atrophy in patients with history compatible with acute myelitis 3. Area postrema syndrome: Requires associated dorsal medulla/area postrema lesions 4. Acute brainstem syndrome: Requires associated periependymal brainstem lesion Q: What is the expected course and prognosis of NMOSD? A: Approximately 90% of NMOSD patients have a relapsing course, with around 50% have their first relapse within 1 year and 90% within 5 years (14). Predictors of relapsing course include older age of onset, longer interval between first and second clinical attack, female gender, and less severe motor disability with the index event (15). If untreated, 50% of patients with relapsing NMOSD become blind in one or both eyes and require ambulatory help within 5 years of disease onset. Q: What are the differences between pediatric and adult onset NMOSD? A: Approximately 4% of NMOSD cases are reported to be pediatric onset. The age of onset is typically around 10–12 years, with the youngest reported patient with NMOSD was 16 months old. The marked female predominance seen in adult-onset disease is less evident (∼3:1 female: male ratio compared with up to 9:1 for adults). As in adults, AQP4 IgG seropositivity is usually associated with a severe, relapsing course, but is sometimes monophasic. In pediatric cases, the brain tends to be more involved, and brain lesions are commonly symptomatic, most common are encephalopathy, intractable nausea, hiccups, diplopia, and vertigo. With regard to spine MRI, both long and short segment myelitis were reported. However, LETM is less specific for NMOSD in children as 15% of pediatric MS patients have LETM. Other clinical, neuroimaging, and laboratory characteristics of pediatric NMOSD are similar to those of adult-onset disease. The International Panel for NMO Diagnosis (IPND) suggested that adult criteria are utilizable in pediatric with a caveat that LETM is probably less specific and can be observed in children with MS or ADEM. Current therapeutic options are similar to those of NMOSD for adults (see below). However, there is no FDA approved drug for pediatric patients with NMOSD. Q: What is the general approach to an NMO relapse? Is it different from an MS relapse? A: At the Mellen Center we treat NMO relapses urgently because of the rapidity, severity, as well as potential irreversibility of relapses in this disorder. Brainstem and cervical cord involvement may lead to fulminant neurogenic respiratory failure. We also make sure the patient is started on long term disease therapy as well (See below). Intravenous corticosteroids are our initial treatment for an acute attack. The typical Mellen Center regimen is methylprednisolone 1000mg IV as a single daily dose on 3-5 consecutive days followed by an oral prednisone taper of one to 6 months depending on the severity of the attack and the maintenance immunotherapy plan. Patients with severe myelitis or brainstem symptoms should be given steroids in an inpatient setting.  We consider plasmapheresis as an early second line treatment with a low threshold in those with no or minimal response to corticosteroids or if the attack is severe. Q: Other than medication, what types of support are needed in an NMO relapse? A: Other considerations during an NMO relapse with spinal cord involvement include attention to skin hygiene, DVT prophylaxis, symptomatic treatment for painful spasms, and early physical therapy.  Patients with cervical cord and/or brainstem involvement may require close monitoring of pulmonary mechanics and cardiac telemetry. Tonic spasms following transverse myelitis can often effectively be treated with a low dose of carbamazepine. Central neuropathic pain is also more frequent in NMOSD and early involvement of a local pain team is helpful if typical neuropathic agents are not effective. A: Given the natural history of NMOSD, long-term immunotherapy is indicated as soon as the diagnosis is made to prevent recurrent relapses and disability accrual. Unlike MS where the risk of relapses diminishes with age, patients with NMOSD require long term immunotherapy-for decades and any decision to stop chronic immunotherapy must be taken with caution. Until recently, there was no approved medication for NMOSD, and all of the medications were used off label. In June 2019, the FDA approved eculizumab (Soliris) for treatment of adult patients with NMOSD who are seropositive for AQP4 IgG antibodies (16). Rituximab has been widely used off label as first-line treatment to prevent relapses in NMOSD, driven by robust effects in several retrospective studies and a recent small randomized control trial  (17). Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil have been used for years but prospective data in support of their efficacy are lacking. Other therapies, such as methotrexate, mitoxantrone, cyclo- phosphamide, and cyclosporine have less supporting data for use in NMOSD. Inebilizumab and Satralizumab showed positive outcomes in phase III with reduction in relapse rates between 70–90% but are not yet licensed or available outside of clinical trials at the time of this review. At the Mellen Center, we treat all patients with AQP4-Abs at their first attack with long-term immunosuppression. We also recommend initiating therapy with Eculizumab or Rituximab as a first line therapy for AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD. Rituximab has the potential benefits of infrequent administration, cost effectiveness and long-term efficacy and tolerability. Table 2 summarizes current treatment options.

Several important practice guidelines updates for MRI in MS have been published recently, including the 2017 revised McDonald’s Criteria[1], Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS network guidelines[2], and revised recommendations of the Consortium of MS Centers Task Force[3]. This document reflects updated recommendations per Mellen Center consensus based on review of the guidelines. A: When making the diagnosis of MS, brain and cervical spinal cord MRIs should be obtained in all cases unless specific contraindications. MRI is essential: to serve as a baseline evaluation and staging the disease process Q: Is an MRI required for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, or can other additional testing and clinical features suffice? A: Yes, MRI should be obtained in all patients unless there is a specific contraindication for obtaining the MRI (for example, presence of MRI-incompatible pacemaker or other electronic devices). In cases where MRIs cannot be obtained, we generally obtain as much supportive testing as possible. We are more cautious regarding the certainty of the diagnosis in such patients, and rely more heavily on lumbar puncture results and other supportive diagnostic testing results such as evoked potentials and optical coherence tomography. If the contraindication for MRI is removed at a later time, we would recommend obtaining an MRI at that point. Q: Do you ever diagnose MS in a patient with a normal MRI? A: Per 2017 McDonald criteria, in order to diagnose MS, there needs to be reasonable clinical suspicion, along with supportive MRI and paraclinical evidence. We would be hesitant to diagnosis MS in a patient with a good quality MRI (at least 1.5 Tesla magnet strength or above) showing a normal brain and spinal cord (cervical cord and thoracic cord). However, due to the potential limitations of conventional MRI, particularly with regard to grey matter pathology, there will be rare exceptions to this rule. In most cases, repeatedly normal imaging raises strong doubts about an MS diagnosis, particularly in a patient with long standing neurological disability. Q: When should an MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine be obtained? A: We recommend an initial cervical and thoracic spine MRI with and without contrast along with brain MRI in patients suspected of having MS, for diagnosis, to establish disease burden, and to monitor for asymptomatic spinal cord lesions[4,5]. Also, if symptoms or signs could be explained by spinal cord disease, then spinal cord MRI is required to evaluate for non-MS cord pathology. Spinal MRI provides increased specificity in patients with an abnormal brain MRI and increased sensitivity in patients with a negative brain MRI. This is particularly true in cases where there are non-specific white matter changes due to cerebrovascular risk factors and/or spinal cord compression from degenerative disc disease. Presence of spinal cord lesions have been shown to predict long term disability in patients with CIS and early RRMS[6,7] and therefore this is an important factor in treatment planning. Due to potential issues of artifact and patient motion, the quality of scans is particularly important with spinal MRI. Typically, higher field strengths (1.5 Tesla or higher) are preferred for spinal cord MRI. Routine follow up scans of spinal cord for disease monitoring purposes is recommended but can be challenging due to small anatomical area involved and physiological artifacts that commonly affect quality of the scans. Q: In which circumstances should a follow-up MRI scan be obtained? A: It can be useful to monitor sub-clinical disease as well as response to therapy by obtaining MRIs periodically during the course of routine follow up care of MS patients. We obtain repeat MRI in the following circumstances: Patients with an MRI typical for MS, in whom we are initiating disease modifying therapy. This serves as a baseline for monitoring therapy. Patients on disease modifying therapy. MRI for re-establishing baseline can be obtained at 6 months after disease modifying therapy initiation, and thereafter every 6-12 months individualized according to disease severity, activity when disease modifying therapies are started, as well as type of disease modifying medication (please see the individual Mellen Approaches for the timing of onset of therapeutic effect with each therapy). Patients with clinically isolated syndrome, radiologically isolated syndrome who need MRI follow up for diagnosis. MS patients who decline therapy, but need monitoring to determine disease activity for future treatment recommendations. Patients with a very active initial MRI in which close follow up is needed to assess for radiological stabilization after starting treatment. Q: Do you recommend an MRI during a relapse of MS? A: MRIs are not required to diagnose relapses. We do not generally obtain an MRI of the brain or spinal cord during an MS relapse if the symptoms and signs are consistent with MS and there are no atypical features. The exceptions to this rule would be if the patient is on immunomodulating therapies that increase the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In addition, if the patient has an altered level of consciousness or other problems such as a severe headache, sudden stroke-like onset, etc., then we would obtain an MRI as soon as possible. Patients whom we are considering switching disease modifying therapy should also obtain MRIs. Q: What is the Mellen approach to a radiologically-isolated syndrome (RIS), or the incidental finding of classic MS by MRI including enhancing lesions with no clinical symptoms or mild or atypical symptoms? A: We recommend clinical and imaging follow-up in these situations, depending on the extent and inflammatory nature of the findings. A portion of these individuals will go on to develop clinical signs and symptoms of MS given a long enough time period. A longitudinal follow up study showed that RIS patients have approximately a one in three chance of converting to MS by year 5[8]. The presence of other factors, such as high brain lesion burden, brainstem or cerebellum lesions, spinal cord lesions, contrast-enhancing lesions, CSF oligoclonal bands, or abnormal visual evoked potentials, increase the likelihood of developing clinically definite MS[5], for which treatment with disease modifying therapy may be considered, with benefits and risks to be carefully weighed. Q: What are the technical requirements for obtaining an MRI of the brain and spine? A: In compliance with published Consortium of MS Centers MRI standardize guidelines, all MRIs should be obtained on machines of at least 1.5 Tesla strength. At Mellen Center, we prefer all MRIs to be performed on 3 Tesla strength machines, especially for spinal cord MRI as higher field strength MRI improves resolution and may increase yield in terms of lesion counts. If 3D acquisition possible: 3D sagittal T2 FLAIR, 3D T2 weighted sequence, 2D axial diffusion weighted sequence, 3D T1 MPRAGE, axial T1 spin echo post-contrast sequence (if needed). If unable to perform 3D: 2D axial and sagittal FLAIR, axial fast spin echo T2-weighted sequence, 2D axial diffusion weighted sequence, sagittal T1 spin echo sequence, axial T1 weighted post-contrast sequence (if needed). Sagittal T2 weighted sequence, sagittal STIR sequence, sagittal T1 weighted sequence, axial T1 weighted sequence, axial T2 weighted sequence, axial and sagittal T1 weighted post-contrast sequences (if needed) Detailed parameters are available on Consortium of MS Centers website [3]. We further recommend that follow-up MRIs be obtained on the same magnet and with similar software, to allow for ‘apples to apples’ comparisons rather than attempting comparing slices obtained with gaps to those obtained with no gaps, etc. If contrast is administered for brain MRI, the same dose can be used for post-contrast imaging in the spinal cord as well. For quantitative analysis such as tissue volume and lesion size, generally 3D sequences are optimal. Volumetric analysis is typically best accomplished using a 3D T2 FLAIR and T1 MPRAGE or equivalent sequence. Lower field open-MRI scanners are not recommended except in special circumstances (i.e. claustrophobia, implanted devices). Q: What are the technical requirements for obtaining an MRI of the orbit? Orbit MRI is not required in asymptomatic patients. However, this may be necessary to confirm optic neuritis or evaluate for other etiologies involving the visual system (e.g., sarcoidosis, compressive lesions, neuromyelitis optica). Coronal STIR or fat-suppressed T2, and post-contrast fat-suppressed T1 with coverage through optic chiasm are the minimal sequences recommended in the Consortium of MS Centers guidelines [3]. Q: What is the role of contrast agents and their safety? A: In general contrast agents are safe and we prefer to obtain MRI of the brain and spinal cord with a gadolinium-based contrast agent as an initial diagnostic strategy. Contrast-enhancing lesions assist in satisfying diagnostic criteria of dissemination in time in patients suspected of having MS. They are validated imaging biomarkers of new inflammatory activity, and assist in ensuring that alternative diagnoses are thoroughly evaluated. The use of IV contrast agents increases the yield of MRI in detecting active lesions and new T2 lesions. Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of new or enlarging T2 lesions on follow up scans is sufficient as a surrogate for subclinical disease activity and progression [9], and did not perform worse than post-contrast T1 scans at detecting interval change [10]. Also, standardized MRI protocols and high-quality comparable scans between follow-ups increase sensitivity for the evaluation of disease progression.  Contrast can cause allergic reactions that should be treated per standard protocols. Contrast should be generally avoided in pregnancy, although there are no reported adverse effects of contrast on the fetus. It is recommended that a serum creatinine be obtained in individuals as indicated by institutional and American College of Radiology guidelines. We follow our institution’s policy for hydration and use of contrast in these patients, which are based on age, GFR, and the presence of risk factors such as diabetes, known renal disease, etc. Contrast can rarely cause nephrogenic sclerosing fibrosis, but this is seen only in patients with severe renal disease and only in a small fraction of patients treated with contrast. Although gadolinium deposition has been reported in brain and other tissues of patients with normal renal function following administration of contrast, there are no known diseases or disorders associated with this finding [11]. We only use macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents (as opposed to linear agents) due to its lower risk of associated gadolinium deposition in body tissues. Of note, there are no current FDA restrictions on gadolinium-based contrast agent use. The FDA is currently investigating the risk associated with brain deposits following repeated doses of gadolinium-based contrast agents for MRI, and we await further guidance from the FDA on this issue. Our current approach is to carefully assess the risks and benefit for MRI imaging with contrast and where possible to defer contrast use. For example, in established MS patients with routine MRI scans every 6-12 months, new T2 lesions and/or enlarged T2 lesions can serve as indicators of disease activity. Q: Can you obtain an MRI in pregnancy or in a woman who is breast feeding? A: According to the most recent American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines [12], there are no precautions or contraindications for non-contrast MRI in pregnant women. There are very rare situations that require obtaining an MRI in a pregnant woman with MS. As mentioned above, the use of contrast is generally avoided during pregnancy, although there is not an absolute contraindication to its use. As very small amounts of gadolinium (<0.04% of the administered dose) is excreted into breast milk, patients who are breast feeding do not need to express their milk after receiving contrast and can continue breast feeding as usual. Q: Can you perform MRI in MS patients with intrathecal pumps and other implanted devices? A: We have a protocol for scanning patients who have implanted baclofen pumps. In general, the pump is deactivated by the MRI, and then restarts automatically, but this should always be checked by qualified personnel after the MRI scan. There are conditional protocols that can allow patients with certain deep brain, spine, vagal nerve and bladder stimulators to have MRI scans using specifically approved protocols. We recommend significant caution in scanning these individuals. MRI staff need to review the information for each specific device with regards to MRI compatibility, as protocols and restrictions are evolving with time. Q: When do you scan patients on natalizumab or other immunomodulating therapies that may increase the risk of PML? What is the protocol you recommend? A: At each natalizumab infusion visit the TOUCH program requires questioning about new symptoms which might indicate the presence of PML. Early detection of PML improves survival and neurological functional outcomes. We perform MRI of the brain with and without contrast as soon as possible if there are clinical changes of concern in such patients. For routine surveillance, we also obtain routine brain MRIs to assess for clinical efficacy and monitor for PML (for low risk patients, every 6-12 months, for high risk patients, every 3-4 months). As other immunomodulating therapies that may increase PML risk are used, a similar approach should be used. We recommend at least a 3D sagittal FLAIR sequence (or 2D axial and sagittal FLAIR sequence), and a 2D axial diffusion weighted sequence; post-contrast T1 images may be obtained depending on clinical and radiographic suspicion for PML, and/or PML-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes. No, but children younger than 9 years old may require general anesthesia for sedation.

Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). “I like to solve medical problems while at the same time communicating what we are doing with individual patients and families.” I was inspired to become a physician because my sister was stricken with polio and remained paralyzed when I was just five years old. That experience motivated me to want to care for people, and lead me to the field of neuroimmunology. I have since discovered a drug for multiple sclerosis, which is FDA approved. I would like to solve other diseases and make them past history, like polio, something we no longer fear. We have three other new drugs in clinical trials for diseases ranging from type 1 diabetes to progressive multiple sclerosis. Especialidades médicas y/o especialidades quirúrgicas Stanford University Dept of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 06/30/1974 Stanford University Neurology Residency, Palo Alto, CA, 06/30/1980 Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, 06/30/1976 Neurology, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology Biological Significance of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies: Lessons Learned From Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pathogenic and diagnostic relevance of cellular and humoral immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) and pertinent observations made in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).METHODS: Review of pertinent literature. RESULTS: There is at least 1 precedent for an antibody response against a viral pathogen that fails to provide host protection in the absence of immune-competent CD4+ T cells. PML is an infection of the CNS caused by JC virus (JCV), which commonly occurs during treatment with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody natalizumab. In this context, the humoral immune response fails to prevent JCV reactivation, and elevated anti-JCV serum indices are associated with a higher PML incidence. The more relevant immune-competent cells in host defense against JCV appear to be T cells. T cell-mediated responses are also detectable in convalescing patients with SARS-COV-2 irrespective of the humoral immune response.CONCLUSION: Based on pathogenic lessons learned from PML under natalizumab therapy, we suggest the incorporation of functional assays that determine neutralizing properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In addition, we outline the potential role of T-cell detection assays in determining herd immunity in a given population or in studying therapeutic responses to vaccines. Reduced development of COVID-19 in children reveals molecular checkpoints gating pathogenesis illuminating potential therapeutics. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Steinman, J. B., Lum, F. M., Ho, P. P., Kaminski, N., Steinman, L. The reduced development of COVID-19 for children compared to adults provides some tantalizing clues on the pathogenesis and transmissibility of this pandemic virus. First, ACE2, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor, is reduced in the respiratory tract in children. Second, coronavirus associated with common colds in children may offer some protection, due to cross-reactive humoral immunity and T cell immunity between common coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Third, T helper 2 immune responses are protective in children. Fourth, surprisingly, eosinophilia, associated with T helper 2, may be protective. Fifth, children generally produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, the influence of the downturn in the global economy, the impact of living in quarters among families who are the most at risk, and factors including the openings of some schools, are considered. Those most disadvantaged socioeconomically may suffer disproportionately with COVID-19. A sugar-coated strategy to treat a rare neurologic disease provides a blueprint for a decoy glycan therapeutic and a potential vaccine for CoViD-19: An Editorial Highlight for ""Selective inhibition of anti-MAG IgM autoantibody binding to myelin by an antigen specific glycopolymer""on https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15021. In a rare neurologic disease known as IgM monoclonal gammopathy the immune system targets a sulfated trisaccharide known as the Human Natural Killer-1 (HNK-1) epitope that comprises a constituent of the myelin sheath known as MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein). This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone withmultiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1trisaccharide.This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo--d-glucopyranuronate)-(13)--d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removedanti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic. Autoantibodies against central nervous system antigens in a subset of B cell-dominant multiple sclerosis patients. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Kuerten, S., Lanz, T. V., Lingampalli, N., Lahey, L. J., Kleinschnitz, C., Murer, M., Schroeter, M., Braune, S., Ziemssen, T., Ho, P. P., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with characteristic inflammatory lesions and demyelination. The clinical benefit of cell-depleting therapies targeting CD20 has emphasized the role of B cells and autoantibodies in MS pathogenesis. We previously introduced an enzyme-linked immunospot spot (ELISpot)-based assay to measure CNS antigen-specific B cells in the blood of MS patients and demonstrated its usefulness as a predictive biomarker for disease activity in measuring the successful outcome of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Here we used a planar protein array to investigate CNS-reactive antibodies in the serum of MS patients as well as in B cell culture supernatants after polyclonal stimulation. Anti-CNS antibody reactivity was evident in the sera of the MS cohort, and the antibodies bound a heterogeneous set of molecules, including myelin, axonal cytoskeleton, and ion channel antigens, in individual patients. Immunoglobulin reactivity in supernatants of stimulated B cells was directed against a broad range of CNS antigens. A group of MS patients with a highly active B cell component was identified by the ELISpot assay. Those antibody reactivities remained stable over time. These assays with protein arrays identify MS patients with a highly active B cell population with antibodies directed against a swathe of CNS proteins. Epstein-Barr Virus in Multiple Sclerosis: Theory and Emerging Immunotherapies. Bar-Or, A., Pender, M. P., Khanna, R., Steinman, L., Hartung, H., Maniar, T., Croze, E., Aftab, B. T., Giovannoni, G., Joshi, M. J. New treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) focused on B cells have created an atmosphere of excitement in the MS community. B cells are now known to play a major role in disease, demonstrated by the highly impactful effect of a B cell-depleting antibody on controlling MS. The idea that a virus may play a role in the development of MS has a long history and is supported mostly by studies demonstrating a link between B cell-tropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and disease onset. Efforts to develop antiviral strategies for treating MS are underway. Although gaps remain in our understanding of the etiology of MS, the role, if any, of viruses in propagating pathogenic immune responses deserves attention. Antigen-specific tolerance to self-antigens in protein replacement therapy, gene therapy and autoimmunity. Steinman, L., Ho, P. P., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Villoslada, P. Trials of antigen-specific tolerance have been undertaken in the clinic for over fifty years and the results of these antigen-specific clinical trials are described in this review. Antigen-specific tolerization of the immune system in protein replacement therapy for hemophilia A is an accepted treatment. Clinical trials are ongoing for autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and rheumatoid arthritis with various antigen-specific strategies. Trials for tolerization in celiac disease aim for antigen specific tolerance to gluten, an environmental trigger, which may then halt the progression to autoimmunity targeting a self-antigen, tissue transglutaminase. Although many promising approaches have been demonstrated in pre-clinical models, this review will focus primarily on clinical trials of antigen-specific tolerance that have been taken to the clinic and with initial results reported in the peer reviewed literature. A separate article on approaches with CAR-T cells appears in this volume. Small Heat Shock Proteins, Amyloid Fibrils, and Nicotine Stimulate a Common Immune Suppressive Pathway with Implications for Future Therapies Rothbard, J. B., Kurnellas, M. P., Ousman, S.

View details for Immune tolerance in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Neuromyelitis Optica by peptide-loaded tolerogenic dendritic cells: final results of the phase 1b clinical trial and extension Zubizarreta, I., Florez-Grau, G., Vila, G., Cabezon, R., Espana, C., Andorra, M., Saiz, A., Llufriu, S., Sepulveda, M., Sola, N., Martinez-Lapiscina, E., Pulido Valdeolivas, I., Casanova, B., Martinez Gines, M., Tellez, N., Oreja-Guevara, C., Espanol, M., Cid, J., Juan, M., Lozano, M., Blanco Morgado, Y., Steinman, L., Benitez, D., Villoslada, P. View details for Immune tolerance in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica with peptide-loaded tolerogenic dendritic cells in a phase 1b trial. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Zubizarreta, I., Florez-Grau, G., Vila, G., Cabezon, R., Espana, C., Andorra, M., Saiz, A., Llufriu, S., Sepulveda, M., Sola-Valls, N., Martinez-Lapiscina, E. H., Pulido-Valdeolivas, I., Casanova, B., Martinez Gines, M., Tellez, N., Oreja-Guevara, C., Espanol, M., Trias, E., Cid, J., Juan, M., Lozano, M., Blanco, Y., Steinman, L., Benitez-Ribas, D., Villoslada, P. There are adaptive T-cell and antibody autoimmune responses to myelin-derived peptides in multiple sclerosis (MS) and to aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs). Strategies aimed at antigen-specific tolerance to these autoantigens are thus indicated for these diseases. One approach involves induction of tolerance with engineered dendritic cells (tolDCs) loaded with specific antigens. We conducted an in-human phase 1b clinical trial testing increasing concentrations of autologous tolDCs loaded with peptides from various myelin proteins and from AQP4. We tested this approach in 12 patients, 8 with MS and 4 with NMOSD. The primary end point was the safety and tolerability, while secondary end points were clinical outcomes (relapses and disability), imaging (MRI and optical coherence tomography), and immunological responses. Therapy with tolDCs was well tolerated, without serious adverse events and with no therapy-related reactions. Patients remained stable clinically in terms of relapse, disability, and in various measurements using imaging. We observed a significant increase in the production of IL-10 levels in PBMCs stimulated with the peptides as well as an increase in the frequency of a regulatory T cell, known as Tr1, by week 12 of follow-up. In this phase 1b trial, we concluded that the i.v. administration of peptide-loaded dendritic cells is safe and feasible. Elicitation of specific IL-10 production by peptide-specific T cells in MS and NMOSD patients indicates that a key element in antigen specific tolerance is activated with this approach. The results warrant further clinical testing in larger trials. Small Heat Shock Proteins, Amyloid Fibrils, and Nicotine Stimulate a Common Immune Suppressive Pathway with Implications for Future Therapies. Rothbard, J. B., Kurnellas, M. P., Ousman, S. S., Brownell, S., Rothbard, J. J., Steinman, L. The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) is central to the anti-inflammatory function of the vagus nerve in a physiological mechanism termed the inflammatory reflex. Studies on the inflammatory reflex have been instrumental for the current development of the field of bioelectronic medicine. An independent investigation of the biological role of alphaB-crystallin (HspB5), the most abundant gene transcript present in active multiple sclerosis lesions in human brains, also led to alpha7nAChR. Induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in HspB5-/- mice results in greater paralytic signs, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and T-lymphocyte activation relative to wild-type animals. Administration of HspB5 was therapeutic in animal models of multiple sclerosis, retinal and cardiac ischemia, and stroke. Structure-activity studies established that residues 73-92 were as potent as the parent protein, but only when it formed amyloid fibrils. Amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) selectively bound alpha7nAChR on peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) and B lymphocytes, converting the MPhis to an immune suppressive phenotype and mobilizing the migration of both cell types from the peritoneum to secondary lymph organs. Here, we review multiple aspects of this work, which may be of interest for developing future therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis and other disorders. Engineered DNA plasmid reduces immunity to dystrophin while improving muscle force in a model of gene therapy of Duchenne dystrophy. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Ho, P. P., Lahey, L. J., Mourkioti, F., Kraft, P. E., Filareto, A., Brandt, M., Magnusson, K. E., Finn, E. E., Chamberlain, J. S., Robinson, W. H., Blau, H. M., Steinman, L. In gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy there are two potential immunological obstacles. An individual with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has a genetic mutation in dystrophin, and therefore the wild-type protein is ""foreign,"" and thus potentially immunogenic. The adeno-associated virus serotype-6 (AAV6) vector for delivery of dystrophin is a viral-derived vector with its own inherent immunogenicity. We have developed a technology where an engineered plasmid DNA is delivered to reduce autoimmunity. We have taken this approach into humans, tolerizing to myelin proteins in multiple sclerosis and to proinsulin in type 1 diabetes. Here, we extend this technology to a model of gene therapy to reduce the immunogenicity of the AAV vector and of the wild-type protein product that is missing in the genetic disease. Following gene therapy with systemic administration of recombinant AAV6-microdystrophin to mdx/mTRG2 mice, we demonstrated the development of antibodies targeting dystrophin and AAV6 capsid in control mice. Treatment with the engineered DNA construct encoding microdystrophin markedly reduced antibody responses to dystrophin and to AAV6. Muscle force in the treated mice was also improved compared with control mice. These data highlight the potential benefits of administration of an engineered DNA plasmid encoding the delivered protein to overcome critical barriers in gene therapy to achieve optimal functional gene expression. An amyloidogenic hexapeptide derived from amylin attenuates inflammation and acute lung injury in murine sepsis Mahapatra, S., Ying, L., Ho, P., Kurnellas, M., Rothbard, J., Steinman, L., Cornfield, D. N. Although the accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins in neuroinflammatory conditions is generally considered pathologic, in a murine model of multiple sclerosis, amyloid-forming fibrils, comprised of hexapeptides, are anti-inflammatory. Whether these molecules modulate systemic inflammatory conditions remains unknown. We hypothesized that an amylin hexapeptide that forms fibrils can attenuate the systemic inflammatory response in a murine model of sepsis. To test this hypothesis, mice were pre-treated with either vehicle or amylin hexapeptide (20 g) at 12 hours and 6 hours prior to intraperitoneal (i.p.) lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 mg/kg) administration. Illness severity and survival were monitored every 6 hours for 3 days. Levels of pro- (IL-6, TNF-, IFN-) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines were measured via ELISA at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after LPS (i.p.). As a metric of lung injury, pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) barrier function was tested 24 hours after LPS administration by comparing lung wet-to-dry ratios, Evan's blue dye (EBD) extravasation, lung histology and caspase-3 activity. Compared to controls, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide significantly reduced mortality (p<0.05 at 72 h), illness severity (p<0.05), and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, while IL-10 levels were elevated (p<0.05). Amylin pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, as demonstrated by decreased lung water and caspase-3 activity (p<0.05, versus PBS). Hence, in a murine model of systemic inflammation, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide reduced mortality, disease severity, and preserved lung barrier function. Amylin hexapeptide may represent a novel therapeutic tool to mitigate sepsis severity and lung injury. Molecular signature of Epstein-Barr virus infection in MS brain lesions. Moreno, M. A., Or-Geva, N., Aftab, B. T., Khanna, R., Croze, E., Steinman, L., Han, M. H. Objective: We sought to confirm the presence and frequency of B cells and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (latent and lytic phase) antigens in archived MS and non-MS brain tissue by immunohistochemistry.Methods: We quantified the type and location of B-cell subsets within active and chronic MS brain lesions in relation to viral antigen expression. The presence of EBV-infected cells was further confirmed by in situ hybridization to detect the EBV RNA transcript, EBV-encoded RNA-1 (EBER-1).Results: We report the presence of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) in 93% of MS and 78% of control brains, with a greater percentage of MS brains containing CD138+ plasma cells and LMP-1-rich populations. Notably, 78% of chronic MS lesions and 33.3% of non-MS brains contained parenchymal CD138+ plasma cells. EBV early lytic protein, EBV immediate-early lytic gene (BZLF1), was also observed in 46% of MS, primarily in association with chronic lesions and 44% of non-MS brain tissue. Furthermore, 85% of MS brains revealed frequent EBER-positive cells, whereas non-MS brains seldom contained EBER-positive cells. EBV infection was detectable, by immunohistochemistry and by in situ hybridization, in both MS and non-MS brains, although latent virus was more prevalent in MS brains, while lytic virus was restricted to chronic MS lesions.Conclusions: Together, our observations suggest an uncharacterized link between the EBV virus life cycle and MS pathogenesis. Identification of a common immune regulatory pathway induced by small heat shock proteins, amyloid fibrils, and nicotine. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Rothbard, J. B., Rothbard, J. J., Soares, L., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Although certain dogma portrays amyloid fibrils as drivers of neurodegenerative disease and neuroinflammation, we have found, paradoxically, that amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). They reduce clinical paralysis and induce immunosuppressive pathways, diminishing inflammation. A key question was the identification of the target for these molecules. When sHsps and amyloid fibrils were chemically cross-linked to immune cells, a limited number of proteins were precipitated, including the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 NAChR). The alpha7 NAChR is noteworthy among the over 20 known receptors for amyloid fibrils, because it plays a central role in a well-defined immune-suppressive pathway. Competitive binding between amyloid fibrils and alpha-bungarotoxin to peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) confirmed the involvement of alpha7 NAChR. The mechanism of immune suppression was explored, and, similar to nicotine, amyloid fibrils inhibited LPS induction of a common set of inflammatory cytokines while inducing Stat3 signaling and autophagy. Consistent with this, previous studies have established that nicotine, sHsps, and amyloid fibrils all were effective therapeutics in EAE. Interestingly, B lymphocytes were needed for the therapeutic effect. These results suggest that agonists of alpha7 NAChR might have therapeutic benefit for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Blocking immune intrusion into the brain suppresses epilepsy in Rasmussen's encephalitis model Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is a neuroinflammatory disease that typically affects only one hemisphere of the brain, resulting in severe seizures. Sixty years after the disease was first described, the preferred and best treatment option for RE is grotesque and involves removing a hemisphere of the brain (hemispherectomy); therefore, a better understanding of this seizure disorder may provide additional, less invasive therapeutic options. In this issue of the JCI, Carmant and colleagues have developed an animal model of this focal seizure disorder. The model provides experimental insights into the pathogenesis of RE and potential new treatments for this disease. View details for Single-cell mass cytometry reveals distinct populations of brain myeloid cells in mouse neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration models. Ajami, B., Samusik, N., Wieghofer, P., Ho, P. P., Crotti, A., Bjornson, Z., Prinz, M., Fantl, W. J., Nolan, G. P., Steinman, L. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration may represent two poles of brain pathology. Brain myeloid cells, particularly microglia, play key roles in these conditions. We employed single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to compare myeloid cell populations in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, the R6/2 model of Huntington's disease (HD) and the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We identified three myeloid cell populations exclusive to the CNS and present in each disease model. Blood-derived monocytes comprised five populations and migrated to the brain in EAE, but not in HD and ALS models. Single-cell analysis resolved differences in signaling and cytokine production within similar myeloid populations in EAE compared to HD and ALS models. Moreover, these analyses highlighted alpha5 integrin on myeloid cells as a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation. Together, these findings illustrate how neuropathology may differ between inflammatory and degenerative brain disease. Narcolepsy and influenza vaccination-induced autoimmunity A Journey in Science: The Privilege of Exploring the Brain and the Immune System. Real innovations in medicine and science are historic and singular; the stories behind each occurrence are precious. At Molecular Medicine we have established the Anthony Cerami Award in Translational Medicine to document and preserve these histories. The monographs recount the seminal events as told in the voice of the original investigators who provided the crucial early insight. These essays capture the essence of discovery, chronicling the birth of ideas that created new fields of research; and launched trajectories that persisted and ultimately influenced how disease is prevented, diagnosed, and treated. In this volume, the Cerami Award Monograph is by Lawrence Steinman, MD, of Stanford University in California. A visionary in the field of neurology, this is the story of Dr. Steinman's scientific journey. View details for Obeticholic acid, a synthetic bile acid agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Bile acids are ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The bile acid-FXR interaction regulates bile acid synthesis, transport, and cholesterol metabolism. Recently, bile acid-FXR regulation has been reported to play an integral role in both hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and in atherosclerosis. In this study, we found that FXR knockout mice had more disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Obeticholic acid (6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, 6-ECDCA), a synthetic FXR agonist, is an orally available drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. When we treated mice exhibiting established EAE with 6-ECDCA, or the natural FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), clinical disease was ameliorated by (i) suppressing lymphocyte activation and proinflammatory cytokine production; (ii) reducing CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cell populations and their expression of negative checkpoint regulators programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); (iii) increasing CD8(+) T cells and PD1, PDl-1, and BTLA expression; and (iv) reducing VLA-4 expression in both the T- and B-cell populations. Moreover, adoptive transfer of 6-ECDCA- or CDCA-treated donor cells failed to transfer disease in naive recipients. Thus, we show that FXR functions as a negative regulator in neuroinflammation and we highlight that FXR agonists represent a potential previously unidentified therapy for MS. View details for Amyloid fibrils activate B-1a lymphocytes to ameliorate inflammatory brain disease PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Kurnellas, M. P., Ghosn, E. E., Schartner, J. M., Baker, J., Rothbard, J. J., Negrin, R. S., Herzenberg, L. A., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Amyloid fibrils composed of peptides as short as six amino acids are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reducing paralysis and inflammation, while inducing several pathways of immune suppression. Intraperitoneal injection of fibrils selectively activates B-1a lymphocytes and two populations of resident macrophages (Ms), increasing IL-10 production, and triggering their exodus from the peritoneum. The importance of IL-10-producing B-1a cells in this effective therapy was established in loss-of-function experiments where neither B-cell-deficient (MT) nor IL10(-/-) mice with EAE responded to the fibrils. In gain-of-function experiments, B-1a cells, adoptively transferred to MT mice with EAE, restored their therapeutic efficacy when Amylin 28-33 was administered. Stimulation of adoptively transferred bioluminescent Ms and B-1a cells by amyloid fibrils resulted in rapid (within 60 min of injection) trafficking of both cell types to draining lymph nodes. Analysis of gene expression indicated that the fibrils activated the CD40/B-cell receptor pathway in B-1a cells and induced a set of immune-suppressive cell-surface proteins, including BTLA, IRF4, and Siglec G. Collectively, these data indicate that the fibrils activate B-1a cells and F4/80(+) Ms, resulting in their migration to the lymph nodes, where IL-10 and cell-surface receptors associated with immune-suppression limit antigen presentation and T-cell activation. These mechanisms culminate in reduction of paralytic signs of EAE. Antibodies to influenza nucleoprotein cross-react with human hypocretin receptor 2 Ahmed, S. S., Volkmuth, W., Duca, J., Corti, L., Pallaoro, M., Pezzicoli, A., Karle, A., Rigat, F., Rappuoli, R., Narasimhan, V., Julkunen, I., Vuorela, A., Vaarala, O., Nohynek, H., Pasini, F. L., Montomoli, E., Trombetta, C., Adams, C. M., Rothbard, J., Steinman, L. The sleep disorder narcolepsy is linked to the HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype and dysregulation of the hypocretin ligand-hypocretin receptor pathway. Narcolepsy was associated with Pandemrix vaccination (an adjuvanted, influenza pandemic vaccine) and also with infection by influenza virus during the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic. In contrast, very few cases were reported after Focetria vaccination (a differently manufactured adjuvanted influenza pandemic vaccine). We hypothesized that differences between these vaccines (which are derived from inactivated influenza viral proteins) explain the association of narcolepsy with Pandemrix-vaccinated subjects. A mimic peptide was identified from a surface-exposed region of influenza nucleoprotein A that shared protein residues in common with a fragment of the first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2. A significant proportion of sera from HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype-positive narcoleptic Finnish patients with a history of Pandemrix vaccination (vaccine-associated narcolepsy) contained antibodies to hypocretin receptor 2 compared to sera from nonnarcoleptic individuals with either 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza infection or history of Focetria vaccination. Antibodies from vaccine-associated narcolepsy sera cross-reacted with both influenza nucleoprotein and hypocretin receptor 2, which was demonstrated by competitive binding using 21-mer peptide (containing the identified nucleoprotein mimic) and 55-mer recombinant peptide (first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2) on cell lines expressing human hypocretin receptor 2. Mass spectrometry indicated that relative to Pandemrix, Focetria contained 72.7% less influenza nucleoprotein. In accord, no durable antibody responses to nucleoprotein were detected in sera from Focetria-vaccinated nonnarcoleptic subjects. Thus, differences in vaccine nucleoprotein content and respective immune response may explain the narcolepsy association with Pandemrix. View details for No quiet surrender: molecular guardians in multiple sclerosis brain The brain under immunological attack does not surrender quietly. Investigation of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) reveals a coordinated molecular response involving various proteins and small molecules ranging from heat shock proteins to small lipids, neurotransmitters, and even gases, which provide protection and foster repair. Reduction of inflammation serves as a necessary prerequisite for effective recovery and regeneration. Remarkably, many lesion-resident molecules activate pathways leading to both suppression of inflammation and promotion of repair mechanisms. These guardian molecules and their corresponding physiologic pathways could potentially be exploited to silence inflammation and repair the injured and degenerating brain and spinal cord in both relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MS and may be beneficial in other neurologic and psychiatric conditions. View details for Mechanisms of action of therapeutic amyloidogenic hexapeptides in amelioration of inflammatory brain disease. Kurnellas, M. P., Schartner, J. M., Fathman, C. G., Jagger, A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Amyloid fibrils composed of peptides as short as six amino acids are effective therapeutics for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunosuppression arises from at least two pathways: (1) expression of type 1 IFN by pDCs, which were induced by neutrophil extracellular traps arising from the endocytosis of the fibrils; and (2) the reduced expression of IFN-, TNF, and IL-6. The two independent pathways stimulated by the fibrils can act in concert to be immunosuppressive in Th1 indications, or in opposition, resulting in inflammation when Th17 T lymphocytes are predominant. The generation of type 1 IFN can be minimized by using polar, nonionizable, amyloidogenic peptides, which are effective in both Th1 and Th17 polarized EAE. Immunology of Relapse and Remission in Multiple Sclerosis Eighty percent of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) initially develop a clinical pattern with periodic relapses followed by remissions, called relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). This period of fluctuating disease may last for a decade or more. Clinical relapses reflect acute inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and spinal cord. Often, different anatomic areas in the CNS are involved each time a relapse occurs, resulting in varied clinical manifestations in each instance. Relapses are nearly always followed by some degree of remission, though recovery to baseline status before the flare is often incomplete. There are nine approved drugs for treatment of RRMS. The most potent drug for inhibiting relapses, the humanized anti-4 integrin antibody known as Natalizumab, blocks homing of mononuclear cells to the CNS. The mechanisms of action of the approved drugs for RRMS provide a strong foundation for understanding the pathobiology of the relapse. Despite substantial progress in controlling relapses with the current armamentarium of medications, there is much to learn and ever more effective and safe therapies to develop.

S., Wu, L., Acharya, S., Arac, A., Blaho, V. A., Huang, Y., Moon, B. S., Axtell, R. C., Ho, P. P., Steinberg, G. K., Lewis, D. B., Sobel, R. A., Han, D. K., Steinman, L., Snyder, M. P., Hla, T., Han, M. H. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs into systemic circulation. The sphingosine phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist FTY-720 (Gilenya) arrests immune trafficking and prevents multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. However, alternative mechanisms of S1P-S1P1 signaling have been reported. Phosphoproteomic analysis of MS brain lesions revealed S1P1 phosphorylation on S351, a residue crucial for receptor internalization. Mutant mice harboring an S1pr1 gene encoding phosphorylation-deficient receptors (S1P1(S5A)) developed severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) due to autoimmunity mediated by interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells (TH17 cells) in the peripheral immune and nervous system. S1P1 directly activated the Jak-STAT3 signal-transduction pathway via IL-6. Impaired S1P1 phosphorylation enhances TH17 polarization and exacerbates autoimmune neuroinflammation. These mechanisms may be pathogenic in MS. Plasmid-Encoded Proinsulin Preserves C-Peptide While Specifically Reducing Proinsulin-Specific CD8+ T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes. Roep, B. O., Solvason, N., Gottlieb, P. A., Abreu, J. R., Harrison, L. C., Eisenbarth, G. S., Yu, L., Leviten, M., Hagopian, W. A., Buse, J. B., von Herrath, M., Quan, J., King, R. S., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Garren, H., Steinman, L. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), there is an intense inflammatory response that destroys the cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, the site where insulin is produced and released. A therapy for T1D that targets the specific autoimmune response in this disease while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact, has long been sought. Proinsulin is a major target of the adaptive immune response in T1D. We hypothesized that an engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin (BHT-3021) would preserve cell function in T1D patients through reduction of insulin-specific CD8(+) T cells. We studied 80 subjects over 18 years of age who were diagnosed with T1D within the past 5 years. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive intramuscular injections of BHT-3021 or BHT-placebo, weekly for 12 weeks, and then monitored for safety and immune responses in a blinded fashion. Four dose levels of BHT-3021 were evaluated: 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg. C-peptide was used both as an exploratory efficacy measure and as a safety measure. Islet-specific CD8(+) T cell frequencies were assessed with multimers of monomeric human leukocyte antigen class I molecules loaded with peptides from pancreatic and unrelated antigens. No serious adverse events related to BHT-3021 were observed. C-peptide levels improved relative to placebo at all doses, at 1 mg at the 15-week time point (+19.5% BHT-3021 versus -8.8% BHT-placebo, P < 0.026). Proinsulin-reactive CD8(+) T cells, but not T cells against unrelated islet or foreign molecules, declined in the BHT-3021 arm (P < 0.006). No significant changes were noted in interferon-, interleukin-4 (IL-4), or IL-10 production in CD4 T cells. Thus, we demonstrate that a plasmid encoding proinsulin reduces the frequency of CD8(+) T cells reactive to proinsulin while preserving C-peptide over the course of dosing. Expansion of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells following SIRT1 inactivation in the adult brain. Rafalski, V. A., Ho, P. P., Brett, J. O., Ucar, D., Dugas, J. C., Pollina, E. A., Chow, L. M., Ibrahim, A., Baker, S. J., Barres, B. A., Steinman, L., Brunet, A. Oligodendrocytes-the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system-can be regenerated during adulthood. In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Amyloid Fibrils Composed of Hexameric Peptides Attenuate Neuroinflammation Kurnellas, M. P., Adams, C. M., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. The amyloid-forming proteins tau, B crystallin, and amyloid P protein are all found in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS). Our previous work established that amyloidogenic peptides from the small heat shock protein B crystallin (HspB5) and from amyloid fibrils, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, were therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reflecting aspects of the pathology of MS. To understand the molecular basis for the therapeutic effect, we showed a set of amyloidogenic peptides composed of six amino acids, including those from tau, amyloid A4, major prion protein (PrP), HspB5, amylin, serum amyloid P, and insulin B chain, to be anti-inflammatory and capable of reducing serological levels of interleukin-6 and attenuating paralysis in EAE. The chaperone function of the fibrils correlates with the therapeutic outcome. Fibrils composed of tau 623-628 precipitated 49 plasma proteins, including apolipoprotein B-100, clusterin, transthyretin, and complement C3, supporting the hypothesis that the fibrils are active biological agents. Amyloid fibrils thus may provide benefit in MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders. View details for A writing-intensive course improves biology undergraduates' perception and confidence of their abilities to read scientific literature and communicate science Most scientists agree that comprehension of primary scientific papers and communication of scientific concepts are two of the most important skills that we can teach, but few undergraduate biology courses make these explicit course goals. We designed an undergraduate neuroimmunology course that uses a writing-intensive format. Using a mixture of primary literature, writing assignments directed toward a layperson and scientist audience, and in-class discussions, we aimed to improve the ability of students to 1) comprehend primary scientific papers, 2) communicate science to a scientific audience, and 3) communicate science to a layperson audience. We offered the course for three consecutive years and evaluated its impact on student perception and confidence using a combination of pre- and postcourse survey questions and coded open-ended responses. Students showed gains in both the perception of their understanding of primary scientific papers and of their abilities to communicate science to scientific and layperson audiences. These results indicate that this unique format can teach both communication skills and basic science to undergraduate biology students. We urge others to adopt a similar format for undergraduate biology courses to teach process skills in addition to content, thus broadening and strengthening the impact of undergraduate courses.

Inflammatory Cytokines at the Summits of Pathological Signal Cascades in Brain Diseases When considering the hierarchical organization of pathological signaling cascades in immunological disorders of the brain, certain cytokines might be considered pinnacles of pathophysiological importance, with their presence determining the appearance or the course of a particular disease. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor are critical for the pathogenesis of inflammation in specific brain disorders. Targeting these cytokines or their receptors can alter the course of several neurological diseases, but the effects may be beneficial or harmful.

Neuronal and Glial Protection: Are there guardian molecules that protect the nervous system in MS? 3. Predictive Medicine: With all the approved drugs, how can we rationally decide which one to use? 4. The Precise Scalpel vs. the Big Hammer for Therapy: Is antigen-specific therapy for demyelinating disease possible?

Journal of undergraduate neuroscience education : JUNE : a publication of FUN, Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience The discovery of natalizumab, a potent therapeutic for multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. There is strong evidence that an immune response in the brain is a critical component of the disease. In 1992, in a collaboration between academia and biotechnology, my colleagues and I showed that 4 integrin was the critical molecule involved in the homing of immune cells into the inflamed brain. Was it sheer luck that these results led to the development of a drug for MS?

V., Rajadas, J., Dolganov, G., Chopra, S., Schoolnik, G. K., Sobel, R. A., Webster, J., Ousman, S. S., Becker, R. A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. To determine whether the therapeutic activity of B crystallin, small heat shock protein B5 (HspB5), was shared with other human sHsps, a set of seven human family members, a mutant of HspB5 G120 known to exhibit reduced chaperone activity, and a mycobacterial sHsp were expressed and purified from bacteria. Each of the recombinant proteins was shown to be a functional chaperone, capable of inhibiting aggregation of denatured insulin with varying efficiency. When injected into mice at the peak of disease, they were all effective in reducing the paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Additional structure activity correlations between chaperone activity and therapeutic function were established when linear regions within HspB5 were examined. A single region, corresponding to residues 73-92 of HspB5, forms amyloid fibrils, exhibited chaperone activity, and was an effective therapeutic for encephalomyelitis. The linkage of the three activities was further established by demonstrating individual substitutions of critical hydrophobic amino acids in the peptide resulted in the loss of all of the functions. Reversal of Paralysis and Reduced Inflammation from Peripheral Administration of beta-Amyloid in T(H)1 and T(H)17 Versions of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Grant, J. L., Ghosn, E. E., Axtell, R. C., Herges, K., Kuipers, H. F., Woodling, N. S., Andreasson, K., Herzenberg, L. A., Herzenberg, L. A., Steinman, L. -Amyloid 42 (A42) and -amyloid 40 (A40), major components of senile plaque deposits in Alzheimer's disease, are considered neurotoxic and proinflammatory. In multiple sclerosis, A42 is up-regulated in brain lesions and damaged axons. We found, unexpectedly, that treatment with either A42 or A40 peptides reduced motor paralysis and brain inflammation in four different models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with attenuation of motor paralysis, reduction of inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), and suppression of lymphocyte activation. A42 and A40 treatments were effective in reducing ongoing paralysis induced with adoptive transfer of either autoreactive T helper 1 (T(H)1) or T(H)17 cells. High-dimensional 14-parameter flow cytometry of peripheral immune cell populations after in vivo A42 and A40 treatment revealed substantial modulations in the percentage of lymphoid and myeloid subsets during EAE. Major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were reduced in the blood after A peptide treatment. Protection conferred by A treatment did not require its delivery to the brain: Adoptive transfer with lymphocytes from donors treated with A42 attenuated EAE in wild-type recipient mice, and A deposition in the brain was not detected in treated EAE mice by immunohistochemical analysis. In contrast to the improvement in EAE with A treatment, EAE was worse in mice with genetic deletion of the amyloid precursor protein. Therefore, in the absence of A, there is exacerbated clinical EAE disease progression. Because A42 and A40 ameliorate experimental autoimmune inflammation targeting the CNS, we might now consider its potential anti-inflammatory role in other neuropathological conditions.

Comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic data from pathologically similar multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions reveals down-regulation of CD47 at the messenger RNA level and low abundance at the protein level. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that CD47 is expressed in normal myelin and in foamy macrophages and reactive astrocytes within active MS lesions. We demonstrate that CD47(-/-) mice are refractory to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), primarily as the result of failure of immune cell activation after immunization with myelin antigen. In contrast, blocking with a monoclonal antibody against CD47 in mice at the peak of paralysis worsens EAE severity and enhances immune activation in the peripheral immune system. In vitro assays demonstrate that blocking CD47 also promotes phagocytosis of myelin and that this effect is dependent on signal regulatory protein (SIRP-). Immune regulation and phagocytosis are mechanisms for CD47 signaling in autoimmune neuroinflammation. Depending on the cell type, location, and disease stage, CD47 has Janus-like roles, with opposing effects on EAE pathogenesis.

Z., Prat, A., Steinman, L., Dunn, S. E. Women develop certain autoimmune diseases more often than men. It has been hypothesized that this may relate to the development of more robust T-helper (Th)1 responses in women. To test whether women exhibit a Th1 bias, we isolated nave cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+) T cells from peripheral blood of healthy women and men and measured the proliferation and cytokine production by these cells in response to submaximal amounts of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. We observed that CD4(+) T cells from women produced higher levels of IFN as well as tended to proliferate more than male CD4(+) T cells. Intriguingly, male CD4(+) T cells instead had a predilection toward IL-17A production. This sex dichotomy in Th cytokine production was found to be even more striking in the Swiss/Jackson Laboratory (SJL) mouse. Studies in mice and humans indicated that the sexual dimorphism in Th1 and Th17 cytokine production was dependent on the androgen status and the T-cell expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) and PPAR. Androgens increased PPAR and decreased PPAR expression by human CD4(+) T cells. PPAR siRNA-mediated knockdown had the effect of increasing IFN by male CD4(+) T cells, while transfection of CD4(+) T cells with PPAR siRNAs increased IL-17A production uniquely by female T cells. Together, our observations indicate that human T cells exhibit a sex difference in the production of IFN and IL-17A that may be driven by expressions of PPAR and PPAR.

Lipids constitute 70% of the myelin sheath, and autoantibodies against lipids may contribute to the demyelination that characterizes multiple sclerosis (MS). We used lipid antigen microarrays and lipid mass spectrometry to identify bona fide lipid targets of the autoimmune response in MS brain, and an animal model of MS to explore the role of the identified lipids in autoimmune demyelination. We found that autoantibodies in MS target a phosphate group in phosphatidylserine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine derivatives. Administration of these lipids ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing activation and inducing apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, effects mediated by the lipids' saturated fatty acid side chains. Thus, phospholipids represent a natural anti-inflammatory class of compounds that have potential as therapeutics for MS. Protective effect of an elastase inhibitor in a neuromyelitis optica-like disease driven by a peptide of myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein Herges, K., de Jong, B.

The pathology of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), in contrast to multiple sclerosis, comprises granulocyte infiltrates along extensive lengths of spinal cord, as well as optic nerve. Furthermore, IFN- treatment worsens NMO. We recently found that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced with Th17 cells is exacerbated by IFN-, in contrast to disease induced with Th1 where treatment attenuated symptoms.This study demonstrates the similarities between NMO and Th17 EAE and how neutrophils mediate pathology in Th17 disease.Levels of blood biomarkers in NMO were assessed by Luminex and ELISA. Effects of IFN- on neutrophils were assessed by culture assays and immunofluorescence. EAE was induced by transfer of myelin-specific Th1 or Th17 cells and treated with Sivelestat sodium hydrate, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor.We show Th17 cytokines, granulocyte chemokines, type 1 interferon and neutrophil elastase are elevated in patients with definitive NMO. In culture, we find that IFN- stimulates neutrophils to release neutrophil elastase. In Th17 EAE, we demonstrate neutrophilic infiltration in the optic nerve and spinal cord which was not present in Th1 EAE. Blockade of neutrophil elastase with Sivelestat had efficacy in Th17 EAE but not Th1 EAE.The similarities between Th17 EAE and NMO indicate that this model represents several aspects of NMO. Neutrophils are critical in the pathologies of both Th17-EAE and NMO, and therefore blockade of neutrophil elastase is a promising target in treating NMO. View details for Therapeutic Effects of Systemic Administration of Chaperone alpha B-Crystallin Associated with Binding Proinflammatory Plasma Proteins Rothbard, J. B., Kurnellas, M. P., Brownell, S., Adams, C. M., Su, L., Axtell, R. C., Chen, R., Fathman, C. G., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. The therapeutic benefit of the small heat shock protein B-crystallin (HspB5) in animal models of multiple sclerosis and ischemia is proposed to arise from its increased capacity to bind proinflammatory proteins at the elevated temperatures within inflammatory foci. By mass spectral analysis, a common set of 70 ligands was precipitated by HspB5 from plasma from patients with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis and mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These proteins were distinguished from other precipitated molecules because they were enriched in the precipitate as compared with their plasma concentrations, and they exhibited temperature-dependent binding. More than half of these ligands were acute phase proteins or members of the complement or coagulation cascades. Consistent with this proposal, plasma levels of HspB5 were increased in patients with multiple sclerosis as compared with normal individuals. The combination of the thermal sensitivity of the HspB5 combined with the high local concentration of these ligands at the site of inflammation is proposed to explain the paradox of how a protein believed to exhibit nonspecific binding can bind with some relative apparent selectivity to proinflammatory proteins and thereby modulate inflammation.

Tissue plasminogen activator is the only treatment option for stroke victims; however, it has to be administered within 4.5 h after symptom onset, making its use very limited. This report describes a unique target for effective treatment of stroke, even 12 h after onset, by the administration of B-crystallin (Cryab), an endogenous immunomodulatory neuroprotectant. In Cryab(-/-) mice, there was increased lesion size and diminished neurologic function after stroke compared with wild-type mice. Increased plasma Cryab was detected after experimental stroke in mice and after stroke in human patients. Administration of Cryab even 12 h after experimental stroke reduced both stroke volume and inflammatory cytokines associated with stroke pathology. Cryab is an endogenous anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectant molecule produced after stroke, whose beneficial properties can be augmented when administered therapeutically after stroke.

Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is an important cause of acute vision loss in adults, and there is no effective treatment. We studied early changes following experimental AION and tested the benefit of a potential treatment.Materials andWe induced experimental AION in adult mice and tested the effects of short-term (daily for 3 days) and long-term (every other day for 3 weeks) B-crystallin (BC) treatment using histological and serial intracranial flash visual evoked potential recordings.One day after experimental AION, there was swelling at the optic nerve (ON) head and increased expression of BC, a small heat shock protein important in ischemia and inflammation. This upregulation coincided with microglial and astrocytic activation. Our hypothesis was that BC may be part of the endogenous protective mechanism against injury, thus we tested the effects of BC on experimental AION. Daily intraveneous or intravitreal BC injections did not improve visual evoked potential amplitude or latency at days 1-2. However, BC treatment decreased swelling and dampened the microglial and astrocytic activation on day 3. Longer treatment with intravenous BC led to acceleration of visual evoked potential latency over 3 weeks, without improving amplitude. This latency acceleration did not correlate with increased retinal ganglion cell survival but did correlate with complete rescue of the ON oligodendrocytes, which are important for myelination.We identified BC as an early marker following experimental AION. Treatment with BC enhanced this endogenous, post-ischemic response by decreasing microglial activation and promoting ON oligodendrocyte survival. View details for Interferon-beta exacerbates Th17-mediated inflammatory disease Interferon (IFN)- is the treatment most often prescribed for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). 30-50% of MS patients, however, do not respond to IFN-. In some cases, IFN- exacerbates MS, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO). To eliminate unnecessary treatment for patients who are non-responsive to IFN-, and to avoid possible harm, researchers are identifying biomarkers that predict treatment outcome before treatment is initiated. These biomarkers reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease. Recent discoveries on human samples from patients with RRMS, NMO, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis, indicate that IFN- is ineffective and might worsen clinical status in diverse diseases when a Th17 immune response is prominent.

J., Kurnellas, M., Mellins, E. D., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. For 15 y, B-crystallin (heat shock protein [Hsp] B5) has been labeled an autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS) based on humoral and cellular responses found in humans and animal models. However, there have been several scientific inconsistencies with this assignment, ranging from studies demonstrating small differences in anticrystallin responses between patients and healthy individuals to the inability of crystallin-specific T cells to induce symptoms of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in animal models. Experiments in this article demonstrate that the putative anti-HspB5 Abs from 23 MS patients cross-react with 7 other members of the human small Hsp family and were equally present in normal plasma. Biolayer interferometry demonstrates that the binding was temperature dependent, and that the calculated K(a) increased as the concentration of the sHsp decreased. These two patterns are characteristic of multiple binding sites with varying affinities, the composition of which changes with temperature, supporting the hypothesis that HspB5 bound the Ab and not the reverse. HspB5 also precipitated Ig heavy and L chains from sera from patients with MS. These results establish that small Hsps bind Igs with high affinity and refute much of the serological data used to assign B-crystallin as an autoantigen.

E., Bhat, R., Straus, D. S., Sobel, R. A., Axtell, R., Johnson, A., Nguyen, K., Mukundan, L., Moshkova, M., Dugas, J. C., Chawla, A., Steinman, L. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPAR-alpha, PPAR-delta, and PPAR-gamma) comprise a family of nuclear receptors that sense fatty acid levels and translate this information into altered gene transcription. Previously, it was reported that treatment of mice with a synthetic ligand activator of PPAR-delta, GW0742, ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating a possible role for this nuclear receptor in the control of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune inflammation. We show that mice deficient in PPAR-delta (PPAR-delta(-/-)) develop a severe inflammatory response during EAE characterized by a striking accumulation of IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(-) and IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(+) CD4(+) cells in the spinal cord. The preferential expansion of these T helper subsets in the CNS of PPAR-delta(-/-) mice occurred as a result of a constellation of immune system aberrations that included higher CD4(+) cell proliferation, cytokine production, and T-bet expression and enhanced expression of IL-12 family cytokines by myeloid cells. We also show that the effect of PPAR-delta in inhibiting the production of IFN-gamma and IL-12 family cytokines is ligand dependent and is observed in both mouse and human immune cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that PPAR-delta serves as an important molecular brake for the control of autoimmune inflammation. View details for Inverse vaccination, the opposite of Jenner's concept, for therapy of autoimmunity DNA-based vaccines to induce antigen-specific inhibition of immune responses in human autoimmune diseases represent the inverse of what Jenner intended when he invented vaccination. Jenner's vaccine induced antigen-specific immunity to small pox. DNA vaccines for autoimmunity have been developed in preclinical settings, and now tested in human trials. The first two clinical trials, one in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, and the other in type 1 diabetes indicate that specific inhibition of antigen-specific antibody and T-cell responses is attainable in humans. Further development of this approach is ongoing. This new version of immunization termed 'inverse vaccination' when applied to autoimmune diseases, may allow targeted reduction of unwanted antibody and T-cell responses to autoantigens, while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact. The method of specifically reducing a pathological adaptive autoimmune response is termed inverse vaccination.

IFN-beta was effective in reducing EAE symptoms induced by T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells but exacerbated disease induced by T(H)17 cells. Effective treatment in T(H)1-induced EAE correlated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by splenocytes. In T(H)17-induced disease, the amount of IL-10 was unaltered by treatment, although, unexpectedly, IFN-beta treatment still reduced IL-17 production without benefit. Both inhibition of IL-17 and induction of IL-10 depended on IFN-gamma. In the absence of IFN-gamma signaling, IFN-beta therapy was ineffective in EAE. In RRMS patients, IFN-beta nonresponders had higher IL-17F concentrations in serum compared to responders. Nonresponders had worse disease with more steroid usage and more relapses than did responders. Hence, IFN-beta is proinflammatory in T(H)17-induced EAE. Moreover, a high IL-17F concentration in the serum of people with RRMS is associated with nonresponsiveness to therapy with IFN-beta.

W., Steinman, L. GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, has a parallel inhibitory role in the immune system. We demonstrate that immune cells synthesize GABA and have the machinery for GABA catabolism. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) express functional GABA receptors and respond electrophysiologically to GABA. Thus, the immune system harbors all of the necessary constituents for GABA signaling, and GABA itself may function as a paracrine or autocrine factor. These observations led us to ask further whether manipulation of the GABA pathway influences an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Increasing GABAergic activity ameliorates ongoing paralysis in EAE via inhibition of inflammation. GABAergic agents act directly on APCs, decreasing MAPK signals and diminishing subsequent adaptive inflammatory responses to myelin proteins. View details for Innate and Adaptive Autoimmunity Directed to the Central Nervous System The immune system has two major components, an innate arm and an adaptive arm. Certain autoimmune diseases of the brain represent examples of disorders where one of these constituents plays a major role. Some rare autoimmune diseases involve activation of the innate arm and include chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome. In contrast, adaptive immunity is prominent in multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and the paraneoplastic syndromes where highly specific T cell responses and antibodies mediate these diseases. Studies of autoimmune brain disorders have aided in the elucidation of distinct neuronal roles played by key molecules already well known to immunologists (e.g., complement and components of the major histocompatibility complex). In parallel, molecules known to neurobiology and sensory physiology, including toll-like receptors, gamma amino butyric acid and the lens protein alpha B crystallin, have intriguing and distinct functions in the immune system, where they modulate autoimmunity directed to the brain.

M., Ho, P. P., Han, M. H., Lanz, T. V., Phillips, L. K., Goldstein, M. J., Bhat, R., Raine, C. S., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a major regulator of blood pressure. The octapeptide angiotensin II (AII) is proteolytically processed from the decapeptide AI by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and then acts via angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R). Inhibitors of ACE and antagonists of the AT1R are used in the treatment of hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We now show that the RAAS also plays a major role in autoimmunity, exemplified by multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using proteomics, we observed that RAAS is up-regulated in brain lesions of MS. AT1R was induced in myelin-specific CD4+ T cells and monocytes during autoimmune neuroinflammation. Blocking AII production with ACE inhibitors or inhibiting AII signaling with AT1R blockers suppressed autoreactive TH1 and TH17 cells and promoted antigen-specific CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) with inhibition of the canonical NF-kappaB1 transcription factor complex and activation of the alternative NF-kappaB2 pathway. Treatment with ACE inhibitors induces abundant CD4+FoxP3+ T cells with sufficient potency to reverse paralytic EAE. Modulation of the RAAS with inexpensive, safe pharmaceuticals used by millions worldwide is an attractive therapeutic strategy for application to human autoimmune diseases. View details for A molecular trio in relapse and remission in multiple sclerosis Two thirds of patients with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing-remitting form, which often progresses to more debilitating disease. Striking clinical recovery, termed remission, often follows these periodic neurological defects, termed relapses. Recent work has revealed the role of three key molecules in relapse and remission: alpha4beta1 integrin (also known as VLA4) is an adhesion molecule that mediates T cell migration from the blood into the brain; osteopontin binds to alpha4beta1 integrin, stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting apoptosis; and alphaB crystallin inhibits inflammation in the brain. This Review discusses how this molecular trio interacts to initiate relapses (in the case of osteopontin and alpha4beta1 integrin) and then to terminate them as remissions in multiple sclerosis (in the case of alphaB crystallin).

Insulin is a major target for the autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells during the pathogenesis of type I diabetes. A plasmid DNA vaccine encoding mouse proinsulin II reduced the incidence of diabetes in a mouse model of type I diabetes when administered to hyperglycemic (therapeutic mode) or normoglycemic (prophylactic mode) NOD mice. Therapeutic administration of proinsulin DNA was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the number of insulin-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells, whereas prophylactic treatment was accompanied by enhanced IFN-gamma-secreting cells and a decrease in insulin autoantibodies. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that the protection was not mediated by induction of CD25(+)/CD4(+) T regulatory cells. The efficacy of the DNA vaccine was enhanced by increasing the level of expression of the encoded Ag, more frequent dosing, increasing dose level, and localization of the protein product to the intracellular compartment. The efficacy data presented in this study demonstrate that Ag-specific plasmid DNA therapy is a viable strategy for preventing progression of type I diabetes and defines critical parameters of the dosing regime that influences tolerance induction. View details for Nuanced roles of cytokines in three major human brain disorders The three most prevalent human disorders of the CNS in which immunity and inflammation are likely to have vital roles (excluding infection of the CNS) are fever, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Alzheimer disease (AD). As reviewed here, cytokines are critical in the induction of fever, the pathogenesis of MS, and the pathobiology of AD. Indeed, antibodies targeting cytokines have been used as a therapy for individuals with unusual and persistent febrile reactions not responsive to common antipyretics, while a recombinant cytokine is the most popular treatment for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. Although cytokine-modulating therapies are not currently in clinical use for the treatment of AD, cytokines can ameliorate disease pathology in certain experimental models of AD, suggesting a potential for future therapeutic opportunities. View details for Some immunologists have characterized T helper (Th)17 T cells as the master mediators of tissue damage in a variety of pathological conditions. New data now demonstrate that Th1 and Th17 T cells are independently capable of inducing disease in two established models of autoimmunity. Thus, the role of Th17 cytokines as the central mediators of pathological tissue damage seems to require clarification.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of BHT-3009 in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and to confirm that BHT-3009 causes immune tolerance.BHT-3009 is a tolerizing DNA vaccine for MS, encoding full-length human myelin basic protein. Relapsing-remitting MS patients were randomized 1:1:1 into three groups: placebo, 0.5 mg BHT-3009, or 1.5 mg BHT-3009, given intramuscularly at weeks 0, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter until week 44. The primary end point was the 4-week rate of occurrence of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance images from weeks 28 to 48. Protein microarrays were used to measure levels of anti-myelin autoantibodies.Compared with placebo, in the 267 patient analysis population the median 4-week rate of new enhancing lesions during weeks 28 to 48 was 50% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.07) and during weeks 8 to 48 was 61% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.05). The mean volume of enhancing lesions at week 48 was 51% lower on 0.5 mg BHT-3009 compared with placebo (p = 0.02). No significant improvement in magnetic resonance imaging lesion parameters was observed with 1.5 mg BHT-3009. Dramatic reductions in 23 myelin-specific autoantibodies in the 0.5 mg BHT-3009 arm were observed, but not with placebo or 1.5 mg BHT-3009.In relapsing-remitting MS patients, treatment with the lower dose (0.5 mg) of BHT-3009 for 44 weeks nearly attained the primary end point for reduction of the rate of new enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions (p = 0.07) and achieved several secondary end points including a reduction of the rate of enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions from weeks 8 to 48 (p = 0.05). Immunological data in a preselected subgroup of patients also indicated that treatment with 0.5 mg induced antigen-specific immune tolerance. The greater dose was ineffective.

H., Gerlitz, B., Robinson, W. H., Baranzini, S. E., Grinnell, B. W., Raine, C. S., Sobel, R. A., Han, D. K., Steinman, L. Understanding the neuropathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is essential for improved therapies. Therefore, identification of targets specific to pathological types of MS may have therapeutic benefits. Here we identify, by laser-capture microdissection and proteomics, proteins unique to three major types of MS lesions: acute plaque, chronic active plaque and chronic plaque. Comparative proteomic profiles identified tissue factor and protein C inhibitor within chronic active plaque samples, suggesting dysregulation of molecules associated with coagulation. In vivo administration of hirudin or recombinant activated protein C reduced disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and suppressed Th1 and Th17 cytokines in astrocytes and immune cells. Administration of mutant forms of recombinant activated protein C showed that both its anticoagulant and its signalling functions were essential for optimal amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. A proteomic approach illuminated potential therapeutic targets selective for specific pathological stages of MS and implicated participation of the coagulation cascade. Induction of antigen-specific tolerance in multiple sclerosis after immunization with DNA encoding myelin basic protein in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1/2 trial Bar-Or, A., Vollmer, T., Antel, J., Arnold, D. L., Bodner, C. A., Campagnolo, D., Gianettoni, J., Jalili, F., Kachuck, N., Lapierre, Y., Niino, M., Oger, J., Price, M., Rhodes, S., Robinson, W. H., Shi, F., Utz, P. J., Valone, F., Weiner, L., Steinman, L., Garren, H. To assess safety and immune modulation by BHT-3009, a tolerizing DNA vaccine encoding full-length human myelin basic protein, in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects receiving placebo were crossed over into an active arm after treatment unblinding.The trial was conducted at 4 academic institutions within North America. Patients Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS who were not taking any other disease-modifying drugs were enrolled in the trial. Further, the patients were required to have either 1 to 5 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on screening brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a relapse in the previous 2 years, or disease worsening in the previous 2 years.BHT-3009 was administered as intramuscular injections at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9 after randomization into the trial, with or without 80 mg of daily oral atorvastatin calcium in combination. Three dose levels of BHT-3009 were tested (0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, and 3 mg).The primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability of BHT-3009. Secondary outcome measures included the number and volume of gadolinium-enhanced lesions on MRI, relapses, and analysis of antigen-specific immune responses.BHT-3009 was safe and well tolerated, provided favorable trends on brain MRI, and produced beneficial antigen-specific immune changes. These immune changes consisted of a marked decrease in proliferation of interferon-gamma-producing, myelin-reactive CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and a reduction in titers of myelin-specific autoantibodies from cerebral spinal fluid as assessed by protein microarrays. We did not observe a substantial benefit of the atorvastatin combination compared with BHT-3009 alone.In patients with MS, BHT-3009 is safe and induces antigen-specific immune tolerance with concordant reduction of inflammatory lesions on brain MRI. View details for Protective and therapeutic role for alpha B-crystallin in autoimmune demyelination Ousman, S. S., Tomooka, B. H., Van Noort, J. M., Wawrousek, E. F., O'Connor, K. C., Hafler, D. A., Sobel, R. A., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) is the most abundant gene transcript present in early active multiple sclerosis lesions, whereas such transcripts are absent in normal brain tissue. This crystallin has anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective functions. CRYAB is the major target of CD4+ T-cell immunity to the myelin sheath from multiple sclerosis brain. The pathophysiological implications of this immune response were investigated here. We demonstrate that CRYAB is a potent negative regulator acting as a brake on several inflammatory pathways in both the immune system and central nervous system (CNS). Cryab-/- mice showed worse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at the acute and progressive phases, with higher Th1 and Th17 cytokine secretion from T cells and macrophages, and more intense CNS inflammation, compared with their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, Cryab-/- astrocytes showed more cleaved caspase-3 and more TUNEL staining, indicating an anti-apoptotic function of Cryab. Antibody to CRYAB was detected in cerebrospinal fluid from multiple sclerosis patients and in sera from mice with EAE. Administration of recombinant CRYAB ameliorated EAE. Thus, the immune response against a negative regulator of inflammation, CRYAB, in multiple sclerosis, would exacerbate inflammation and demyelination. This can be countered by giving CRYAB itself for therapy of ongoing disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha expression in T cells mediates gender differences in development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity Dunn, S. E., Ousman, S. S., Sobel, R. A., Zuniga, L., Baranzini, S. E., Youssef, S., Crowell, A., Loh, J., Oksenberg, J., Steinman, L. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha is a nuclear receptor that mediates gender differences in lipid metabolism. PPARalpha also functions to control inflammatory responses by repressing the activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-jun in immune cells. Because PPARalpha is situated at the crossroads of gender and immune regulation, we hypothesized that this gene may mediate sex differences in the development of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We show that PPARalpha is more abundant in male as compared with female CD4(+) cells and that its expression is sensitive to androgen levels. Genetic ablation of this gene selectively removed the brake on NF-kappaB and c-jun activity in male T lymphocytes, resulting in higher production of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor (but not interleukin 17), and lower production of T helper (Th)2 cytokines. Upon induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, male but not female PPARalpha(-/-) mice developed more severe clinical signs that were restricted to the acute phase of disease. These results suggest that males are less prone to develop Th1-mediated autoimmunity because they have higher T cell expression of PPARalpha. View details for A brief history of T(H)17, the first major revision in the T(H)1/T(H)2 hypothesis of T cell-mediated tissue damage For over 35 years, immunologists have divided T-helper (T(H)) cells into functional subsets. T-helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells-long thought to mediate tissue damage-might be involved in the initiation of damage, but they do not sustain or play a decisive role in many commonly studied models of autoimmunity, allergy and microbial immunity. A major role for the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) has now been described in various models of immune-mediated tissue injury, including organ-specific autoimmunity in the brain, heart, synovium and intestines, allergic disorders of the lung and skin, and microbial infections of the intestines and the nervous system. A pathway named T(H)17 is now credited for causing and sustaining tissue damage in these diverse situations. The T(H)1 pathway antagonizes the T(H)17 pathway in an intricate fashion. The evolution of our understanding of the T(H)17 pathway illuminates a shift in immunologists' perspectives regarding the basis of tissue damage, where for over 20 years the role of T(H)1 cells was considered paramount. View details for Osteopontin-induced relapse and progression of autoimmune brain disease through enhanced survival of activated T cells Hur, E. M., Youssef, S., Haws, M. E., Zhang, S. Y., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. Relapses and disease exacerbations are vexing features of multiple sclerosis. Osteopontin (Opn), which is expressed in multiple sclerosis lesions, is increased in patients' plasma during relapses. Here, in models of multiple sclerosis including relapsing, progressive and multifocal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Opn triggered recurrent relapses, promoted worsening paralysis and induced neurological deficits, including optic neuritis. Increased inflammation followed Opn administration, whereas its absence resulted in more cell death of brain-infiltrating lymphocytes. Opn promoted the survival of activated T cells by inhibiting the transcription factor Foxo3a, by activating the transcription factor NF-kappaB through induction of phosphorylation of the kinase IKKbeta and by altering expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bak and Bax. Those mechanisms collectively suppressed the death of myelin-reactive T cells, linking Opn to the relapses and insidious progression characterizing multiple sclerosis. View details for Isoprenoids determine Th1/Th2 fate in pathogenic T cells, providing a mechanism of modulation of autoimmunity by atorvastatin Dunn, S. E., Youssef, S., Goldstein, M. J., Prod'homme, T., Weber, M. S., Zamvil, S. S., Steinman, L. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that regulates the biosynthesis of cholesterol as well as isoprenoids that mediate the membrane association of certain GTPases. Blockade of this enzyme by atorvastatin (AT) inhibits the destructive proinflammatory T helper cell (Th)1 response during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here we present evidence linking specific isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway to signaling pathways that regulate T cell autoimmunity. We demonstrate that the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) mediates proliferation, whereas both GGPP and its precursor, farnesyl-PP, regulate the Th1 differentiation of myelin-reactive T cells. Depletion of these isoprenoid intermediates in vivo via oral AT administration hindered these T cell responses by decreasing geranylgeranylated RhoA and farnesylated Ras at the plasma membrane. This was associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 phosphorylation and DNA binding of their cotarget c-fos in response to T cell receptor activation. Inhibition of ERK and p38 mimicked the effects of AT and induced a Th2 cytokine shift. Thus, by connecting isoprenoid availability to regulation of Th1/Th2 fate, we have elucidated a mechanism by which AT may suppress Th1-mediated central nervous system autoimmune disease. View details for Lipid microarrays identify key mediators of autoimmune brain inflammation Kanter, J. L., Narayana, S., Ho, P. P., Catz, I., Warren, K. G., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Recent studies suggest that increased T-cell and autoantibody reactivity to lipids may be present in the autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. To perform large-scale multiplex analysis of antibody responses to lipids in multiple sclerosis, we developed microarrays composed of lipids present in the myelin sheath, including ganglioside, sulfatide, cerebroside, sphingomyelin and total brain lipid fractions. Lipid-array analysis showed lipid-specific antibodies against sulfatide, sphingomyelin and oxidized lipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from individuals with multiple sclerosis. Sulfatide-specific antibodies were also detected in SJL/J mice with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of mice with sulfatide plus myelin peptide resulted in a more severe disease course of EAE, and administration of sulfatide-specific antibody exacerbated EAE. Thus, autoimmune responses to sulfatide and other lipids are present in individuals with multiple sclerosis and in EAE, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune demyelination. Treatment of autoimmune neuroinflammation with a synthetic tryptophan metabolite Platten, M., Ho, P. P., Youssef, S., Fontoura, P., Garren, H., Hur, E. M., Gupta, R., Lee, L. Y., Kidd, B. A., Robinson, W. H., Sobel, R. A., Selley, M. L., Steinman, L. Local catabolism of the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is considered an important mechanism of regulating T cell immunity. We show that IDO transcription was increased when myelin-specific T cells were stimulated with tolerogenic altered self-peptides. Catabolites of Trp suppressed proliferation of myelin-specific T cells and inhibited production of proinflammatory T helper-1 (T(H)1) cytokines. N-(3,4,-Dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (3,4-DAA), an orally active synthetic derivative of the Trp metabolite anthranilic acid, reversed paralysis in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Trp catabolites and their derivatives offer a new strategy for treating T(H)1-mediated autoimmune diseases such as MS. Design of effective immunotherapy for human autoimmunity A better understanding of the molecules involved in immune responses has identified many potential targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. But although successful therapies have been found for immune disorders in animal studies, few have passed the much harder test of treating human diseases. So far, non-antigen-specific approaches, such as the blocking of tumour-necrosis factor, are achieving some success but the same is not true for antigen-specific approaches. Future therapies will probably include both non-antigen-specific strategies that target cytokines (cell-cell signalling molecules) or block the molecules that stimulate immune responses, and antigen-specific therapies that induce tolerance to self antigens. View details for Blocking adhesion molecules as therapy for multiple sclerosis: Natalizumab Immunologists have long hypothesized that particular 'molecular addresses' govern lymphocyte entry to a given organ. In 1992, alpha4beta1 integrin was identified as the key molecule involved in homing to inflamed regions of the brain. An antibody to alpha4beta1integrin blocked paralysis in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, and the humanized monoclonal antibody natalizumab, which binds alpha4beta1 integrin, reduced relapses 66% in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis. Three months after its expedited approval by the FDA, natalizumab was removed from the market after two cases of deadly progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were reported among the few thousand patients who had taken this drug in those clinical trials. View details for Our increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease has revealed a number of checkpoints that can be targeted with immune therapy, including key mediators of lymphocyte adhesion and migration, destructive cytokines involved in tissue damage, and the complex of molecules critical in the presentation of self-antigen and the activation of autoaggressive T lymphocytes. In many organ-specific autoimmune diseases, the identity of the molecules attacked by T cells and autoantibodies is known and attempts are under way to tolerize the immune system with a high level of specificity to these targets.

Administration of a monoclonal antibody (GK1.5) that recognizes the L3T4 marker present on helper T cells prevented the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Furthermore, treatment with GK1.5 reversed EAE when the antibody was given to paralyzed animals. In vivo injection of GK1.5 selectively reduced the number of L3T4+ cells in the spleen and the lymph nodes. These results suggest that manipulation of the human equivalent of the murine L3T4+ T-cell subset with monoclonal antibodies may provide effective therapy for certain autoimmune diseases.

K., Hardy, R. R., Hayakawa, K., Steinman, L., Herzenberg, L. A., Herzenberg, L. A. Previous studies have shown that treatment with antibodies to the murine I-A antigen encoded in the major histocompatibility complex attenuates experimental allergic encephalitis and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. These studies were conducted with SJL mice, an inbred strain that is highly susceptible to the induction of these diseases. Here we show that injection of monoclonal anti-I-A antibody in the amounts used for the above studies rapidly depletes B cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) multiparameter analysis of the B-cell subpopulations in treated animals shows that maximum depletion occurs around 5 days after treatment and that recovery of some subpopulations i still incomplete 1 month later. SJL mice are more sensitive to this B-cell depletion and recover more slowly than putatively normal C3H.Ighb (CKB) mice. Some components of the primary, secondary and tertiary IgG antibody responses are reduced in anti-I-A-treated SJL animals immunized after the first and second anti-I-A injections. The persistence of some antibody response impairment well beyond the time when anti-I-A disappears raises a note of caution concerning human therapy protocols based on the injection of anti-Ia antibodies.

S., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, E. M., Frohman, T. C. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the punctuated administration of low-dose rituximab, temporally linked to B-cell hyperrepopulation (defined when the return of CD19+ B cells approximates 40%-50% of baseline levels as measured before alemtuzumab treatment inception), can mitigate alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmunity.METHODS: In this hypothesis-driven pilot study, 10 patients received low-dose rituximab (50-150 mg/m2), a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, after either their first or second cycles of alemtuzumab. These patients were then routinely assessed for the development of autoimmune disorders and safety signals related to the use of dual monoclonal antibody therapy.RESULTS: Five patients received at least 1 IV infusion of low-dose rituximab, following alemtuzumab therapy, with a mean follow-up of 41 months. None of the 5 patients developed secondary autoimmune disorders. An additional 5 patients with follow-up over less than 24 months received at least 1 infusion of low-dose rituximab treatment following alemtuzumab treatment. No secondary autoimmune diseases were observed.CONCLUSIONS: An anti-CD20 ""whack-a-mole"" B-cell depletion strategy may serve to mitigate alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmunity in MS by reducing the imbalance in B- and T-cell regulatory networks during immune reconstitution. We believe that these observations warrant further investigation.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for people with MS, low-dose rituximab following alemtuzumab treatment decreases the risk of alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmune diseases.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced a world-wide collapse of social and economic infrastructure, as well as constrained our freedom of movement. This respiratory tract infection is nefarious in how it targets the most distal and highly vulnerable aspect of the human bronchopulmonary tree, specifically, the delicate yet irreplaceable alveoli that are responsible for the loading of oxygen upon red cell hemoglobin for use by all of the body's tissues. In most symptomatic individuals, the disease is a mild immune-mediated syndrome, with limited damage to the lung tissues. About 20% of those affected experience a disease course characterized by a cataclysmic set of immune activation responses that can culminate in the diffuse and irreversible obliteration of the distal alveoli, leading to a virtual collapse of the gas-exchange apparatus. Here, in Part I of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we define severe COVID-19 as a consequence of the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to trigger what we now designate for the first time as a 'Prolific Activation of a Network-Immune-Inflammatory Crisis', or 'PANIC' Attack, in the alveolar tree. In Part II we describe an immunotherapeutic hypothesis worthy of the organization of a randomized clinical trial in order to ascertain whether a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent is capable of abolishing 'PANIC'; thereby preventing or mitigating severe COVID-19, with monumental ramifications for world health, and the global pandemic that continues to threaten it.

Introduction: Immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) significantly decrease the risk of new relapses. However, the chronic compartmentalized inflammation and neurodegeneration that define progressive MS are not prevented by these therapies and so significant damage to the brain and spinal cord and resulting disability ensues. Hence, the possibility of combining current immunotherapies with neuroprotective, remyelinating or regenerative therapies should be pursued.Areas Covered: This article sheds light on neuroprotective, remyelination and neurorepair strategies for MS, the numerous mechanisms for therapeutic targeting and the new candidates for combination therapies. We searched PubMed for articles with the terms, 'neuroprotection', remyelination' or 'regeneration' and 'therapies' or 'drugs' and 'Multiple Sclerosis'.Expert Opinion: An enriched understanding of the neurobiology and molecular changes that are activated by inflammatory CNS damage will provide new opportunities for the identification of neuroprotective, remyelinating and regenerative therapies. Success will depend on the improvement of CNS drug delivery, the identification of new predictive biomarkers, the optimization of clinical trials by assessment of the damage to the visual pathway and the testing of novel therapies in acute optic neuritis.

M., Villemarette-Pittman, N. R., Cruz, R. A., Longmuir, R., Rowe, V., Rowe, E. S., Varkey, T. C., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, T. C. Here, in Part II of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we characterize the application of an innovative treatment regimen for the prevention of the transition from mild to severe COVID-19, as well as detail an intensive immunotherapy intervention hypothesis. We propose as a putative randomized controlled trial that high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin (HDMTX-LR) rescue can abolish 'PANIC', thereby 'left-shifting' severe COVID-19 patients to the group majority of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are designated as having mild, even asymptomatic, disease. HDMTX-LR is endowed with broadly pleiotropic properties and is a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent which can be administered early in the course of severe COVID-19 thus rescuing the critical and irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli. Further, we describe a preventative treatment intervention regimen for those designated as having mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, but who exhibit features which herald the transition to the severe variant of this disease. Both of our proposed hypothesis-driven questions should be urgently subjected to rigorous assessment in the context of randomized controlled trials, in order to confirm or refute the contention that the approaches characterized herein, are in fact capable of exerting mitigating, if not abolishing, effects upon SARS-CoV-2 triggered 'PANIC Attack'. Confirmation of our immunotherapy hypothesis would have far-reaching ramifications for the current pandemic, along with yielding invaluable lessons which could be leveraged to more effectively prepare for the next challenge to global health.

P., Pedotti, R., Sangaletti, S. The extrusion of DNA traps contributes to a key mechanism in which innate immune cells clear pathogens or induce sterile inflammation. Here we provide evidence that CD4+ T cells, a critical regulator of adaptive immunity, release extracellular threads of DNA on activation. These DNA extrusions convey autocrine costimulatory signals to T lymphocytes and can be detected in lymph nodes isolated during the priming phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4+ T cell-driven mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) abolishes the extrusion of DNA by CD4+ T cells, reducing cytokine production in vitro and T cell priming against myelin in vivo. Moreover, mtROS blockade during established EAE markedly ameliorates disease severity, dampening autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system. Taken together, these experimental results elucidate a mechanism of intrinsic immune costimulation mediated by DNA threads released by activated T helper cells, and identify a potential therapeutic target for such disorders as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and CD4+ T cell-mediated disorders.

The development of neuroprotective therapies is a sought-after goal. By screening combinatorial chemical libraries using in vitro assays, we identified the small molecule BN201 that promotes the survival of cultured neural cells when subjected to oxidative stress or when deprived of trophic factors. Moreover, BN201 promotes neuronal differentiation, the differentiation of precursor cells to mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, and the myelination of new axons. BN201 modulates several kinases participating in the insulin growth factor 1 pathway including serum-glucocorticoid kinase and midkine, inducing the phosphorylation of NDRG1 and the translocation of the transcription factor Foxo3 to the cytoplasm. In vivo, BN201 prevents axonal and neuronal loss, and it promotes remyelination in models of multiple sclerosis, chemically induced demyelination, and glaucoma. In summary, we provide a new promising strategy to promote neuroaxonal survival and remyelination, potentially preventing disability in brain diseases. Safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus interferon beta-1a in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RADIANCE): a multicentre, randomised, 24-month, phase 3 trial. Cohen, J. A., Comi, G., Selmaj, K. W., Bar-Or, A., Arnold, D. L., Steinman, L., Hartung, H. P., Montalban, X., Kubala Havrdov, E., Cree, B. A., Sheffield, J. K., Minton, N., Raghupathi, K., Huang, V., Kappos, L. Ozanimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, which selectively binds to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 with high affinity. In the RADIANCE phase 2 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was associated with better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures and was well tolerated. The RADIANCE phase 3 study aimed to confirm the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus interferon beta-1a in individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.We did a 24-month, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy phase 3 trial in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis at 147 medical centres and clinical practices in 21 countries. Participants were aged 18-55 years, had multiple sclerosis according to 2010 McDonald criteria, a relapsing clinical course, brain MRI lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis, an expanded disability status scale score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months before screening plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within the 12 months before randomisation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via an interactive voice response system to daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) over 24 months. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population of all participants who received study drug and safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received study drug, grouped by highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02047734, and EudraCT, 2012-002714-40.Between Dec 27, 2013, and March 31, 2015, we screened 1695 participants, of which 375 did not meet inclusion criteria. 1320 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to a group, of whom 1313 received study drug (433 assigned to ozanimod 10 mg, 439 assigned to ozanimod 05 mg, and 441 assigned to interferon beta-1a) and 1138 (867%) completed 24 months of treatment. Adjusted ARRs were 017 (95% CI 014-021) with ozanimod 10 mg, 022 (018-026) with ozanimod 05 mg, and 028 (023-032) with interferon beta-1a, with rate ratios versus interferon beta-1a of 062 (95% CI 051-077; p<00001) for ozanimod 10 mg and 079 (065 to 096; p=00167) for ozanimod 05 mg. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was higher in the interferon beta-1a group (365 [830%] of 440 participants) than in the ozanimod 10 mg group (324 [747%] of 434) or the ozanimod 05 mg group (326 [743%] of 439). More participants in the interferon beta-1a group had treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation than in the ozanimod groups. Incidences of infections and serious treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across treatment groups. No cases of ozanimod-related symptomatic reduction in heart rate and no second-degree or third-degree cases of atrioventricular block were reported.In this 24-month phase 3 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was well tolerated and associated with a significantly lower rate of clinical relapses than intramuscular interferon beta-1a. These findings show the potential of ozanimod as an effective oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

The RADIANCE phase 2 study showed that ozanimod had better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures, with a favourable safety profile, in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The SUNBEAM study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus intramuscular interferon beta-1a in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis.SUNBEAM was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled phase 3 trial done at 152 academic medical centres and clinical practices in 20 countries. We enrolled participants aged 18-55 years with relapsing multiple sclerosis, baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within the 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within 12 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 by a blocked algorithm stratified by country and baseline EDSS score to at least 12 months treatment of either once-daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) during the treatment period and was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants according to the highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02294058 and EudraCT, number 2014-002320-27.Between Dec 18, 2014, and Nov 12, 2015, 1346 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to ozanimod 10 mg (n=447), ozanimod 05 mg (n=451), or interferon beta-1a (n=448). 91 (68%) participants discontinued the study drug (29 in the ozanimod 10 mg group; 26 in the ozanimod 05 mg group; and 36 in the interferon beta-1a group). Adjusted ARRs were 035 (028-044) for interferon beta-1a, 018 (95% CI 014-024) for ozanimod 10 mg (rate ratio [RR] of 052 [041-066] vs interferon beta-1a; p<00001), and 024 (019-031) for ozanimod 05 mg (RR 069 [055-086] vs interferon beta-1a; p=00013). Few ozanimod-treated participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events (13 [29%] who received ozanimod 10 mg; seven [15%] who received ozanimod 05 mg; and 16 [36%] who received interferon beta-1a). No first-dose, clinically significant bradycardia or second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block was reported. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar across treatment groups (13 [29%] participants who received ozanimod 10 mg; 16 [35%] who received ozanimod 05 mg; and 11 [25%] who received interferon beta-1a). No serious opportunistic infections occurred in ozanimod-treated participants.In participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis treated for at least 12 months, ozanimod was well tolerated and demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate than interferon beta-1a. These findings provide support for ozanimod as an oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

To evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine profiles in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein IgG-positive (MOG-IgG+) disease in adult and paediatric patients.In this cross-sectional study, we measured 27 cytokines in the CSF of MOG-IgG+ disease in acute phase before treatment (n=29). The data were directly compared with those in aquaporin-4 antibody-positive (AQP4-IgG+) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) (n=20), multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=20) and non-inflammatory controls (n=14).In MOG-IgG+ disease, there was no female preponderance and the ages were younger (mean 18 years, range 3-68; 15 were below 18 years) relative to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD (41, 15-77) and MS (34, 17-48). CSF cell counts were higher and oligoclonal IgG bands were mostly negative in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD compared with MS. MOG-IgG+ disease had significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interferon-, IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 as compared with MS. No cytokine in MOG-IgG+ disease was significantly different from AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD. Moreover many elevated cytokines were correlated with each other in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut not in MS. No difference in the data was seen between adult and paediatric MOG-IgG+ cases.The CSF cytokine profile in the acute phase of MOG-IgG+ disease is characterised by coordinated upregulation of T helper 17 (Th17) and other cytokines including some Th1-related and regulatory T cells-related ones in adults and children, which is similar to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut clearly different from MS. The results suggest that as with AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD, some disease-modifying drugs for MS may be ineffective in MOG-IgG+ disease while they may provide potential therapeutic targets.

M., Glanville, J., Volkmuth, W., Emerling, D. E., Robinson, W. H. There is significant debate regarding whether B cells and their antibodies contribute to effective anti-cancer immune responses. Here we show that patients with metastatic but non-progressing melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma exhibited increased levels of blood plasmablasts. We used a cell-barcoding technology to sequence their plasmablast antibody repertoires, revealing clonal families of affinity matured B cells that exhibit progressive class switching and persistence over time. Anti-CTLA4 and other treatments were associated with further increases in somatic hypermutation and clonal family size. Recombinant antibodies from clonal families bound non-autologous tumor tissue and cell lines, and families possessing immunoglobulin paratope sequence motifs shared across patients exhibited increased rates of binding. We identified antibodies that caused regression of, and durable immunity toward, heterologous syngeneic tumors in mice. Our findings demonstrate convergent functional anti-tumor antibody responses targeting public tumor antigens, and provide an approach to identify antibodies with diagnostic or therapeutic utility.

Ozanimod, an oral immunomodulator, selectively targets sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5.Evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis.In the RADIANCE Part A phase II study (NCT01628393), participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis were randomized (1:1:1) to once-daily ozanimod hydrochloride (0.5 or 1mg) or placebo. After 24weeks, participants could enter a 2-year, dose-blinded extension. Ozanimod-treated participants continued their assigned dose; placebo participants were re-randomized (1:1) to ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5 or 1mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.46 and 0.92mg).A total of 223 (89.6%) of the 249 participants completed the blinded extension. At 2years of the extension, the percentage of participants who were gadolinium-enhancing lesion-free ranged from 86.5% to 94.6%. Unadjusted annualized relapse rate during the blinded extension (week 24-end of treatment) was 0.32 for ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5mg ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5mg, 0.18 for ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg, 0.30 for placebo ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5 mg, and 0.18 for placebo ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg. No second-degree or higher atrioventricular block or serious opportunistic infection was reported.Ozanimod demonstrated sustained efficacy in participants continuing treatment up to 2years and reached similar efficacy in participants who switched from placebo; no unexpected safety signals emerged. Amelioration of ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with fluoxetine Bhat, R., Mahapatra, S., Axtell, R. C., Steinman, L. In patients with multiple sclerosis, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, resulted in less acute disease activity. We tested the immune modulating effects of fluoxetine in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that fluoxetine delayed the onset of disease and reduced clinical paralysis in mice with established disease. Fluoxetine had abrogating effects on proliferation of immune cells and inflammatory cytokine production by both antigen-presenting cells and T cells. Specifically, in CD4 T cells, fluoxetine increased Fas-induced apoptosis. We conclude that fluoxetine possesses immune-modulating effects resulting in the amelioration of symptoms in EAE.

Demyelinated brain lesions, a hallmark of autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, result from oligodendroglial cell damage. Activated microglia are considered a major source of nitric oxide and subsequent peroxynitrite-mediated damage of myelin. Here, we provide biochemical and biophysical evidence that the oxidoreductase glutaredoxin 2 inhibits peroxynitrite formation by transforming nitric oxide into dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron-complexes. Glutaredoxin 2 levels influence both survival rates of primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and preservation of myelin structure in cerebellar organotypic slice cultures challenged with activated microglia or nitric oxide donors. Of note, glutaredoxin 2-mediated protection is not linked to its enzymatic activity as oxidoreductase, but to the disassembly of its uniquely coordinated iron-sulfur cluster using glutathione as non-protein ligand. The protective effect of glutaredoxin 2 is connected to decreased protein carbonylation and nitration. In line, brain lesions of mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, show decreased glutaredoxin 2 expression and increased nitrotyrosine formation indicating that this type of protection is missing in the inflamed central nervous system. Our findings link inorganic biochemistry to neuroinflammation and identify glutaredoxin 2 as a protective factor against neuroinflammation-mediated myelin damage. Thus, improved availability of glutathione-coordinated iron-sulfur clusters emerges as a potential therapeutic approach in inflammatory demyelination.

L., Fontana, E., Cominelli, M., Abolafio, G., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of targeting the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcepsilonRI), that plays a central role in allergic responses and is constitutively expressed on mast cells and basophils, in clinical disease and autoimmune T-cell response in experimental MS.METHODS: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55. Anti-FcepsilonRI alpha-chain antibody was administered intraperitoneally. CNS immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry analysis of immune cell populations, IgE and histamine serum concentration, immune cell proliferation, and cytokine measurement were performed. In BALB/c mice, EAE was induced by immunization with myelin proteolipid protein 185-206.RESULTS: Treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody resulted in exacerbation of EAE and increased CNS inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. Treated mice displayed long-lasting complete depletion of basophils in the blood stream and peripheral lymphoid organs and increased antigen-induced immune cell proliferation and production of interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In BALB/c mice, which are T-helper (Th) 2 prone and resistant to EAE, treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody restored susceptibility to EAE.CONCLUSION: Our observations that anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody increases Th1 and Th17 responses against myelin antigen and exacerbates EAE suggest that FcepsilonRI, basophils, and possibly other FcepsilonRI-bearing cells that might be affected by this antibody play important roles in influencing the severity of CNS autoimmunity.

View details for Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS To determine the average age of MS onset vs the age at which Epstein-Barr infection has previously occurred and stratify this analysis by sex and the blood level of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibody.Using infectious mononucleosis (IM) as a temporal marker in data from the Swedish epidemiologic investigation of MS, 259 adult IM/MS cases were identified and then augmented to account for ""missing"" childhood data so that the average age of MS onset could be determined for cases binned by age of IM (as stratified by sex and EBNA1 titer level).Mean age of IM vs mean age of MS reveals a positive time correlation for all IM ages (from 5 to 30 years), with IM-to-MS delay decreasing with increased age. When bifurcated by sex or EBNA1 blood titer levels, males and high-titer subpopulations show even stronger positive time correlation, while females and low-titer populations show negative time correlation in early childhood (long IM/MS delay). The correlation becomes positive in females beyond puberty.IM/MS time correlation implies causality if IM is time random. Alternative confounding models seem implausible, in light of constraints imposed by time-invariant delay observed here. Childhood infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in females and/or those genetically prone to low EBNA1 blood titers will develop MS slowly. Males and/or high EBNA1-prone develop MS more rapidly following IM infection at all ages. For all, postpubescent EBV infection is critical for the initiation and rapid development of MS. PH20 is not expressed in murine CNS and oligodendrocyte precursor cells Marella, M., Ouyang, J., Zombeck, J., Zhao, C., Huang, L., Connor, R. J., Phan, K. B., Jorge, M. C., Printz, M.

Expression of Spam1/PH20 and its modulation of high/low molecular weight hyaluronan substrate have been proposed to play an important role in murine oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation in vitro and in normal and demyelinated central nervous system (CNS). We reexamined this using highly purified PH20.Steady-state expression of mRNA in OPCs was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction; the role of PH20 in bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH) inhibition of OPC differentiation was explored by comparing BTH to a purified recombinant human PH20 (rHuPH20). Contaminants in commercial BTH were identified and their impact on OPC differentiation characterized. Spam1/PH20 expression in normal and demyelinated mouse CNS tissue was investigated using deep RNA sequencing and immunohistological methods with two antibodies directed against recombinant murine PH20.BTH, but not rHuPH20, inhibited OPC differentiation in vitro. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was identified as a significant contaminant in BTH, and bFGF immunodepletion reversed the inhibitory effects of BTH on OPC differentiation. Spam1 mRNA was undetected in OPCs in vitro and in vivo; PH20 immunolabeling was undetected in normal and demyelinated CNS.We were unable to detect Spam1/PH20 expression in OPCs or in normal or demyelinated CNS using the most sensitive methods currently available. Further, ""BTH"" effects on OPC differentiation are not due to PH20, but may be attributable to contaminating bFGF. Our data suggest that caution be exercised when using some commercially available hyaluronidases, and reports of Spam1/PH20 morphogenic activity in the CNS may be due to contaminants in reagents.

F., Yoon, J., van Horssen, J., Han, M. H., Bollyky, P. L., Palmer, T. D., Steinman, L. The small heat shock protein B-crystallin (CRYAB) has been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Earlier studies have indicated that CRYAB inhibits inflammation and attenuates clinical disease when administered in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. In this study, we evaluated the role of CRYAB in primary demyelinating events. Using the cuprizone model of demyelination, a noninflammatory model that allows the analysis of glial responses in MS, we show that endogenous CRYAB expression is associated with increased severity of demyelination. Moreover, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the expression of CRYAB and the extent of reactive astrogliosis in demyelinating areas and in in vitro assays. In addition, we reveal that CRYAB is differentially phosphorylated in astrocytes in active demyelinating MS lesions, as well as in cuprizone-induced lesions, and that this phosphorylation is required for the reactive astrocyte response associated with demyelination. Furthermore, taking a proteomics approach to identify proteins that are bound by the phosphorylated forms of CRYAB in primary cultured astrocytes, we show that there is clear differential binding of protein targets due to the specific phosphorylation of CRYAB. Subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of these targets reveals implications for intracellular pathways and biological processes that could be affected by these modifications. Together, these findings demonstrate that astrocytes play a pivotal role in demyelination, making them a potential target for therapeutic intervention, and that phosphorylation of CRYAB is a key factor supporting the pathogenic response of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte injury.

C., Cen, S. Y., Tauhid, S., Neema, M., Steinman, L. The objective of this study was to evaluate monthly intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) gel versus intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) add-on therapy to interferon for breakthrough disease in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.This was a prospective, open-label, examiner-blinded, 15-month pilot study evaluating patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.0-6.5 and at least one clinical relapse or new T2 or gadolinium-enhanced lesion in the previous year. Twenty-three patients were randomized to ACTH (n = 12) or IVMP (n = 11) and completed the study. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative number of relapses. Secondary outcomes included EDSS, Mental Health Inventory (MHI), plasma cytokines, MS Functional Composite (MSFC), Quality-of-Life (MS-QOL) score, bone mineral density (BMD), and new or worsened psychiatric symptoms per month. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed post hoc. This was a preliminary and small-scale study.Relapse rates differed significantly [ACTH 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.54 versus IVMP 0.80, 95% CI 0.36-1.75; rate ratio, IVMP versus ACTH: 9.56, 95% CI 1.23-74.6; p = 0.03]. ACTH improved (p = 0.03) MHI (slope 0.95 0.38 points/month; p = 0.02 versus slope -0.38 0.43 points/month; p = 0.39). On-study decreases (all p < 0.05) in eight cytokine levels occurred only in the ACTH group. However, on-study EDSS, MSFC, MS-QOL, BMD, and MRI lesion changes were not significant between groups. Psychiatric symptoms per patient were greater with IVMP than ACTH (0.55, 95% CI 0.12-2.6 versus 0; p < 0.0001). Other common adverse events were insomnia and urinary tract infections (IVMP, seven events each) and fatigue or flu symptoms (ACTH, five events each).This study provided class II evidence that ACTH produced better examiner-assessed cumulative rates of relapses per patient than IVMP in the adjunctive treatment of breakthrough disease in multiple sclerosis. Regulator of oligodendrocyte maturation, miR-219, a potential biomarker for MS. Bruinsma, I. B., van Dijk, M., Bridel, C., van de Lisdonk, T., Haverkort, S. Q., Runia, T. F., Steinman, L., Hintzen, R. Q., Killestein, J., Verbeek, M. M., Teunissen, C. E., de Jong, B. A. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Normally, demyelination is followed by remyelination, which requires repopulation of a demyelinated area by oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Although large numbers of precursor cells are present in MS lesions, remyelination often fails, in part by the inability of precursor cells to differentiate into mature myelin-forming cells. In mouse and rat, miR-219 is required for this differentiation. Previously, we identified decreased miR-219 expression in tissue of MS patients compared to controls. Cell-free miRNAs have been detected in many different body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may reflect disease processes going on in the central nervous system. This prompted us to investigate the biomarker performance of CSF miR-219 for MS diagnosis.Quantitative PCR was performed measuring miR-219 levels in CSF of MS patients and controls in three independent cohorts.All three cohorts of MS patients and controls revealed that absence of miR-219 detection in CSF is consistently associated with MS.We have been able to identify and validate absence of miR-219 detection in CSF of MS patients compared to controls, suggesting that it may emerge as a candidate biomarker for MS diagnosis. Induction of Paralysis and Visual System Injury in Mice by T Cells Specific for Neuromyelitis Optica Autoantigen Aquaporin-4. Sagan, S. A., Cruz-Herranz, A., Spencer, C. M., Ho, P. P., Steinman, L., Green, A. J., Sobel, R. A., Zamvil, S. S. While it is recognized that aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific T cells and antibodies participate in the pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a human central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune demyelinating disease, creation of an AQP4-targeted model with both clinical and histologic manifestations of CNS autoimmunity has proven challenging. Immunization of wild-type (WT) mice with AQP4 peptides elicited T cell proliferation, although those T cells could not transfer disease to nave recipient mice. Recently, two novel AQP4 T cell epitopes, peptide (p) 135-153 and p201-220, were identified when studying immune responses to AQP4 in AQP4-deficient (AQP4-/-) mice, suggesting T cell reactivity to these epitopes is normally controlled by thymic negative selection. AQP4-/- Th17 polarized T cells primed to either p135-153 or p201-220 induced paralysis in recipient WT mice, that was associated with predominantly leptomeningeal inflammation of the spinal cord and optic nerves. Inflammation surrounding optic nerves and involvement of the inner retinal layers (IRL) were manifested by changes in serial optical coherence tomography (OCT). Here, we illustrate the approaches used to create this new in vivo model of AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA), which can now be employed to study mechanisms that permit development of pathogenic AQP4-specific T cells and how they may cooperate with B cells in NMO pathogenesis. Tolerance checkpoint bypass permits emergence of pathogenic T cells to neuromyelitis optica autoantigen aquaporin-4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Sagan, S.

J., Anderson, M. S., Sobel, R. A., Zamvil, S. S. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific T cells are expanded in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients and exhibit Th17 polarization. However, their pathogenic role in CNS autoimmune inflammatory disease is unclear. Although multiple AQP4 T-cell epitopes have been identified in WT C57BL/6 mice, we observed that neither immunization with those determinants nor transfer of donor T cells targeting them caused CNS autoimmune disease in recipient mice. In contrast, robust proliferation was observed following immunization of AQP4-deficient (AQP4(-/-)) mice with AQP4 peptide (p) 135-153 or p201-220, peptides predicted to contain I-A(b)-restricted T-cell epitopes but not identified in WT mice. In comparison with WT mice, AQP4(-/-) mice used unique T-cell receptor repertoires for recognition of these two AQP4 epitopes. Donor T cells specific for either determinant from AQP4(-/-), but not WT, mice induced paralysis in recipient WT and B-cell-deficient mice. AQP4-specific Th17-polarized cells induced more severe disease than Th1-polarized cells. Clinical signs were associated with opticospinal infiltrates of T cells and monocytes. Fluorescent-labeled donor T cells were detected in CNS lesions. Visual system involvement was evident by changes in optical coherence tomography. Fine mapping of AQP4 p201-220 and p135-153 epitopes identified peptides within p201-220 but not p135-153, which induced clinical disease in 40% of WT mice by direct immunization. Our results provide a foundation to evaluate how AQP4-specific T cells contribute to AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA) and suggest that pathogenic AQP4-specific T-cell responses are normally restrained by central tolerance, which may be relevant to understanding development of AQP4-reactive T cells in NMO.

G., Benners, E., Shinohara, M. L. Inflammation induced by innate immunity influences the development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that strong activation of innate immunity induced Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-independent and interferon- (IFN)-resistant EAE (termed type B EAE), whereas EAE induced by weak activation of innate immunity requires the NLRP3 inflammasome and is sensitive to IFN treatment. Instead, an alternative inflammatory mechanism, including membrane-bound lymphotoxin- receptor (LTR) and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), is involved in type B EAE development, and type B EAE is ameliorated by antagonizing these receptors. Relative expression of Ltbr and Cxcr2 genes was indeed enhanced in patients with IFN-resistant multiple sclerosis. Remission was minimal in type B EAE due to neuronal damages induced by semaphorin 6B upregulation on CD4(+) T cells.

M., Lutterotti, A., Martin, R., Schippling, S., Villoslada, P., Wei, C., Weiner, H. L., Zamvil, S. S., Smith, T. J., Yeaman, M. R. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMO/SD) and its clinical variants have at their core the loss of immune tolerance to aquaporin-4 and perhaps other autoantigens. The characteristic phenotype is disruption of astrocyte function and demyelination of spinal cord, optic nerves, and particular brain regions. In this second of a 2-part article, we present further perspectives regarding the pathogenesis of NMO/SD and how this disease might be amenable to emerging technologies aimed at restoring immune tolerance to disease-implicated self-antigens. NMO/SD appears to be particularly well-suited for these strategies since aquaporin-4 has already been identified as the dominant autoantigen. The recent technical advances in reintroducing immune tolerance in experimental models of disease as well as in humans should encourage quantum leaps in this area that may prove productive for novel therapy. In this part of the article series, the potential for regulatory T and B cells is brought into focus, as are new approaches to oral tolerization. Finally, a roadmap is provided to help identify potential issues in clinical development and guide applications in tolerization therapy to solving NMO/SD through the use of emerging technologies. Each of these perspectives is intended to shine new light on potential cures for NMO/SD and other autoimmune diseases, while sparing normal host defense mechanisms. Restoring immune tolerance in neuromyelitis optica Part I Steinman, L., Bar-Or, A., Behne, J. M., Benitez-Ribas, D., Chin, P. S., Clare-Salzler, M., Healey, D., Kim, J. I., Kranz, D. M., Lutterotti, A., Martin, R., Schippling, S., Villoslada, P., Wei, C., Weiner, H. L., Zamvil, S. S., Yeaman, M. R., Smith, T. J., Guthy-Jackson Charitable Fdn Int Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and spectrum disorder (NMO/SD) represent a vexing process and its clinical variants appear to have at their pathogenic core the loss of immune tolerance to the aquaporin-4 water channel protein. This process results in a characteristic pattern of astrocyte dysfunction, loss, and demyelination that predominantly affects the spinal cord and optic nerves. Although several empirical therapies are currently used in the treatment of NMO/SD, none has been proven effective in prospective, adequately powered, randomized trials. Furthermore, most of the current therapies subject patients to long-term immunologic suppression that can cause serious infections and development of cancers. The following is the first of a 2-part description of several key immune mechanisms in NMO/SD that might be amenable to therapeutic restoration of immune tolerance. It is intended to provide a roadmap for how potential immune tolerance restorative techniques might be applied to patients with NMO/SD. This initial installment provides a background rationale underlying attempts at immune tolerization. It provides specific examples of innovative approaches that have emerged recently as a consequence of technical advances. In several autoimmune diseases, these strategies have been reduced to practice. Therefore, in theory, the identification of aquaporin-4 as the dominant autoantigen makes NMO/SD an ideal candidate for the development of tolerizing therapies or cures for this increasingly recognized disease. Genetic background modulates outcome of therapeutic amyloid peptides in treatment of neuroinflammation Kraus, A., Race, B., Phillips, K., Winkler, C., Saturday, G., Kurnellas, M., Rothbard, J. B., Groveman, B. R., Steinman, L., Caughey, B. Amyloid hexapeptide molecules are effective in the treatment of the murine model of neuroinflammation, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Efficacy however differs between two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and C57BL/10SnJ (B10). Amyloid hexapeptide treatments improved the clinical outcomes of B6, but not B10 mice, indicating that genetic background influences therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, although previous studies indicated that prion protein deficiency results in more severe EAE in B6 mice, we observed no such effect in B10 mice. In addition, we found that amyloid hexapeptide treatments of B10 and B6 mice elicited differential IL4 responses. Thus, the modulatory potential of prion protein and related treatments with other amyloid hexapeptides in EAE depends on mouse strain.

G., Marshall, P. L., Gebe, J. A., Ishak, H. D., Keswani, S. G., Bollyky, J., Frymoyer, A. R., Wight, T. N., Steinman, L., Bollyky, P. L. Recently, there has been considerable interest in using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) to inhibit hyaluronan synthesis in mouse models of cancer, autoimmunity, and a variety of other inflammatory disorders where hyaluronan (HA) has been implicated in disease pathogenesis. In order to facilitate future studies in this area, we have examined the dosing, treatment route, treatment duration, and metabolism of 4-MU in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Mice fed chow containing 5% 4-MU, a dose calculated to deliver 250 mg/mouse/day, initially lose substantial weight but typically resume normal weight gain after one week. It also takes up to a week to see a reduction in serum HA in these animals, indicating that at least a one-week loading period on the drug is required for most protocols. At steady state, over 90% of the drug is present in plasma as the glucuronidated metabolite 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (4-MUG), with the sulfated metabolite, 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (4-MUS) comprising most of the remainder. Chow containing 5% but not 0.65% 4-MU was effective at preventing disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis as well as in the DORmO mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. While oral 4-MU was effective at preventing EAE, daily intraperitoneal injections of 4-MU were not. Factors potentially affecting 4-MU uptake and plasma concentrations in mice include its taste, short half-life and low bioavailability. These studies provide a practical resource for implementing oral 4-MU treatment protocols in mice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

View details for CEACAM1 mediates B cell aggregation in central nervous system autoimmunity Rovituso, D. M., Scheffler, L., Wunsch, M., Kleinschnitz, C., Doerck, S., Ulzheimer, J., Bayas, A., Steinman, L., Erguen, S., Kuerten, S. B cell aggregates in the central nervous system (CNS) have been associated with rapid disease progression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we demonstrate a key role of carcinoembryogenic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule1 (CEACAM1) in B cell aggregate formation in MS patients and a B cell-dependent mouse model of MS. CEACAM1 expression was increased on peripheral blood B cells and CEACAM1(+) B cells were present in brain infiltrates of MS patients. Administration of the anti-CEACAM1 antibody T84.1 was efficient in blocking aggregation of B cells derived from MS patients. Along these lines, application of the monoclonal anti-CEACAM1 antibody mCC1 was able to inhibit CNS B cell aggregate formation and significantly attenuated established MS-like disease in mice in the absence of any adverse effects. CEACAM1 was co-expressed with the regulator molecule T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain -3 (TIM-3) on B cells, a novel molecule that has recently been described to induce anergy in T cells. Interestingly, elevated coexpression on B cells coincided with an autoreactive T helper cell phenotype in MS patients. Overall, these data identify CEACAM1 as a clinically highly interesting target in MS pathogenesis and open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the disease. Beginning of the end of two-stage theory purporting that inflammation then degeneration explains pathogenesis of progressive multiple sclerosis The review discusses future directions in research on multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, as long-held beliefs about these diseases are undermined with data from recent clinical trials.Results of clinical trials for registration (phase 3) were reported in the last year. Anti-inflammatory approaches, such as daclizumab high-yield process targeting IL-2 receptor, and ocrelizumab targeting CD20 B cells, confirmed a beneficial role of immune suppression in relapsing-remitting disease. And now for the first time achieving the primary end point in primary progressive multiple sclerosis was attained with ocrelizumab.The results in the past year challenge the long-held belief that relapsing-remitting disease is inflammatory, whereas progressive forms of the disease are 'less inflammatory' and more 'degenerative.'

Multiple proteins with overlapping functions play a role in IFN signaling, but the signaling events downstream of receptor engagement are unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the roles of the type I and type II IFN signaling components IFN-// receptor 2 (IFNAR-2), IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9), and STAT-1 in a mouse model of SLE.We used immunohistochemical staining and highly multiplexed assays to characterize pathologic changes in histology, autoantibody production, cytokine/chemokine profiles, and STAT phosphorylation in order to investigate the individual roles of IFNAR-2, IRF-9, and STAT-1 in MRL/lpr mice.We found that STAT-1(-/-) mice, but not IRF-9(-/-) or IFNAR-2(-/-) mice, developed interstitial nephritis characterized by infiltration with retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor t-positive lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. Despite pronounced interstitial kidney disease and abnormal kidney function, STAT-1(-/-) mice had decreased proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, and autoantibody production. Phosphospecific flow cytometry revealed shunting of STAT phosphorylation from STAT-1 to STAT-3/4.We describe unique contributions of STAT-1 to pathology in different kidney compartments in a mouse model, and provide potentially novel insight into tubulointerstitial nephritis, a poorly understood complication that predicts end-stage kidney disease in SLE patients.

To evaluate serum cytokine profiles for their utility to determine the heterogeneous responses to interferon (IFN)- treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).Patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or clinically isolated syndrome receiving de novo IFN- treatment were included in this prospective, observational study. Number of relapses and changes in disability were assessed 2 years prior to and 2 years after initiation of treatment. Sera were collected at baseline and after 3 months on therapy. Cytokine levels in sera were assessed by Luminex multiplex assays. Baseline cytokine profiles were grouped by hierarchical clustering analysis. Demographic features, changes in cytokines, and clinical outcome were then assessed in the clustered patient groups.A total of 157 patients were included in the study and clustered into 6 distinct subsets by baseline cytokine profiles. These subsets differed significantly in their clinical and biological response to IFN- therapy. Two subsets were associated with patients who responded poorly to therapy. Two other subsets, associated with a good response to therapy, showed a significant reduction in relapse rates and no worsening of disability. Each subset also had differential changes in cytokine levels after 3 months of IFN- treatment.There is heterogeneity in the immunologic pathways of the RRMS population, which correlates with IFN- response. Anti-Insulin Immune Responses Are Detectable in Dogs with Spontaneous Diabetes Kim, J., Furrow, E., Ritt, M. G., Utz, P. J., Robinson, W. H., Yu, L., Eckert, A., Stuebner, K., O'Brien, T. D., Steinman, L., Modiano, J. F. Diabetes mellitus occurs spontaneously in dogs. Although canine diabetes shares many features with human type-1 diabetes, there are differences that have cast doubt on the immunologic origin of the canine disease. In this study, we examined whether peripheral immune responses directed against islet antigens were present in dogs with diabetes. Routine diagnostics were used to confirm diabetic status, and serum samples from dogs with (N = 15) and without (N = 15) diabetes were analyzed for the presence of antibodies against islet antigens (insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulinoma-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase, and islet beta-cell zinc cation efflux transporter) using standard radioassays. Interferon- production from peripheral blood T cells stimulated by porcine insulin and by human insulin was tested using Elispot assays. Anti-insulin antibodies were detectable in a subset of diabetic dogs receiving insulin therapy. Pre-activated T cells and incipient insulin-reactive T cells in response to porcine or human insulin were identified in non-diabetic dogs and in dogs with diabetes. The data show that humoral and cellular anti-insulin immune responses are detectable in dogs with diabetes. This in turn provides support for the potential to ethically use dogs with diabetes to study the therapeutic potential of antigen-specific tolerance. The Safety of Adjuvanted Vaccines Revisited: Vaccine-Induced Narcolepsy Ahmed, S. S., Montomoli, E., Pasini, F. L., Steinman, L. Despite the very high benefit-to-risk ratio of vaccines, the fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in the reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis and diphtheria. This fear has been amplified more recently by multiple epidemiologic studies that confirmed the link of an AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine (Pandemrix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Germany) used in Europe during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [A(H1N1) pdm09] with the development of narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder, in children and adolescents. However, public misperceptions of what adjuvants are and why they are used in vaccines has created in some individuals a closed ""black box"" attitude towards all vaccines. The focus of this review article is to revisit this ""black box"" using the example of narcolepsy associated with the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine.

B., Sinha, A. A. Patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) harbor antibodies reactive against self-antigens expressed at the surface of keratinocytes, primarily desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and, to a lesser extent, Dsg1. Conventionally, only antibodies targeting these molecules have been thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. This notion has been challenged by a growing pool of evidence that suggests that antibodies toward additional targets may play a role in disease. The aims of this study were to (i) establish high-throughput protein microarray technology as a method to investigate traditional and putative autoantibodies (autoAbs) in PV and (ii) use multiplexed protein array technology to define the scope and specificity of the autoAb response in PV. Our analysis demonstrated significant IgG reactivity in patients with PV toward the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes 3, 4, and 5 as well as thyroid peroxidase. Furthermore, we found that healthy first- and second-degree relatives of patients with PV express autoAbs toward desmoglein and non-Dsg targets. Our analysis also identified genetic elements, particularly HLA, as key drivers of autoAb expression. Finally, we show that patients with PV exhibit significantly reduced IgM reactivity toward disease-associated antigens relative to controls. The use of protein microarrays to profile the autoAb response in PV advanced the current understanding of disease and provided insight into the complex relationship between genetics and disease development. Hyaluronan synthesis is necessary for autoreactive T-cell trafficking, activation, and Th1 polarization. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Kuipers, H. F., Rieck, M., Gurevich, I., Nagy, N., Butte, M. J., Negrin, R. S., Wight, T. N., Steinman, L., Bollyky, P. L. The extracellular matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) accumulates at sites of autoimmune inflammation, including white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS), but its functional importance in pathogenesis is unclear. We have evaluated the impact of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an oral inhibitor of HA synthesis, on disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Treatment with 4-MU decreases the incidence of EAE, delays its onset, and reduces the severity of established disease. 4-MU inhibits the activation of autoreactive T cells and prevents their polarization toward a Th1 phenotype. Instead, 4-MU promotes polarization toward a Th2 phenotpye and induction of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Further, 4-MU hastens trafficking of T cells through secondary lymphoid organs, impairs the infiltration of T cells into the CNS parenchyma, and limits astrogliosis. Together, these data suggest that HA synthesis is necessary for disease progression in EAE and that treatment with 4-MU may be a potential therapeutic strategy in CNS autoimmunity. Considering that 4-MU is already a therapeutic, called hymecromone, that is approved to treat biliary spasm in humans, we propose that it could be repurposed to treat MS.

To study the safety profile and characterize the immunologic effects of high- vs low-dose cholecalciferol supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).In this double-blind, single-center randomized pilot study, 40 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were randomized to receive 10,400 IU or 800 IU cholecalciferol daily for 6 months. Assessments were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months.Mean increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from baseline to final visit was larger in the high-dose group (34.9 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.0-44.7 ng/mL) than in the low-dose group (6.9 ng/mL; 95% CI 1.0-13.7 ng/mL). Adverse events were minor and did not differ between the 2 groups. Two relapses occurred, one in each treatment arm. In the high-dose group, we found a reduction in the proportion of interleukin-17(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.016), CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.03), and effector memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.021) with a concomitant increase in the proportion of central memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.018) and naive CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.04). These effects were not observed in the low-dose group.Cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and tolerable in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS, which include reduction of interleukin-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and decreased proportion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells with concomitant increase in central memory CD4(+) T cells and naive CD4(+) T cells.This study provides Class I evidence that cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and well-tolerated in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects. Identification of Candidate Tolerogenic CD8(+) T Cell Epitopes for Therapy of Type 1 Diabetes in the NOD Mouse Model. Yu, C., Burns, J. C., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Ho, P. P., Steinman, L., Frey, A. B. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells are the target of self-reactive B and T cells. T cells reactive with epitopes derived from insulin and/or IGRP are critical for the initiation and maintenance of disease, but T cells reactive with other islet antigens likely have an essential role in disease progression. We sought to identify candidate CD8(+) T cell epitopes that are pathogenic in type 1 diabetes. Proteins that elicit autoantibodies in human type 1 diabetes were analyzed by predictive algorithms for candidate epitopes. Using several different tolerizing regimes using synthetic peptides, two new predicted tolerogenic CD8(+) T cell epitopes were identified in the murine homolog of the major human islet autoantigen zinc transporter ZnT8 (aa 158-166 and 282-290) and one in a non- cell protein, dopamine -hydroxylase (aa 233-241). Tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with a cDNA plasmid expressing full-length proinsulin prevented diabetes, whereas plasmids encoding ZnT8 and DH did not. However, tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with the proinsulin plasmid in combination with plasmids expressing ZnT8 and DH decreased insulitis and enhanced prevention of disease compared to vaccination with the plasmid encoding proinsulin alone.

View details for Mechanistic insights into influenza vaccine-associated narcolepsy We previously reported an increased frequency of antibodies to hypocretin (HCRT) receptor 2 in sera obtained from narcoleptic patients who received the European AS03-adjuvanted vaccine Pandemrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, s.a.) for the global influenza A H1N1 pandemic in 2009 [A(H1N1)pdm09]. These antibodies cross-reacted with a particular fragment of influenza nucleoprotein (NP) - one of the proteins naturally contained in the virus used to make seasonal influenza vaccine and pandemic influenza vaccines. The purpose of this commentary is to provide additional insights and interpretations of the findings and share additional data not presented in the original paper to help the reader appreciate the key messages of that publication. First, a brief background to narcolepsy and vaccine-induced narcolepsy will be provided. Then, additional insights and clarification will be provided on the following topics: 1) the critical difference identified in the adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines, 2) the contributing factor likely for the discordant association of narcolepsy between the AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccines Pandemrix and Arepanrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, s.a.), 3) the significance of detecting HCRT receptor 2 (HCRTr2) antibodies in some Finnish control subjects, 4) the approach used for the detection of HCRTr2 antibodies in vaccine-associated narcolepsy, and 5) the plausibility of the proposed mechanism involving HCRTr2 modulation in vaccine-associated narcolepsy.

Tissue Transglutaminase contributes to experimental multiple sclerosis pathogenesis and clinical outcome by promoting macrophage migration van Strien, M. E., de Vries, H. E., Chrobok, N. L., Bol, J. G., Breve, J. J., van der Pol, S. M., Kooij, G., van Buul, J. D., Karpuj, M., Steinman, L., Wilhelmus, M. M., Sestito, C., Drukarch, B., Van Dam, A. Multiple sclerosis is a serious neurological disorder, resulting in e.g., sensory, motor and cognitive deficits. A critical pathological aspect of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the influx of immunomodulatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS). Identification of key players that regulate cellular trafficking into the CNS may lead to the development of more selective treatment to halt this process. The multifunctional enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) can participate in various inflammation-related processes, and is known to be expressed in the CNS. In the present study, we question whether TG2 activity contributes to the pathogenesis of experimental MS, and could be a novel therapeutic target. In human post-mortem material, we showed the appearance of TG2 immunoreactivity in leukocytes in MS lesions, and particular in macrophages in rat chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (cr-EAE), an experimental MS model. Clinical deficits as observed in mouse EAE were reduced in TG2 knock-out mice compared to littermate wild-type mice, supporting a role of TG2 in EAE pathogenesis. To establish if the enzyme TG2 represents an attractive therapeutic target, cr-EAE rats were treated with TG2 activity inhibitors during ongoing disease. Reduction of TG2 activity in cr-EAE animals dramatically attenuated clinical deficits and demyelination. The mechanism underlying these beneficial effects pointed toward a reduction in macrophage migration into the CNS due to attenuated cytoskeletal flexibility and RhoA GTPase activity. Moreover, iNOS and TNF levels were selectively reduced in the CNS of cr-EAE rats treated with a TG2 activity inhibitor, whereas other relevant inflammatory mediators were not affected in CNS or spleen by reducing TG2 activity. We conclude that modulating TG2 activity opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in MS which does not affect peripheral levels of inflammatory mediators.

This region of EPO has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Use of a peptide sequence from this region provides the potential for an effective therapeutic without effects on erythropoiesis. The re-emergence of antigen-specific tolerance as a potential therapy for MS Ideal therapy for inflammatory disease in the nervous system would preserve normal immune function, while suppressing only the pathologic immune responses that damage tissue and allowing for repair. In principle, antigen-specific therapy would eradicate unwanted adaptive immune responses-antibody and T-cell mediated--while preserving the integrity of other adaptive responses to infectious agents and retaining the ability to fight malignancy. However, at this time, for multiple sclerosis (MS) we do not have compelling evidence that would support any particular dominant immune response to any specific antigen or even a limited group of antigens. In fact, there are adaptive immune responses to a wide swathe of proteins and lipids found on neurons and myelin in MS. Unless controlling a few of the known immune responses is sufficient, antigen-specific therapy in MS may not have enough of an impact to modulate clinical outcome. However, in other neuroinflammatory conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica, the adaptive immune response is highly focused. Trials of antigen-specific therapy for neuroinflammatory disease might first be tested in diseases with a more limited adaptive immune response like neuromyelitis optica. The likelihood of a significant success for this therapeutic strategy might then ensue.

C., Newell, E. W., Nolan, G., Ansel, K. M., Davis, M. M., Steinman, L., Chen, C. Understanding the consequences of tuning TCR signaling on selection, peripheral T cell function, and tolerance in the context of native TCR repertoires may provide insight into the physiological control of tolerance. In this study, we show that genetic ablation of a natural tuner of TCR signaling, mir-181a-1/b-1, in double-positive thymocytes dampened TCR and Erk signaling and increased the threshold of positive selection. Whereas mir-181a-1/b-1 deletion in mice resulted in an increase in the intrinsic reactivity of naive T cells to self-antigens, it did not cause spontaneous autoimmunity. Loss of mir-181a-1/b-1 dampened the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and reduced basal TCR signaling in peripheral T cells and their migration from lymph nodes to pathogenic sites. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tolerance can be modulated by microRNA gene products through the control of opposing activities in T cell selection and peripheral T cell function. View details for HDL-bound sphingosine-1-phosphate restrains lymphopoiesis and neuroinflammation. Blaho, V. A., Galvani, S., Engelbrecht, E., Liu, C., Swendeman, S. L., Kono, M., Proia, R. L., Steinman, L., Han, M. H., Hla, T. Lipid mediators influence immunity in myriad ways. For example, circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a key regulator of lymphocyte egress. Although the majority of plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle, the immunological functions of the ApoM-S1P complex are unknown. Here we show that ApoM-S1P is dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking yet restrains lymphopoiesis by activating the S1P1 receptor on bone marrow lymphocyte progenitors. Mice that lacked ApoM (Apom(-/-)) had increased proliferation of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) cKit(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells (LSKs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in bone marrow. Pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression of S1P1 suppressed LSK and CLP cell proliferation in vivo. ApoM was stably associated with bone marrow CLPs, which showed active S1P1 signalling in vivo. Moreover, ApoM-bound S1P, but not albumin-bound S1P, inhibited lymphopoiesis in vitro. Upon immune stimulation, Apom(-/-) mice developed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, characterized by increased lymphocytes in the central nervous system and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the ApoM-S1P-S1P1 signalling axis restrains the lymphocyte compartment and, subsequently, adaptive immune responses. Unique biological functions imparted by specific S1P chaperones could be exploited for novel therapeutic opportunities.

Abou-Hamdan, M., Costanza, M., Fontana, E., Di Dario, M., Musio, S., Congiu, C., Onnis, V., Lattanzi, R., Radaelli, M., Martinelli, V., Salvadori, S., Negri, L., Poliani, P. L., Farina, C., Balboni, G., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. To investigate the potential role of prokineticin 2 (PK2), a bioactive peptide involved in multiple biological functions including immune modulation, in CNS autoimmune demyelinating disease.We investigated the expression of PK2 in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), and in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. We evaluated the biological effects of PK2 on expression of EAE and on development of T-cell response against myelin by blocking PK2 in vivo with PK2 receptor antagonists. We treated with PK2 immune cells activated against myelin antigen to explore the immune-modulating effects of this peptide in vitro.Pk2 messenger RNA was upregulated in spinal cord and lymph node cells (LNCs) of mice with EAE. PK2 protein was expressed in EAE inflammatory infiltrates and was increased in sera during EAE. In patients with relapsing-remitting MS, transcripts for PK2 were significantly increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with healthy controls, and PK2 serum concentrations were significantly higher. A PK2 receptor antagonist prevented or attenuated established EAE in chronic and relapsing-remitting models, reduced CNS inflammation and demyelination, and decreased the production of interferon (IFN)- and interleukin (IL)-17A cytokines in LNCs while increasing IL-10. PK2 in vitro increased IFN- and IL-17A and reduced IL-10 in splenocytes activated against myelin antigen.These data suggest that PK2 is a critical immune regulator in CNS autoimmune demyelination and may represent a new target for therapy.

Y., Steinman, L. Natalizumab treatment alters peripheral CD4 cells counts in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, providing a way to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. The study was undertaken to assess whether CD4 cell counts correlate with different phases of natalizumab treatment of relapsing MS patients, including during a 12-week planned treatment interruption, and whether that might provide insights on lymphocyte trafficking. Clinical outcomes, MRI data, and CD4 cell counts were assessed at baseline prior to initiating natalizumab, while on regular dosing, at the end of the 12-week extended dosing interval, and at the time of reinitiation of natalizumab. The 12-week interruption was well tolerated and not associated with return of MS activity, disability progression, or new or worsened MRI data. Observed significant shifts in CD4 counts - dramatically increasing from the baseline while on treatment and decreasing back to the baseline level off treatment, then rising in a similar manner on natalizumab reinitiation, suggest that these measurements may aid in monitoring modulation of lymphocyte trafficking and cell redistribution. IFN- Treatment Requires B Cells for Efficacy in Neuroautoimmunity. Schubert, R. D., Hu, Y., Kumar, G., Szeto, S., Abraham, P., Winderl, J., Guthridge, J. M., Pardo, G., Dunn, J., Steinman, L., Axtell, R. C. IFN- remains the most widely prescribed treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Despite widespread use of IFN-, the therapeutic mechanism is still partially understood. Particularly, the clinical relevance of increased B cell activity during IFN- treatment is unclear. In this article, we show that IFN- pushes some B cells into a transitional, regulatory population that is a critical mechanism for therapy. IFN- treatment increases the absolute number of regulatory CD19(+)CD24(++)CD38(++) transitional B cells in peripheral blood relative to treatment-naive and Copaxone-treated patients. In addition, we found that transitional B cells from both healthy controls and IFN--treated MS patients are potent producers of IL-10, and that the capability of IFN- to induce IL-10 is amplified when B cells are stimulated. Similar changes are seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IFN- treatment increases transitional and regulatory B cell populations, as well as IL-10 secretion in the spleen. Furthermore, we found that IFN- increases autoantibody production, implicating humoral immune activation in B cell regulatory responses. Finally, we demonstrate that IFN- therapy requires immune-regulatory B cells by showing that B cell-deficient mice do not benefit clinically or histopathologically from IFN- treatment. These results have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Prolactin: A versatile regulator of inflammation and autoimmune pathology Costanza, M., Binart, N., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. Prolactin (PRL) has long been proposed as an immune-stimulating and detrimental factor in autoimmune disorders. However, recent findings have challenged this common view, showing that PRL does not play a crucial role in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS), and even protects against adjuvant-induced model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this review we provide a critical overview of data supporting a role for PRL in the regulation of immune responses. In addition, we focus on studies exploring the involvement of PRL in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, MS and RA, in light of the recently-outlined regenerative properties of this hormone.

J., Jurado, S., Han, J., Steinman, L., Longo, F. M., Schneider, J. A., Malenka, R. C., Buckwalter, M. S. Each year, 10 million people worldwide survive the neurologic injury associated with a stroke. Importantly, stroke survivors have more than twice the risk of subsequently developing dementia compared with people who have never had a stroke. The link between stroke and the later development of dementia is not understood. There are reports of oligoclonal bands in the CSF of stroke patients, suggesting that in some people a B-lymphocyte response to stroke may occur in the CNS. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke could contribute to the onset of dementia. We discovered that, in mouse models, activated B-lymphocytes infiltrate infarcted tissue in the weeks after stroke. B-lymphocytes undergo isotype switching, and IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies are found in the neuropil adjacent to the lesion. Concurrently, mice develop delayed deficits in LTP and cognition. Genetic deficiency, and the pharmacologic ablation of B-lymphocytes using an anti-CD20 antibody, prevents the appearance of delayed cognitive deficits. Furthermore, immunostaining of human postmortem tissue revealed that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke also occurs in the brain of some people with stroke and dementia. These data suggest that some stroke patients may develop a B-lymphocyte response to stroke that contributes to dementia, and is potentially treatable with FDA-approved drugs that target B cells. View details for Role reversal: infiltrating T cells protect the brain Inflammatory conditions intensify and then resolve, often sparing and recovering some of the injured tissue. While the ebb and flow of inflammation can be followed in many tissues, there is not a great deal of information on how inflammation regresses in the brain. In this issue of the JCI, Walsh, Hendrix, and colleagues illuminate a cellular mechanism whereby T cells that infiltrate the brain after nerve crush or contusion actually protect neurons from injury. These infiltrating T cells produce IL-4 and do so independently of a classic adaptive T cell immune response. The T cells respond to mediators produced by damaged neurons, without the classic three-way interaction among antigen, the major histocompatibility complex, and the T cell receptor. After brain injury, these protective T cells produce IL-4, which attenuates damage via IL-4 receptors on neurons.

View details for Self-Assembling Peptides Form Immune Suppressive Amyloid Fibrils Effective in Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis. Amyloidogenic proteins have long been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. However, amyloid fibrils composed of six amino acids are protective in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decrease in the number of inflammatory foci in the parenchyma and meninges of the brain and spinal cord, and amelioration of the neurological signs of EAE when amyloid fibril-forming hexapeptides are administered reveal that some fibrils provide benefit. The therapeutic activity of the amyloid fibrils arise from diverse pathways that include binding of pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma, reduction of IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- levels, and induction of type 1 interferon (IFN). Type 1 IFN has been used widely as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of MS and has been shown to be therapeutic in EAE with adoptive transfer of Th1 lymphocytes. However, type 1 IFN is known to exacerbate EAE with adoptive transfer of Th17 lymphocytes. Indeed, the amyloid fibril-forming peptide Tau 623-628 was therapeutic in Th1 adoptively transferred EAE, but ineffective in Th17 adoptively transferred EAE. However, the therapeutic effect of Tau 623-628 was restored in IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) knockout mice, indicating that other immune pathways independent of type 1 IFN induction play a role in the amelioration of EAE. Moreover, Amylin 28-33, a polar, non-ionizable peptide that does not form fibrils as rapidly as Tau 623-628, induces a small fraction of type 1 IFN compared to Tau 623-628 and is therapeutic in Th17 EAE. The diverse immunological pathways modulated by the self-assembling hexapeptides are under investigation with a goal to develop novel, safe, and potent therapeutics for neuroinflammation. Gene expression analysis of histamine receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with clinically-isolated syndrome and different stages of multiple sclerosis Costanza, M., Di Dario, M., Steinman, L., Farina, C., Pedotti, R. Along with their established role in allergic reactions, histamine and its receptors have been implicated in the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In this study we analyzed the gene expression of histamine receptor 1 (HRH1), HRH2 and HRH4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, secondary-progressive (SP) MS, primary-progressive (PP) MS, and healthy controls (HC). We found that HRH1 transcript was significantly down-modulated in SP-MS compared with HC, and HRH4 was increased in this group compared to HC, CIS and RR-MS. No other differences in the expression of histamine receptors were observed between HC, CIS and other clinical forms of definite MS.

Their application of the animal model, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), for the discovery of Copaxone, opened a new path for testing of drug candidates in MS. By measuring clinical, pathologic, and immunologic outcomes, the biological implications of new drugs could be elucidated. Using EAE they established the efficacy of Copaxone as a therapy for preventing and reducing paralysis and inflammation in the central nervous system without massive immune suppression. This had a huge impact on the field of drug discovery for MS. Much like the use of parabiosis to discover soluble factors associated with obesity, or the replica plating system to probe antibiotic resistance in bacteria, the pioneering research on Copaxone using the EAE model, paved the way for the discovery of other therapeutics in MS, including Natalizumab and Fingolimod. Future applications of this approach may well elucidate novel therapies for the neurodegenerative phase of multiple sclerosis associated with disease progression. View details for Conflicting consequences of immunity to cancer versus autoimmunity to neurons: Insights from paraneoplastic disease Immunologists are well aware that cancer regression and increased patient survival with the use of checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, an antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, CTLA-4 (CD152), is accompanied by concomitant autoimmunity. For over 30 years, a small group of investigators have shown that the rare paraneoplastic syndromes are caused by immunity to shared antigens found on both tumors and on components of the nervous system. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Blachre et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2014. 44: 3240-3251] elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tolerance to neuronal antigens which share epitopes with oncologic antigens, observed in the context of paraneoplastic syndromes in mice. The presence of the shared tumor antigen on a nonhematopoietic cell underlies the basis for a certain level of tolerance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, preventing these cells from attacking the brain, but allowing them to lyse the tumor upon transfer into tumor-bearing recipient mice. Comparisons between the paraneoplastic syndromes and the new autoimmune conditions seen with antibodies to immune checkpoints at CD152 or at CD279 are likely to illuminate shared mechanisms and solutions to these vexing diseases.

View details for View details for Why are prions and amyloid structures immune suppressive and other intriguing questions facing neuroimmunologists in the future The immune system plays a major role in certain diseases of the brain like multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, while the brain may play a major role in modulating certain immunologic diseases of the periphery like inflammatory bowel disease. The most significant developments in neuroimmunology will involve explorations of the roles for the immune system in neurodegenerative conditions often associated with the presence of amyloid deposits. Here I present my personal perspectives on four of the most intriguing challenges that we face in the future of neuroimmunology: (1) Why are the traditional hallmarks of innate and adaptive inflammation conspicuously absent from brains of individuals with prion disease and amyloid pathology? (2) What is the role of adaptive and innate immunity in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis? (3) Is molecular mimicry an adequate explanation for the initiation of neuroinflammatory disease and for exacerbations in conditions like multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, and neuromyelitis optica? (4) Do neural pathways regulate inflammatory diseases outside the nervous system? View details for Thymic Epithelium Determines a Spontaneous Chronic Neuritis in Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD Mice Horste, G. M., Mausberg, A. K., Cordes, S., El-Haddad, H., Partke, H., Leussink, V. I., Roden, M., Martin, S., Steinman, L., Hartung, H., Kieseier, B. C. The NOD mouse strain spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes. A deficiency in costimulatory molecules, such as B7-2, on the NOD genetic background prevents diabetes but instead triggers an inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. This constitutes a shift in the target of autoimmunity, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that NOD mice deficient for isoforms of ICAM-1, which comediate costimulatory functions, spontaneously develop a chronic autoimmune peripheral neuritis instead of diabetes. The disease is transferred by CD4(+) T cells, which infiltrate peripheral nerves together with macrophages and B cells and are autoreactive against peripheral myelin protein zero. These Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit unaltered numbers of regulatory T cells, but increased IL-17-producing T cells, which determine the severity, but not the target specificity, of autoimmunity. Ab-mediated ICAM-1 blockade triggers neuritis only in young NOD mice. Thymic epithelium from Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice features an altered expression of costimulatory molecules and induces neuritis and myelin autoreactivity after transplantation into nude mice in vivo. Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit a specifically altered TCR repertoire. Our findings introduce a novel animal model of chronic inflammatory neuropathies and indicate that altered expression of ICAM-1 on thymic epithelium shifts autoimmunity specifically toward peripheral nerves. This improves our understanding of autoimmunity in the peripheral nervous system with potential relevance for human diseases.

To elucidate immunopathogenetic roles of aquaporin-4 antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), we analyzed aquaporin-4 antibody titers, cellular and inflammatory markers in the CSF collected from 11 aquaporin-4 antibody seropositive patients. The CSF aquaporin-4 antibody levels during attacks (but not in sera) closely correlated with pleocytosis, inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 that can regulate antibody-producing plasmablasts, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in the CSF. The amount of aquaporin-4 antibodies present in the central nervous system may have therapeutic implications, as it is associated with astrocyte injury and inflammatory responses during NMOSD attacks.

In Alzheimer's Disease two amyloid molecules A A4 and tau vie for consideration as the main pathogenic culprit. But molecules obey the laws of chemistry and defy the way we categorize them as humans with our well-known proclivities to bias in our reasoning. We have been exploring the brains of multiple sclerosis patients to identify molecules that are associated with protection from inflammation and degeneration. In 2001 we noted that aB crystallin (cryab) was the most abundant transcript found in MS lesions, but not in healthy brains.

Cryab is an amyloid forming molecule. We have identified a core structure common to many amyloids including amyloid protein A A4, tau, amylin, prion protein, serum amyloid protein P, and cryab. The core hexapeptide structure is highly immune suppressive and can reverse paralysis in EAE when administered systemically. Administration of this amyloid forming hexapeptide quickly lowers inflammatory cytokines in plasma like IL-6 and IL-2.

Uncovering Cryptic Glycan Markers in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) Wang, D., Bhat, R., Sobel, R. A., Huang, W., Wang, L., Olsson, T., Steinman, L. Using an integrated antigen microarray approach, we observed epitope-spreading of autoantibody responses to a variety of antigenic structures in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in the serum of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These included previously described protein- and lipid-based antigenic targets and newly discovered autoimmunogenic sugar moieties, notably, autoantibodies specific for the oligomannoses in both MS patient CSF and the sera of mice with EAE. These glycans are often masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of cryptic autoantigens. We further determined that these targets are highly expressed on multiple cell types in MS and EAE lesions. Co-immunization of SJL/J mice with a Man9-KLH conjugate at the time of EAE induction elicited highly significant levels of anti-Man9-cluster autoantibodies. Nevertheless, this anti-glycan autoantibody response was associated with a significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE. The potential of these cryptic glycan markers and targeting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions of neurological disorders has yet to be explored.

View details for Development of therapies for autoimmune disease at Stanford: a tale of multiple shots and one goal The title of this contribution on Immunology at Stanford is purposely ambiguous. One goal is the development of safe and effective therapy for autoimmune diseases. Another definition of goal is to score, and this would ultimately mean the development of an approved drug. Indeed, the efforts in my four decades at Stanford, have included the discovery and subsequent development of a monoclonal antibody to block homing to the inflamed brain, leading to natalizumab, an approved therapeutic for two autoimmune diseases: relapsing-remitting MS and for inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple attempts to develop new therapies for autoimmune disease are described here: The trimolecular complex and the immune synapse serve as one major set of targets, with attempts to inhibit particular major histocompatibility molecules, the variable regions of the T cell receptor, and CD4. Other approaches focusing on antigen-specific tolerance include ongoing attempts with tolerizing DNA vaccines in type 1 diabetes. Finally, the repurposing of popular drugs approved for other indications, including statins and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme is under development and showing promise in the clinic, particularly for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The milieu within Stanford Immunology has helped to nurture these efforts to translate discoveries in immunology and to take them from bench to bedside. View details for Narcolepsy, 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza, and pandemic influenza vaccinations: What is known and unknown about the neurological disorder, the role for autoimmunity, and vaccine adjuvants Ahmed, S. S., Schur, P. H., MacDonald, N. E., Steinman, L. The vaccine safety surveillance system effectively detected a very rare adverse event, narcolepsy, in subjects receiving AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine made using the European inactivation/purification protocol. The reports of increased cases of narcolepsy in non-vaccinated subjects infected with wild A(H1N1) pandemic influenza virus suggest a role for the viral antigen(s) in disease development. However, additional investigations are needed to better understand what factor(s) in wild influenza infection trigger(s) narcolepsy in susceptible hosts. An estimated 31 million doses of European AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine were used in more than 47 countries. The Canadian AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine was used with high coverage in Canada where an estimated 12 million doses were administered. As no similar narcolepsy association has been reported to date with the AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine made using the Canadian inactivation/purification protocol, this suggests that the AS03 adjuvant alone may not be responsible for the narcolepsy association. To date, no narcolepsy association has been reported with the MF59-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine. This review article provides a brief background on narcolepsy, outlines the different types of vaccine preparations including the ones for influenza, reviews the accumulated evidence for the safety of adjuvants, and explores the association between autoimmune diseases and natural infections. It concludes by assimilating the historical observations and recent clinical studies to formulate a feasible hypothesis on why vaccine-associated narcolepsy may not be solely linked to the AS03 adjuvant but more likely be linked to how the specific influenza antigen component of the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine was prepared. Careful and long-term epidemiological studies of subjects who developed narcolepsy in association with AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine prepared with the European inactivation/purification protocol are needed.

M., Hoehne, A., Alabsi, H., Gambhir, S. S., Steinman, L., Luo, J., Wyss-Coray, T. Aberrant microglial responses contribute to neuroinflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases, but no current therapies target pathogenic microglia. We discovered unexpectedly that the antiviral drug ganciclovir (GCV) inhibits the proliferation of microglia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as in kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity. In EAE, GCV largely prevented infiltration of T lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) and drastically reduced disease incidence and severity when delivered before the onset of disease. In contrast, GCV treatment had minimal effects on peripheral leukocyte distribution in EAE and did not inhibit generation of antibodies after immunization with ovalbumin. Additionally, a radiolabeled analogue of penciclovir, [(18)F]FHBG, which is similar in structure to GCV, was retained in areas of CNS inflammation in EAE, but not in naive control mice, consistent with the observed therapeutic effects. Our experiments suggest GCV may have beneficial effects in the CNS beyond its antiviral properties. Neither T-helper type 2 nor Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells are necessary for therapeutic benefit of atorvastatin in treatment of central nervous system autoimmunity Weber, M. S., Prod'homme, T., Youssef, S., Dunn, S. E., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Oral atorvastatin has prevented or reversed paralysis in the multiple sclerosis (MS) model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and reduced development of new MS lesions in clinical trials. Besides inhibiting development of encephalitogenic T cells, atorvastatin treatment of EAE has been associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory myelin-reactive T-helper type (Th)-2 cells. To investigate the clinical significance of atorvastatin-mediated Th2 differentiation, we first evaluated atorvastatin treatment in interleukin (IL)-4 green fluorescent protein-enhanced transcript (4-GET) reporter mice. Atorvastatin treatment failed to induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo; however, when T cells from atorvastatin-treated 4-GET mice were reactivated in vitro, T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 cells, while antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor and IL-12) were reduced. Oral atorvastatin also prevented or reversed EAE in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-deficient (STAT6-/-) mice, which cannot generate IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Further, atorvastatin treatment did not induce or expand Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in either wild-type or STAT6-/- mice. In vivo proliferation of T cells, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, was inhibited in atorvastatin-treated wild-type and STAT6-/- mice. These data imply that atorvastatin ameliorates central nervous system autoimmune disease primarily by inhibiting proliferation of proinflammatory encephalitogenic T cells, and not simply through induction of anti-inflammatory Th2 cells. This cytostatic effect may be a relevant mechanism of action when considering use of statins in MS and other inflammatory conditions.

Metabolic stroke is the rapid onset of lasting central neurological deficit associated with decompensation of an underlying metabolic disorder. Glutaric aciduria type I (GA1) is an inherited disorder of lysine and tryptophan metabolism presenting with metabolic stroke in infancy. The clinical presentation includes bilateral striatal necrosis and spontaneous subdural and retinal hemorrhages, which has been frequently misdiagnosed as non-accidental head trauma. The mechanisms underlying metabolic stroke and spontaneous hemorrhage are poorly understood.Using a mouse model of GA1, we show that metabolic stroke progresses in the opposite sequence of ischemic stroke, with initial neuronal swelling and vacuole formation leading to cerebral capillary occlusion. Focal regions of cortical followed by striatal capillaries are occluded with shunting to larger non-exchange vessels leading to early filling and dilation of deep cerebral veins. Blood-brain barrier breakdown was associated with displacement of tight-junction protein Occludin.Together the current findings illuminate the pathophysiology of metabolic stroke and vascular compromise in GA1, which may translate to other neurometabolic disorders presenting with stroke.

CRYAB modulates the activation of CD4(+) T cells from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients Que Lan Quach, Q. L., Metz, L. M., Thomas, J. C., Rothbard, J. B., Steinman, L., Ousman, S. S. BACKGROUND: Suppression of activation of pathogenic CD4(+) T cells is a potential therapeutic intervention in multiple sclerosis (MS). We previously showed that a small heat shock protein, CRYAB, reduced T cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and clinical signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a model of MS. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether the ability of CRYAB to reduce the activation of T cells translated to the human disease. METHODS: CD4(+) T cells from healthy controls and volunteers with MS were activated in vitro in the presence or absence of a CRYAB peptide (residues 73-92). Parameters of activation (proliferation rate, cytokine secretion) and tolerance (anergy, activation-induced cell death, microRNAs) were evaluated. RESULTS: The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CD4(+) T cells was decreased in the presence of CRYAB in a subset of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) participants with mild disease severity while no changes were observed in healthy controls. Further, there was a correlation for higher levels of miR181a microRNA, a marker upregulated in tolerant CD8(+) T cells, in CD4(+) T cells of MS patients that displayed suppressed cytokine production (responders). CONCLUSION: CRYAB may be capable of suppressing the activation of CD4(+) T cells from a subset of RRMS patients who appear to have less disability but similar age and disease duration. View details for Clinical optimization of antigen specific modulation of type 1 diabetes with the plasmid DNA platform Gottlieb, P., Utz, P. J., Robinson, W., Steinman, L. Some clinical trials in humans have aimed at modulation of type 1 diabetes (T1D) via alteration of the immune response to putative islet cell antigens, particularly proinsulin and insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase and the peptide, DiaPep 277, derived from heat shock protein 60. The focus here is on development of a specially engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin to treat T1D. The plasmid is engineered to turn off adaptive immunity to proinsulin. This approach yielded exciting results in a randomized placebo controlled trial in 80 adult patients with T1D. The implications of this trial are explored in regards to the potential for sparing inflammation in islets and thus allowing the functioning beta cells to recover and produce more insulin. Strategies to further strengthen the effects seen thus far with the tolerizing DNA plasmid to proinsulin will be elucidated. The DNA platform affords an opportunity for easy modifications. In addition standard exploration of dose levels, route of administration and frequency of dose are practical. Optimization of the effects seen to date on C-peptide and on depletion of proinsulin specific CD8 T cells are feasible, with expected concomitant improvement in other parameters like hemoglobin A1c and reduction in insulin usage. T1D is one of the few autoimmune conditions where antigen specific therapy can be achieved, provided the approach is tested intelligently. Tolerizing DNA vaccines to proinsulin and other islet cell autoantigens is a worthy pursuit to potentially treat, prevent and to perhaps even 'cure' or 'prevent' type 1 diabetes.

C., O'Connor, K. C., Hafler, D. A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) share overlapping clinical, radiologic and laboratory features at onset. Because autoantibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, we sought to identify autoantibody biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing them. METHODS: We used custom antigen arrays to profile anti-myelin-peptide autoantibodies in sera derived from individuals with pediatric ADEM (n = 15), pediatric multiple sclerosis (Ped MS; n = 11) and adult MS (n = 15). Using isotype-specific secondary antibodies, we profiled both IgG and IgM reactivities. We used Statistical Analysis of Microarrays software to confirm the differences in autoantibody reactivity profiles between ADEM and MS samples. We used Prediction Analysis of Microarrays software to generate and validate prediction algorithms, based on the autoantibody reactivity profiles. RESULTS: ADEM was characterized by IgG autoantibodies targeting epitopes derived from myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein, and alpha-B-crystallin. In contrast, MS was characterized by IgM autoantibodies targeting myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte-specific protein. We generated and validated prediction algorithms that distinguish ADEM serum (sensitivity 62-86%; specificity 56-79%) from MS serum (sensitivity 40-87%; specificity 62-86%) on the basis of combined IgG and IgM anti-myelin autoantibody reactivity to a small number of myelin peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Combined profiles of serum IgG and IgM autoantibodies identified myelin antigens that may be useful for distinguishing MS from ADEM. Further studies are required to establish clinical utility. Further biological assays are required to delineate the pathogenic potential of these antibodies.

M., Steinman, L., Tintore, M., Vollmer, T. L., Weber, M. S., Weiner, L. P., Ziemssen, T., Zamvil, S. S. Several innovative disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis have been licensed recently or are in late-stage development. The molecular targets of several of these DMTs are well defined. All affect at least 1 of 4 properties, namely (1) trafficking, (2) survival, (3) function, or (4) proliferation. In contrast to -interferons and glatiramer acetate, the first-generation DMTs, several newer therapies are imbued with safety issues, which may be attributed to their structure or metabolism. In addition to efficacy, understanding the relationship between the mechanism of action of the DMTs and their safety profile is pertinent for decision making and patient care. In this article, we focus primarily on the safety of DMTs in the context of understanding their pharmacological characteristics, including molecular targets, mechanism of action, chemical structure, and metabolism. While understanding mechanisms underlying DMT toxicities is incomplete, it is important to further develop this knowledge to minimize risk to patients and to ensure future therapies have the most advantageous benefit-risk profiles. Recognizing the individual classes of DMTs described here may be valuable when considering use of such agents sequentially or possibly in combination.

M., Steinman, L., Tintor, M., Vollmer, T. L., Weber, M. S., Weiner, L. P., Ziemssen, T., Zamvil, S. S. Several innovative disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis have been licensed recently or are in late-stage development. The molecular targets of several of these DMTs are well defined. All affect at least 1 of 4 properties, namely (1) trafficking, (2) survival, (3) function, or (4) proliferation. In contrast to -interferons and glatiramer acetate, the first-generation DMTs, several newer therapies are imbued with safety issues, which may be attributed to their structure or metabolism. In addition to efficacy, understanding the relationship between the mechanism of action of the DMTs and their safety profile is pertinent for decision making and patient care. In this article, we focus primarily on the safety of DMTs in the context of understanding their pharmacological characteristics, including molecular targets, mechanism of action, chemical structure, and metabolism. While understanding mechanisms underlying DMT toxicities is incomplete, it is important to further develop this knowledge to minimize risk to patients and to ensure future therapies have the most advantageous benefit-risk profiles. Recognizing the individual classes of DMTs described here may be valuable when considering use of such agents sequentially or possibly in combination. The Interdependent, Overlapping, and Differential Roles of Type I and II IFNs in the Pathogenesis of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Naves, R., Singh, S. P., Cashman, K. S., Rowse, A. L., Axtell, R. C., Steinman, L., Mountz, J. D., Steele, C., De Sarno, P., Raman, C. Type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) and type II IFN (IFN-) mediate both regulation and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the underlying mechanism for these Janus-like activities of type I and II IFNs in neuroinflammation remains unclear. Although endogenous type I IFN signaling provides a protective response in neuroinflammation, we find that when IFN- signaling is ablated, type I IFNs drive inflammation, resulting in exacerbated EAE. IFN- has a disease stage-specific opposing function in EAE. Treatment of mice with IFN- during the initiation phase of EAE leads to enhanced severity of disease. In contrast, IFN- treatment during the effector phase attenuated disease. This immunosuppressive activity of IFN- required functional type I IFN signaling. In IFN-/ receptor-deficient mice, IFN- treatment during effector phase of EAE exacerbated disease. Using an adoptive transfer EAE model, we found that T cell-intrinsic type I and II IFN signals are simultaneously required to establish chronic EAE by encephalitogenic Th1 cells. However, in Th17 cells loss of either IFN signals leads to the development of a severe chronic disease. The data imply that type I and II IFN signals have independent but nonredundant roles in restraining encephalitogenic Th17 cells in vivo. Collectively, our data show that type I and II IFNs function in an integrated manner to regulate pathogenesis in EAE.

IMPORTANCE High serum levels of interleukin 17F (IL-17F) at baseline have been associated with suboptimal response to interferon beta in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE To further investigate the role of IL-17F in predicting treatment response to interferon beta-1b in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis using the Singulex Erenna IL-17F immunoassay. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Serum samples were analyzed from 239 randomly selected patients treated with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years in the Betaferon Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose Study. EXPOSURE Treatment with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Levels of IL-17F at baseline and month 6 as well as the difference between the IL-17F levels at month 6 and baseline were compared between the following: (1) patients with less disease activity vs more disease activity; (2) patients with no disease activity vs some disease activity; and (3) responders vs nonresponders. RESULTS Levels of IL-17F measured at baseline and month 6 did not correlate with lack of response to treatment after 2 years using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Relapses and new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were not associated with pretreatment serum IL-17F levels. When patients with neutralizing antibodies were excluded, the results did not change. All patients with levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL were associated with poor response with some clinical or radiological activity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An increase of IL-17F before and early after treatment with interferon beta-1b was not associated with poor response. These data do not support the value of IL-17F as a treatment response indicator for therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis with interferon beta, although high levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL may predict nonresponsiveness. View details for Th17 cells induce Th1-polarizing monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Davidson, M. G., Alonso, M. N., Yuan, R., Axtell, R. C., Kenkel, J. A., Suhoski, M. M., Gonzlez, J. C., Steinman, L., Engleman, E. G. In chronically inflamed tissues, such as those affected by autoimmune disease, activated Th cells often colocalize with monocytes. We investigate in this study how murine Th cells influence the phenotype and function of monocytes. The data demonstrate that Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets promote the differentiation of autologous monocytes into MHC class II(+), CD11b(+), CD11c(+) DC that we call DCTh. Although all Th subsets induce the formation of DCTh, activated Th17 cells uniquely promote the formation of IL-12/IL-23-producing DCTh (DCTh17) that can polarize both naive and Th17 cells to a Th1 phenotype. In the inflamed CNS of mice with Th17-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Th cells colocalize with DC, as well as monocytes, and the Th cells obtained from these lesions drive the formation of DCTh that are phenotypically indistinguishable from DCTh17 and polarize naive T cells toward a Th1 phenotype. These results suggest that DCTh17 are critical in the interplay of Th17- and Th1-mediated responses and may explain the previous finding that IL-17-secreting Th cells become IFN--secreting Th1 cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and other autoimmune disorders.

A., Chow, L. M., Ibrahim, A., Baker, S. J., Barres, B. A., Steinman, L., Brunet, A. Oligodendrocytes-the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system-can be regenerated during adulthood. In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. The gender gap in multiple sclerosis: intersection of science and society. Type I Interferons: Beneficial in Th1 and Detrimental in Th17 Autoimmunity In relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), type I interferon (IFN) is considered immuno-modulatory, and recombinant forms of IFN- are the most prescribed treatment for this disease. However, within the RRMS population, 30-50% of MS patients are nonresponsive to this treatment, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a disease once considered to be a form of RRMS. In contrast to RRMS, type I IFNs have been shown to have properties that drive the inflammatory pathologies in many other autoimmune diseases. These diseases include Sjgren's syndrome, system lupus erythematosus (SLE), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Historically, autoimmune diseases were thought to be driven by a TH1 response to auto-antigens. However, since the discovery of the TH17 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is now generally thought that TH17 plays an important role in MS and all other autoimmune diseases. In this article, we will discuss recent clinical and basic research advances in the field of autoimmunity and argue that IFN- and other type I IFNs are immuno-modulatory in diseases driven predominantly by TH1 but in contrast are inflammatory in diseases that have a predominant Th17 response.

A recent type 1 diabetes (T1D) clinical trial of rituximab (a B cell-depleting anti-CD20 antibody) achieved some therapeutic benefit in preserving C-peptide for a period of approximately nine months in patients with recently diagnosed diabetes. Our previous data in the NOD mouse demonstrated that co-administration of antigen (insulin) with anti-CD3 antibody (a T cell-directed immunomodulator) offers better protection than either entity alone, indicating that novel combination therapies that include a T1D-related autoantigen are possible. To accelerate the identification and development of novel combination therapies that can be advanced into the clinic, we have evaluated the combination of a mouse anti-CD20 antibody with either oral insulin or a proinsulin-expressing DNA vaccine. Anti-CD20 alone, given once or on 4 consecutive days, produced transient B cell depletion but did not prevent or reverse T1D in the NOD mouse. Oral insulin alone (twice weekly for 6 weeks) was also ineffective, while proinsulin DNA (weekly for up to 12 weeks) showed a trend toward modest efficacy. Combination of anti-CD20 with oral insulin was ineffective in reversing diabetes in NOD mice whose glycemia was controlled with SC insulin pellets; these experiments were performed in three independent labs. Combination of anti-CD20 with proinsulin DNA was also ineffective in diabetes reversal, but did show modest efficacy in diabetes prevention (p = 0.04). In the prevention studies, anti-CD20 plus proinsulin resulted in modest increases in Tregs in pancreatic lymph nodes and elevated levels of proinsulin-specific CD4+ T-cells that produced IL-4. Thus, combination therapy with anti-CD20 and either oral insulin or proinsulin does not protect hyperglycemic NOD mice, but the combination with proinsulin offers limited efficacy in T1D prevention, potentially by augmentation of proinsulin-specific IL-4 production.

Natalizumab was granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004, only 12 years after its molecular target was cloned. Shortly after initial approval, natalizumab use was suspended pending a safety review when several natalizumab recipients were diagnosed as having progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. After the safety review, natalizumab was reintroduced to the market in 2006. Since then, more than 92,000 patients have been treated with the drug. Risk stratification algorithms and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy management strategies have been developed, which facilitate more personalized decision making and safer natalizumab use. This review article summarizes the evolution of natalizumab from target molecule discovery through regulatory approval, voluntary suspension, reapproval, and clinical use. The natalizumab story highlights both the opportunities and risks inherent in a novel biological therapy for a progressive neurologic disease.

There is a significant unmet need for serum biomarkers in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) that are predictive of therapeutic response to disease-modifying therapies. Following a recent Stanford study which reported that pretreatment levels of serum interleukin (IL)-17F could predict poor response to interferon- (IFN) therapy, we sought to validate the finding using samples from a large clinical trial.The validation cohort included 54 good responders (GR) and 64 poor responders (PR) selected from 762 subjects with RRMS from the IM IFN-1a dose comparison study (Avonex study C94-805). Subjects were classified as GR and PR based on the number of relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and new and enlarging T2 lesions on MRI. Serum samples were assayed for IL-17F using a multiplexed Luminex assay and for IL-17F/F using an ELISA. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study were also assayed to assure reproducibility of methods.Median pretreatment and post-treatment serum IL-17F levels were not statistically significantly different between GR and PR, and serum IL-7/IL-17F ratios were also not predictive of response status. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study showed good correlation to their original cohort (r = 0.77).We were unable to validate the finding that serum IL-17F is a predictor of PR in a large independent cohort of subjects with RRMS. Differences in patient populations and methodology might explain the failure to validate the results from the Stanford study.

A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination. Although considered a T cell-mediated disease, multiple sclerosis involves the activation of both adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as resident cells of the central nervous system, which synergize in inducing inflammation and thereby demyelination. Differentiation, survival, and inflammatory functions of innate immune cells and of astrocytes of the central nervous system are regulated by tyrosine kinases. Here, we show that imatinib, sorafenib, and GW2580-small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors-can each prevent the development of disease and treat established disease in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In vitro, imatinib and sorafenib inhibited astrocyte proliferation mediated by the tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), whereas GW2580 and sorafenib inhibited macrophage tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production mediated by the tyrosine kinases c-Fms and PDGFR, respectively. In vivo, amelioration of disease by GW2580 was associated with a reduction in the proportion of macrophages and T cells in the CNS infiltrate, as well as a reduction in the levels of circulating TNF. Our findings suggest that GW2580 and the FDA-approved drugs imatinib and sorafenib have potential as novel therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune demyelinating disease.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is predominantly produced by T helper 17 cells distinct from T helper 1 or T helper 2 cells, participates in the pathogenesis of infectious, autoimmune, and allergic disorders. However, the precise role in allograft rejection remains uncertain. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17 in acute allograft rejection using IL-17-deficient mice.Donor hearts from FVB mice were heterotopically transplanted into either C57BL/6J-IL-17-deficient (IL-17(-/-)) or -wild-type mice. Allograft survival was significantly prolonged in IL-17(-/-) recipient mice due to reduced local inflammation accompanied by decreased inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine expression. IL-17(-/-) recipient mice exhibited decreased IL-6 production and reciprocally enhanced regulatory T cell expansion, suggesting a contribution of regulatory T cells to prolonged allograft survival. Indeed, allografts transplanted into anti-CD25 mAb-treated IL-17(-/-) recipient mice (regulatory T cell-depleted) developed acute rejection similar to wild-type recipient mice. Surprisingly, we found that gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were key IL-17 producers in the allografts. In support, equivalent allograft rejection was observed in Rag-2(-/-) recipient mice engrafted with either wild-type or IL-17(-/-) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Finally, hearts transplanted into gamma delta T cell-deficient mice resulted in decreased allograft rejection compared with wild-type controls.During heart transplantation, (1) IL-17 is crucial for acceleration of acute rejection; (2) IL-17-deficiency enhances regulatory T cell expansion; and (3) gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are a potential source of IL-17. IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

L., Liu, H., Rohowsky-Kochan, C., Ichiyama, K., Yoshimura, A., Steinman, L., Christakos, S., Youssef, S. A new class of inflammatory CD4(+) T cells that produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) (termed Th17) has been identified, which plays a critical role in numerous inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3. Our results describe novel mechanisms and new concepts with regard to vitamin D and the immune system and suggest therapeutic targets for the control of autoimmune diseases.

The interleukin-7 receptor chain (IL-7R) gene was identified as a top non-major histocompatibility complex-linked risk locus for multiple sclerosis (MS). Recently, we showed that a T helper 1 (T(H)1)-driven, but not a T(H)17-driven, form of MS exhibited a good clinical response to interferon- (IFN-) therapy. We now demonstrate that high serum levels of IL-7, particularly when paired with low levels of IL-17F, predict responsiveness to IFN- and hence a T(H)1-driven subtype of MS. We also show that although IL-7 signaling is neither necessary nor sufficient for the induction or expansion of T(H)17 cells, IL-7 can greatly enhance both human and mouse T(H)1 cell differentiation. IL-7 alone is sufficient to induce human T(H)1 differentiation in the absence of IL-12 or other cytokines. Furthermore, targeting IL-7/IL-7R is beneficial in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Mice treated with IL-7R-blocking antibodies before or after onset of paralysis exhibited reduced clinical signs of EAE, with reduction in peripheral nave and activated T cells, whereas central memory T, regulatory T, B, and natural killer cell populations were largely spared. IL-7R antibody treatment markedly reduced lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system in mice with EAE. Thus, a serum profile of high IL-7 may signify a T(H)1-driven form of MS and may predict outcome in MS patients undergoing IFN- therapy. Blockade of IL-7 and the IL-7R pathway may have therapeutic potential in MS and other autoimmune diseases. View details for alpha B-Crystallin Improves Murine Cardiac Function and Attenuates Apoptosis in Human Endothelial Cells Exposed to Ischemia-Reperfusion Velotta, J. B., Kimura, N., Chang, S. H., Chung, J., Itoh, S., Rothbard, J., Yang, P. C., Steinman, L., Robbins, R. C., Fischbein, M. P. This study investigates the protective effect of exogenous B-crystallin (CryAB) on myocardial function after ischemia-reperfusion injury.Mice underwent temporary left anterior descending artery occlusion for 30 minutes. Either CryAB (50 g) or phosphate-buffered saline (100 L [n=6, each group]) were injected in the intramyocardial medial and lateral perinfarct zone 15 minutes before reperfusion. Intraperitoneal injections were administered every other day. Left ventricular ejection fraction was evaluated on postoperative day 40 with magnetic resonance imaging. To investigate the effect of CryAB on apoptosis after hypoxia/reoxygenation in vitro, murine atrial cardiomyocytes (HL-1 cells) or human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were incubated with either 50 g CryAB (500 g /10 mL) or phosphate-buffered saline in a hypoxia chamber for 6, 12, and 24 hours, followed by 30 minutes of reoxygenation at room air. Apoptosis was then assessed by western blot (Bcl-2, free bax, cleaved caspases-3, 9, PARP) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses (cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments and caspase-3 activity).On postoperative day 40, CryAB-treated mice had a 1.8-fold increase in left ventricular ejection fraction versus control mice (27%6% versus 15%4% SD, p<0.005). In vitro, (1) the HL-1 cells showed no significant difference in apoptotic protein expression, cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, or caspase-3 activity; (2) the HMEC-1 cells had increased but not significant apoptotic protein expression with, however, a significant decrease in cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (1.5-fold, p<0.01) and caspase-3 activity (2.7-fold, p<0.005).Exogenous CryAB administration significantly improves cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion injury, in vivo. The protective anti-apoptotic affects of CryAB may target the endothelial cell.

To determine whether low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) contribute to the increased risk of postpartum multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses.Prospective cohort study.Outpatients identified through membership records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California or Stanford University outpatient neurology clinics.Twenty-eight pregnant women with MS.We prospectively followed up patients through the postpartum year and assessed exposures and symptoms through structured interviews. Total serum 25(OH)D levels were measured using the DiaSorin Liaison Assay during the third trimester and 2, 4, and 6 months after giving birth. The data were analyzed using longitudinal multivariable methods.Levels of 25(OH)D and relapse rate.Fourteen (50%) women breastfed exclusively, and 12 women (43%) relapsed within 6 months after giving birth. During pregnancy, the average 25(OH)D levels were 25.4 ng/mL (range, 13.7-42.6) and were affected only by season (P=.009). In contrast, in the postpartum period, 25(OH)D levels were significantly affected by breastfeeding and relapse status. Levels of 25(OH)D remained low in the exclusive breastfeeding group, yet rose significantly in the nonexclusive breastfeeding group regardless of season (P=.007, unadjusted; P=.02, adjusted for season). By 4 and 6 months after childbirth, 25(OH)D levels were, on average, 5 ng/mL lower in the women who breastfed exclusively compared with the nonbreastfeeding group (P=.001).Pregnancy and exclusive breastfeeding are strongly associated with low 25(OH)D levels in women with MS. However, these lower vitamin D levels were not associated with an increased risk of postpartum MS relapses. These data suggest that low vitamin D in isolation is not an important risk factor for postpartum MS relapses. View details for Common variants in P2RY11 are associated with narcolepsy Kornum, B.

Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that narcolepsy with cataplexy is an autoimmune disease. We here report genome-wide association analyses for narcolepsy with replication and fine mapping across three ethnic groups (3,406 individuals of European ancestry, 2,414 Asians and 302 African Americans). We identify a SNP in the 3' untranslated region of P2RY11, the purinergic receptor subtype P2Y gene, which is associated with narcolepsy (rs2305795, combined P = 6.1 10, odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.39, n = 5689). The disease-associated allele is correlated with reduced expression of P2RY11 in CD8(+) T lymphocytes (339% reduced, P = 0.003) and natural killer (NK) cells (P = 0.031), but not in other peripheral blood mononuclear cell types. The low expression variant is also associated with reduced P2RY11-mediated resistance to ATP-induced cell death in T lymphocytes (P = 0.0007) and natural killer cells (P = 0.001). These results identify P2RY11 as an important regulator of immune-cell survival, with possible implications in narcolepsy and other autoimmune diseases.

N., Srinagesh, H., Axtell, R., Zhang, H., Platten, M., Wyss-Coray, T., Steinman, L. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key hormonal system regulating blood pressure. However, expression of RAAS components has recently been detected in immune cells, and the RAAS has been implicated in several mouse models of autoimmune disease. Here, we have identified Ang II as a paracrine mediator, sustaining inflammation in the CNS in the EAE mouse model of MS via TGF-beta. Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) were found to be primarily expressed in CNS-resident cells during EAE. In vitro, astrocytes and microglia responded to Ang II treatment by inducing TGF-beta expression via a pathway involving the TGF-beta-activating protease thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). TGF-beta upregulation in astrocytes and microglia during EAE was blocked with candesartan (CA), an inhibitor of AT1R. Treatment of EAE with CA ameliorated paralysis and blunted lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS, outcomes that were also seen with genetic ablation of AT1Ra and treatment with an inhibitor of TSP-1. These data suggest that AT1R antagonists, frequently prescribed as antihypertensives, may be useful to interrupt this proinflammatory, CNS-specific pathway in individuals with MS.

M., Bsibsi, M., Gerritsen, W. H., van der Valk, P., Bajramovic, J. J., Steinman, L., Amor, S. We present the first comparative analysis of serum immunoglobulin G reactivity profiles against the full spectrum of human myelin-associated proteins in multiple sclerosis patients and healthy control subjects. In both groups, serum antibodies display a consistent and prominent reaction to alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) versus other myelin proteins. As an apparently major target for the adaptive immune system in humans, CRYAB selectively accumulates in oligodendrocytes, but not in astrocytes, or axons in so-called preactive multiple sclerosis lesions. These are clusters of activated HLA-DR-expressing microglia in myelinated normal-appearing white matter with no obvious leukocyte infiltration. They are found in most multiple sclerosis patients at all stages of disease. In these lesion areas, CRYAB in oligodendrocytes may come directly in contact with activated HLA-DR+ microglia. We demonstrate that CRYAB activates innate responses by microglia by stimulating the secretion of leukocyte-recruiting factors, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 17, CCL5, and CCL1, and immune-regulatory cytokines such as interleukin 10, transforming growth factor-beta, and interleukin 13. Together, these data suggest that CRYAB accumulation in preactive lesions may be part of a reversible reparative local response that involves both oligodendrocytes and microglia. At the same time, however, accumulated CRYAB may represent a major target for adaptive immune responses that could contribute to progression of preactive lesions to a stage of demyelination.

B., Kimura, N., Kajiwara, N., Iwakura, Y., Saito, H., Adachi, H., Steinman, L., Robbins, R. C., Fischbein, M. P. Although interleukin-17 (IL-17) has been reported to participate in the pathogenesis of infectious, autoimmune and allergic disorders, the precise role in allograft rejection remains uncertain. This study illustrates that IL-17 contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic allograft rejection.Utilizing a murine heterotopic heart transplant model system, IL-17-deficient recipient mice had decreased allograft inflammatory cell recruitment, decreased IL-6, MCP-1, and KC production, and reduced graft coronary artery disease (GCAD). Intragraft gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells appear to be the predominant source of IL-17 production.Therefore, IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

P., Steinman, L., Utz, P. J., Ho, P. P. Activation of the innate immune system by DNA containing hypomethylated CpG motifs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we examined the consequences of immunostimulatory CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and inhibitory GpG-ODN treatment in the NZB x NZW F1 (NZB/W) murine model of SLE. Beginning at 5 months of age, we administered CpG-ODN or GpG-ODN at regular intervals to female NZB/W animals. We also determined the effects of ODN administration on NZB/W mouse lymphocyte function, and the specificity of ODN binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) other than TLR-9. While CpG-ODN treatment did not appear to have a major impact on disease severity, GpG-ODN treatment significantly delayed the onset of proteinuria in NZB/W mice. Interestingly, short-term GpG-ODN treatment promoted Th2-type T and B cell responses, and inhibited B lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. On the other hand, extended GpG-ODN treatment did not result in sustained Th2 responses or significantly reduced renal disease. Moreover, the binding of CpG-ODN and GpG-ODN was not restricted to TLR-9 as both ODNs also interacted with TLR-3, TLR-7, and TLR-8. Taken together, the data indicate that the protective mechanism of GpG-ODN treatment in the NZB/W model of lupus nephritis involves modulating T cell cytokine profiles and B lymphocyte activation through the inhibition of several TLRs, including TLR-7 and TLR-9.

To determine whether fluctuations in functional T-cell subsets can explain why multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses decline during pregnancy and increase in the postpartum period.Case-control study.Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Stanford University.Twenty-six pregnant women with MS and 24 age-matched, pregnant controls. Intervention We prospectively followed up the pregnant women with MS and the age-matched, pregnant controls; conducted structured interviews; and collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells during each trimester and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post partum.Sixteen functional cell types, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)- and tumor necrosis factor-producing T-cell subsets, were measured using multicolor flow cytometry. Since these cell types may also fluctuate with pregnancy, lactational amenorrhea, or MS treatment, the data were analyzed taking into account these factors.Fifteen women with MS (58%) had relapses during the postpartum year. CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells fluctuated with MS relapses, declining during pregnancy in women with MS (P < .001) and continuing to decline after parturition in women with relapses (P = .001), yet rising or remaining stable in women with nonrelapsing MS or healthy pregnant women. Lactational amenorrhea was associated with a rise in CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells in women with MS (P = .009). In contrast, CD4(+) tumor necrosis factor-producing cells decreased during lactational amenorrhea in all groups of women and, once this was taken into account, obscured any relationship to MS relapses. CD8(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells were elevated in women with MS throughout the study (P < .001) but did not fluctuate with relapses.Our findings suggest that a decline in circulating CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells leads to postpartum MS relapses. Our findings also suggest that the decline in these cells may begin during late pregnancy and that lactational amenorrhea induced by exclusive breastfeeding may be able to interrupt this process.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder with a high burden on patient quality of life and medical rehabilitation services. Little is known about the acute hospitalization costs and characteristics. We examined the trends in MS hospitalizations from 1993 to 2006.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was searched using the ICD-9 code 340 (MS). Diagnostic, treatment and administrative data were analyzed using basic statistical software.A total of 288,454 hospital admissions with the primary diagnosis of MS occurred between 1993 and 2006, an average of 20,604 admissions annually. The percentage admitted from the emergency department (ED) increased from 19.4 to 60.0% during 1993-2006. The mean cost for each inpatient increased from USD 7,965 to 20,076. The percentage of discharges to home health care increased from 8.6 to 14.9%, and the percentage of discharges to nursing homes and rehabilitation services increased from 8.3 to 22.6%. In 2006, Medicaid patients were significantly more likely to be admitted from the ED (p < 0.001). Medicare payers were significantly more likely to be discharged to a nursing home/rehabilitation (p < 0.0001).National health insurance policies have made measurable effects on MS disease management. MS is becoming more expensive to treat acutely, and improved treatment modalities geared toward decreasing acute flare-ups may provide substantial cost savings by reducing ED visits, inpatient hospitalizations and the need for rehabilitation.

E., Hueber, W., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune synovitis characterized by the presence of anticitrullinated protein Abs, although the exact targets and role of anticitrullinated protein autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of RA remain to be defined. Fibrinogen, which can be citrullinated, has recently emerged as a candidate autoantigen. To determine whether autoimmunity against fibrinogen can mediate inflammatory arthritis, we immunized a variety of common mouse strains with fibrinogen and found that DBA/1 and SJL mice developed an inflammatory and erosive arthritis. Mice with fibrinogen-induced arthritis (FIA) possess fibrinogen-reactive T cells that produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. FIA can be adoptively transferred with either plasma or fibrinogen-specific T cells from diseased mice. Mice with FIA possess rheumatoid factor, circulating immune complexes, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide Abs, all of which are characteristic of human RA. These observations demonstrate that fibrinogen is arthritogenic in mice and that the pathogenesis of FIA is mediated by both autoantibodies and fibrinogen-reactive T cells. Mixed results with modulation of T-H-17 cells in human autoimmune diseases The outcomes of clinical trials provide the most convincing data to clarify the role of particular cytokines in the pathogenesis of human diseases. The immunology community, for a variety of practical reasons, spends most of its research time and funds on studies in model systems, mainly mice. In this perspective I discuss results of clinical trials assessing the effect of blocking the differentiation and/or function of interleukin-17-producing CD4(+) T cells on human autoimmune disease, and devote more limited attention to corroborating preclinical studies from animal models. Thus far, these outcomes in human trials have been mixed, with notable success in psoriasis and Crohn's disease but a negative result in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

Statins are thought to have tumorolytic properties, reducing angiogenesis by inhibiting pro-angiogenic factors and inducing apoptosis of mural pericytes within the tumor vascular tree.An orthotopic mouse glioblastoma (GL-26) model was used to investigate the effect of simvastatin on glioblastoma vasculature in vivo. GL-26 cells were implanted into the striatum of C5LKa mice treated with either control, low- or high-dose simvastatin. Brains were analyzed for necrotic volume, apoptosis, morphology and pericytic cells within the vascular tree.Low-dose simvastatin increased necrosis and apoptosis compared to both control and high-dose simvastatin groups. High-dose simvastatin increased vessel caliber by reducing pericytic cells along the tumor vessel wall compared to both control and low-dose simvastatin groups.Simvastatin has a dual effect on tumorigenesis. At high doses, it may worsen instead of 'normalizing' tumor angio-architecture, albeit low doses affect tumor cell survival by promoting necrosis and apoptosis.

Macrophages rapidly engulf apoptotic cells to limit the release of noxious cellular contents and to restrict autoimmune responses against self antigens. Although factors participating in recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells have been identified, the transcriptional basis for the sensing and the silent disposal of apoptotic cells is unknown. Here we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) is induced when macrophages engulf apoptotic cells and functions as a transcriptional sensor of dying cells. Genetic deletion of PPAR-delta decreases expression of opsonins such as complement component-1qb (C1qb), resulting in impairment of apoptotic cell clearance and reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This increases autoantibody production and predisposes global and macrophage-specific Ppard(-/-) mice to autoimmune kidney disease, a phenotype resembling the human disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, PPAR-delta has a pivotal role in orchestrating the timely disposal of apoptotic cells by macrophages, ensuring that tolerance to self is maintained. Shifting therapeutic attention in MS to osteopontin, type 1 and type 2 IFN It is widely debated whether MS is mediated solely by Th1, or solely by Th17, whether it might be mediated by both pathways, or perhaps by neither pathway. We must integrate the following four facts: first, MS lesions have a signature of IL-6-, IL-17-, osteopontin- and IFN-driven transcriptional activity. Second, MS is worsened with administration of IFN-gamma, the quintessential type 2 IFN and Th1 cytokine. Third, blockade of TNF-alpha worsened MS in clinical trials. Fourth, inhibiting the main driver of Th17, IL-23, failed to modulate relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Against this backdrop, standing outside the framework of the Th1 and Th17 pathways are the type 1 IFN, notably IFN-beta, the most widely used approved therapy for RRMS. A paper in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology demonstrates that IFN-beta suppresses production in CD4(+) T cells of both osteopontin and IL-17. In this commentary, the roles of these two molecules, i.e. osteopontin and IL-17, are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of MS. Osteopontin may be more important than Th1 or Th17 in the pathogenesis of RRMS. Trials targeting this small integrin-binding protein ought to be pursued in RRMS.

J., Pedotti, R. Induction of T helper 1 (Th1) to Th2 deviation through administration of self- or altered self-peptides holds promise for treatment of autoimmunity. However, administration of self-peptides in models of autoimmunity can result in anaphylactic reactions. Although both IgE and IgG1 antibodies might be involved in the development of anaphylaxis to myelin peptides in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, the effector cells and molecules involved are not fully understood. Here we show that systemic anaphylaxis to the self-antigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 can occur in mice lacking mast cells (Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice) or histamine (histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice), but is prevented in mice lacking IL-4. Treatment of mice with CV6209, a platelet-activating factor antagonist, slightly reduced the incidence of anaphylaxis to self-MOG35-55 in this model, but more effectively protected mice against anaphylaxis to this peptide when self-MOG35-55 was administered in a different immunization protocol that omitted the use of Bordetella pertussis toxin as an adjuvant at the time of immunization. Thus, anaphylactic reactions to self-MOG can occur in the absence of mast cells or histamine, key elements of the classical IgE-, mast cell-, and histamine-dependent pathway of anaphylaxis.

Abnormal glycosylation is one of the hallmarks of the cancer cell and is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. The development of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) vaccines has been problematic due to poor immunogenicity. However, when appropriate targets can be identified, passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against TACAs has been shown to have antitumor activity. Fas ligand (FasL) is a transmembrane protein that induces apoptosis in cells expressing its receptor, Fas. When grafted into mice, FasL-expressing tumor cells break immunologic tolerance to self-antigens and induce antibody-mediated tumor immunity. Here, five IgM mAbs were produced from mice vaccinated with FasL-expressing B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. They recognize various syngeneic and allogeneic murine tumor cell lines. One mAb, TM10, recognizes a range of human tumor cell lines, including melanoma, prostate, and ovarian cancer. It does not bind to untransformed cells. The epitopes recognized by all the mAbs were carbohydrates expressed on proteins. Using carbohydrate microarrays, the antigenic targets of TM10 were found to be high-mannose core structures of N-linked glycans. In normal cells, high-mannose clusters are hidden by extensive saccharide branching but they become exposed in cancer cells as a result of abnormal glycosylation pathways. Vaccination with FasL-expressing tumors therefore enables the immune system to break tolerance to self-antigens, allowing identification of novel TACAs that can form the basis of future humoral anticancer therapy.

W., Wang, P., Kattah, M. G., Youssef, S., Steinman, L., DeFea, K., Straus, D. S. The IL-23/IL-17 pathway plays an important role in chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. In inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal epithelial cells are an important source of chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells. We examined the effect of IL-17 on chemokine expression of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells. IL-17 strongly repressed TNF-alpha-stimulated expression of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5, but synergized with TNF-alpha for induction of CXCL8, CXCL1, and CCL20 mRNAs. For CXCL10, IL-17 strongly inhibited promoter activity but had no effect on mRNA stability. In contrast, for CXCL8, IL-17 slightly decreased promoter activity but stabilized its normally unstable mRNA, leading to a net increase in steady-state mRNA abundance. IL-17 synergized with TNF-alpha in transactivating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and in activating ERK and p38 MAPK. The p38 and ERK pathway inhibitors SB203580 and U0126 reversed the repressive effect of IL-17 on CXCL10 mRNA abundance and promoter activity and also reversed the inductive effect of IL-17 on CXCL8 mRNA, indicating that MAPK signaling mediates both the transcriptional repression of CXCL10 and the stabilization of CXCL8 mRNA by IL-17. The EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 partially reversed the effects of IL-17 on CXCL8 and CXCL10 mRNA, demonstrating a role for EGFR in downstream IL-17 signaling. The overall results indicate a positive effect of IL-17 on chemokines that recruit neutrophils (CXCL8 and CXCL1), and Th17 cells (CCL20). In contrast, IL-17 represses expression of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCR5, three chemokines that selectively recruit Th1 but not other effector T cells.

M., Baumgarth, N., Chien, Y. gammadelta T cells uniquely contribute to host immune defense, but how this is accomplished remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I T10 and T22-specific gammadelta T cells in mice and found that encountering antigen in the thymus was neither required nor inhibitory for their development. But when triggered through the T cell receptor, ligand-naive lymphoid-gammadelta T cells produced IL-17, whereas ligand-experienced cells made IFN-gamma. Immediately after immunization, a large fraction of IL-17(+) gammadelta T cells were found in the draining lymph nodes days before the appearance of antigen-specific IL-17(+) *beta T cells. Thus, thymic selection determines the effector fate of gammadelta T cells rather than constrains their antigen specificities. The swift IL-17 response mounted by antigen-naive gammadelta T cells suggests a critical role for these cells at the onset of an acute inflammatory response to novel antigens.

Inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme (statins) are cholesterol-lowering drugs that have shown promise as therapeutic agents in various animal models of autoimmune disease. The results of initial clinical trials with statins in multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis have also been encouraging. In this study, we attempted to treat a widely studied murine model of spontaneous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with atorvastatin.(NZB x NZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mice received daily oral doses of atorvastatin for 20 weeks. The mice were monitored weekly for survival and proteinuria. Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels in sera were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). T lymphocyte cytokine production in vitro, as well as cytokine levels in vivo, were measured by ELISA. T cell proliferation was assessed by thymidine incorporation assay. Serum cholesterol levels were determined using a standard fluorometric assay. Kidney tissue was harvested and evaluated for pathologic changes.In NZB/NZW mice, oral atorvastatin had significant effects on T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. Atorvastatin also induced significant increases in serum levels of interleukin-4. However, atorvastatin treatment in NZB/NZW mice had no significant impact on proteinuria, survival, serum anti-dsDNA antibody and cholesterol levels, or extent of renal disease.Monotherapy with oral atorvastatin has no protective effects in a murine model of spontaneous SLE. The efficacy of atorvastatin in human SLE remains to be determined.

View details for Extensive fusion of haematopoietic cells with Purkinje neurons in response to chronic inflammation Johansson, C. B., Youssef, S., Koleckar, K., Holbrook, C., Doyonnas, R., Corbel, S. Y., Steinman, L., Rossi, F. M., Blau, H. M. Transplanted bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been reported to fuse with cells of diverse tissues, but the extremely low frequency of fusion has led to the view that such events are biologically insignificant. Nonetheless, in mice with a lethal recessive liver disease (tyrosinaemia), transplantation of wild-type BMDCs restored liver function by cell fusion and prevented death, indicating that cell fusion can have beneficial effects. Here we report that chronic inflammation resulting from severe dermatitis or autoimmune encephalitis leads to robust fusion of BMDCs with Purkinje neurons and formation of hundreds of binucleate heterokaryons per cerebellum, a 10-100-fold higher frequency than previously reported. Single haematopoietic stem-cell transplants showed that the fusogenic cell is from the haematopoietic lineage and parabiosis experiments revealed that fusion can occur without irradiation. Transplantation of rat bone marrow into mice led to activation of dormant rat Purkinje neuron-specific genes in BMDC nuclei after fusion with mouse Purkinje neurons, consistent with nuclear reprogramming. The precise neurological role of these heterokaryons awaits elucidation, but their frequency in brain after inflammation is clearly much higher than previously appreciated. View details for CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells specific for a thymus-expressed antigen prevent the development of anaphylaxis to self Scabeni, S., Lapilla, M., Musio, S., Gallo, B., Ciusani, E., Steinman, L., Mantegazza, R., Pedotti, R. A role for CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the control of allergic diseases has been postulated. We developed a mouse model in which anaphylaxis is induced in SJL mice by immunization and challenge with the fragment of self myelin proteolipid protein (PLP)(139-151), that is not expressed in the thymus, but not with fragment 178-191 of the same protein, that is expressed in the thymus. In this study, we show that resistance to anaphylaxis is associated with naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for the self peptide expressed in the thymus. These cells increase Foxp3 expression upon Ag stimulation and suppress peptide-induced proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells. Depletion of Tregs with anti-CD25 in vivo significantly diminished resistance to anaphylaxis to PLP(178-191), suggesting an important role for CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs in preventing the development of allergic responses to this thymus-expressed peptide. These data indicate that naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for a peptide expressed under physiological conditions in the thymus are able to suppress the development of a systemic allergic reaction to self. View details for Bioluminescence in vivo imaging of autoimmune encephalomyelitis predicts disease Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a widely used animal model to understand not only multiple sclerosis but also basic principles of immunity. The disease is scored typically by observing signs of paralysis, which do not always correspond with pathological changes.Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in transgenic mice expressing an injury responsive luciferase reporter in astrocytes (GFAP-luc). Bioluminescence in the brain and spinal cord was measured non-invasively in living mice. Mice were sacrificed at different time points to evaluate clinical and pathological changes. The correlation between bioluminescence and clinical and pathological EAE was statistically analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis.Bioluminescence from the brain and spinal cord correlates strongly with severity of clinical disease and a number of pathological changes in the brain in EAE. Bioluminescence at early time points also predicts severity of disease.These results highlight the potential use of bioluminescence imaging to monitor neuroinflammation for rapid drug screening and immunological studies in EAE and suggest that similar approaches could be applied to other animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. View details for Epitope spreading to citrullinated antigens in mouse models of autoimmune arthritis and demyelination Kidd, B. A., Ho, P. P., Sharpe, O., Zhao, X., Tomooka, B. H., Kanter, J. L., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies have a diagnostic role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, little is known about their origins and contribution to pathogenesis. Citrullination is the post-translational conversion of arginine to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase, and increased citrullination of proteins is observed in the joint tissue in RA and in brain tissue in multiple sclerosis (MS).We applied synovial and myelin protein arrays to examine epitope spreading of B cell responses to citrullinated epitopes in both the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model for RA and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model for MS. Synovial and myelin protein arrays contain a spectrum of proteins and peptides, including native and citrullinated forms, representing candidate autoantigens in RA and MS, respectively. We applied these arrays to characterise the specificity of autoantibodies in serial serum samples derived from mice with acute and chronic stages of CIA and EAE.In samples from pre-disease CIA and acute-disease EAE, we observed autoantibody targeting of the immunising antigen and responses to a limited set of citrullinated epitopes. Over the course of diseases, the autoantibody responses expanded to target multiple citrullinated epitopes in both CIA and EAE. Using immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified citrullination of multiple polypeptides in CIA joint and EAE brain tissue that have not previously been described as citrullinated.Our results suggest that anti-citrulline antibody responses develop in the early stages of CIA and EAE, and that autoimmune inflammation results in citrullination of joint proteins in CIA and brain proteins in EAE, thereby creating neoantigens that become additional targets in epitope spreading of autoimmune responses.

View details for Preemptive HMG-CoA reductase inhibition provides graft-versus-host disease protection by Th-2 polarization while sparing graft-versus-leukemia activity Zeiser, R., Youssef, S., Baker, J., Kambham, N., Steinman, L., Negrin, R. S. We investigated whether atorvastatin (AT) was capable of protecting animals from acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) across major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatch barriers. AT treatment of the donor induced a Th-2 cytokine profile in the adoptively transferred T cells and reduced their in vivo expansion, which translated into significantly reduced aGVHD lethality. Host treatment down-regulated costimulatory molecules and MHC class II expression on recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and enhanced the protective statin effect, without impacting graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. The AT effect was partially reversed in STAT6(-/-) donors and abrogated by L-mevalonate, indicating the relevance of STAT6 signaling and the L-mevalonate pathway for AT-mediated aGVHD protection. AT reduced prenylation levels of GTPases, abolished T-bet expression, and increased c-MAF and GATA-3 protein in vivo. Thus, AT has significant protective impact on aGVHD lethality by Th-2 polarization and inhibition of an uncontrolled Th-1 response while maintaining GVL activity, which is of great clinical relevance given the modest toxicity profile of AT. Glia-dependent TGF-beta signaling, acting independently of the TH17 pathway, is critical for initiation of murine autoimmune encephalomyelitis Luo, J., Ho, P. P., Buckwalter, M. S., Hsu, T., Lee, L. Y., Zhang, H., Kim, D., Kim, S., Gambhir, S. S., Steinman, L., Wyss-Coray, T. Autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model for multiple sclerosis, is characterized by the activation of immune cells, demyelination of axons in the CNS, and paralysis. We found that TGF-beta1 synthesis in glial cells and TGF-beta-induced signaling in the CNS were activated several days before the onset of paralysis in mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis. While early production of TGF-beta1 was observed in glial cells TGF-beta signaling was activated in neurons and later in infiltrating T cells in inflammatory lesions. Systemic treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling ameliorated the paralytic disease and reduced the accumulation of pathogenic T cells and expression of IL-6 in the CNS. Priming of peripheral T cells was not altered, nor was the generation of TH17 cells, indicating that this effect was directed within the brain, yet affected the immune system. These results suggest that early production of TGF-beta1 in the CNS creates a permissive and dangerous environment for the initiation of autoimmune inflammation, providing a rare example of the brain modulating the immune system. Importantly, inhibition of TGF-beta signaling may have benefits in the treatment of the acute phase of autoimmune CNS inflammation. Recent evidence points to tryptophan (Trp) degradation as a potent immunosuppressive mechanism involved in the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Both Trp depletion and downstream Trp catabolites (TCs) appear to synergistically confer protection against excessive inflammation. In this review, we give an overview of the immunosuppressive properties of Trp degradation with special focus on TCs. Constitutive and inducible Trp degradation in different cell types and tissues of human and murine origin is summarized. We address the influence of Trp degradation on different aspects of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Possible therapeutic approaches for autoimmune disorders targeting Trp degradation are presented, and key issues relevant for the development of such therapeutic strategies are discussed. View details for Nanosensor detection of an immunoregulatory tryptophan influx/kynurenine efflux cycle Kaper, T., Looger, L. L., Takanaga, H., Platten, M., Steinman, L., Frommer, W. B. Mammalian cells rely on cellular uptake of the essential amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan sequestration by up-regulation of the key enzyme for tryptophan degradation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), e.g., in cancer and inflammation, is thought to suppress the immune response via T cell starvation. Additionally, the excreted tryptophan catabolites (kynurenines) induce apoptosis of lymphocytes. Whereas tryptophan transport systems have been identified, the molecular nature of kynurenine export remains unknown. To measure cytosolic tryptophan steady-state levels and flux in real time, we developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer nanosensors (FLIPW). The transport properties detected by FLIPW in KB cells, a human oral cancer cell line, and COS-7 cells implicate LAT1, a transporter that is present in proliferative tissues like cancer, in tryptophan uptake. Importantly, we found that this transport system mediates tryptophan/kynurenine exchange. The tryptophan influx/kynurenine efflux cycle couples tryptophan starvation to elevation of kynurenine serum levels, providing a two-pronged induction of apoptosis in neighboring cells. The strict coupling protects cells that overproduce IDO from kynurenine accumulation. Consequently, this mechanism may contribute to immunosuppression involved in autoimmunity and tumor immune escape. View details for Inhibition of HMGcoA reductase by atorvastatin prevents and reverses MYC-induced lymphomagenesis Shachaf, C. M., Perez, O. D., Youssef, S., Fan, A. C., Elchuri, S., Goldstein, M. J., Shirer, A. E., Sharpe, O., Chen, J., Mitchell, D. J., Chang, M., Nolan, G. P., Steinman, L., Felsher, D. W. Statins are a class of drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGcoA) reductase, a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Several reports document that statins may prevent different human cancers. However, whether or not statins can prevent cancer is controversial due to discordant results. One possible explanation for these conflicting conclusions is that only some tumors or specific statins may be effective. Here, we demonstrate in an in vivo transgenic model in which atorvastatin reverses and prevents the onset of MYC-induced lymphomagenesis, but fails to reverse or prevent tumorigenesis in the presence of constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D). Using phosphoprotein fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, atorvastatin treatment was found to result in the inactivation of the Ras and ERK1/2 signaling pathways associated with the dephosphorylation and inactivation of MYC. Correspondingly, tumors with a constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D) did not exhibit dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MYC. Atorvastatin's effects on MYC were specific to the inhibition of HMGcoA reductase, as treatment with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, abrogated these effects and inhibited the ability of atorvastatin to reverse or suppress tumorigenesis. Also, RNAi directed at HMGcoA reductase was sufficient to abrogate the neoplastic properties of MYC-induced tumors. Thus, atorvastatin, by inhibiting HMGcoA reductase, induces changes in phosphoprotein signaling that in turn prevent MYC-induced lymphomagenesis. Antigen-specific therapy of multiple sclerosis: The long-sought magic bullet The adaptive immune response in multiple sclerosis (MS) targets various myelin proteins and even some inducible heat shock proteins. A few attempts have been made to tolerize relapsing-remitting patients with MS to either full-length myelin basic protein or to a key peptide epitope between residues 83-99. These trials have demonstrated that this approach may potentially provide benefit to patients with relapsing- remitting MS. However, manipulation of responses to myelin proteins can have deleterious effects. The immune response to myelin components is positioned at a key tipping point in the pathophysiology of the disease. Clarification of the key target antigens in MS, and better understanding of practical methods to attain tolerance to a wide variety of myelin and neuronal molecules will provide the basis for the ultimately successful antigen specific therapy. View details for Statins-treatment option for central nervous system autoimmune disease? Statins, inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are well-established agents to lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular morbidity. Independent of their lipid-lowering properties, statins have been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in various animal models of human autoimmune disease. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model for multiple sclerosis, statins prevented disease onset and even reversed paralysis when treatment was initiated after experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was fully established. Furthermore, well-tolerated oral statins were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in combination with existing agents for multiple sclerosis therapy. Based primarily on these encouraging results, statins are now being tested in clinical trials as a monotherapy for multiple sclerosis, as well as in combination with approved disease-modifying therapies.

C., Stuve, O., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Treatment with glatiramer acetate (GA, copolymer-1, Copaxone), a drug approved for multiple sclerosis (MS), in a mouse model promoted development of anti-inflammatory type II monocytes, characterized by increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and decreased production of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This anti-inflammatory cytokine shift was associated with reduced STAT-1 signaling. Type II monocytes directed differentiation of T(H)2 cells and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (T(reg)) independent of antigen specificity. Type II monocyte-induced regulatory T cells specific for a foreign antigen ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating that neither GA specificity nor recognition of self-antigen was required for their therapeutic effect. Adoptive transfer of type II monocytes reversed EAE, suppressed T(H)17 cell development and promoted both T(H)2 differentiation and expansion of T(reg) cells in recipient mice. This demonstration of adoptive immunotherapy by type II monocytes identifies a central role for these cells in T cell immune modulation of autoimmunity.

P., Idrissova, Z., Viglietta, V., Rostasy, K., Pohl, D., Dale, R. C., Freedman, M., Steinman, L., Kuchroo, V. K., Hafler, D. A., Wucherpfennig, K. W. The role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases is controversial, in part because widely used western blotting and ELISA methods either do not permit the detection of conformation-sensitive antibodies or do not distinguish them from conformation-independent antibodies. We developed a sensitive assay based on self-assembling radiolabeled tetramers that allows discrimination of antibodies against folded or denatured myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) by selective unfolding of the antigen domain. The tetramer radioimmunoassay (RIA) was more sensitive for MOG autoantibody detection than other methodologies, including monomer-based RIA, ELISA or fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). Autoantibodies from individuals with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) selectively bound the folded MOG tetramer, whereas sera from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced with MOG peptide immunoprecipitated only the unfolded tetramer. MOG-specific autoantibodies were identified in a subset of ADEM but only rarely in adult-onset MS cases, indicating that MOG is a more prominent target antigen in ADEM than MS.

A., Steinman, L., Soares, M. P. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, encoded by HMOX1) dampens inflammatory reactions via the catabolism of heme into CO, Fe, and biliverdin. We report that expression of HO-1 dictates the pathologic outcome of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Induction of EAE in Hmox1(-/- )C57BL/6 mice led to enhanced CNS demyelination, paralysis, and mortality, as compared with Hmox1(+/+) mice. Induction of HO-1 by cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) administration after EAE onset reversed paralysis in C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice and disease relapse in SJL/J mice. These effects were not observed using zinc protoporphyrin IX, which does not induce HO-1. CoPPIX protection was abrogated in Hmox1(-/-) C57BL/6 mice, indicating that CoPPIX acts via HO-1 to suppress EAE progression. The protective effect of HO-1 was associated with inhibition of MHC class II expression by APCs and inhibition of Th and CD8 T cell accumulation, proliferation, and effector function within the CNS. Exogenous CO mimicked these effects, suggesting that CO contributes to the protective action of HO-1. In conclusion, HO-1 or exposure to its end product CO counters autoimmune neuroinflammation and thus might be used therapeutically to treat MS.

Current therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases non-specifically suppress immune function, and there is great need for fundamental approaches such as antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. In this paper we describe development of antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines to treat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, and use of protein microarrays to monitor response to therapy and to identify potential additional autoimmune targets for next generation vaccines. We demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding type II collagen (CII) reduced the incidence and severity of CIA. Atorvastatin, a statin drug found to reduce the severity of autoimmunity, potentiated the effect of DNA vaccines encoding CII. Analysis of cytokines produced by collagen-reactive T cells derived from mice receiving tolerizing DNA encoding CII, as compared to control vaccines, revealed reduced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Arthritis microarray analysis demonstrated reduced spreading of autoantibody responses in mice treated with DNA encoding CII. The development of tolerizing DNA vaccines, and the use of antibody profiling to guide design of and to monitor therapeutic responses to such vaccines, represents a promising approach for the treatment of RA and other autoimmune diseases. Type IIHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins) provide acute-graft-versus-host disease protection by Th-2 cytokine induction while sparing graft-versus-leukemia activity. 48th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Hematology Zeiser, R., Youssef, S., Baker, J., Steinman, L., Negrin, R.

Tyrosine kinases play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways and cellular responses that mediate the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed to treat Bcr/Abl-expressing leukemias and subsequently found to treat c-Kit-expressing gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We demonstrate that imatinib potently prevents and treats murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We further show that micromolar concentrations of imatinib abrogate multiple signal transduction pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis, including mast cell c-Kit signaling and TNF-alpha release, macrophage c-Fms activation and cytokine production, and fibroblast PDGFR signaling and proliferation. In our studies, imatinib attenuated PDGFR signaling in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and TNF-alpha production in synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMCs) derived from human RA patients. Imatinib-mediated inhibition of a spectrum of signal transduction pathways and the downstream pathogenic cellular responses may provide a powerful approach to treat RA and other inflammatory diseases.

Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are widely prescribed for their cholesterol-lowering properties to reduce atherogenesis and cardiovascular morbidity. Over recent years, statins have also been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects that might be of therapeutic benefit in autoimmune disorders. The primary mechanism by which statins alter immune function appears to be mediated through the inhibition of post-translational protein prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins and is largely independent of lipid-lowering. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), statins prevent or reverse paralysis and were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit when combined with agents approved for MS therapy. Based primarily upon the beneficial effects in EAE, statins are now being tested in patients in MS clinical trials.

Four easy pieces: interconnections between tissue injury, intermediary metabolism, autoimmunity, and chronic degeneration. Four questions are posed: (1) Can tissue damage itself provoke autoimmunity? (2) Can genetic mutations of key structures produce tissue pathology and thus provoke autoimmunity? (3) Can acute immune damage produce tissue degeneration without further hallmarks of an immune response? (4) Can intermediary metabolism modulate immune damage to tissues? Four answers are given: (1) Tissue injury itself may lead to autoimmunity. Both innate and adaptive immunity may arise as a response to tissue injury, and the immune attack can further damage tissue. (2) Genetic mutations can lead to an immune response indistinguishable from autoimmunity, exemplified from Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. (3) Chronic immune damage may lead to tissue degeneration, with or without further hallmarks of an immune response. Variations on this theme, including inverse scenarios, are also possible: Inborn errors of metabolism may lead to tissue damage that may provoke an adaptive and or innate immune response. The immune response might further damage tissue. (4) Finally, perturbations of intermediary metabolism may modulate the immune response, controlling the extent of immune-mediated damage. Examples are taken from perturbations in the cholesterol pathway that influence the characteristics of the immune response, and with tryptophan metabolites that modulate autoimmunity and graft rejection. Inflammatory, degenerative, and autoimmune neurological disease will be discussed in terms of their implications for pathogenic mechanisms underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. How to successfully apply animal studies in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis to research on multiple sclerosis In their Point of View entitled ""Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis: A Misleading Model of Multiple Sclerosis,"" Sriram and Steiner(1) wrote, ""The most disappointing aspect of EAE [experimental allergic encephalomyelitis] as a potential model for MS is its almost total inability to point toward a meaningful therapy or therapeutic approach for MS."" Actually, EAE has led directly to the development of three therapies approved for use in multiple sclerosis (MS): glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, and natalizumab. Several new approaches to MS are in clinical trials based on positive indications in preclinical work relying on EAE. New clues to the pathogenesis of MS and new potential surrogate markers for MS are shown from research involving EAE when it is critically coupled with actual findings in MS. There are pitfalls in overreliance on the EAE model, or on any animal model for any human disease. Nevertheless, over the past 73 years, the EAE model has proved itself remarkably useful for aiding research on MS. View details for Nogo in multiple sclerosis: Growing roles of a growth inhibitor Symposium on Cognitive Decline in Multiple Sclerosis In recent years, knowledge about the physiological functions of the Nogo-A protein has grown considerably, and this molecule has evolved from being one of the most important axonal regrowth inhibitors present in central nervous system (CNS) myelin, to several other potentially important roles in different areas such as nervous system development, epilepsy, vascular physiology, muscle pathology and CNS tumors. Therapeutically, targeting the Nogo-A protein by means of the immune response has been tried in an attempt to block neurite growth inhibition and promote regeneration in spinal cord injury models; the immune response to Nogo-A, however, has not been extensively studied. We propose to review recent evidence that Nogo-A may also play an important role in autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, including that Nogo-66 derived epitopes are encephalitogenic antigens in susceptible mouse strains, and that the immune response to Nogo-66 antigens includes both strong T cell and B cell activation, with epitope spreading of the antibody response to other myelin molecules. In CNS immunotherapy, careful targeting of neural self-antigens is a prerequisite in order to avoid unexpected deleterious effects, and increasing knowledge about the immune response to Nogo-A may provide a safe basis for the development of relevant therapeutic alternatives for several neurological conditions. View details for Emerging therapeutic targets in multiple sclerosis The aim of this review is to describe the recent findings regarding the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and their translation to new therapies.Basic research is providing new insights into the immune elements involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, both in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system. Unveiling the complex interplay of the molecules involved in the immunological cascade of the disease supplies new targets for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies. Similarly, clinical studies and identification of distinct subgroups of patients based on their responsiveness to immunotherapies provides support for the existence of immunopathological disease subtypes that seem to require different therapeutic approaches. These studies extend the theoretical basis that facilitates development of neuroprotective and repair-promoting therapeutic strategies.The application of novel and cutting-edge technologies in the fields of genomics and proteomics is providing a better understanding of the genetic and environmental factors involved in multiple sclerosis susceptibility and progression, as well as the detection of biomarkers for disease activity and response to therapy. Implementation of these facilitates identification of new targets for therapy towards tailoring treatment to the individual patient with multiple sclerosis. View details for Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and multiple sclerosis: Lessons from natalizumab Three patients have developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while being treated with natalizumab for their autoimmune diseases. One patient had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), one had Crohn's disease, and one (who had been enrolled in an RRMS phase III trial) had no evidence of multiple sclerosis on autopsy. The patient with RRMS now has severe, permanent neurologic damage and the other two patients died. In this article, we recommend revised entry and diagnostic criteria to prevent enrollment of RRMS patients with a favorable prognosis or questionable diagnosis into trials of drugs with unknown safety profiles. In light of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, we strongly recommend that RRMS patients who are at low risk of disability not be treated with natalizumab. Finally, we discuss what additional natalizumab efficacy data need to be presented before any decisions should be made about treating RRMS patients with a high risk of developing long-term disability.

View details for Statin therapy and autoimmune disease: from protein prenylation to immunomodulation Statins have been prescribed extensively for their cholesterol-lowering properties and efficacy in cardiovascular disease. However, compelling evidence now exists that statins also have extensive immunomodulatory properties that operate independently of lipid lowering. Consequently, much attention has been directed towards their potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Modulation of post-translational protein prenylation seems to be a key mechanism by which statins alter immune function. In this Review, the effect of statin therapy on immune function, and how this relates to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, is reviewed alongside current opinion of what the key biological targets of statins are. View details for A neuropeptide in immune-mediated inflammation, Y? Prod'homme, T., Weber, M. S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Disturbances in crosstalk between the immune system and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) can contribute to the pathogenesis of Th1-mediated autoimmunity. Recent studies indicate that neuropeptide Y (NPY) has a major role in the regulation of Th1 responses. The precise role of NPY has been an enigma, but a recent study provides a breakthrough, demonstrating that NPY has a bimodal role as a negative regulator of T cells and an activator of antigen-presenting cell function.

C., Hemmer, B., Prod'homme, T., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. One approach to improving efficacy in MS therapy is to identify medications that provide additive or synergistic benefit in combination. Orally administered cholesterol-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (known as statins), which exhibit immunomodulatory properties and are effective in treatment of the MS model EAE, are being tested in MS. As atorvastatin can enhance protective Th2 responses and has a different mechanism of action than glatiramer acetate (GA), a parenterally administered immunomodulatory agent approved for MS treatment, we tested whether the combination of these agents could be beneficial in EAE. Combination therapy using suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA prevented or reversed clinical and histologic EAE. Secretion of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines was reduced--and conversely Th2 cytokine secretion was increased--in these mice, but not in mice treated with each drug alone at the same doses. Monocytes treated with the combination of suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA secreted an antiinflammatory type II cytokine pattern and, when used as APCs, promoted Th2 differentiation of naive myelin-specific T cells. Our results demonstrate that agents with different mechanisms of immune modulation can combine in a synergistic manner for the treatment of CNS autoimmunity and provide rationale for testing the combination of atorvastatin and GA in MS.

L., Matarese, G., Ohtsu, H., GALLI, S. J., Mantegazza, R., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. Histamine can modulate the cytokine network and influence Th1 and Th2 balance and Ab-isotype switching. Thus, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of specific histamine receptors has been shown to reduce the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a prototypic Th1-mediated disease with similarities to human multiple sclerosis. To study the comprehensive contribution of endogenous histamine to the expression of EAE, we attempted to induce EAE in histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice, which are genetically unable to make histamine. In this study, we show that EAE is significantly more severe in HDC-/-, histamine-deficient mice, with diffuse inflammatory infiltrates, including a prevalent granulocytic component, in the brain and cerebellum. Unlike splenocytes from wild-type mice, splenocytes from HDC-/- mice do not produce histamine in response to the myelin Ag, whereas production of IFN-gamma, TNF, and leptin are increased in HDC-/- splenocytes in comparison to those from wild-type mice. Endogenous histamine thus appears to regulate importantly the autoimmune response against myelin and the expression of EAE, in this model, and to limit immune damage to the CNS. Understanding which receptor(s) for histamine is/are involved in regulating autoimmunity against the CNS might help in the development of new strategies of treatment for EAE and multiple sclerosis.

Statins, a family of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are used primarily to reduce atherogenesis and cardiovascular morbidity. Surprisingly, they have also been shown to have immunomodulatory properties that might be of benefit for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Statins can prevent and even reverse ongoing paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis--the mouse model for multiple sclerosis--and on the basis of these findings, statins are now being tested in patients with multiple sclerosis in clinical trials.

H., Steinman, L. Targeting pathogenic T cells with Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding autoantigens is a powerful and feasible therapeutic strategy for Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. However, plasmid DNA contains abundant unmethylated CpG motifs, which induce a strong Th1 immune response. We describe here a novel approach to counteract this undesired side effect of plasmid DNA used for vaccination in Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. In chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), combining a myelin cocktail plus IL-4-tolerizing DNA vaccine with a suppressive GpG oligodeoxynucleotide (GpG-ODN) induced a shift of the autoreactive T cell response toward a protective Th2 cytokine pattern. Myelin microarrays demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccination plus GpG-ODN further decreased anti-myelin autoantibody epitope spreading and shifted the autoreactive B cell response to a protective IgG1 isotype. Moreover, the addition of GpG-ODN to tolerizing DNA vaccination therapy effectively reduced overall mean disease severity in both the chronic relapsing EAE and chronic progressive EAE mouse models. In conclusion, suppressive GpG-ODN effectively counteracted the undesired CpG-induced inflammatory effect of a tolerizing DNA vaccine in a Th1-mediated autoimmune disease by skewing both the autoaggressive T cell and B cell responses toward a protective Th2 phenotype. These results demonstrate that suppressive GpG-ODN is a simple and highly effective novel therapeutic adjuvant that will boost the efficacy of Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines used for treating Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Virtues and pitfalls of EAE for the development of therapies for multiple sclerosis Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a useful model for aiding the development of new treatments for MS. All therapies approved for MS ameliorate EAE. Two approved medications, glatiramer acetate and Natalizumab, were developed directly from studies in EAE. Several trials are ongoing in MS after success in EAE, including altered peptide ligands of myelin, DNA vaccines and statins. However, EAE has failed to predict the outcome of certain approaches. The reasons underlying such failures are discussed here.

A., Hauser, S., Weiner, H., Racke, M. K., Filippi, M. In the management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), providers are all faced with the highly formidable challenge of ascertaining whether, and to what degree, disease-modifying therapy is effective in the individual patient. While much has been learned in randomized, controlled clinical trials, we cannot simply extrapolate the outcomes of these initiatives and apply them to the care of a single patient. In the future, the application of pharmacogenetic techniques, proteomics, and microarray analysis will yield novel profiling information on individual patients that will substantially refine the specific therapeutic questions of relevance: (1) What is the best treatment for an individual patient? (2) Which patients require intensive therapeutic combination regimens to optimize control of the disease process? (3) What are the appropriate drug dosing targets for an individual patient? and (4) Which patients will be predisposed to the development of drug-related adverse events? Such data may provide a novel variable of drug responsiveness that will mandate its inclusion into the process of covariate analyses for clinical trials. View details for Antigen-specific therapies in multiple sclerosis: Going beyond proteins and peptides Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex immune-mediated disease resulting largely from an autoimmune attack against components of central nervous system myelin, including several proteins and lipids. Knowledge about the details of this anomalous immune response has come mostly from studies in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this model, it has been possible to prevent and effectively treat established disease through several antigen-specific therapeutic strategies, which have included administration of whole myelin or myelin proteins by various routes, random copolymers consisting of the main major histocompatability complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) contact amino acid residues, altered peptide ligands of dominant myelin epitopes in which one or more residues are selectively substituted, and lately DNA vaccination encoding self-myelin antigens. However, there have been difficulties in making successful transitions from animal models to human clinical trials, due either to lack of efficacy or unforeseen complications. Despite these problems, antigen-specific therapies have retained their attraction for clinicians and scientists alike, and hopefully the upcoming generation of agents--including altered peptide ligands and DNA vaccines--will benefit from the increasing knowledge about this disease and surmount existing difficulties to make an impact in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

Major advancements have been achieved in our ability to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) and to commence treatment intervention with agents that can favorably affect the disease course. Although MS exacerbations and the emergence of disability constitute the more conspicuous aspects of the disease process, evidence has confirmed that most of the disease occurs on a constitutive and occult basis. Disease-modifying therapies appear to be modest in the magnitude of their treatment effects, particularly in the progressive stage of the disease. Therapeutic strategies currently used for MS primarily target the inflammatory cascade. Several potential mechanisms appear to be involved in the progression of MS. Characterizing these mechanisms will result in a better understanding of the various forms of the disorder and how to effectively treat its clinical manifestations. It is our objective within this 2-part series on progression in MS to offer both evidence-based observations and hypothesis-driven expert perspectives on what constitutes the cause of progression in MS. We have chosen areas of inquiry that appear to have been most productive in helping us to better conceptualize the landscape of what MS looks like pathologically, immunologically, neuroscientifically, radiographically, and genetically. We have attempted to advance hypotheses focused on a deeper understanding of what contributes to the progression of this illness and to illustrate new technical capabilities that are catalyzing novel research initiatives targeted at achieving a more complete understanding of progression in MS.

Nogo-66, the extracellular 66 aa loop of the Nogo-A protein found in CNS myelin, interacts with the Nogo receptor and has been proposed to mediate inhibition of axonal regrowth. It has been shown that immunization with Nogo-A promotes recovery in animal models of spinal cord injury through induction of Ab production. In this report, studies were performed to characterize the immune response to Nogo-66 and to determine the role of Nogo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of EAE-susceptible mouse strains with peptides derived from Nogo-66 induced a CNS immune response with clinical and pathological similarities to EAE. The Nogo-66 peptides elicited strong T cell responses that were not cross-reactive to other encephalitogenic myelin Ags. Using a large scale spotted microarray containing proteins and peptides derived from a wide spectrum of myelin components, we demonstrated that Nogo-66 peptides also generated a specific Ab response that spreads to several other encephalitogenic myelin Ags following immunization. Nogo-66-specific T cell lines ameliorated established EAE, via Nogo-66-specific Th2 cells that entered the CNS. These results indicate that some T cell and B cell immune responses to Nogo-66 are associated with suppression of ongoing EAE, whereas other Nogo-66 epitopes can be encephalitogenic. The multifaceted role of transglutaminase in neurodegeneration: Review article 8th International Congress on Amino Acids and Proteins A critical role for transglutaminase [TGase] has been hypothesized in the pathogenesis of the CAG trinucleotide repeat diseases, characterized by proteins with abnormal expansions of a polyglutamine domain. In the last few years the involvement of TGase in neurodegenerative diseases [NDS], including its role in aggregate formation, has been broadened to include Alzheimer's [AD] and Parkinson's Disease [PD]. It is clear that reduction of TGase activity is beneficial for prolonged survival in mouse models of NDS. The pathological progression of these diseases might reflect in part increases of TGase induced aggregates, or changes in other pathways influenced by increases in TGase activity. Neurodegeneration may be influenced by increased TGase activity affecting apoptosis, modulation of GTPase activity and signal transduction. This review will focus on the leading hypotheses in relation to both old and new experimental results.

Numerous groups have now validated high-throughput approaches to autoantibody profiling in a variety of systems. Recently, we have used autoantigen microarray technology to identify distinct autoantibody profiles in H-2 congenic MRL/lpr mice (Sekine et al., manuscript in preparation), and we are expanding this platform to study human and mouse models of IDDM and RA. We are also developing protein arrays for multiplex analysis of serum antibody isotypes. Multiplexed methods for autoantibody profiling will undoubtedly continue to uncover novel aspects of autoimmunity and B cell biology. It is now time to move these technologies beyond the proof-of-concept phase, and start addressing the next series of important questions. These include, but certainly are not limited to: identifying ""autoantibody signatures"" associated with disease state or outcome; profiling autoantibodies during the natural course of murine and human disease; and monitoring changes in autoantibody profiles of patients in response to therapeutic intervention. However, the next set of challenges is just right around the corner. As data and statistical analysis tools become more robust, it will be possible to generate and approach new hypotheses at an unprecedented pace.

The immune system modulates brain activity, including body temperature, sleep and feeding behavior.

S. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (ie, statins) are oral cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins are well tolerated and have an excellent safety record. These agents competitively inhibit HMG CoA reductase, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to L-mevalonate. Although L-mevalonate is a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis, several of its metabolites are involved in post-translational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties, statins have important pleiotropic biologic effects. Recent reports indicate that statins have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Whether statins will be of clinical benefit for patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system will only be known after they are evaluated in prospective randomized clinical trials.

In this study, we show that the application of an immunomodulatory GpG ODN, with a single base switch from CpG to GpG, can effectively inhibit the activation of Th1 T cells associated with autoimmune disease. Moreover, this immunomodulatory GpG ODN suppresses the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, a prototypic Th1-mediated animal disease model for multiple sclerosis.

Statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to L-mevalonate, a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis. Certain metabolites of mevalonate are also involved in posttranslational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.

In addition to identifying autoantigens and mapping immunodominant epitopes, proteomic analysis of autoantibody responses will further enable diagnosis, prognosis, and tailoring of antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. Statins and their potential targets in multiple sclerosis therapy Stuve, O., Prod'homme, T., Slavin, A., Youssef, S., Dunn, S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a CNS-demyelinating disease characterised by relapsing and chronic neurological impairment. While traditionally CNS autoantigen-specific CD4(+) T cells have been considered the culprits in the initial phase of the disease, recent observations have altered this concept. It is now recognised that other T lymphocyte subclasses can initiate CNS demyelination. In addition, other cell types and molecules may play an important role in MS pathogenesis. There is overwhelming evidence that MS is a dynamic process, in which recurrent episodes of blood-brain barrier disruption and CNS inflammation play a crucial role in early disease stages, leading eventually to the largely irreversible changes of demyelination, gliosis and axonal degeneration. These observations may have important therapeutic implications. Within the last ten years, several medications have been approved for MS treatment. These agents, all of which are given parenterally, are only partially effective and are often associated with adverse effects and potential toxicities. The number and different types of medications used for MS are likely to increase in the near future, as several novel therapies are currently tested in clinical trials. 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, 'statins', are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are given orally, are safe and have biological effects independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties. Recent reports have shown that statins have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties that may be beneficial in the treatment of MS. This article will outline experimental evidence that suggests potential clinical benefits of statins for MS patients.

E., Amara, R. R., Steinman, L., Utz, P. J., Robinson, H. L., Robinson, W. H. We developed antigen microarrays to profile the breadth, strength, and kinetics of epitope-specific antiviral antibody responses in vaccine trials with a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These arrays contained 430 distinct proteins and overlapping peptides spanning the SHIV proteome. In macaques vaccinated with three different DNA and/or recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) vaccines encoding Gag-Pol or Gag-Pol-Env, these arrays distinguished vaccinated from challenged macaques, identified three novel viral epitopes, and predicted survival. Following viral challenge, anti-SHIV antibody responses ultimately converged to target eight immunodominant B-cell regions in Env regardless of vaccine regimen, host histocompatibility type, and divergent T-cell specificities. After challenge, responses to nonimmunodominant epitopes were transient, while responses to dominant epitopes were gained. These data suggest that the functional diversity of anti-SHIV B-cell responses is highly limited in the presence of persisting antigen.

We developed 'myelin proteome' microarrays to profile the evolution of autoantibody responses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Increased diversity of autoantibody responses in acute EAE predicted a more severe clinical course. Chronic EAE was associated with previously undescribed extensive intra- and intermolecular epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Array analysis of autoantigens targeted in acute EAE was used to guide the choice of autoantigen cDNAs to be incorporated into expression plasmids so as to generate tolerizing vaccines. Tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding a greater number of array-determined myelin targets proved superior in treating established EAE and reduced epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Proteomic monitoring of autoantibody responses provides a useful approach to monitor autoimmune disease and to develop and tailor disease- and patient-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines. Diverse targets for intervention during inflammatory and neurodegenerative phases of multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease that causes relapsing and chronic neurologic impairment. Recent observations have altered certain traditional concepts regarding MS pathogenesis. A greater diversity of cell types and molecules involved in MS is now evident. While remyelination can occur during the early inflammatory phase when damage may be reversible, it is impaired in the later stages, which involve axonal death.

Osteopontin (OPN), also known as early T-cell activating gene (Eta-1), has been recently shown to be a critical factor in the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and perhaps multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we investigated whether the 327T/C, 795C/T, 1128A/G or 1284A/C single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the OPN gene were correlated with susceptibility or any of the several clinical end points in a cohort of 821 MS patients. Overall, we observed no evidence of genetic association between the OPN polymorphisms and MS. Although not reaching statistical significance, a modest trend for association with disease course was detected in patients carrying at least one wild-type 1284A allele, suggesting an effect on disease course. Patients with this genotype were less likely to have a mild disease course and were at increased risk for a secondary-progressive clinical type. View details for Statins as potential therapeutic agents in neuroinflammatory disorders Stuve, O., Youssef, S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating disease that is thought to have an autoimmune pathogenesis. Recent results indicate that 'statins', 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, which are the most commonly used oral cholesterol-lowering drugs, have immunomodulatory properties. In this article we will review those findings that indicate that statins may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disease, and ischemic stroke.It was reported that statin treatment could either inhibit or reverse chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis. Several immunomodulatory properties of statins may account for their beneficial clinical effect: Statins decreased the migration of leukocytes into the central nervous system, inhibited MHC class II and costimulatory signals required for activation of proinflammatory T cells, induced a T(H)2 phenotype in T cells, and decreased the expression of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system, including nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor alpha. It was also demonstrated that statin use significantly reduced beta-amyloid secretion in the cerebrospinal fluid of experimental animals. Clinically, there is emerging evidence that statins have beneficial effects in patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and ischemic stroke.In-vitro studies have indicated that statins may have anti-inflammatory properties. Results from in-vivo animal models suggest that statins may be beneficial in treatment of different central nervous system conditions. Larger scale, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to validate the role of statins as a treatment of inflammatory central nervous system diseases.

This review focuses on multiple sclerosis and on the approaches that are being used to identify new targets that might be manipulated to control this disease.

Pedotti, R., Sanna, M., Tsai, M., DeVoss, J., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H., Galli, S. J. Insulin dependent (i.e., ""type 1"") diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is considered to be a T cell mediated disease in which TH1 and Tc autoreactive cells attack the pancreatic islets. Among the beta-cell antigens implicated in T1DM, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 appears to play a key role in the development of T1DM in humans as well as in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the experimental model for this disease. It has been shown that shifting the immune response to this antigen from TH1 towards TH2, via the administration of GAD65 peptides to young NOD mice, can suppress the progression to overt T1DM. Accordingly, various protocols of ""peptide immunotherapy"" of T1DM are under investigation. However, in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), another autoimmune TH1 mediated disease that mimics human multiple sclerosis, anaphylactic shock can occur when the mice are challenged with certain myelin self peptides that initially were administered with adjuvant to induce the disease.Here we show that NOD mice, that spontaneously develop T1DM, can develop fatal anaphylactic reactions upon challenge with preparations of immunodominant GAD65 self peptides after immunization with these peptides to modify the development of T1DM.These findings document severe anaphylaxis to self peptide preparations used in an attempt to devise immunotherapy for a spontaneous autoimmune disease. Taken together with the findings in EAE, these results suggest that peptide therapies designed to induce a TH1 to TH2 shift carry a risk for the development of anaphylactic reactivity to the therapeutic peptides. Multiple elements of the allergic arm of the immune response modulate autoimmune demyelination PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Pedotti, R., DeVoss, J. J., Youssef, S., Mitchell, D., Wedemeyer, J., Madanat, R., Garren, H., Fontoura, P., Tsai, M., GALLI, S. J., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. Analysis of mRNA from multiple sclerosis lesions revealed increased amounts of transcripts for several genes encoding molecules traditionally associated with allergic responses, including prostaglandin D synthase, histamine receptor type 1 (H1R), platelet activating factor receptor, Ig Fc epsilon receptor 1 (Fc epsilon RI), and tryptase. We now demonstrate that, in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), mediated by T helper 1 (Th1) T cells, histamine receptor 1 and 2 (H1R and H2R) are present on inflammatory cells in brain lesions. Th1 cells reactive to myelin proteolipid protein expressed more H1R and less H2R than Th2 cells. Pyrilamine, an H1R antagonist, blocked EAE, and the platelet activating factor receptor antagonist CV6209 reduced the severity of EAE. EAE severity was also decreased in mice with disruption of the genes encoding Ig Fc gamma RIII or both Fc gamma RIII and Fc epsilon RI. Prostaglandin D synthase and tryptase transcripts were elevated in EAE brain. Taken together, these data reveal extensive involvement of elements of the immune response associated with allergy in autoimmune demyelination. The pathogenesis of demyelination must now be viewed as encompassing elements of both Th1 responses and ""allergic"" responses.

View details for Protein and peptide array analysis of autoimmune disease Molecular cloning, sequencing of the human genome, and other major advances in biomedical research have contributed substantially to our understanding of autoimmune disease. Nevertheless, to date, such advances have failed to reveal the etiology of or yield curative therapies for autoimmune disease. New approaches are needed. Proteomics, the large-scale study of expression and function of proteins that compose our tissues and mediate disease, represents a powerful and promising strategy. We developed protein and peptide arrays to profile autoantibody responses in autoimmune disease. Protein and peptide array analysis of autoimmune samples is revealing human and pathogen proteins involved in initiation and perpetuation of autoimmunity. Proteomic determination of autoantibody profiles can be utilized for diagnosis, prognostication, and guiding tolerizing therapy for autoimmune disease. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, promotes a Th2 bias and reverses paralysis in central nervous system autoimmune disease Youssef, S., Stuve, O., Patarroyo, J. C., Ruiz, P. J., Radosevich, J. L., Hur, E. M., Bravo, M., Mitchell, D. J., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, which are approved for cholesterol reduction, may also be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) was tested in chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a CD4(+) Th1-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease model of multiple sclerosis. Here we show that oral atorvastatin prevented or reversed chronic and relapsing paralysis. Atorvastatin induced STAT6 phosphorylation and secretion of Th2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Conversely, STAT4 phosphorylation was inhibited and secretion of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) was suppressed. Atorvastatin promoted differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells. In adoptive transfer, these Th2 cells protected recipient mice from EAE induction. Atorvastatin reduced CNS infiltration and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression. Treatment of microglia inhibited IFN-gamma-inducible transcription at multiple MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) promoters and suppressed class II upregulation. Atorvastatin suppressed IFN-gamma-inducible expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules. l-Mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed atorvastatin's effects on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and T cells. Atorvastatin treatment of either APC or T cells suppressed antigen-specific T-cell activation. Thus, atorvastatin has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects involving both APC and T-cell compartments.

C., von Budingen, H. C., Yousef, S., Bowen, J. D., Genain, C. P., Hauser, S. L., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Pharmacotherapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) advanced with the demonstration that interferon beta and glatiramer acetate improve the clinical course of this disease. Mitoxantrone is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of secondary progressive MS. Despite this progress, the agents presently available are only partially effective, are difficult to administer, and may have significant side effects. Several orally administered immunomodulatory agents are presently being evaluated for treatment of MS. One class of drugs, HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), is safe and well-tolerated and could become another mainstay of MS therapy.This article reviews the clinical evidence for approved MS therapies and discusses their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the clinical and laboratory data suggesting a potential role for statins in MS therapy are discussed.Although treatment with interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and mitoxantrone, the approved therapies, provide important treatment options for patients with relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS, the potential benefits of other medications, including statins, should be explored in controlled clinical trials.

J., Steinman, L. Women with multiple sclerosis have significantly diminished disease activity during pregnancy. The purpose of our study was to identify the underlying mechanism for the diminished disease activity. We found that during the period of late pregnancy there is protection against paralysis, during both the induction and effector phases of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We did not find any changes in the cytokine secretion profiles or the proliferative activity of autoreactive T cells from mice induced during late pregnancy compared with virgin controls. In mice mated after disease onset, the inflammatory histologic lesions did not clear, despite marked clinical improvement during pregnancy. We found evidence for a serum factor present in late pregnancy that suppresses T cell activation. In the presence of sera taken from mice late in pregnancy, the proliferative response and IL-2 production of proteolipid protein p139-151-specific T cells were significantly diminished as compared with stimulation in the presence of normal mouse sera. In conclusion, serum from late pregnancy has the capacity to down-regulate T cell responses and might be associated with the amelioration of disease activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

The development of vaccines is arguably the most significant achievement in medicine to date. The practice of innoculation with the fluid from a sore to protect from a disease actually dates back to ancient China; however, with the introduction of Jenner's smallpox vaccine, and greater understanding of the immune system, vaccines have become specific and systematic. Traditional vaccines have used killed pathogens (hepatitis A and the Salk polio vaccines), immunogenic subunits of a given pathogen (hepatitis B subunit vaccine), or live attenuated pathogens (measles, mumps, rubella, Sabin polio vaccines) to generate protective immunity. Currently, a new generation of vaccines that use the genetic material of a pathogen to elicit protective immunity are being developed. Although the most widespread and successful use of vaccines today remains in the arena of infectious diseases, manipulations of immune responses to protect against cancers, neurologic diseases, and autoimmunity are being explored rigorously.

J., Oksenberg, J. R., Raine, C. S., Heller, R., Steinman, L. Microarray analysis of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions obtained at autopsy revealed increased transcripts of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 and -17, interferon-gamma and associated downstream pathways. Comparison of two poles of MS pathology--acute lesions with inflammation versus 'silent' lesions without inflammation--revealed differentially transcribed genes. Some products of these genes were chosen as targets for therapy of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is upregulated in acute, but not in chronic, MS lesions, and the effect on ameliorating EAE is more pronounced in the acute phase, in contrast to knocking out the immunoglobulin Fc receptor common gamma chain where the effect is greatest on chronic disease. These results in EAE corroborate the microarray studies on MS lesions. Large-scale analysis of transcripts in MS lesions elucidates new aspects of pathology and opens possibilities for therapy. Millennium Award. Proteomics for the development of DNA tolerizing vaccines to treat autoimmune disease. Robinson, W. H., Garren, H., Utz, P. J., Steinman, L.

We constructed miniaturized autoantigen arrays to perform large-scale multiplex characterization of autoantibody responses directed against structurally diverse autoantigens, using submicroliter quantities of clinical samples. Autoantigen microarrays were produced by attaching hundreds of proteins, peptides and other biomolecules to the surface of derivatized glass slides using a robotic arrayer. Arrays were incubated with patient serum, and spectrally resolvable fluorescent labels were used to detect autoantibody binding to specific autoantigens on the array. We describe and characterize arrays containing the major autoantigens in eight distinct human autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. This represents the first report of application of such technology to multiple human disease sera, and will enable validated detection of antibodies recognizing autoantigens including proteins, peptides, enzyme complexes, ribonucleoprotein complexes, DNA and post-translationally modified antigens. Autoantigen microarrays represent a powerful tool to study the specificity and pathogenesis of autoantibody responses, and to identify and define relevant autoantigens in human autoimmune diseases.

V., Becher, M. W., Springer, J. E., Chabas, D., Youssef, S., Pedotti, R., Mitchell, D., Steinman, L. An expanded polyglutamine domain in huntingtin underlies the pathogenic events in Huntington disease (HD), characterized by chorea, dementia and severe weight loss, culminating in death. Transglutaminase (TGase) may be critical in the pathogenesis, via cross-linking huntingtin. Administration of the TGase competitive inhibitor, cystamine, to transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of huntingtin containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat, altered the course of their HD-like disease. Cystamine given intraperitoneally entered brain where it inhibited TGase activity. When treatment began after the appearance of abnormal movements, cystamine extended survival, reduced associated tremor and abnormal movements and ameliorated weight loss. Treatment did not influence the appearance or frequency of neuronal nuclear inclusions. Unexpectedly, cystamine treatment increased transcription of one of the two genes shown to be neuroprotective for polyglutamine toxicity in Drosophila, dnaj (also known as HDJ1 and Hsp40 in humans and mice, respectively). Inhibition of TGase provides a new treatment strategy for HD and other polyglutamine diseases.

Gamma-glutaminyl-lysyl cross-links have been detected in nuclear inclusions in HD brain, indicating that TGase may play a prominent role in the aggregation of huntingtin (htt).

Pathological-length polyglutamine (Q(n)) expansions, such as those that occur in the huntingtin protein (htt) in Huntington's disease (HD), are excellent substrates for tissue transglutaminase in vitro, and transglutaminase activity is increased in post-mortem HD brain. However, direct evidence for the participation of tissue transglutaminase (or other transglutaminases) in HD patients in vivo is scarce. We now report that levels of N(epsilon)-(gamma-L-glutamyl)-L-lysine (GGEL)--a 'marker' isodipeptide produced by the transglutaminase reaction--are elevated in the CSF of HD patients (708 +/- 41 pmol/mL, SEM, n = 36) vs. control CSF (228 +/- 36, n = 27); p < 0.0001. These data support the hypothesis that transglutaminase activity is increased in HD brain in vivo.

R., Denhardt, D. T., Sobel, R. A., Lock, C., Karpuj, M., Pedotti, R., Heller, R., Oksenberg, J. R., Steinman, L. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease, characterized by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, possibly due to autoimmunity. Large-scale sequencing of cDNA libraries, derived from plaques dissected from brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), indicated an abundance of transcripts for osteopontin (OPN). Microarray analysis of spinal cords from rats paralyzed by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, also revealed increased OPN transcripts. Osteopontin-deficient mice were resistant to progressive EAE and had frequent remissions, and myelin-reactive T cells in OPN-/- mice produced more interleukin 10 and less interferon-gamma than in OPN+/+ mice. Osteopontin thus appears to regulate T helper cell-1 (TH1)-mediated demyelinating disease, and it may offer a potential target in blocking development of progressive MS.

T cell-mediated destruction of the myelin sheath causes inflammatory damage of the CNS in multiple sclerosis (MS). The major T and B cell responses in MS patients who are HLA-DR2 (about two-thirds of MS patients) react to a region between residues 84 and 103 of myelin basic protein (1 ). The crystal structure of HLA-DR2 complexed with myelin basic protein(84-102) confirmed that Lys(91) is the major TCR contact site, whereas Phe(90) is a major anchor to MHC and binds the hydrophobic P4 pocket (2 ). We have tested peptides containing repetitive 4-aa sequences designed to bind critical MHC pockets and to interfere with T cell activation. One such sequence, EYYKEYYKEYYK, ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats, an animal model of MS.

Spinal cord injury results in a massive loss of neurons, and thus of function. We recently reported that passive transfer of autoimmune T cells directed against myelin-associated antigens provides acutely damaged spinal cords with effective neuroprotection. The therapeutic time window for the passive transfer of T cells was found to be at least 1 week. Here we show that posttraumatic T cell-based active vaccination is also neuroprotective. Immunization with myelin-associated antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) significantly promoted recovery after spinal cord contusion injury in the rat model. To reduce the risk of autoimmune disease while retaining the benefit of the immunization, we vaccinated the rats immediately after severe incomplete spinal cord injury with MBP-derived altered peptide ligands. Immunization with these peptides resulted in significant protection from neuronal loss and thus in a reduced extent of paralysis, assessed by an open-field behavioral test. Retrograde labeling of the rubrospinal tracts and magnetic resonance imaging supported the behavioral results. Further optimization of nonpathogenic myelin-derived peptides can be expected to lead the way to the development of an effective therapeutic vaccination protocol as a strategy for the prevention of total paralysis after incomplete spinal cord injury.

DNA vaccination is an effective means of protecting experimental animals against infectious pathogens and cancer and has more recently been used to prevent autoimmune disease. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas. The NOD mouse is an animal model of IDDM in which several autoantigens, including insulin, have been identified. In this study we demonstrate that vaccination of NOD mice with DNA encoding an immunodominant peptide of insulin (residues 9-23 of the B chain) protects the animals from developing diabetes. Animals injected intramuscularly with a bacterial plasmid encoding the insulin B chain peptide show significantly lower disease incidence and delayed onset of disease when compared to controls. Protection appears to be mediated by insulin B (9-23)-specific down-regulation of IFN-gamma. Our results confirm that DNA vaccination has a protective effect on autoimmunity, the understanding of which will reveal new insights into the immune system and open doors for novel therapies.

Using a combination of local gene delivery and tolerizing DNA vaccination, we demonstrate that codelivery of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene and a DNA vaccine encoding the self-peptide proteolipid protein 139-151 (PLP139-151) provides protective immunity against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We provide evidence for a mechanism whereby IL-4 expressed from the naked DNA is secreted and acts locally on autoreactive T cells via activation of STAT6 to shift their cytokine profile to T helper 2. We also show that DNA vaccines can be used to reverse established EAE by covaccination with the genes for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and IL-4. This treatment strategy combines the antigen-specific effects of DNA vaccination and the beneficial effects of local gene delivery.

We have recently reported some success with altered peptide ligands for a major target of the autoimmune response in MS. Antigen specific therapy has the potential to suppress undesirable autoimmunity, while leaving the rest of the immune system intact.

Although EAE is classically a prototypic T helper 1 (TH1) cell-mediated autoimmune disease, it can also be induced by TH2 cells. Characteristically, the most severe manifestation of allergy, anaphylaxis, is associated with exposure to a foreign antigen that is often derived from medication, insect venom or food. We report here that, after self-tolerance to myelin is destroyed, anaphylaxis may be triggered by a self-antigen, in this case a myelin peptide. ""Horror autotoxicus"", which was initially described by Ehrlich, may not only include autoimmunity to self, it may also encompass immediate hypersensitivity to self, which leads to shock and rapid death.

A., Mitchell, D. J., Pattabiraman, K., Pelkey, E. T., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Certain proteins contain subunits that enable their active translocation across the plasma membrane into cells. In the specific case of HIV-1, this subunit is the basic domain Tat(49-57) (RKKRRQRRR). To establish the optimal structural requirements for this translocation process, and thereby to develop improved molecular transporters that could deliver agents into cells, a series of analogues of Tat(49-57) were prepared and their cellular uptake into Jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. All truncated and alanine-substituted analogues exhibited diminished cellular uptake, suggesting that the cationic residues of Tat(49-57) play a principal role in its uptake. Charge alone, however, is insufficient for transport as oligomers of several cationic amino acids (histidine, lysine, and ornithine) are less effective than Tat(49-57) in cellular uptake. In contrast, a 9-mer of l-arginine (R9) was 20-fold more efficient than Tat(49-57) at cellular uptake as determined by Michaelis-Menton kinetic analysis. The d-arginine oligomer (r9) exhibited an even greater uptake rate enhancement (>100-fold). Collectively, these studies suggest that the guanidinium groups of Tat(49-57) play a greater role in facilitating cellular uptake than either charge or backbone structure. Based on this analysis, we designed and synthesized a class of polyguanidine peptoid derivatives. Remarkably, the subset of peptoid analogues containing a six-methylene spacer between the guanidine head group and backbone (N-hxg), exhibited significantly enhanced cellular uptake compared to Tat(49-57) and even to r9. Overall, a transporter has been developed that is superior to Tat(49-57), protease resistant, and more readily and economically prepared.

Homopolymers or peptides containing a high percentage of cationic amino acids have been shown to have a unique ability to cross the plasma membrane of cells, and consequently have been used to facilitate the uptake of a variety of biopolymers and small molecules. To investigate whether the polycationic character of these molecules, or some other structural feature, was the molecular basis for the effect, the ability of a variety of homopolymers to enter cells was assayed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Polymers of L- or D-arginine containing six or more amino acids entered cells far more effectively than polymers of equal length composed of lysine, ornithine and histidine. Peptides of fewer than six amino acids were ineffective. The length of the arginine side-chain could be varied without significant loss of activity. These data combined with the inability of polymers of citrulline to enter cells demonstrated that the guanidine headgroup of arginine was the critical structural component responsible for the biological activity. Cellular uptake could be inhibited by preincubation of the cells with sodium azide, but not by low temperature (3 degrees C), indicating that the process was energy dependent, but did not involve endocytosis.

In this 'double-blind', randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we compared an altered peptide ligand of myelin basic protein with placebo, evaluating their safety and influence on magnetic resonance imaging in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. A safety board suspended the trial because of hypersensitivity reactions in 9% of the patients. There were no increases in either clinical relapses or in new enhancing lesions in any patient, even those with hypersensitivity reactions. Secondary analysis of those patients completing the study showed that the volume and number of enhancing lesions were reduced at a dose of 5 mg. There was also a regulatory type 2 T helper-cell response to altered peptide ligand that cross-reacted with the native peptide.

A., Gijbels, K., Tropper, F. D., Bednarski, M., Li, K. C., Steinman, L. The expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in the intact brains of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) was visualized by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) through the use of a new, target-specific MR contrast agent. Antibody-conjugated paramagnetic liposomes (ACPLs) were designed to achieve in vivo targeting of molecules expressed on vascular endothelium, while providing sufficient signal enhancement at these sites for detection by MRI. ACPLs targeted to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an endothelial leukocyte receptor upregulated on cerebral microvasculature during EAE, were administered to diseased mice. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that fluorescently-tagged ACPLs were localized to central nervous system (CNS) microvasculature in a pattern consistent with ICAM-1 upregulation described immunohistochemically. High resolution MRI of mouse brains ex vivo demonstrated that ACPL binding conferred significant enhancement of signal intensity (SI) as compared to control images. These results suggest that ACPLs can be used as MRI contrast agents to visualize specific molecules expressed on vascular endothelium during disease.

W., Hirschberg, D. L., Xiao, J., Lu, Q., Roederer, M., Lock, C. B., Herzenberg, L. A., Steinman, L., Herzenberg, L. A. Multigenic programs controlling susceptibility to apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation have not yet been defined. Here, using DNA microarrays, we show gene expression patterns in an apoptosis-sensitive and apoptosis-resistant murine B cell lymphoma model system both before and after irradiation. From the 11,000 genes interrogated by the arrays, two major patterns emerged. First, before radiation exposure the radioresistant LYar cells expressed significantly greater levels of message for several genes involved in regulating intracellular redox potential. Compared with LYas cells, LYar cells express 20- to 50-fold more mRNA for the tetraspanin CD53 and for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Expression of both of these genes can lead to the increase of total cellular glutathione, which is the principle intracellular antioxidant and has been shown to inhibit many forms of apoptosis. A second pattern emerged after radiation, when the apoptosis-sensitive LYas cells induced rapid expression of a unique cluster of genes characterized by their involvement in mitochondrial electron transport. Some of these genes have been previously recognized as proapoptotic; however others, such as uncoupling protein 2, were not previously known to be apoptotic regulatory proteins. From these observations we propose that a multigenic program for sensitivity to apoptosis involves induction of transcripts for genes participating in mitochondrial uncoupling and loss of membrane potential. This program triggers mitochondrial release of apoptogenic factors and induces the ""caspase cascade."" Conversely, cells resistant to apoptosis down-regulate these biochemical pathways, while activating pathways for establishment and maintenance of high intracellular redox potential by means of elevated glutathione.

A., Gussoni, E., Begovich, A. B., MURRAY, R. S., Zang, Y. Q., Appel, S. H., Steinman, L., Zhang, J. W. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disorder whose etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the presence of inflammatory infiltrates within ALS spinal cord and suggested the possibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron degeneration. We have analyzed the diversity of T-cells in the spinal cord in ALS. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with variable (V) region sequence specific oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify T-cell receptor (TCR)BV transcripts from spinal cords obtained at autopsy from patients with ALS, patients who died without inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, brains from patients with ALS, and brains from patients who died with inflammatory CNS disease. Sequencing was then performed on the amplified transcripts. An overall increase in the level of TCRBV 2 transcripts was detected in ALS specimens when compared to controls. This result was independent of the HLA genotype of the individual. Furthermore, enrichment of TCRBV2-positive T cells could be demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid derived from patients with ALS, using PCR analysis and a T cell stimulation assay with toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), a Vbeta2-specific superantigen. Our results suggest that an immunological process involving the specific expansion of Vbeta2 TCR-positive T-cells may be important in the pathogenesis of ALS.

V., Garren, H., Slunt, H., Price, D. L., Gusella, J., Becher, M. W., Steinman, L. The protein huntingtin (htt), aggregated in neuronal nuclear inclusions, is pathognomonic of Huntington's disease (HD). Constructs, translated in vitro from the N terminus of htt, containing either polyQ23 from a normal individual, or polyQ41 or polyQ67 from an HD patient, were all soluble. Transglutaminase (TGase) crosslinked these proteins, and the aggregations did not have the staining properties of amyloid. More TGase-catalyzed aggregates formed when the polyglutamine domain of htt exceeded the pathologic threshold of polyQ36. Furthermore, shorter htt constructs, containing 135 aa or fewer, formed more aggregates than did larger htt constructs. TGase activity in the HD brain was increased compared with the control, with notable increases in cell nuclei. The increased TGase activity was brain specific. In lymphoblastoid cells from HD patients, TGase activity was decreased. TGase-mediated crosslinking of htt may be involved in the formation of the nonamyloidogenic nuclear inclusions found in the HD brain. The staining properties of nuclear inclusions in the HD brain revealed that they were not amyloid.

L., VEROMAA, T. The role of various adhesion molecules in lymphocyte homing to the brain and in inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) was examined in mice. Activated T cell lines and clones expressed CD44 and integrin alpha4, but not L-selectin, and entered the CNS independent of their antigen specificity. mAbs directed against CD44 and integrin alpha4 prevented the transfer of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by myelin basic protein-specific T cells. T cells preincubated with anti-CD44 or antiintegrin alpha4 were blocked only partially from entering the brain parenchyma. However, both antibodies efficiently prevented CNS inflammation and clinical expression of EAE when injected in vivo. This effect lasted as long as antibodies were administered. Antibodies specific for L-selectin had no effect on homing of encephalitogenic T cells to the brain or development of EAE. Antiintegrin alpha4 and anti-CD44 did not impair the activation and function of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro and did not deplete integrin alpha4- or CD44-positive cells in vivo. These data suggest that, in the absence of leukocyte recruitment, the entry of a reduced number of activated myelin basic protein-reactive T cells in the CNS is not sufficient for the development and expression of EAE. We propose that antibodies to integrin alpha4 and CD44 prevent clinical disease by partially targeting the primary influx of encephalitogenic T cells and by preventing the secondary influx of leukocytes to lesions initiated by the transferred T cells.

M., Levite, M., Karpuj, M. V., Southwood, S., Sette, A., Conlon, P., Steinman, L. Molecular mimicry refers to structural homologies between a self-protein and a microbial protein. A major epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), p87-99 (VHFFKNIVTPRTP), induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). VHFFK contains the major residues for binding of this self-molecule to T cell receptor (TCR) and to the major histocompatibility complex. Peptides from papilloma virus strains containing the motif VHFFK induce EAE. A peptide from human papilloma virus type 40 (HPV 40) containing VHFFR, and one from HPV 32 containing VHFFH, prevented EAE. A sequence from Bacillus subtilis (RKVVTDFFKNIPQRI) also prevented EAE. T cell lines, producing IL-4 and specific for these microbial peptides, suppressed EAE. Thus, microbial peptides, differing from the core motif of the self-antigen, MBPp87-99, function as altered peptide ligands, and behave as TCR antagonists, in the modulation of autoimmune disease.

J., Garren, H., Ruiz, I. U., Hirschberg, D. L., Nguyen, L. V., Karpuj, M. V., Cooper, M. T., Mitchell, D. J., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Usually we rely on vaccination to promote an immune response to a pathogenic microbe. In this study, we demonstrate a suppressive from of vaccination, with DNA encoding a minigene for residues 139-151 of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP139-151), a pathogenic self-Ag. This suppressive vaccination attenuates a prototypic autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which presents clinically with paralysis. Proliferative responses and production of the Th1 cytokines, IL-2 and IFN-gamma, were reduced in T cells responsive to PLP139-151. In the brains of mice that were successfully vaccinated, mRNA for IL-2, IL-15, and IFN-gamma were reduced. A mechanism underlying the reduction in severity and incidence of paralytic autoimmune disease and the reduction in Th1 cytokines involves altered costimulation of T cells; loading of APCs with DNA encoding PLP139-151 reduced the capacity of a T cell line reactive to PLP139-151 to proliferate even in the presence of exogenous CD28 costimulation. DNA immunization with the myelin minigene for PLP-altered expression of B7.1 (CD80), and B7.2 (CD86) on APCs in the spleen. Suppressive immunization against self-Ags encoded by DNA may be exploited to treat autoimmune diseases.

K., Allegretta, M., Steinman, L., Atkinson, M. A., Brostoff, S. W., Albertini, R. J. T cells with somatically acquired mutations in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene were isolated from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) as representatives of populations potentially enriched for in vivo activated T cells. TCRB gene V region usage among mutant isolates from individual IDDM patients, but not from normal controls, showed a pronounced preference for BV14 and, to a lesser extent, BV6. Wild-type (nonmutant) isolates did not show such preferences. Extensive in vivo clonal expansions of the BV14 expressing mutant T cells from IDDM patients were revealed by sequence identity of TCRB chain junctional regions. These data support restricted TCRB gene usage in T cell populations enriched for in vivo activated clones in patients with IDDM.

View details for Local delivery of TNF by retrovirus-transduced T lymphocytes exacerbates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis Dal Canto, R. A., Shaw, M. K., Nolan, G. P., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that serves as a model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. Paralysis is ""induced"" by CD4+ T cells of the Th1 phenotype. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a Th1 type cytokine, has been shown to be upregulated in the CNS during the onset of EAE, and systemic manipulations of TNF have had substantial effects on disease progression. However, the precise role of TNF in EAE has been called into question by recent experiments utilizing TNF and lymphotoxin knockout mice. We demonstrate here that the local delivery of TNF by myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells, retrovirally transduced to express TNF, exacerbated MBP-induced disease following adoptive transfer into syngeneic mice. View details for Viral peptide with limited homology to a self peptide can induce clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis Gautam, A. M., Liblau, R., Chelvanayagam, G., Steinman, L., Boston, T. Molecular mimicry has been suggested as a mode of autoreactive T cell stimulation in autoimmune diseases. Myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide 1-11 induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in susceptible strains of mice. Here we show that a herpesvirus Saimiri (HVS) peptide, AAQRRPSRPFA, with a limited homology to MBP1-11 peptide, ASQKRPSQRHG (underlined letters showing homology), can stimulate a panel of MBP-11-specific T cell hybridomas and more importantly cause EAE in mice. We demonstrate that this is due to cross-recognition of these two peptides by TCRs. Results presented in this communication are the first demonstration that a viral peptide with homology at just 5 amino acids with a self peptide can induce clinical signs of EAE in mice. These findings have important implications in understanding the breakdown of T cell tolerance to self Ags in autoimmune diseases by means of cross-reactivity with unrelated peptides.

L., Carmi, P., Erez, N., Garren, H., Herkel, J., Karpuj, M., Steinman, L., Rotter, V., Cohen, I. R. The p53 molecule might serve as a common tumor-associated antigen, as the tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated and the p53 protein is often over-expressed in tumor cells. We report that effective immunity to p53 can be induced through an idiotypic network by immunization of mice with a monoclonal antibody (PAb-240) specific for mutated p53, or with a peptide derived from the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of the variable domain of the light chain (VL) of this antibody. The immunized mice produced IgG antibodies to p53 and mounted a cytotoxic reaction to a tumor line bearing mutated p53. The idiotypically immunized mice were resistant to challenge with the tumor cells. Thus antibodies to p53 might serve as immunogens for activating resistance to some tumors. At the basic level, these findings indicate that a network of p53 immunity may be organized naturally within the immune system.

D., Conlon, P., Gaur, A., Ling, N., Steinman, L. An immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), VHFFKNIVTPRTP (p87-99), is a major target of T cells in brain lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), and this peptide can trigger experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We designed truncated peptides based on this pathogenic 13-mer that are not antigenic. These short peptides reduced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in vivo. Moreover, paraplegic rats given the 7-mer FKNIVTP in soluble form showed total reversal of paralysis in 24 h. Truncated peptides that are too small to stimulate antigenic responses to pathogenic regions of myelin basic protein are nevertheless effective tolerogens and are able to anergize autoreactive T cells. Short peptide-based tolerogens, devoid of immunogenic and pathogenic potential, may be attractive for therapy of autoimmune diseases. View details for Dal Canto, R. A., Shaw, M.

The mechanisms by which microbial peptide antigens and superantigens might initiate and perpetuate autoimmune responses against antigens of the central nervous system are discussed. A model will be proposed that includes the initial activation of naive T lymphocytes through T cell receptor-mediated recognition of microbial antigens presented by MHC class II molecules. This event might be followed by re-activation of autoreactive T cells by bacterial and viral superantigens. Both mechanisms could lead to acute and relapsing autoimmune disease. View details for Neuropeptides, via specific receptors, regulate T cell adhesion to fibronectin Levite, M., Cahalon, L., HERSHKOVIZ, R., Steinman, L., Lider, O. The ability of T cells to adhere to and interact with components of the blood vessel walls and the extracellular matrix is essential for their extravasation and migration into inflamed sites. We have found that the beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion of resting human T cells to fibronectin, a major glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix, is induced by physiologic concentrations of three neuropeptides: calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP), neuropeptide Y, and somatostatin; each acts via its own specific receptor on the T cell membrane. In contrast, substance P (SP), which coexists with CGRP in the majority of peripheral endings of sensory nerves, including those innervating the lymphoid organs, blocks T cell adhesion to fibronectin when induced by CGRP, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, and PMA. Inhibition of T cell adhesion was obtained both by the intact SP peptide and by its 1-4 N-terminal and its 4-11, 5-11, and 6-11 C-terminal fragments, used at similar nanomolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the parent SP peptide and its fragments were abrogated by an SP NK-1 receptor antagonist, suggesting they all act through the same SP NK-1 receptor. These findings suggest that neuropeptides, by activating their specific T cell-expressed receptors, can provide the T cells with both positive (proadhesive) and negative (antiadhesive) signals and thereby regulate their function. Thus, neuropeptides may influence diverse physiologic processes involving integrins, including leukocyte-mediated migration and inflammation.

Recent findings, however, beg re-evaluation of the direct role of Th2 cells in the induction or maintenance of tolerance, whereas evidence for the role of a distinct subset of regulatory T cells producing TGF-beta to suppress cell-mediated immunopathology is compelling.

W., Catz, I., Hausmann, S., STROMINGER, J. L., Steinman, L., Warren, K. G. Myelin basic protein (MBP) may be an important autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS), with the MBP(82-100) region being immunodominant for T cells and autoantibodies. The structural requirements for autoantibody recognition were compared to those previously defined for MBP-specific T cell clones. MBP autoantibodies were affinity-purified from central nervous system lesions of 11/12 postmortem cases studied. The MBP(83-97) peptide was immunodominant in all 11 cases since it inhibited autoantibody binding to MBP > 95%. Residues contributing to autoantibody binding were located in a 10-amino acid segment (V86-T95) that also contained the MHC/T cell receptor contact residues of the T cell epitope. In the epitope center, the same residues were important for antibody binding and T cell recognition. Based on the antibody-binding motif, microbial peptides were identified that were bound by purified autoantibodies. Autoantibody binding of microbial peptides required sequence identity at four or five contiguous residues in the epitope center. Microbial peptides previously found to activate T cell clones did not have such obvious homology to MBP since sequence identity was not required at MHC contacts. The similar fine specificity of B cells and T cells may be useful for tolerance induction to MBP in MS. View details for Perivascular T cells express the pro-inflammatory chemokine RANTES mRNA in multiple sclerosis lesions Hvas, J., McLean, C., Justesen, J., Kannourakis, G., Steinman, L., Oksenberg, J. R., Bernard, C. C. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by accumulation of mononuclear cells. The pathogenesis of MS is complex and probably involves soluble immune mediators, particularly cytokines, and activated memory T cells, that are thought to migrate into the CNS. During lesion formation in MS, cytokines regulate cell functions, such as cell recruitment and migration. Because the chemokine RANTES play a role in both activating and recruiting leucocytes, particularly memory T cells into inflammatory sites, the authors have assessed RANTES mRNA levels at the site of lesions. Expression levels were analysed in brain samples and compared with neurological, infectious and other controls. RANTES was expressed by activated perivascular memory T cells, predominantly located at the edge of active plaques. While RANTES mRNA was detected in all 17 MS brains analysed, it was only found in six of the 14 control patients and generally at a lower expression level. In view of the regulatory and chemotactic properties of RANTES, these results imply that RANTES in MS lesions may play an important role in the activation and/or selective accumulation of memory T cells and, thereby, in the pathogenic events associated with MS.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) exerts a major role in the stress response. Both CRF and urocortin, a newly discovered neuropeptide homologous to CRF, suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Suppression of paralysis with CRF involved stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and inhibitory effects on an encephalitogenic T cell line. While CRF increased glucocorticoid production, which is known to block EAE, it also suppressed EAE in adrenalectomized rats, where glucocorticoid stimulation via CRF plays no role. Moreover, the encephalitogenicity of a T cell line exposed to CRF in vitro was reduced. Stress may influence autoimmune disease through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and directly via the immune system.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system which serves as a model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. We demonstrate here that encephalitogenic T cells, transduced with a retroviral gene, construct to express interleukin 4, and can delay the onset and reduce the severity of EAE when adoptively transferred to myelin basic protein-immunized mice. Thus, T lymphocytes transduced with retroviral vectors can deliver ""regulatory cytokines"" in a site-specific manner and may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune disease.

The influence of epistatic interactions between these genes is considered. The impact of genetic rearrangements of certain germline genes on susceptibility to MS is described.

View details for Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in IL-4-deficient mice Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in an inflammatory demyelinating disease which usually follows a monophasic course. Autoreactive Th1 CD4+ T cells are responsible for the lesions, whereas autoreactive Th2 CD4+ T cells can, upon adoptive transfer, suppress the disease process. However, the role of IL-4 and Th2 cells in the spontaneous remission of EAE and in the prevention of relapses is not known. We have addressed these issues using IL-4-deficient mice in which the differentiation of Th2 CD4+ T cells is severely compromised. The clinical course of actively induced EAE was compared in IL-4+/+, IL-4+ /- and IL-4-/- mice on the PL/J genetic background. No significant differences were noted between groups for the frequency, severity and duration of EAE, and the frequency of relapses. Our results indicate that IL-4, despite its well-documented regulatory role in EAE, is not necessary for the spontaneous remission of disease or for the prevention of relapses. Therefore, in the absence of IL-4, overlapping or compensatory immunoregulatory mechanisms can restrict an inflammatory response within the central nervous system.

A., Chalmers, D., Crowe, P. D., Pahuja, A., Ling, N., Brocke, S., Steinman, L., Conlon, P. J. T-cells specific for a region of human myelin basic protein, amino acids 87-99 (hMBP87-99), have been implicated in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Administration of soluble altered peptide ligand (APL), made by substituting native residues with alanine at either positions 91(91K > A or A91) or 97 (97R > A or A97) in the hMBP87-99 peptide, blocked the development of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), in the SJL mouse. The non-encephalitogenic APL A91, appears to induce cytokine shifts from Th1 to Th2 in the target T-cells, whereas the encephalitogenic superagonist APL A97 causes deletion of the MBP87-99 responsive cells. Thus, single amino acid changes at different positions in the same peptide epitope can lead to APL capable of controlling auto-immune disease by different mechanisms.

We evaluated myoblast implantation in 10 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and absent dystrophin (age 5-10 years) who were implanted with 100 million myoblasts in the anterior tibial muscle of one leg and placebo in the other. Cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) was administered for 7 months. Pre- and postimplantation (after 1 and 6 months) muscle biopsies were analyzed. Force generation (tetanic tension and maximum voluntary contraction) was measured monthly in a double-blind design. There was increased force generation in both legs of all boys, probably due to cyclosporine. Using the polymerase chain reaction, evidence of myoblast survival and dystrophin mRNA expression was obtained in 3 patients after 1 month and in 1 patient after 6 months. These studies suggest a salutary effect of cyclosporine upon muscular force generation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; however, myoblast implantation was not effective in replacing clinically significant amounts of dystrophin in DMD muscle.

Administration of AG reduced the expression of nitrosotyrosine in inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system. Cytokine expression, determined by semiquantitative PCR, revealed increased expression of IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta, which was associated with protection from EAE, and reduced TNF-alpha, associated with the development of EAE. Furthermore, AG blocked the secretion of nitric oxide, TNF-alpha, and PGE2 in astrocyte cultures. AG did not influence the proliferation response of T cells to a pathogenic epitope of myelin basic protein. Down-regulation of nitric oxide by AG has widespread consequences for cytokine production in central nervous system inflammation and prevents EAE.

View details for IL-2 and TNF receptors as targets of regulatory T-T interactions - Isolation and characterization of cytokine receptor-reactive T cell lines in the Lewis rat T cells are considered to be of prime importance in immune regulation of both B and T cell functions. The targets of recognition in T-T cell interactions are not clear. Most recent experimental work has focused on the idiotypic regulatory interactions mediated by TCR peptides. There is experimental evidence that regulatory cells exist that do not recognize the TCR. This type of regulation is selectively induced by activated T cells. Therefore, we designed this study to examine the possible role of cytokine receptors as targets of immune regulation. We tested two peptides of IL-2R alpha-chain, 2 of IL-2R beta-chain, and one of TNFR (p60). All peptides were found to be immunogenic at inducing T cell proliferation and four induced Abs in Lewis rats. We generated T cell lines to these five peptides, and tested them both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the T cells exhibited a proliferative response when cultured with activated, irradiated stimulator cells that were augmented upon addition of the cytokine receptor peptide. The cytokine profile of the lines was characterized as well as the Vbeta gene composition. One of the lines significantly protected against active encephalomyelitis. These results point at cytokine receptors as possible targets of immune regulation and T-T cell interactions.

F., Martin, R. We have examined the functional consequences induced by interaction of DR2a-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) (87-99)-specific T cell clones (TCC) with altered peptide ligands (APL) derived from MBP peptide (87-99). The immunodominant MBP peptide (87-99) has been implicated as a candidate antigen in multiple sclerosis (MS) by several lines of evidence. In the present study, we have defined the T cell receptor (TCR) contact residues for DR2a-restricted, (87-99)-specific T helper type 1 T cells to design APL suitable to modify the functions of such T cells potentially relevant for the pathogenesis of MS. We show that neutral (L-alanine substitutions) or conservative exchanges of the primary and secondary TCR contact residues lead to various alterations of T cell function, ranging from differences in interleukin-2 receptor up-regulation to anergy induction and TCR antagonism. The potential usefulness of APL as an immunomodulating therapy for DR2+ MS patients is discussed. View details for The right stuff: Breaking through the xenotransplant barrier View details for Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease during which an autoimmune reaction is directed against oligodendrocytes. Alterations of normal myelin structure or oligodendrocyte metabolism may be primary events that influence the susceptibility to MS. Once triggered, the immune system attacks and destroys myelin and the myelin forming cell. Evidence is presented that the oligodendrocyte responds to the attack by immune cells and their secreted products through modulation of its metabolism and gene expression. Cytokines, immunoglobulins, and complement complexes may elicit a survival response in the oligodendrocytes, involving the induction of heat shock proteins and other protective molecules. The possibility of manipulating these complex glial cell functions and controlling their pathologic interactions with immune cells will illuminate how myelin damage can be contained and how the injured tissue can be repaired.

J., Hirschberg, D. L., Gelman, A., Oksenberg, J. R., Brocke, S., Mor, F., Cohen, I. R., Steinman, L. A variable region gene of the T-cell receptor, V beta 8.2, is rearranged, and its product is expressed on pathogenic T cells that induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in H-2u mice after immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP). Vaccination of these mice with naked DNA encoding V beta 8.2 protected mice from EAE. Analysis of T cells reacting to the pathogenic portion of the MBP molecule indicated that in the vaccinated mice there was a reduction in the Th1 cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gama. In parallel, there was an elevation in the production of IL-4, a Th2 cytokine associated with suppression of disease. A novel feature of DNA immunization for autoimmune disease, reversal of the autoimmune response from Th1 to Th2, may make this approach attractive for treatment of Th1-mediated diseases like multiple sclerosis, juvenile diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

We have examined the level of surface expression and functional properties of leukocyte function associated antigen-1, very late antigen-4, and CD45 isoforms on a panel of human CD4+ T-cell clones representative of TH0, TH1, and TH2 cells. There were no qualitative differences in the expression of these antigens among the three types of CD4+ T-cell clones. However, CD45RB was the only CD45 isoform that provided a costimulatory signal in a solid-phase antibody-induced cellular proliferation assay. Additionally, the antigen-induced proliferative response of T-cell clones was inhibited by soluble anti-CD45RO and anti-CD45RB antibodies. Our results suggest that CD45 isoforms differentially provide costimulatory signals to T cells. However, the ability of each CD45 isoform to provide a costimulatory signal does not differ among the TH0, TH1, or TH2 T-cell populations. View details for Regulation of disease susceptibility: Decreased prevalence of IgE-mediated allergic disease in patients with multiple sclerosis ORO, A. S., Guarino, T. J., Driver, R., Steinman, L., Umetsu, D. T. The development of restricted cytokine profiles by subsets of CD4+ T cells is a pivotal point in the regulation of immune responses. T cells producing Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and interferon-gamma) induce cell-mediated immunity, whereas T cells producing Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) play a prominent role in the induction of humoral immunity. We examined a group of patients with multiple sclerosis, a disease caused by excess production of Th1 cytokines in myelin-reactive T cells, and control patients with noninflammatory neuroconvulsive disorders, for the presence of allergic disease, which is caused by excess production of Th2 cytokines in allergen-specific T cells. The patients with multiple sclerosis had significantly fewer allergic symptoms, a lower number of positive allergen-specific IgE test results, and lower composite allergy indexes than control subjects. These results demonstrate that the prevalence of IgE-mediated allergic disease is decreased in a group of patients with multiple sclerosis and support the hypothesis that genetic factors that promote susceptibility to Th1-mediated inflammatory disease in human beings protect against the development of Th2-mediated disease.

A variety of autoantigens and their derived peptides have been shown to be excellent stimulators for encephalitogenic T-cell lines and clones. This article describes protocols for the establishment and characterization of autoreactive T-cell lines and clones and for the study of EAE induced by these cells. The rationale for using transferred EAE models is discussed, together with advantages and disadvantages of using in vitro cultured T cells compared with Freund's adjuvant-based immunization for the induction of EAE.

View details for A few autoreactive cells in an autoimmune infiltrate control a vast population of nonspecific cells: A tale of smart bombs and the infantry PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Inflammatory infiltrates in tissue-specific autoimmune disease comprise a collection of T cells with specificity for an antigen in the target organ. These specific cells recruit a population of nonspecific T cells and macrophages. The rare tissue-specific T cells in the infiltrate have the capacity to regulate both the influx and the efflux of cells from the tissue. Administration of an altered peptide ligand for the specific T cell which triggers autoimmunity can lead to the regression of the entire inflammatory ensemble in a few hours. Interleukin 4 is a critical cytokine involved in the regression of the inflammatory infiltrate.

J., Wraith, D. C., OGARRA, A., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Following induction of experimental encephalomyelitis with a T-cell clone, L10C1, that is specific for the myelin basic protein epitope p87-99, the inflammatory infiltrate in the central nervous system contains a diverse collection of T cells with heterogeneous receptors. We show here that when clone L10C1 is tolerized in vivo with an analogue of p87-99, established paralysis is reversed, inflammatory infiltrates regress, and the heterogeneous T-cell infiltrate disappears from the brain, with only the T-cell clones that incited disease remaining in the original lesions. We found that antibody raised against interleukin-4 reversed the tolerance induced by the altered peptide ligand. Treatment with this altered peptide ligand selectively silences pathogenic T cells and actively signals for the efflux of other T cells recruited to the site of disease as a result of the production of interleukin-4 and the reduction of tumour-necrosis factor-alpha in the lesion.

A., Brocke, S., TAYLOREDWARDS, C., Ridgway, W., Dinisco, C., Steinman, L., Dalton, D., Fathman, C. G. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, is an autoimmune disorder seen in mice and rats following immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) or MBP-derived peptides. IFN-gamma, a cytokine produced by a variety of cells, is involved in many inflammatory and immune regulatory events. Contradictory results concerning exacerbations and the disease course were seen comparing injections of IFN-gamma in humans suffering from multiple sclerosis to studies using anti-IFN-gamma Abs in mice with EAE. To study the role of IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-producing cells in EAE, we crossed IFN-gamma knockout mice (H-2b) (unable to produce IFN-gamma due to the disruption of the IFN-gamma gene) with an EAE-susceptible mouse strain, B10.PL (H-2u). EAE was seen in IFN-gamma knockout mice, heterozygotic (IFN-gamma +/-) mice, as well as wild-type littermates following immunization with MBP. Histologic analyses of the central nervous system of IFN-gamma knockout mice with EAE revealed massive infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. We conclude that the presence of IFN-gamma is not crucial to the induction or the clinical course of EAE.

S., Szafer, F., HENSLEEDOWNEY, P. J., Walker, M., King, S., Godder, K., Pati, A. R., BEST, R., Steinman, L., Geier, S. S., Gee, A. P. The purpose of this study was to characterize the phenotype and clonality of the T cell population in patients who experience acute rejection (AR) following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a partially mismatched related donor (PMRD). Phenotypic analysis was performed using flow cytometry, assignment of donor/host lineage by cytogenetics or HLA-specific flow cytometry, and analysis of the T cell receptor (TCR) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We have previously reported the initial appearance in the blood of AR patients of host CD8+brightCD3low T cells that progressively express increasing amounts of CD3+ cells. We now report that this cell population can differentiate into either a cytotoxic T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+CD57-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched unrelated donors or a suppressor T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+CD57+HLA-DR-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched sibling donors. Analysis of the TCR V beta subsets from two patients revealed sorted host CD3+CD8+ cells (purity 90-95%) from the first patient to express V beta 18 almost exclusively. In a second patient with late rejection (55 days post-BMT), the CD3+CD8+ cells were predominantly restricted to V beta 1, 5.1, 7, 9, and 18. Although CD3+CD8+ T cells are known to be associated with AR, cytotoxic and suppressor lineages in AR from the same type of BMT and clonal distribution of T cells in AR have not been reported. Preliminary results suggest that V beta expression in AR of PMRD grafts is restricted and host T cell phenotype may vary. Further studies will investigate whether specific mismatches correlate with specific V beta usage and/or host T cell phenotype.

S., Steinman, L. We previously demonstrated the local production of the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the central nervous system (CNS) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for the human disease multiple sclerosis.To assess the role of IL-6 in autoimmune CNS inflammation, we administered neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 in the EAE model. Their effect was examined at the clinical and histopathological level. Levels of administered antibody and IL-6 bioactivity were followed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Systemically administered antibodies penetrated into the fluid CSF in animals in which EAE was induced. Administration of anti-IL-6 reduced the development of actively induced as well as adoptively transferred EAE and was associated with increased levels of IL-6 activity in the CSF and to a lesser extent in the serum. Anti-IL-6 was still effective when given 1 day before the onset of disease signs in adoptively transferred EAE. The disease-reducing effect of anti-IL-6 was also reflected at the pathological level by the absence of inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS.Our study indicates that IL-6 plays an important role in autoimmune CNS inflammation. However, due to the complex nature of the in vivo interactions of administered antibodies, the disease-reducing effect of the anti-IL-6 antibodies could be caused by neutralization of IL-6 activity or by enhancement of IL-6 activity via induction of higher IL-6 levels in the CNS.

Analysis of pathogen-reactive T cell clones (CD3+4+8-TCR alpha beta +), isolated from the synovial fluid of 2 HLA-B27-positive patients with Yersinia enterocolitica-triggered reactive arthritis, has provided important information about the cellular immune response to this disease-inciting pathogen. This study demonstrates that the proteins secreted by Y. enterocolitica, including a protein with tyrosine phosphatase activity (YopH), are potent immunogens stimulating CD4+ cells within the inflamed joint. The pathogen-reactive T cell clones preferentially utilized a limited set of T cell receptor variable region gene segments. A purified Yersinia superantigen triggered a proliferative response in most of the antigen-reactive T cell clones tested. These results suggest that the activity of this pathogen's superantigen influences the cellular immune response to its antigens. View details for MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS - PRESENTING AN ODD AUTOANTIGEN View details for Evidence is emerging that the major T- and B-cell response in multiple sclerosis (MS) is directed to a region of myelin basic protein (MBP) between residues 84 and 103. In rodent models of MS, immunization to this component of MBP evokes experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). T cells found in EAE lesions show similarities in the VJ and VDJ regions of their alpha and beta chains with T cells in MS lesions, and with T cells that are specific for MBPp84-103 isolated from patients with MS. If this region of MBP is critical in the pathogenesis of MS, then therapy aimed at controlling the immune response to this immunodominant region of MBP may be beneficial in treating MS. View details for REINDUCTION OF EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN MICE Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats and some strains of mice is typically a monophasic disease, and recovered animals are resistant to reinduction of disease. We demonstrate that SJL mice remain susceptible to disease after recovery, and suffer a second episode of disease when reinjected with spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant. Reinduced disease occurs earlier after injection than the initial disease (mean onset 7.3 days compared with 14.5 days), and has comparable severity and incidence. The susceptibility to reinduced disease is present for at least 20 weeks after the initial injection. If the initial episode of EAE is elicited using a synthetic peptide of proteolipid protein, then reinjection of the same peptide causes reinduced disease. PL/J mice and PL/J x SJL F1 mice are also susceptible to reinduced disease which occurs with an accelerated onset and higher incidence than the initial disease. We conclude that SJL and PL/J mice have a defect in immunoregulation which causes them to be susceptible to recurrent episodes of autoimmune disease.

One strategy was to sequence TCR gene rearrangements directly from MS lesions. The second strategy utilized T-cell clones with a selectable mutation that are found only in MS patients. The selection of T-cell clones with mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene was used to isolate T-cells reactive to myelin basic protein (MBP) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These T-cell clones are activated in vivo, and are not found in healthy individuals. The third complementarity determining regions (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains are the putative contact sites for peptide fragments of MBP bound in the groove of the HLA molecule. The TCR V gene usage and CDR3s of these MBP-reactive hprt- T-cell clones are homologous to TCRs from other T-cells relevant to MS, including T-cells causing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and T-cells found in brain lesions and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients. In vivo activated MBP-reactive T-cells in MS patients may be critical in the pathogenesis of MS.

L., Porteus, M., Steinman, L., Stevens, D. A. CSF lymphocytes from patients with Coccidioides immitis meningitis exhibited a significant antigen-specific response to in vitro stimulation with C. immitis antigens. In some patients, lesser responses to control antigens (Candida and PPD) were also detected. Antigen-specific responses by CSF lymphocytes were seen early in the course of this disease as well as several years after patients had entered remission. When compared to CSF cells, the response of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells was similar but of a much smaller magnitude and at times undetectable. Fluorescence activated cell sorting revealed an increased percentage of CD3+ (T-cells), CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD3+/HLA-DR+ (activated T-cell) cells in the CSF of C. immitis meningitis patients compared to their blood. Most of the antigen-specific proliferative response resided in the CD4+ lymphocyte subset. CSF T-cell proliferation assays may have a role in the diagnosis of C. immitis meningitis.

D., Michie, S. A., Tisch, R., Karin, N., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. To elucidate the role of cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and to determine the predominant lymphocytic homing pathway(s) involved in the selective lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets (insulitis), nonobese diabetic mice were treated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the L-selectin and integrin alpha 4 lymphocyte adhesion molecules. Treatment of neonatal mice with either anti-L-selectin or anti-integrin alpha 4 monoclonal antibodies for the first 4 weeks of life led to a significant and long-term protection against spontaneous occurrence of insulitis and diabetes. The same treatment failed to inhibit lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands (sialadenitis). This tissue-specific inhibition of inflammation may be attributed to differences between the pancreas and salivary gland in their expression of endothelial ligands for L-selectin (peripheral vascular addressin) and for integrin alpha 4 (mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1). Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 is highly expressed by vessels within the inflamed islets but was not detected in the salivary glands. In contrast, peripheral vascular addressin- and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1-expressing vessels can be found in almost every area of inflammation within the salivary glands but are seen in only 40-50% of inflamed islets. Anti-L-selectin and anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment had no demonstrable effect on anti-beta-cell autoimmunity or on the immune responses to foreign antigens. Therapeutic treatment with anti-L-selectin after the onset of insulitis from 10 to 14 weeks of age delayed the onset but failed to prevent spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, whereas anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment resulted in a significant and long-lasting suppression of the disease. These data strongly suggest that integrin alpha 4 plays a prominent role in the spontaneous development of insulitis and diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice.

Selective homing of autoreactive lymphocytes to the pancreatic islets of Langerhans is essential for triggering the cascade of molecular and cellular interactions which culminate in the specific destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells. Based upon the sequential multistep model of lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelium, we investigated the possibility of preventing the progression of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) by selectively blocking L-selectin and alpha 4-integrin homing receptors, which function at different stages of the adhesion process. Treatment of NOD mice with mAb specific for L-selectin or alpha 4-integrin resulted in a significant inhibition of lymphocytic infiltration (insulitis). Both spontaneous development and acute transfer of IDDM were completely prevented by administration of anti-alpha 4-integrin antibody and partially inhibited by anti-L-selectin antibody. The protective effect was of long duration. Interestingly, the autoimmune T cell responses to a panel of beta cell autoantigens and the lymphocytic infiltration of salivary glands (sialadenitis) appeared unaffected by anti-L-selectin or anti-alpha 4-integrin treatment. These data suggest that prevention of lymphocyte homing to the pancreatic islets may provide a selective target for prevention/treatment of IDDM in patients.

We used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model to evaluate the effect of a hydroxamate matrix metalloprotease inhibitor (GM 6001) on inflammatory demyelination. A single dose of the inhibitor, given intraperitoneally, provided sufficient levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of animals with EAE to induce at least a partial inhibition of the gelatinase activity in the cerebrospinal fluid. When administered daily either from the time of disease induction or from the onset of clinical signs, GM 6001 suppressed the development or reversed clinical EAE in a dose-dependent way, respectively. Animals returned to the same clinical course as the nontreated group after cessation of treatment. Animals treated from the onset of clinical signs had normal permeability of the blood-brain barrier, compared with the enhanced permeability in nontreated animals. These results indicate that matrix metalloprotease inhibition can reverse ongoing EAE. This effect appears to be mediated mainly through restoration of the damaged blood-brain barrier in the inflammatory phase of the disease, since, the degree of demyelination and inflammation did not differ between the treatment groups.

J., Brocke, S., Ling, N., Steinman, L. An immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), VHFFKNIVTPRTP (p87-99), is a major target of T cells in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). T cells found in EAE lesions bear the same amino acids in the third complementary determining region of the T cell receptor (TCR) as those found in MS lesions. We analyzed the trimolecular interactions between MBP p87-99, class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and TCR, and designed soluble inhibitors for therapy. F, N, I, and V at positions 90, 92, 93, and 94 interact with MHC, whereas K, T, and P at positions 91, 95, and 96 interact with TCR. The peptides, p87-99[95T > A] and p87-99[96P > A] could compete more effectively with p87-99 for binding to MHC and could antagonize the in vitro response to T cells to p87-99 more effectively than p87-99[91K > A]. However, only p87-99[91K > A] prevented and reversed EAE, indicating that the extent of MHC or TCR competition does not predict success in treating EAE. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of EAE, draining lymph node cells from rats immunized with the native peptide alone or together with each of the three TCR antagonists were challenged in vitro with p87-99. Administration of p87-99[91K > A], but not p87-99 [95T > A] or p87-99[96P > A], reduced the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha and interferon (IFN) gamma. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are two cytokines that are critical in the pathogenesis of EAE and MS.

A., Allegretta, M., Steinman, L., Sriram, S. Characterization of T cells responding to autoantigens is central to understanding autoimmune disease. We have used somatic mutation at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene as an index of T-cell amplification in vivo. With this strategy we previously showed that myelin basic protein-reactive T cells can be isolated only from the HPRT mutant T-cell population cultured from the peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis patients and not from normal individuals. In this study, 165 HPRT mutant and 104 wild-type clones were examined for their reactivity to myelin basic protein and overlapping peptides of myelin basic protein. Five HPRT mutant clones that recognized myelin basic protein and myelin basic protein peptides along with three clones that responded to myelin basic protein peptide alone were isolated. All but one of the eight clones recognized peptides derived from the carboxy terminus of myelin basic protein (p84-168). Sequence analysis showed heterogeneous expression of T-cell receptor V alpha and V beta genes and CDR3s. These studies showed that in vivo amplified autoimmune T cells from patients with long-standing disease use diverse T-cell receptor elements in the recognition of C-terminal myelin basic protein peptides.

Despite the prolonged depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, no opportunistic infections occurred. Only 1 patient had a possible allergic reaction. Most patients were clinically stable, but a few progressed. We conclude that repeated treatment with cM-T412 is effective in reducing the number of circulating CD4 lymphocytes and has no limiting side effects.

J., Howell, M. D., Smith, L. R., Martin, R., McFarland, H. F., Sriram, S., Brostoff, S., Steinman, L. The selection of T cell clones with mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene has been used to isolate T cells reactive to myelin basic protein (MBP) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These T cell clones are activated in vivo, and are not found in healthy individuals. The third complementarity determining regions (CDR3) of the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains are the putative contact sites for peptide fragments of MBP bound in the groove of the HLA molecule. The TCR V gene usage and CDR3s of these MBP-reactive hprt-T cell clones are homologous to TCRs from other T cells relevant to MS, including T cells causing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and T cells found in brain lesions and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients. In vivo activated MBP-reactive T cells in MS patients may be critical in the pathogenesis of MS.

Brocke, S., VEROMAA, T., Weissman, I. L., Gijbels, K., Steinman, L. The association of infection with autoimmune diseases is enigmatic, partly because cause and effect are difficult to establish in chronic diseases. Microorganisms might initiate multiple sclerosis and trigger relapses of disease. Superantigens might be involved in autoimmunity through the (re)activation of T cells, including autoreactive cells, expressing certain T cell receptor beta chain variable regions. LUPUS-PRONE MICE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ORGAN-SPECIFIC AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE, EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS Zamvil, S. S., ALSabbagh, A., Nelson, P. A., Kaul, D., STCHARLES, M., Mitchell, D. J., Steinman, L., Weiner, H. L., Kuchroo, V. K. Immunization with the multideterminant autoantigen myelin basic protein (MBP) causes experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease that serves as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). MBP peptides Ac1-11 and p35-47 induce potent EAE in mice of the H-2u haplotype. T cells specific for Ac1-11 predominantly utilize one T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta gene segment, V beta 8.2. All T-cell clones and hybridomas analyzed, regardless of TCR V beta usage, utilize D beta 2 and J beta 2 elements. The NZW mouse strain (H-2z), which contributes to the spontaneous 'lupus-like' illness in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, has a genomic deletion encompassing D beta 2 and J beta 2 gene segments. The NZW strain expresses class II (I-A and I-E) genes which share identical sequences with H-2u class II. We investigated whether these strains are susceptible to EAE induced with intact MBP and known encephalitogenic MBP peptides. In vitro analysis demonstrated that NZW antigen-presenting cells (APC) can present MBP and MBP peptide Ac1-11 to an encephalitogenic T-cell clone derived from an H-2u mouse, confirming the functional identity of NZW class-II (I-A) molecules with their respective H-2u class-II gene products. In vivo results demonstrated that NZW and (NZB x NZW)F1 mice are susceptible to EAE induced with intact MBP and Ac1-11. MBP p35-47 caused EAE in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, which express alleles for both the normal (NZB) TCR beta-gene locus, and the abnormal (NZW) TCR beta-gene locus containing the J beta 2 deletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) View details for A HIPPOCAMPAL PROTEIN ASSOCIATED WITH PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC SYNDROME AND SMALL-CELL LUNG-CARCINOMA BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS Sakai, K., GOFUKU, M., Kitagawa, Y., Ogasawara, T., Hirose, G., Yamazaki, M., Koh, C. S., Yanagisawa, N., Steinman, L. A hippocampal 38 kd autoantigen recognized by an autoantibody from the serum of a patient with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) was isolated by screening a human hippocampal cDNA library. The 1,991-nucleotide ple21 clone was obtained and the deduced 350-residue protein encoded by the ple21 cDNA clone was found to be highly homologous to the neuron-specific RNA recognition motifs (RRMs)-containing proteins. The homologies were confined to the RRMs and the RRM connecting region. The presence of RRM in the antigenic protein may be important in the pathogenesis of SCLC-associated paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome.

W., Hodgkinson, S., Mehta, R., Siegel, R. C., Mitchell, D. J., Lim, M., Piercy, C., Tram, T., Dorfman, L., ENZMANN, D., Steinman, L. We conducted an open trial of cM-T412, a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody, in 29 patients with MS. This antibody caused a prompt and long-lasting depletion of circulating CD4 (helper/inducer) lymphocytes. The mean (+/- SE) CD4 count for the group decreased from 870 (+/- 66) cells/mm3 at baseline to 76 (+/- 11) 3 hours after treatment, and then increased to 425 (+/- 38) at 1 month after treatment and 475 (+/- 39) at 6 months after treatment. Numbers of CD8 (cytotoxic/suppressor) lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes changed transiently but showed no significant long-term effects. The most common side effects were headache, nausea, myalgia, fever, and tachycardia occurring in the first few hours after treatment. No serious or unexpected infections or other significant adverse effects occurred. Kurtzke EDSS scores remained stable, and MRI scans showed less contrast enhancement 1 week after treatment. We conclude that treatment of MS patients with cM-T412 chimeric anti-CD4 antibody is well tolerated at the doses tested and produces a long-lasting, selective depletion of CD4 lymphocytes.

M., Lock, C. B., Smilek, D. E., Pearson, C. I., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. The precise mechanisms of failure of immunological tolerance to self proteins are not known. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) susceptibility alleles, the target peptides, and T cells with anti-self reactivity must be present to cause autoimmune diseases. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a murine model of a human autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. In EAE, residues 1-11 of myelin basic protein (MBP) are the dominant disease-inducing determinants in PL/J and (PL/J x SJL/J)F1 mice. Here we report that a six-residue peptide (five of them native) of MBP can induce EAE. Using peptide analogues of the MBP-(1-11) peptide, we demonstrate that only four native MBP residues are required to stimulate MBP-specific T cells. Therefore, this study demonstrates lower minimum structural requirements for effective antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules. Many viral and bacterial proteins share short runs of amino acid similarity with host self proteins, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry. Since a six-residue peptide can sensitize MBP-specific T cells to cause EAE, these results define a minimum sequence identity for molecular mimicry in autoimmunity.

Despite intensive research, no other putative ""MS genes"" have been firmly established. The analysis of TCR rearrangements in the brain lesion has helped to identify a major target of the immune response in MS.Understanding the genetic basis for autoimmune demyelination will offer new possibilities for the treatment of this illness.

D., Karin, N., Tisch, R., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial venules in the pancreatic islets is thought to be one of the initial steps in the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It has been suggested that leukocyte adhesion to endothelium is a sequential multistep process involving various different homing receptors. We report here that blocking different homing receptors--namely, L-selectin and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4)--which function during different stages of the adhesion process, by specific monoclonal antibodies inhibits insulitis and prevents diabetes in mice. Moreover, leukocyte attachment to the inflamed vessels within pancreatic sections could be inhibited by anti-L-selectin and anti-VLA-4 antibodies. Interestingly, anti-L-selectin or anti-VLA-4 antibody did not appear to influence the autoimmune response to a panel of pancreatic beta-cell autoantigens. These data suggest that L-selectin and VLA-4 receptors are involved in mediating leukocyte homing to the islets and that intervention of these two adhesion pathways may provide a novel approach for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

CD4 and CD8 were not quantifiable at baseline, became detectable at 5 days after immunization, and increased steadily to a peak during clinical disease. I-A increased after CD4 and CD8, but before onset of disease. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 did not increase until after onset of clinical disease. CD4, CD8, and I-A remained elevated long after recovery from disease. These results suggest that infiltration of CD4 and CD8 cells into the spinal cord and subsequent upregulation of I-A mRNA play an important role in the development of EAE, but reversal of these processes is not necessary for recovery. Upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA does not appear to be important for development of disease.

G., Steinman, L. The role of infection in the pathogenesis of clinical relapses that occur in most autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, remains to be established. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) serves as a model for multiple sclerosis, with episodes of relapsing paralysis. In certain strains of mice, T-lymphocytes expressing the V beta 8 T-cell receptor (TCR) engage the amino-terminal epitope Ac1-11 of myelin basic protein, leading to EAE. The bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activates V beta 8-expressing T cells. Here we show that after immunization with Ac1-11, or after transfer of encephalitogenic T-cell lines or clones reactive to Ac1-11, SEB induces exacerbation or relapses of paralytic disease in mice that are in clinical remission following an initial episode of paralysis, and triggers paralysis in mice with subclinical disease. Tumour necrosis factor has a critical role in the mechanism underlying SEB-induced exacerbation of disease, because anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody given in vivo delays the onset of paralysis triggered by SEB. On reactivation of autoaggressive cells through their T-cell receptor, superantigens may induce clinical relapses of autoimmune disease.

In this study we analyzed the usage frequencies of the TCR V-gene segments by alpha beta+ T cells present in synovial fluid of 17 patients with chronic arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis. The results of this study, obtained from semiquantitative PCR analyses, showed that in all patients most of the TCR V alpha- and V beta-gene segments could be detected both in fresh PBMCs and in fresh SFMCs. The relative frequencies of use of these V-region genes were variable between the different patients. Although there was some skewing of increased usage frequencies of particular TCR V alpha and V beta genes among SFMC-derived TCRs when compared with PBMCs, we could not correlate such increased TCR V-gene usage with the inflammation in the joints as a disease-specific marker. View details for GAMMA-DELTA T-CELL RECEPTOR REPERTOIRE IN BRAIN-LESIONS OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS Hvas, J., Oksenberg, J. R., Fernando, R., Steinman, L., Bernard, C. C. The identification of activated T cells in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that these cells are critical in the pathogenesis of this disease. Recently we have used the PCR method to analyse rearrangements of V alpha and V beta genes of the T cell receptor (TCR) in samples of MS and control brains. The results of these studies showed that TCR V gene usage in MS brains may be restricted and in particular that V beta genes may be preferentially rearranged in certain HLA haplotypes associated with susceptibility to MS. In view of the recent evidence that T lymphocytes bearing the gamma delta chains may have autoreactive potential, we have assessed whether or not such TCR-bearing lymphocytes were also present in chronic MS lesions. TCR V gamma and V delta were analysed by the PCR method using a panel of V gamma and V delta primers paired with C gamma or C delta primers in 12 MS brains, as well as in brain samples of ten normal post-mortem cases and three neurological controls. TCR V gamma-C gamma and V delta-C delta rearrangements were confirmed using Southern blotting and hybridisation of the PCR products with specific C gamma and C delta probes. Only one to four rearranged TCR V gamma and V delta transcripts were detected in each of the 23 brain samples obtained from 12 MS patients, with the majority of gamma delta T cells expressing the V gamma 2 and V delta 2 chains. In marked contrast, V gamma and V delta transcripts could only be found in one of the ten non-neurological control brains analysed. To assess the clonality of V gamma 2 and V delta 2 T cell receptor chains in the brain samples of MS patients, we have sequenced the junctional regions of the TCR V gamma-N-J gamma-C gamma and V delta-N-D delta-N-J delta-C delta segments amplified from brain tissues, CSF and spleens of two MS patients and from the spleen of two control subjects. The sequence analysis obtained so far shows no compelling evidence of an MS specific expansion of one or more clones expressing particular types of gamma delta T cell receptors. In contrast, a clonal expansion of a different population of TCR gamma delta-bearing T cells was found in the spleen of both an MS patient and one of the control individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for CLONAL ANALYSIS OF INVIVO ACTIVATED CD8+ CYTOTOXIC T-LYMPHOCYTES FROM A MELANOMA PATIENT RESPONSIVE TO ACTIVE SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY KANMITCHELL, J., Huang, X. Q., Steinman, L., Oksenberg, J. R., Harel, W., Parker, J. W., Goedegebuure, P. S., Darrow, T. L., Mitchell, M. S. To study in vivo activated cytolytic T cells, CD8+ T cells clones were isolated from a melanoma patient (HLA A2, A11) treated with active specific immunotherapy for 5 years. CD8+ T lymphocytes, purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, were cloned directly from the peripheral blood without antigen-presenting cells in the presence of irradiated autologous melanoma cells and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4. These conditions were inhibitory to de novo in vitro immunization. Of the 28 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones, 21 lysed the autologous melanoma cell line (M7) but not the autologous lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL-7) nor the two melanoma cell line, M1 (HLA A28) and M2 (HLA A28, A31), used to immunize the patient. The remaining 7 clones were also melanoma-specific, although their reactivities were broader, lysing several melanoma cell lines but not HLA-matched lymphoblastoid cells. Eight clones from the first group, ostensibly self-MHC-restricted, were expanded for further analysis. All expressed cluster determinants characteristic of mature, activated T cells, but not those of thymocytes, naive T cells, B cells or natural killer (NK) cells. They also expressed CD13, a myeloid marker. Of the 8 clones, 3 expressed both CD4 and CD8, but dual expression was not correlated with specificity of lysis. Two CD8+ and 2 CD4+ CD8+ clones were specific for the autologous melanoma cells, the other 4 were also reactive against other HLA-A2-positive melanomas. Cytotoxicity for both singly and doubly positive clones was restricted by HLA class I but not class II antigens. Analysis of the RNA expression of the T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta gene segments revealed heterogeneous usage by the A2-restricted clones and, perhaps, also by the broadly melanoma-specific clones. Apparent TCR-restricted usage was noted for the self-MHC-restricted clones; 2 of the 4 expressed the V alpha 17/V beta 7 dimer. Since the T cell clones were derived from separate precursors of circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), the V alpha 17/V beta 7 TCR was well represented in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of this patient. In summary, we show that melanoma cells presented their own antigens to stimulate the proliferation of melanoma-reactive CD8+ CTL. CTL with a range of melanoma specificities and different TCR alpha beta dimers were encountered in this patient, perhaps as a result of hyperimmunization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for T-CELL RECEPTOR GENE USAGE OF ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR-SPECIFIC T-HELPER CELLS Melms, A., Oksenberg, J.

In this study of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein-induced uveitis, TCR V beta usage was studied using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of transcripts derived directly from ocular tissues and from T cell lines obtained from the spleen. Specific V beta 5' primers from the major murine TCR V beta families were coupled with a common 3' primer from the V beta C region. Amplification of rearranged TCR V beta-D beta-J beta-C beta sequences was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. In ocular tissue from sensitized mice, TCR V beta expression was limited mainly to one to three V beta families, with predominant expression of V beta 2, V beta 12, and V beta 15. In most animals there was similar, albeit limited, TCR gene usage in both the recognition of autoantigen in uveitogenic T cell lines and at the site of inflammation in the eye. Identification of a limited TCR V beta repertoire in Ag-reactive T cell lines correlated with TCR usage at the target site of autoimmune expression. The gene products of the restricted TCR V beta rearrangements found in lesions and in the cell lines may serve as the target for selective immunotherapy.

P., Steinman, L. The diversity of Ag-specific receptors on T cells homing to an inflammatory infiltrate in the central nervous system has been analyzed. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, was induced in Lewis rats with a CD4+, CD8- T cell line specific for peptide 68-86 of myelin basic protein. Within the line a wide array of TCR V beta genes was transcribed including the V beta 8, V beta 10, V beta 15, V beta 16, and V beta 19 families. Accumulation of T cells at the site of inflammation was determined by using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of rearranged TCR V beta transcripts derived from brain. By 8 to 10 h after i.p. infusion of the pathogenic T cell line, TCR V beta transcripts, including mainly V beta families that were predominantly rearranged by the line, could be identified in brains. Restricted TCR V gene transcripts with predominance of the V beta 8 family were identified in brain 48 h after injection, before onset of disease. Paralysis was apparent by 4 to 5 days after injection. At this time diverse V beta gene transcripts were detected in brain, reaching a maximum by day 9, when paralyzed rats have recovered. By day 14 a second stage of limited heterogeneity in the T cell infiltrate could be identified with predominant expression of V beta 8, V beta 9, V beta 10, and V beta 19. Interestingly, three out of these four V beta families were predominantly expressed within the encephalitogenic line. Thus, T cell migration to brain in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is characterized by a rapid penetration of T cells followed by a selective trapping of T cells before the clinical manifestations of disease. When clinical disease was present the T cell infiltrate was diverse, whereas in the post-acute phase of disease the T cells in the central nervous system had limited heterogeneity with selective accumulation of T cells transcribing the same V regions that were detected in the line that incited disease.

Transcription of V beta genes was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on RNA extracted from spinal cord, and expression of the V beta gene products was detected by immunohistochemistry with mAb specific for various V beta proteins. Multiple V beta genes were found to be transcribed and expressed in the central nervous system starting 7 days after immunization, and continuing up to 3 wk after clinical recovery. Preferential utilization of a single TCR V beta gene was not detected in the central nervous system at any time in the course of disease.

C., ALLSUP, A., SODERBERG, C., Anzola, J., Freitas, V., Turck, C., Steinman, L., Peltz, G. Forty-three CD3+4+8- TCR alpha beta+ Borrelia burgdorferi-reactive T cell clones isolated from the peripheral blood of a single patient with clinically active chronic Lyme arthritis were characterized. The spirochetal Ag recognized by 16 of these T cell clones was determined by reactivity with a panel of recombinant spirochetal Ag, which included the OspA, OspB, flagellin, Hsp60 and Hsp70 proteins. All three T cell clones reactive with heat shock proteins recognized a non-cross-reactive epitope unique to the spirochetal Ag. Analysis of the TCR V regions revealed preferential usage of V beta 5.1; 5 of 15 T cell clones that recognized an unidentified spirochetal Ag utilized this V beta gene segment. Most of the T cell clones recognized a given spirochetal Ag exclusively within the context of one HLA class II allele. However, two T cell clones, which recognized an unidentified Ag in the spirochetal lysate within the context of different HLA class II alleles, were both TCR V beta 5.1+, although each displayed a distinct alpha-chain. Moreover, in vitro incubation of this patient's PBMC with B. burgdorferi Ag resulted in a specific increase in the percentage of T cells expressing TCR V beta 5.1. These results indicate that B. burgdorferi has a V beta-selective factor influencing the cellular immune response in a patient with clinically active Lyme disease.

It has been demonstrated that the administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in mice leads to unresponsiveness in V beta 8+ T cells in vivo which are the same T cells that could be stimulated in vitro by this enterotoxin. We present here data on the effect of SEB administration in DBA/2 and (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice on their T cell response to two different T cell determinants, the responses against which are dominated by the use of V beta 8+ T cells. Treatment of mice with SEB not only diminished their primary T cell proliferative response to these determinants, but also was able to effectively reduce the memory T cell response. SEB treatment, however, showed only a modest effect in preventing Ac 1-11-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in H-2u mice.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in which a restricted cellular immune response has been observed. In order to establish whether such T cell responses are likely to be antigen-specific particularly with regard to myelin basic protein (MBP), we analysed T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements directly from MS brain plaques, using the polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed messenger RNA, and compared these with TCR of previously described MBP-specific T cell clones from MS and the rat model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Rearranged V beta 5.2 genes were detected in the brains of all patients who were HLA DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401. The V beta 5.2-D beta-J beta sequences in these MS brain plaques revealed five motifs. One of the common motifs was identical to that described for the VDJ region of a V beta 5.2 T-cell clone. This clone was from an MS patient who was HLA DRB1*1501, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401, and it was cytotoxic towards targets containing the MBP peptide 89-106 (ref. 1). The deduced amino-acid sequence of this VDJ rearrangement, Leu-Arg-Gly, has also been described in rat T cells cloned from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis lesions, which are specific for MBP peptide 87-99 (ref. 2). VDJ sequences with specificity for this MBP epitope constitute a large fraction (40%) of the TCR V beta 5.2 N(D)N rearrangements in MS lesions. The capacity of rat T cells with these VDJ sequences to cause experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and the prevalence of such sequences in demyelinated human lesions indicate that T cells with this rearranged TCR may be critical in MS.

Most other amino acid side chains in the Ac1-11 peptide are essentially irrelevant for T cell stimulation and for disease induction. Further analysis revealed that binding to A alpha uA beta u occurred with a peptide that consists mainly of alanines and only three of the original residues of Ac1-11. Moreover, when used as a coimmunogen with MBP Ac1-11, this peptide inhibited EAE. The finding that a specific in vivo response can be generated by a peptide containing only five native residues provides evidence that disease-inducing TCRs recognize only a very short sequence of the MHC-bound peptide.

O. Expression of the lymphokine genes in human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma, one neuroblastoma cell line and 4 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). mRNA transcripts of neither IL-1 nor IL-3, the biological activities of which were observed in rat primary cultured astrocytes, could be detected within these cell lines. Two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U138 and U373, expressed IL-6 genes. IL-8 gene was detected within U87, U138, U251, U373 glioma cells. After stimulation with IL-1 beta, all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell line expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma specimens. The result shows that three out of four glioma specimens expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-6 or IL-8 may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the central nervous system. [An analysis of lymphokine gene expression within astrocytoma]. The profile of lymphokines secreted by 14 T cell clones and 24 T cell lines reactive with Yersinia Ag isolated from the synovial fluid cells of two HLA-B27+ patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis was characterized. In response to Ag-specific or -nonspecific stimulation, all of the Yersinia-reactive T cell clones and lines had a pattern of lymphokine secretion resembling that of murine (Th1) cells. A total of 50% of T cell lines and clones randomly isolated from a reactive arthritis patient, without prior in vitro stimulation with Yersinia Ag, also exhibited a Th1-like profile of cytokine secretion upon nonspecific activation. This indicates that the selective expansion of this subset of T cells had already occurred in vivo. The possibility that the predominance of Th1-like T cells was an artefact generated by the T cell cloning procedure was excluded; 50% of the randomly isolated T cell clones and lines produced IL-4, IL-5, or both cytokines upon nonspecific activation. These results indicate that Yersinia Ag selectively activate a Th1-like subset of T cells in patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis. Accumulation of such cells in the synovial tissue of patients with reactive arthritis may play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory neurologic disease initiated by myelin basic protein-reactive CD4+ T cells, which are restricted by a particular MHC class II molecule. Recent studies have utilized inhibitor peptides that bind to restricting MHC class II molecules in order to inhibit EAE, presumably by means of competing with encephalitogenic epitopes. However, these studies leave open the possibility of alternative explanations, such as Ag-specific nonresponsiveness and immunodominance. In order to demonstrate that competition for MHC binding alone can inhibit EAE, the inhibitor peptide should ideally be structurally unrelated and nonimmunogenic yet physically associate with the MHC class II molecule. In this study, we show that the OVA-323-339 peptide, which is unrelated to the disease-inducing peptide, binds to A alpha uA beta u. However, although OVA-323-339 is extremely immunogenic in A alpha dA beta d-expressing BALB/c mice, it is nonimmunogenic in (PL/J x SJL)F1 and PL/J mice expressing A alpha uA beta u. When administered as a coimmunogen with Ac1-11, OVA-323-339 inhibited induction of EAE in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice. Myelin basic protein-89-101, which does not bind A alpha uA beta u, had no effect on the disease process. This study provides evidence that MHC class II binding alone can modulate the induction of EAE. The use of a nonimmunogenic non-self peptide to modulate an autoimmune disease minimizes the potential complications of immunodominance or alternative regulatory mechanisms associated with immunogenic peptide therapies and further confirms the MHC-blocking model of immunosuppression.

E., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Applications of PCR have revolutionized the field of immunogenetics particularly in studies of human leukocyte antigen class II polymorphism and more recently in the analysis of T cell receptor usage. The diversity of the variable region of the T cell receptor, however, has made it difficult to amplify the complete repertoire of T cell receptor transcripts. We have chosen to address this problem through the design of oligonucleotide primers specific for each of the known V alpha- and V beta-region T cell receptor families in order to characterize the T cell receptor repertoire. Using nonradioactive probes labeled with horse radish peroxidase, the system presented here allows for the rapid elucidation of the T cell receptor repertoire expressed in cells or tissue samples, such as those derived from autoimmune lesions. The identification of the T cell receptor repertoire involved in a pathogenic process can have therapeutic implications given the success of reversing experimental autoimmune disorders by directing specific forms of immunotherapy against V region gene products.

Expression of T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta genes in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within human malignant brain tumor was examined. Primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families were used to analyze TCRV-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements in TILs in 8 human malignant glioma specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we detected limited TCR variable region, V alpha gene expression in malignant glial tumors and also V alpha 7 and V alpha 12 TCR genes were preferentially expressed. Usage of TCR V beta gene was not as restricted as in TCR V alpha. These TILs expressing a limited repertoire of TCRs might be isolated, expanded, and used therapeutically for treatment of malignant brain tumors.

Gene delivery by transplantation of normal myoblasts has been proposed as a treatment of the primary defect, lack of the muscle protein dystrophin, that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal human muscle degenerative disorder. To test this possibility, we transplanted normal myoblasts from a father or an unaffected sibling into the muscle of eight boys with DMD, and assessed their production of dystrophin. Three patients with deletions in the dystrophin gene expressed normal dystrophin transcripts in muscle biopsy specimens taken from the transplant site one month after myoblast injection. Using the polymerase chain reaction we established that the dystrophin in these biopsies derived from donor myoblast DNA. These results show that transplanted myoblasts persist and produce dystrophin in muscle fibres of DMD patients.

G., Steinman, L., Blau, H. M. Applications of the polymerase chain reaction have revolutionized the field of immunogenetics, particularly in studies of human leukocyte antigen class II polymorphism, and more recently in the analysis of T-cell receptor usage. However, the enormous diversity and variability of the T-cell receptor complex have made the amplification of the complete repertoire difficult. Several methods have been devised to address this problem. Each system is described with recent examples of its use and an assessment of its advantages and disadvantages. The use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction in T-cell receptor analysis is also discussed. The elucidation of the T-cell repertoire involved in a pathogenic process can have therapeutic implications, given the success of reversing experimental autoimmune disorders by directing specific forms of immunotherapy against V region gene products. View details for THE POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION FOR DETECTION OF T-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION The interaction of the immunodominant pertussis toxin peptide containing residues 30-42 (p30-42) with soluble DR1 molecules and the T-cell receptor (TCR) of 12 DR1-restricted human T-cell clones has been analyzed. Peptide analogues of p30-42 containing single alanine substitutions were used in DR1-binding and T-cell proliferation assays to identify the major histocompatibility complex and TCR contact residues. Each T-cell clone was found to recognize p30-42 with a different fine specificity. However, a common core comprising amino acids 33-39 was found to be important for stimulation of all T-cell clones. Within this core two residues, Leu33 and Leu36, interact with the DR1 molecule, whereas Asp34, His35, Thr37, and Arg39 are important for TCR recognition in most of the clones. Computer modeling of the structure of p30-42 showed that an alpha-helical conformation is compatible with the experimental data. The analysis of TCR rearrangement revealed that the peptide was recognized by T-cell clones expressing different variable region alpha (V alpha) and variable region beta (V beta) chains, although a preferential use of V alpha 8-V beta 13 and V alpha 11-V beta 18 combinations was found in clones from the same donor. Understanding the details of the interaction of antigenic peptides with the major histocompatibility complex and TCR molecules should provide the theoretical basis to design T-cell epitopes and obtain more immunogenic vaccines.

T., DiTommaso, A., Domenighini, M., Censini, S., Tagliabue, A., Oksenberg, J. R., Steinman, L., Judd, A. K., OSULLIVAN, D., Rappuoli, R. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory condition of the central nervous system with similarities to multiple sclerosis. In both diseases, circulating leukocytes penetrate the blood-brain barrier and damage myelin, resulting in impaired nerve conduction and paralysis. We sought to identify the adhesion receptors that mediate the attachment of circulating leukocytes to inflamed brain endothelium in EAE, because this interaction is the first step in leukocyte entry into the central nervous system. Using an in vitro adhesion assay on tissue sections, we found that lymphocytes and monocytes bound selectively to inflamed EAE brain vessels. Binding was inhibited by antibodies against the integrin molecule alpha 4 beta 1, but not by antibodies against numerous other adhesion receptors. When tested in vivo, anti-alpha 4 integrin effectively prevented the accumulation of leukocytes in the central nervous system and the development of EAE. Thus, therapies designed to interfere with alpha 4 beta 1 integrin may be useful in treating inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis.

C., SANCHEZMADRID, F., Steinman, L., Karin, N. Anti-I-A antibodies, administered in vivo at the time of S-antigen injection, suppress development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in Lewis rats. While the effects of anti-I-A are profound, the exact mechanism for this suppression is unknown. We attempted adoptive transfer of this form of suppression by injecting lymphocytes from anti-I-A-treated animals into syngeneic recipients which were later injected with S-antigen. Histologically, globes of 75% of the anti-I-A-treated animals showed no inflammation while 25% of these animals developed mild uveitis. In the group of animals which were injected with S-antigen and also received spleen cells from anti-I-A-treated rats, only 1 showed mild uveitis while the remaining 7 had no inflammation. The animals undergoing adoptive transfer of spleen cells and which were primed with an irrelevant antigen, readily developed uveitis. Suppression of S-antigen-induced EAU was abrogated by pretreatment of donor animals with cyclophosphamide. In vitro studies revealed that spleen cells of S-antigen-primed, anti-I-A-treated donors specifically suppressed lymphocyte responses to S-antigen. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that generation of antigen-specific suppressor cells play a role in the anti-I-A immunotherapy of EAU.

View details for ASSOCIATION OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS WITH TCR GENES With the aim of investigating the distribution of T cells expressing different T-cell receptors (TCR) in the inflamed synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients, we have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify TCR V alpha and V beta transcripts from synovial biopsies obtained by arthroscopy from patients with arthritis of variable duration. From each of nine patients a single biopsy was taken. Southern hybridization analysis of amplified products revealed extensive heterogeneity of TCR V beta in most patients. On the other hand, restriction in V alpha gene expression was seen in several patients. A highly restricted V alpha repertoire was observed in all cases with arthritis of short duration. In addition, two of three samples of short duration yielded a more limited number of V beta transcripts than the others. No conformity was, however, seen in usage of individual V alpha and V beta transcripts among the investigated patients. The present data thus demonstrate variability in synovial TCR expression between rheumatoid arthritis patients, but they also indicate a development towards greater diversity with increasing disease duration, implicating the necessity for careful choice of cases, preferentially selecting for early stages of disease, when further analysing rheumatoid synovial T cells for TCR usage as well as for antigen specificity.

R., Lindblad, S., Gronberg, A., Steinman, L., Klareskog, L. Expression of granulocyte (G) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factor (CSF) genes in human cells of astroglial lineage was studied. Primers for CSFs were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and 8 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM-CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell lines, and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138 MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1 beta + tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The results show that some of the tumor and its surrounding reactive lesions express G- and GM-CSF genes but normal brains do not. The concentration of G- and GM-CSF in supernatants of cultured cells was assessed at the protein level by ELISA. A low level of GM-CSF activity was constitutively present in all astrocytomas. G-CSF was detected in unstimulated U87MG and U138MG and other cell lines could synthesize G-CSF after the stimulation of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha at the level of mRNA. Furthermore, the concentration of CSFs increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta and/or TNF-alpha in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived CSFs may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the brain.

This study has led to novel immunotherapeutic approaches, many of which are based on the administration of synthetic peptides. Since short peptides are understood to be the minimal antigenic units bound by MHC molecules for recognition by T cells, they are attractive experimental tools for finely modulating specific immune responses. It is clear that a large number of defined peptides can dramatically influence the course of EAE. Table IV lists a number of potential mechanisms which may mediate disease prevention. Increasing evidence supports the idea that prevention of autoimmune disease can result from MHC-blockade by peptides which competitively bind to class II molecules. However, for some peptides such as the perplexing partial agonist Ac1-11[4A], the mechanism by which these precisely defined units act is not yet fully understood. Numerous hurdles hinder immediate clinical application of peptide-based immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the knowledge gained by probing experimental autoimmunity with defined peptides promises to inspire original and practical approaches to treating human autoimmune disease. EAE: a model for immune intervention with synthetic peptides. Smilek, D. E., Gautam, A. M., Pearson, C., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Expression of lymphokine genes in the human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and fresh brain specimens by PCR. mRNA transcripts for IL-8 were detected in all neuroglial cells. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The result shows that tumor and cells of the surrounding reactive lesion express IL-8 genes, but it is not expressed in normal brains. Next, the concentration of IL-8 in supernatants of cultured cells was measured quantitatively by a solid phase ELISA assay. IL-8 activity was produced constitutively in all astrocytomas and increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF alpha, in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-8 may take part in neutrophil-mediated inflammation which accompanies infection, degeneration and malignancy in the brain.

Primers for 5 different human cytokine, TNF-alpha, -beta, IFN-gamma, G-CSF and GM-CSF, were used to analyze messenger RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma, one neuroblastoma cell lines and fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U138, U251, U373 MG and IMR32 neuroblastoma cells expressed TNF-alpha genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta (1000 U/ml) all these cell lines expressed TNF-alpha genes. TNF-beta genes could not be detected in these cell lines even in the presence of any cytokine stimuli. We were able to detect expression of IFN-gamma genes within 2 astrocytoma cell lines (U87MG and A172), which interestingly did not show TNF-alpha activity. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM -CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition, we also examined gene expression of these cytokines within 4 human malignant astrocytoma specimens, 2 peritumoral brain and 2 autopsied normal brains. The results show that tumor and surrounding lesions express TNF-alpha (4 of 6), TNF-beta (1/6), IFN-gamma (4/6), G-CSF (3/6) and GM-CSF (5/6) but not normal brains. One tumor specimen also expresses TNF-beta as well as TNF-alpha genes (case 2). From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived cytokines may participate in local immune reactions accompanying glioma in the brain. PROSPECTS FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY DIRECTED TO THE T-CELL RECEPTOR IN HUMAN AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an experimental demyelinating disease of rodents. In (PL/J x SJL) F1 mice, it is induced by immunization with the myelin basic protein peptide Ac1-11. Ac1-11 [4A], a myelin basic protein peptide analog with a single amino acid substitution, (i) binds to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and stimulates encephalitogenic T cells in vitro better than Ac1-11, (ii) is nonimmunogenic and nonencephalitogenic in vivo in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice, (iii) prevents EAE when administered before or at the time of immunization with Ac1-11, and (iv) prevents EAE when administered later, near the time of disease onset. Initial studies suggest that Ac1-11 [4A] does not prevent EAE by competitive inhibition or by activation of regulatory cells. Thus, substitution of a single amino acid in a myelin basic protein peptide confers the capacity to prevent rather than induce EAE, even after peptide-specific encephalitogenic T cells have been activated. View details for [Expression of cytokine genes within astrocytoma cell lines and brain specimens]. Expression of T-cell-receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta genes in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of 29 patients, 15 melanomas and 14 malignant glial tumors (glioma and medulloblastoma), was investigated. The identification and propagation of T cells with anti-tumor reactivity is crucial to the understanding of the human immune response to tumors, which may possibly be useful in the successful implementation of adoptive immunotherapy against cancer. Despite clinical evidence that a more favorable prognosis is associated with the degree of lymphocyte infiltration within a tumor, the actual role of TIL remains uncertain. In order to address this question, we examined the diversity of the RNA transcripts of TCR genes in TILs within 29 specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) method and primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families to analyze TCR V-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements, we detected a limited expression of TCR variable-region V alpha genes of TILs. TCR V beta gene rearrangements were more diverse than those for V alpha. In addition to restricted usage of TCR V alpha genes, preferential expression of V alpha 7 genes was found in 20 out of 29 cases (69%). Predominant usage of V alpha 7 genes was more remarkable in melanoma TILs (14/15) than in glial tumor TILs (6/14). These findings were also confirmed by Southern blot analysis with oligonucleotide probes for the constant (C) region of TCR alpha and beta chains. We suspect that some specific T-cell populations may be directed to antigenic determinants in melanoma cells.

E., Wraith, D. C., Hodgkinson, S., Dwivedy, S., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Expression of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within primary and metastatic melanoma specimens was studied. In order to analyze TCR gene transcription in TILs within these tissues, we analyzed reverse transcribed complementary DNA from mRNA directly from tissues using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified products were confirmed by dot or Southern blot hybridization with C alpha or C beta oligoprobes. First, we investigated the diversity of TCR V alpha and V beta gene usage in human malignant melanoma patients with multiple metastasis. We found in one patient, bearing multiple skin lesions, that the patterns of TCR V alpha and V beta repertoires in different sites of the skin (leg and chest wall) were almost the same. However, in another patient with skin and brain melanomas, different TCR repertoires were presented. Next, we examined the usage of murine TCR V beta genes in TILs within the primary and metastatic sites (liver, lung, and brain) of C57BL/6 mice bearing B16-F10 murine melanoma. The population of TILs in each primary and metastatic site expressed from one to four TCR V beta genes. In each metastatic site, the profile of TCR V beta gene expression was different. A different TCR V beta usage in TILs distributed within metastases of various organs may reflect differences in tumor antigenicity at these sites or may be due to differential homing patterns to these tumors.

T-CELL RECEPTOR V-BETA GENE-EXPRESSION DIFFERS IN TUMOR-INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES WITHIN PRIMARY AND METASTATIC MELANOMA NITTA, T., Bell, R., Okumura, K., Sato, K., Steinman, L. Some investigators have proposed myoblast transfer as a potential therapy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Little is known about the immunobiology of myoblast transplantation. Transplantation rejection is mediated to a large extent by CD8+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class I HLA genes, and by CD4+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class II HLA genes. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is a potent inducer of HLA class II molecules as well as beta 2-microglobulin, which is co-expressed with HLA class I. IFN-gamma may be a critical cytokine involved in graft rejection. We purified human myoblasts by flow cytometry and incubated them in vitro for varying time periods with recombinant human IFN-gamma. The inducibility of HLA-DR and -DP molecules raises a note of caution concerning possible rejection phenomenon which might occur following myoblast transplantation.

To study antitumor immunity in patients with choroidal melanoma, T cells were generated from the peripheral blood of choroidal melanoma patients by mixed lymphocyte/tumor cell culture (MLTC). Because autologous tumors are generally unavailable, an allogeneic choroidal melanoma cell line, OCM-1, was used as the specific stimulus. Lymphocyte cultures from 27 patients were characterized by cell-surface phenotypes, patterns of reactivity towards cells of the melanocytic origin and T-cell-receptor gene usage. Antimelanoma reactivity was found in cell-sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. To analyze this reactivity, sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ cells from a MLTC were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of exogenous interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 as well as irradiated OCM-1. Under these conditions, CD4+ T cells did not proliferate, perhaps because of the absence of antigen-presenting cells. However, CD8+ grew vigorously and 29 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones were isolated. On the basis of their pattern of lysis of OCM-1, a skin melanoma cell line M-7 and its autologous lymphoblastoid cell line LCL-7, the clones were categorized into three groups. Group 1, representing 52% of the clones, lysed all three target cells, and are alloreactive. However, since OCM-1 and M-7 did not share class I antigens, these clones recognized cross-reactive epitope(s) of the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) molecule. Group 2, constituting 28% of the clones, lysed both the ocular and skin melanoma cell lines but not LCL-7, and were apparently melanoma-specific. Unlike classical HLA-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes, these T cells might mediate the lysis of melanoma cells via other ligands or a more degenerate type of HLA restriction. For the latter, the HLA-A2 and -A28 alleles would have to act interchangeably as the restriction element for shared melanoma-associated antigen(s). Group 3, representing only 10% of the T cell clones, was cytotoxic only to OCM-1, but not to M-7 or LCL-7. These clones may recognize antigens unique to ocular melanoma cells. Our data suggest that choroidal melanoma patients can recognize melanoma-associated antigens common to both ocular and cutaneous melanoma cells, and presumbly their autologous tumor. Thus, choroidal melanoma, like its skin counterpart, may be responsive to immunotherapeutic regimens such as active specific or adoptive cellular immunotherapy.

Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T cell mediated model of demyelinating disease that develops as a result of an autoimmune response to the myelin structural antigen, myelin basic protein (MBP). Much information has accumulated on the nature of trimolecular interactions which lead to the activation of self-reactive T lymphocytes in this disorder. Many parallels exist in the etiopathogenesis of EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS). Based upon these similarities selective immunotherapy that targets either class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex or T cell receptor variable region genes will be described for EAE with consideration given to application of these principles in MS.

At the 80-mg dose level, antibody was readily observed in biopsied skin lesions. Although there was coating by antibody of most CD4 positive cells in the blood, there was no significant depletion of CD4 positive cells. Low-level antibody responses against the mouse Ig variable region and human Ig allotypic constant region determinants were observed in several patients, but none were of clinical significance. All but two patients made primary antibody and T-cell proliferative responses to a simultaneously administered foreign protein test antigen. However, there was marked suppression of the mixed lymphocyte reaction. We conclude that at the dose levels studied, a chimeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (1) had some clinical efficacy against mycosis fungoides; (2) was well tolerated; (3) had a low level of immunogenicity; (4) had immediate immunosuppressive effects; and (5) did not induce tolerance to a co-injected antigen.

G., Steinman, L., Majumdar, S., Almada, A., PAVLATH, G. K., Blau, H. M. We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody. Unexpectedly, the transcript of this gene was detected not only in the cerebellum and the brain stem but also in an extraneural tissue, the intestine.

S., Hoppe, R., Abel, E. A., Steinman, L., Berger, R. G., Gaiser, C., Young, G., Bindl, J., Hanham, A., Reichert, T. Over the past decade monoclonal antibodies have been successfully employed in a number of animal models of autoimmune disease. We have used antibodies to the class II gene products of the major histocompatibility complex, the CD4 molecule on helper T cells, and the T-cell receptor. Monoclonal anti-class II antibodies have been administered to treat paralytic disease in the animal model of multiple sclerosis--experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These antibodies not only reverse acute paralytic disease but also decrease the number of relapses in a model of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis when given after the first attack. The advantage of this form of therapy is that it is haplotype specific. In other words, in a heterozygous individual it is possible to block the major histocompatibility gene associated with disease susceptibility while leaving other major histocompatibility gene products free for antigen presentation. Thus, animals given this form of immunotherapy are not significantly immunosuppressed. Antibodies to the CD4 molecule have been equally effective in treating animal models of autoimmunity. We and others have reversed ongoing paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Relapses have been diminished after the administration of anti-CD4. Antibodies to CD4 have been used successfully to treat animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis. Recent trials with anti-CD4 have been successful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The latter trial employed a chimeric human/mouse antibody. Antibodies to the variable region of the T-cell receptor have been employed to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ISOLATION OF A COMPLEMENTARY-DNA CLONE ENCODING AN AUTOANTIGEN RECOGNIZED BY AN ANTINEURONAL CELL ANTIBODY FROM A PATIENT WITH PARANEOPLASTIC CEREBELLAR DEGENERATION Sakai, K., Mitchell, D. J., Tsukamoto, T., Steinman, L. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) was recently reported to be etiologically associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and brain plaques of patients with MS was analyzed for the presence of sequences homologous to the HTLV-I pol gene using the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot techniques. Comparison of DNA amplification patterns between patients with MS, and with control subjects who have other autoimmune conditions, with those in healthy control subjects and with an HTLV-I-infected cell line indicates that HTLV-I pol sequence is not present in the peripheral blood of patients with MS, and that the virus is not active in MS brain plaques.

BMT for Severe Autoimmune Diseases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come The article by Dr. Burt provides an excellent summary of the rationale for using high-dose therapy with autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in patients with severe autoimmune diseases (SADS). The article also describes the approach to BMT adopted by Dr. Burt and colleagues at Northwestern University. Enthusiasm for this form of therapy has been contagious, and numerous US investigators have initiated similar trials, which are outlined in Table 1 of the article. The article by Dr. Burt provides an excellent summary of the rationalefor using high-dose therapy with autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation(BMT) in patients with severe autoimmune diseases (SADS). The article alsodescribes the approach to BMT adopted by Dr. Burt and colleagues at NorthwesternUniversity. Enthusiasm for this form of therapy has been contagious, andnumerous US investigators have initiated similar trials, which are outlinedin Table 1 of the article. In the majority of cases, the initiation of an autoimmune disease requiresboth exposure to an environmental trigger and an underlying genetic predispositionto the disease. As Dr. Burt points out, the likelihood that a regimen ofhigh-dose therapy will lead to prolonged remissions depends on: (1) theimportance of the genetic predisposition for disease development, and (2)the persistence of the environmental trigger. If the triggering environmental stimulus persists and there is an inherentpropensity of the stem cells to produce autoreactive lymphocytes due tothis antigen, there is little chance that a more aggressive form of immunosuppressioncould completely eradicate the disease. In this situation, only a replacementof the defective stem-cell compartment using allogeneic transplantationwould be likely to lead to long-term disease remissions. In contrast, if temporary exposure to an environmental trigger led toautoreactivity, aggressive immunosuppression followed by the replacementof autologous stem cells might be sufficient for long-term control. Evenif the original antigen persists, if this antigen is not presented in amanner capable of initiating an immune response, tolerance could developif a completely naive immune system is allowed to develop under these circumstances. For autologous transplantation to be successful, the reinfusion of alymphocyte-purged product appears to be essential. Animal data suggestthat a threshold dose of immunosuppression is required for curative purposesand that reinfusion of unpurged lymphocytes regenerates disease.[1] Furthermore,early reports from Europe imply that unmanipulated peripheral blood orbone marrow autografts are inadequate, as all of the patients who receivedsuch grafts developed disease recurrence after high-dose chemotherapy.[2]It is entirely possible that the 66 or more, ×10 lymphocytes/kgbody weight reinfused in each of these patients contributed to early diseaserecurrence. In contrast, a patient with systemic sclerosis who was transplantedwith a CD34-selected, T-cell-depleted autograft (0.04 ×10CD3 cells/kg body weight) after conditioning with 200 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide(Cytoxan, Neosar) showed significant disease improvement, although clearlylonger-term follow-up will be required to confirm this effect.[3] Sinceapproaches to remove lymphocytes that have little impact on treatment-relatedtoxicity are available,[4] the theoretical benefit from these purging proceduresseems to be warranted if autologous transplantation is used. As with any procedure or treatment, the decision to implement BMT isbased on an assessment of potential risk vs potential benefit. Althoughthere is evidence that allogeneic transplantation can lead to long-termdisease remissions in patients with aplastic anemia and coincidental autoimmunedisease, given the 20% to 30% treatment-related mortality, it is unlikelythat this approach can be justified for the majority of patients with autoimmunedisease. Since it remains unclear whether allogeneic transplantation will berequired for reversal of human autoimmune diseases, it seems prudent tofirst test its efficacy using the least toxic procedure. Fortunately, therisks related to autologous transplantation have been falling, presumablybecause of improved supportive care and better methods of identifying adequateautografts based on CD34+ cell yields. As an example, autotransplant-relatedmortality was 1.5% in the recently completed 134-patient multicenter trialcomparing CD34- enriched vs unselected autografts in patients with multiplemyeloma. Preliminary evidence suggests that if identical exclusionary criteriaare used to select patients with autoimmune disease, the tolerability ofautotransplantion will be similar.[5] The conditioning regimens chosen by the various centers have been modeledafter programs for the treatment of aplastic anemia. Although the additionof total-body irradiation (TBI) may be more immunosuppressive and seemsto be a rational approach for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) dueto the existence of the blood-brain barrier, the use of radiation may substantiallyincrease short- and long-term toxicity. Radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity may be significant for patientswith systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or systemic sclerosis, who arelikely to have abnormal baseline lung function. The long-term risk forsolid tumor development was also notably increased in a multivariate analysisof aplastic anemia patients treated with TBI instead of antithymocyte globulin(ATG) during allogeneic transplantation (relative risk, 3.9; P less than.05).[6] Finally, whereas 56 of 103 patients recovered ovarian functionafter cyclophosphamide/ATG, almost all of the patients who received irradiationbecame sterile. This latter toxicity may be especially significant forthe population of patients most likely to undergo this type of therapy(young females). In order to address whether TBI is required, a protocol for the treatmentof patients with systemic sclerosis was developed jointly at the Universityof California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center(FHCC). Identical entry criteria and follow-up evaluations are in place,but patients at UCLA will be treated with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg)and ATG (90 mg/kg), while those at FHCC will receive TBI and a lower doseof cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg). Hopefully, sufficient patients will beenrolled at both institutions to permit preliminary efficacy/toxicity comparisons. Dr. Burt does an excellent job of outlining the rationale for subjectingpatients with MS, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or SLE to autologous transplantation.His group identified patients with a significant risk of early mortality--anapproach similar to that taken at UCLA. Consequently, our inclusion criteriafor SLE and RA patients are nearly identical, being based on an estimated5-year mortality 30% or more. We have also defined a cohort of systemic sclerosis patients with asimilar risk of early mortality based on the existence of diffuse skininvolvement (skin score or more 16 using the modified Rodman method) andsignificant heart, lung, or renal dysfunction.[7] Although prolongationof survival is the ultimate goal, quality-of-life improvement may alsobe a valid long-term goal and will be measured in these initial patients. Other autoimmune diseases not mentioned by Dr. Burt and yet potentiallysevere enough to warrant this form of therapy include patients who developa lupus anticoagulant and recurrent thromboembolism while receiving warfarinand patients with severe refractory autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Two Englishpatients with the latter condition are in remission following high-dosecyclophosphamide and peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation.[8] At present, relatively few patients have disease severe enough to warrantBMT. Furthermore, many of these patients will then be excluded from treatmentbecause of excessive irreversible organ damage. If transplants prove successfulfor these initial patients, the entry criteria will be expanded to includeprevention of long-term morbidity, and therefore, will broaden the scopeof this procedure. Unfortunately, the biggest hurdle in initiating these studies at UCLAhas not been the identification of interested and qualified patients, butrather, a financial constraint. As health-care costs have assumed moreimportance, it has become increasingly difficult to investigate new butexpensive forms of therapy. Hopefully, a recently completed agreement betweenthe hospital, clinical research center, and individual insurance companieswill permit the initiation of these studies so that the concept of immuneablation for patients with life-threatening autoimmune disease can be assessed. 1.

Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). “I like to solve medical problems while at the same time communicating what we are doing with individual patients and families.” I was inspired to become a physician because my sister was stricken with polio and remained paralyzed when I was just five years old. That experience motivated me to want to care for people, and lead me to the field of neuroimmunology. I have since discovered a drug for multiple sclerosis, which is FDA approved. I would like to solve other diseases and make them past history, like polio, something we no longer fear. We have three other new drugs in clinical trials for diseases ranging from type 1 diabetes to progressive multiple sclerosis. Stanford University Dept of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 06/30/1974 Stanford University Neurology Residency, Palo Alto, CA, 06/30/1980 Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, 06/30/1976 Neurology, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology Biological Significance of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies: Lessons Learned From Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pathogenic and diagnostic relevance of cellular and humoral immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) and pertinent observations made in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).METHODS: Review of pertinent literature. RESULTS: There is at least 1 precedent for an antibody response against a viral pathogen that fails to provide host protection in the absence of immune-competent CD4+ T cells. PML is an infection of the CNS caused by JC virus (JCV), which commonly occurs during treatment with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody natalizumab. In this context, the humoral immune response fails to prevent JCV reactivation, and elevated anti-JCV serum indices are associated with a higher PML incidence. The more relevant immune-competent cells in host defense against JCV appear to be T cells. T cell-mediated responses are also detectable in convalescing patients with SARS-COV-2 irrespective of the humoral immune response.CONCLUSION: Based on pathogenic lessons learned from PML under natalizumab therapy, we suggest the incorporation of functional assays that determine neutralizing properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In addition, we outline the potential role of T-cell detection assays in determining herd immunity in a given population or in studying therapeutic responses to vaccines. Reduced development of COVID-19 in children reveals molecular checkpoints gating pathogenesis illuminating potential therapeutics. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Steinman, J. B., Lum, F. M., Ho, P. P., Kaminski, N., Steinman, L. The reduced development of COVID-19 for children compared to adults provides some tantalizing clues on the pathogenesis and transmissibility of this pandemic virus. First, ACE2, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor, is reduced in the respiratory tract in children. Second, coronavirus associated with common colds in children may offer some protection, due to cross-reactive humoral immunity and T cell immunity between common coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Third, T helper 2 immune responses are protective in children. Fourth, surprisingly, eosinophilia, associated with T helper 2, may be protective. Fifth, children generally produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, the influence of the downturn in the global economy, the impact of living in quarters among families who are the most at risk, and factors including the openings of some schools, are considered. Those most disadvantaged socioeconomically may suffer disproportionately with COVID-19. A sugar-coated strategy to treat a rare neurologic disease provides a blueprint for a decoy glycan therapeutic and a potential vaccine for CoViD-19: An Editorial Highlight for ""Selective inhibition of anti-MAG IgM autoantibody binding to myelin by an antigen specific glycopolymer""on https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15021. In a rare neurologic disease known as IgM monoclonal gammopathy the immune system targets a sulfated trisaccharide known as the Human Natural Killer-1 (HNK-1) epitope that comprises a constituent of the myelin sheath known as MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein). This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone withmultiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1trisaccharide.This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo--d-glucopyranuronate)-(13)--d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removedanti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic. Autoantibodies against central nervous system antigens in a subset of B cell-dominant multiple sclerosis patients. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Kuerten, S., Lanz, T. V., Lingampalli, N., Lahey, L. J., Kleinschnitz, C., Murer, M., Schroeter, M., Braune, S., Ziemssen, T., Ho, P. P., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with characteristic inflammatory lesions and demyelination. The clinical benefit of cell-depleting therapies targeting CD20 has emphasized the role of B cells and autoantibodies in MS pathogenesis. We previously introduced an enzyme-linked immunospot spot (ELISpot)-based assay to measure CNS antigen-specific B cells in the blood of MS patients and demonstrated its usefulness as a predictive biomarker for disease activity in measuring the successful outcome of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Here we used a planar protein array to investigate CNS-reactive antibodies in the serum of MS patients as well as in B cell culture supernatants after polyclonal stimulation. Anti-CNS antibody reactivity was evident in the sera of the MS cohort, and the antibodies bound a heterogeneous set of molecules, including myelin, axonal cytoskeleton, and ion channel antigens, in individual patients. Immunoglobulin reactivity in supernatants of stimulated B cells was directed against a broad range of CNS antigens. A group of MS patients with a highly active B cell component was identified by the ELISpot assay. Those antibody reactivities remained stable over time. These assays with protein arrays identify MS patients with a highly active B cell population with antibodies directed against a swathe of CNS proteins. Epstein-Barr Virus in Multiple Sclerosis: Theory and Emerging Immunotherapies. Bar-Or, A., Pender, M. P., Khanna, R., Steinman, L., Hartung, H., Maniar, T., Croze, E., Aftab, B. T., Giovannoni, G., Joshi, M. J. New treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) focused on B cells have created an atmosphere of excitement in the MS community. B cells are now known to play a major role in disease, demonstrated by the highly impactful effect of a B cell-depleting antibody on controlling MS. The idea that a virus may play a role in the development of MS has a long history and is supported mostly by studies demonstrating a link between B cell-tropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and disease onset. Efforts to develop antiviral strategies for treating MS are underway. Although gaps remain in our understanding of the etiology of MS, the role, if any, of viruses in propagating pathogenic immune responses deserves attention. Antigen-specific tolerance to self-antigens in protein replacement therapy, gene therapy and autoimmunity. Steinman, L., Ho, P. P., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Villoslada, P. Trials of antigen-specific tolerance have been undertaken in the clinic for over fifty years and the results of these antigen-specific clinical trials are described in this review. Antigen-specific tolerization of the immune system in protein replacement therapy for hemophilia A is an accepted treatment. Clinical trials are ongoing for autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and rheumatoid arthritis with various antigen-specific strategies. Trials for tolerization in celiac disease aim for antigen specific tolerance to gluten, an environmental trigger, which may then halt the progression to autoimmunity targeting a self-antigen, tissue transglutaminase. Although many promising approaches have been demonstrated in pre-clinical models, this review will focus primarily on clinical trials of antigen-specific tolerance that have been taken to the clinic and with initial results reported in the peer reviewed literature. A separate article on approaches with CAR-T cells appears in this volume.

There are adaptive T-cell and antibody autoimmune responses to myelin-derived peptides in multiple sclerosis (MS) and to aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs). Strategies aimed at antigen-specific tolerance to these autoantigens are thus indicated for these diseases. One approach involves induction of tolerance with engineered dendritic cells (tolDCs) loaded with specific antigens. We conducted an in-human phase 1b clinical trial testing increasing concentrations of autologous tolDCs loaded with peptides from various myelin proteins and from AQP4. We tested this approach in 12 patients, 8 with MS and 4 with NMOSD. The primary end point was the safety and tolerability, while secondary end points were clinical outcomes (relapses and disability), imaging (MRI and optical coherence tomography), and immunological responses. Therapy with tolDCs was well tolerated, without serious adverse events and with no therapy-related reactions. Patients remained stable clinically in terms of relapse, disability, and in various measurements using imaging. We observed a significant increase in the production of IL-10 levels in PBMCs stimulated with the peptides as well as an increase in the frequency of a regulatory T cell, known as Tr1, by week 12 of follow-up. In this phase 1b trial, we concluded that the i.v. administration of peptide-loaded dendritic cells is safe and feasible. Elicitation of specific IL-10 production by peptide-specific T cells in MS and NMOSD patients indicates that a key element in antigen specific tolerance is activated with this approach. The results warrant further clinical testing in larger trials. Small Heat Shock Proteins, Amyloid Fibrils, and Nicotine Stimulate a Common Immune Suppressive Pathway with Implications for Future Therapies. Rothbard, J. B., Kurnellas, M. P., Ousman, S. S., Brownell, S., Rothbard, J. J., Steinman, L. The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) is central to the anti-inflammatory function of the vagus nerve in a physiological mechanism termed the inflammatory reflex. Studies on the inflammatory reflex have been instrumental for the current development of the field of bioelectronic medicine. An independent investigation of the biological role of alphaB-crystallin (HspB5), the most abundant gene transcript present in active multiple sclerosis lesions in human brains, also led to alpha7nAChR. Induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in HspB5-/- mice results in greater paralytic signs, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and T-lymphocyte activation relative to wild-type animals. Administration of HspB5 was therapeutic in animal models of multiple sclerosis, retinal and cardiac ischemia, and stroke. Structure-activity studies established that residues 73-92 were as potent as the parent protein, but only when it formed amyloid fibrils. Amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) selectively bound alpha7nAChR on peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) and B lymphocytes, converting the MPhis to an immune suppressive phenotype and mobilizing the migration of both cell types from the peritoneum to secondary lymph organs. Here, we review multiple aspects of this work, which may be of interest for developing future therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis and other disorders. Engineered DNA plasmid reduces immunity to dystrophin while improving muscle force in a model of gene therapy of Duchenne dystrophy. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Ho, P. P., Lahey, L. J., Mourkioti, F., Kraft, P. E., Filareto, A., Brandt, M., Magnusson, K. E., Finn, E. E., Chamberlain, J. S., Robinson, W. H., Blau, H. M., Steinman, L. In gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy there are two potential immunological obstacles. An individual with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has a genetic mutation in dystrophin, and therefore the wild-type protein is ""foreign,"" and thus potentially immunogenic. The adeno-associated virus serotype-6 (AAV6) vector for delivery of dystrophin is a viral-derived vector with its own inherent immunogenicity. We have developed a technology where an engineered plasmid DNA is delivered to reduce autoimmunity. We have taken this approach into humans, tolerizing to myelin proteins in multiple sclerosis and to proinsulin in type 1 diabetes. Here, we extend this technology to a model of gene therapy to reduce the immunogenicity of the AAV vector and of the wild-type protein product that is missing in the genetic disease. Following gene therapy with systemic administration of recombinant AAV6-microdystrophin to mdx/mTRG2 mice, we demonstrated the development of antibodies targeting dystrophin and AAV6 capsid in control mice. Treatment with the engineered DNA construct encoding microdystrophin markedly reduced antibody responses to dystrophin and to AAV6. Muscle force in the treated mice was also improved compared with control mice. These data highlight the potential benefits of administration of an engineered DNA plasmid encoding the delivered protein to overcome critical barriers in gene therapy to achieve optimal functional gene expression. An amyloidogenic hexapeptide derived from amylin attenuates inflammation and acute lung injury in murine sepsis Mahapatra, S., Ying, L., Ho, P., Kurnellas, M., Rothbard, J., Steinman, L., Cornfield, D. N. Although the accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins in neuroinflammatory conditions is generally considered pathologic, in a murine model of multiple sclerosis, amyloid-forming fibrils, comprised of hexapeptides, are anti-inflammatory. Whether these molecules modulate systemic inflammatory conditions remains unknown. We hypothesized that an amylin hexapeptide that forms fibrils can attenuate the systemic inflammatory response in a murine model of sepsis. To test this hypothesis, mice were pre-treated with either vehicle or amylin hexapeptide (20 g) at 12 hours and 6 hours prior to intraperitoneal (i.p.) lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 mg/kg) administration. Illness severity and survival were monitored every 6 hours for 3 days. Levels of pro- (IL-6, TNF-, IFN-) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines were measured via ELISA at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after LPS (i.p.). As a metric of lung injury, pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) barrier function was tested 24 hours after LPS administration by comparing lung wet-to-dry ratios, Evan's blue dye (EBD) extravasation, lung histology and caspase-3 activity. Compared to controls, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide significantly reduced mortality (p<0.05 at 72 h), illness severity (p<0.05), and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, while IL-10 levels were elevated (p<0.05). Amylin pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, as demonstrated by decreased lung water and caspase-3 activity (p<0.05, versus PBS). Hence, in a murine model of systemic inflammation, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide reduced mortality, disease severity, and preserved lung barrier function. Amylin hexapeptide may represent a novel therapeutic tool to mitigate sepsis severity and lung injury. Molecular signature of Epstein-Barr virus infection in MS brain lesions. Moreno, M. A., Or-Geva, N., Aftab, B. T., Khanna, R., Croze, E., Steinman, L., Han, M. H. Objective: We sought to confirm the presence and frequency of B cells and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (latent and lytic phase) antigens in archived MS and non-MS brain tissue by immunohistochemistry.Methods: We quantified the type and location of B-cell subsets within active and chronic MS brain lesions in relation to viral antigen expression. The presence of EBV-infected cells was further confirmed by in situ hybridization to detect the EBV RNA transcript, EBV-encoded RNA-1 (EBER-1).Results: We report the presence of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) in 93% of MS and 78% of control brains, with a greater percentage of MS brains containing CD138+ plasma cells and LMP-1-rich populations. Notably, 78% of chronic MS lesions and 33.3% of non-MS brains contained parenchymal CD138+ plasma cells. EBV early lytic protein, EBV immediate-early lytic gene (BZLF1), was also observed in 46% of MS, primarily in association with chronic lesions and 44% of non-MS brain tissue. Furthermore, 85% of MS brains revealed frequent EBER-positive cells, whereas non-MS brains seldom contained EBER-positive cells. EBV infection was detectable, by immunohistochemistry and by in situ hybridization, in both MS and non-MS brains, although latent virus was more prevalent in MS brains, while lytic virus was restricted to chronic MS lesions.Conclusions: Together, our observations suggest an uncharacterized link between the EBV virus life cycle and MS pathogenesis. Identification of a common immune regulatory pathway induced by small heat shock proteins, amyloid fibrils, and nicotine. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Rothbard, J. B., Rothbard, J. J., Soares, L., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Although certain dogma portrays amyloid fibrils as drivers of neurodegenerative disease and neuroinflammation, we have found, paradoxically, that amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). They reduce clinical paralysis and induce immunosuppressive pathways, diminishing inflammation. A key question was the identification of the target for these molecules. When sHsps and amyloid fibrils were chemically cross-linked to immune cells, a limited number of proteins were precipitated, including the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 NAChR). The alpha7 NAChR is noteworthy among the over 20 known receptors for amyloid fibrils, because it plays a central role in a well-defined immune-suppressive pathway. Competitive binding between amyloid fibrils and alpha-bungarotoxin to peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) confirmed the involvement of alpha7 NAChR. The mechanism of immune suppression was explored, and, similar to nicotine, amyloid fibrils inhibited LPS induction of a common set of inflammatory cytokines while inducing Stat3 signaling and autophagy. Consistent with this, previous studies have established that nicotine, sHsps, and amyloid fibrils all were effective therapeutics in EAE. Interestingly, B lymphocytes were needed for the therapeutic effect. These results suggest that agonists of alpha7 NAChR might have therapeutic benefit for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Blocking immune intrusion into the brain suppresses epilepsy in Rasmussen's encephalitis model Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is a neuroinflammatory disease that typically affects only one hemisphere of the brain, resulting in severe seizures. Sixty years after the disease was first described, the preferred and best treatment option for RE is grotesque and involves removing a hemisphere of the brain (hemispherectomy); therefore, a better understanding of this seizure disorder may provide additional, less invasive therapeutic options. In this issue of the JCI, Carmant and colleagues have developed an animal model of this focal seizure disorder. The model provides experimental insights into the pathogenesis of RE and potential new treatments for this disease.

P., Crotti, A., Bjornson, Z., Prinz, M., Fantl, W. J., Nolan, G. P., Steinman, L. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration may represent two poles of brain pathology. Brain myeloid cells, particularly microglia, play key roles in these conditions. We employed single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to compare myeloid cell populations in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, the R6/2 model of Huntington's disease (HD) and the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We identified three myeloid cell populations exclusive to the CNS and present in each disease model. Blood-derived monocytes comprised five populations and migrated to the brain in EAE, but not in HD and ALS models. Single-cell analysis resolved differences in signaling and cytokine production within similar myeloid populations in EAE compared to HD and ALS models. Moreover, these analyses highlighted alpha5 integrin on myeloid cells as a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation. Together, these findings illustrate how neuropathology may differ between inflammatory and degenerative brain disease. Narcolepsy and influenza vaccination-induced autoimmunity A Journey in Science: The Privilege of Exploring the Brain and the Immune System. Real innovations in medicine and science are historic and singular; the stories behind each occurrence are precious. At Molecular Medicine we have established the Anthony Cerami Award in Translational Medicine to document and preserve these histories. The monographs recount the seminal events as told in the voice of the original investigators who provided the crucial early insight. These essays capture the essence of discovery, chronicling the birth of ideas that created new fields of research; and launched trajectories that persisted and ultimately influenced how disease is prevented, diagnosed, and treated. In this volume, the Cerami Award Monograph is by Lawrence Steinman, MD, of Stanford University in California. A visionary in the field of neurology, this is the story of Dr. Steinman's scientific journey. View details for Obeticholic acid, a synthetic bile acid agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Bile acids are ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The bile acid-FXR interaction regulates bile acid synthesis, transport, and cholesterol metabolism. Recently, bile acid-FXR regulation has been reported to play an integral role in both hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and in atherosclerosis. In this study, we found that FXR knockout mice had more disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Obeticholic acid (6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, 6-ECDCA), a synthetic FXR agonist, is an orally available drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. When we treated mice exhibiting established EAE with 6-ECDCA, or the natural FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), clinical disease was ameliorated by (i) suppressing lymphocyte activation and proinflammatory cytokine production; (ii) reducing CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cell populations and their expression of negative checkpoint regulators programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); (iii) increasing CD8(+) T cells and PD1, PDl-1, and BTLA expression; and (iv) reducing VLA-4 expression in both the T- and B-cell populations. Moreover, adoptive transfer of 6-ECDCA- or CDCA-treated donor cells failed to transfer disease in naive recipients. Thus, we show that FXR functions as a negative regulator in neuroinflammation and we highlight that FXR agonists represent a potential previously unidentified therapy for MS. View details for Amyloid fibrils activate B-1a lymphocytes to ameliorate inflammatory brain disease PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Kurnellas, M. P., Ghosn, E. E., Schartner, J. M., Baker, J., Rothbard, J. J., Negrin, R. S., Herzenberg, L. A., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Amyloid fibrils composed of peptides as short as six amino acids are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reducing paralysis and inflammation, while inducing several pathways of immune suppression. Intraperitoneal injection of fibrils selectively activates B-1a lymphocytes and two populations of resident macrophages (Ms), increasing IL-10 production, and triggering their exodus from the peritoneum. The importance of IL-10-producing B-1a cells in this effective therapy was established in loss-of-function experiments where neither B-cell-deficient (MT) nor IL10(-/-) mice with EAE responded to the fibrils. In gain-of-function experiments, B-1a cells, adoptively transferred to MT mice with EAE, restored their therapeutic efficacy when Amylin 28-33 was administered. Stimulation of adoptively transferred bioluminescent Ms and B-1a cells by amyloid fibrils resulted in rapid (within 60 min of injection) trafficking of both cell types to draining lymph nodes. Analysis of gene expression indicated that the fibrils activated the CD40/B-cell receptor pathway in B-1a cells and induced a set of immune-suppressive cell-surface proteins, including BTLA, IRF4, and Siglec G. Collectively, these data indicate that the fibrils activate B-1a cells and F4/80(+) Ms, resulting in their migration to the lymph nodes, where IL-10 and cell-surface receptors associated with immune-suppression limit antigen presentation and T-cell activation. These mechanisms culminate in reduction of paralytic signs of EAE. Antibodies to influenza nucleoprotein cross-react with human hypocretin receptor 2 Ahmed, S. S., Volkmuth, W., Duca, J., Corti, L., Pallaoro, M., Pezzicoli, A., Karle, A., Rigat, F., Rappuoli, R., Narasimhan, V., Julkunen, I., Vuorela, A., Vaarala, O., Nohynek, H., Pasini, F. L., Montomoli, E., Trombetta, C., Adams, C. M., Rothbard, J., Steinman, L. The sleep disorder narcolepsy is linked to the HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype and dysregulation of the hypocretin ligand-hypocretin receptor pathway. Narcolepsy was associated with Pandemrix vaccination (an adjuvanted, influenza pandemic vaccine) and also with infection by influenza virus during the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic. In contrast, very few cases were reported after Focetria vaccination (a differently manufactured adjuvanted influenza pandemic vaccine). We hypothesized that differences between these vaccines (which are derived from inactivated influenza viral proteins) explain the association of narcolepsy with Pandemrix-vaccinated subjects. A mimic peptide was identified from a surface-exposed region of influenza nucleoprotein A that shared protein residues in common with a fragment of the first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2. A significant proportion of sera from HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype-positive narcoleptic Finnish patients with a history of Pandemrix vaccination (vaccine-associated narcolepsy) contained antibodies to hypocretin receptor 2 compared to sera from nonnarcoleptic individuals with either 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza infection or history of Focetria vaccination. Antibodies from vaccine-associated narcolepsy sera cross-reacted with both influenza nucleoprotein and hypocretin receptor 2, which was demonstrated by competitive binding using 21-mer peptide (containing the identified nucleoprotein mimic) and 55-mer recombinant peptide (first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2) on cell lines expressing human hypocretin receptor 2. Mass spectrometry indicated that relative to Pandemrix, Focetria contained 72.7% less influenza nucleoprotein. In accord, no durable antibody responses to nucleoprotein were detected in sera from Focetria-vaccinated nonnarcoleptic subjects. Thus, differences in vaccine nucleoprotein content and respective immune response may explain the narcolepsy association with Pandemrix. View details for No quiet surrender: molecular guardians in multiple sclerosis brain The brain under immunological attack does not surrender quietly. Investigation of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) reveals a coordinated molecular response involving various proteins and small molecules ranging from heat shock proteins to small lipids, neurotransmitters, and even gases, which provide protection and foster repair. Reduction of inflammation serves as a necessary prerequisite for effective recovery and regeneration. Remarkably, many lesion-resident molecules activate pathways leading to both suppression of inflammation and promotion of repair mechanisms. These guardian molecules and their corresponding physiologic pathways could potentially be exploited to silence inflammation and repair the injured and degenerating brain and spinal cord in both relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MS and may be beneficial in other neurologic and psychiatric conditions. View details for Mechanisms of action of therapeutic amyloidogenic hexapeptides in amelioration of inflammatory brain disease. Kurnellas, M. P., Schartner, J. M., Fathman, C. G., Jagger, A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Amyloid fibrils composed of peptides as short as six amino acids are effective therapeutics for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunosuppression arises from at least two pathways: (1) expression of type 1 IFN by pDCs, which were induced by neutrophil extracellular traps arising from the endocytosis of the fibrils; and (2) the reduced expression of IFN-, TNF, and IL-6. The two independent pathways stimulated by the fibrils can act in concert to be immunosuppressive in Th1 indications, or in opposition, resulting in inflammation when Th17 T lymphocytes are predominant. The generation of type 1 IFN can be minimized by using polar, nonionizable, amyloidogenic peptides, which are effective in both Th1 and Th17 polarized EAE. Immunology of Relapse and Remission in Multiple Sclerosis Eighty percent of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) initially develop a clinical pattern with periodic relapses followed by remissions, called relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). This period of fluctuating disease may last for a decade or more. Clinical relapses reflect acute inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and spinal cord. Often, different anatomic areas in the CNS are involved each time a relapse occurs, resulting in varied clinical manifestations in each instance. Relapses are nearly always followed by some degree of remission, though recovery to baseline status before the flare is often incomplete. There are nine approved drugs for treatment of RRMS. The most potent drug for inhibiting relapses, the humanized anti-4 integrin antibody known as Natalizumab, blocks homing of mononuclear cells to the CNS. The mechanisms of action of the approved drugs for RRMS provide a strong foundation for understanding the pathobiology of the relapse. Despite substantial progress in controlling relapses with the current armamentarium of medications, there is much to learn and ever more effective and safe therapies to develop.

S., Wu, L., Acharya, S., Arac, A., Blaho, V. A., Huang, Y., Moon, B. S., Axtell, R. C., Ho, P. P., Steinberg, G. K., Lewis, D. B., Sobel, R. A., Han, D. K., Steinman, L., Snyder, M. P., Hla, T., Han, M. H. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs into systemic circulation. The sphingosine phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist FTY-720 (Gilenya) arrests immune trafficking and prevents multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. However, alternative mechanisms of S1P-S1P1 signaling have been reported. Phosphoproteomic analysis of MS brain lesions revealed S1P1 phosphorylation on S351, a residue crucial for receptor internalization. Mutant mice harboring an S1pr1 gene encoding phosphorylation-deficient receptors (S1P1(S5A)) developed severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) due to autoimmunity mediated by interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells (TH17 cells) in the peripheral immune and nervous system. S1P1 directly activated the Jak-STAT3 signal-transduction pathway via IL-6. Impaired S1P1 phosphorylation enhances TH17 polarization and exacerbates autoimmune neuroinflammation. These mechanisms may be pathogenic in MS. Plasmid-Encoded Proinsulin Preserves C-Peptide While Specifically Reducing Proinsulin-Specific CD8+ T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes. Roep, B. O., Solvason, N., Gottlieb, P. A., Abreu, J. R., Harrison, L. C., Eisenbarth, G. S., Yu, L., Leviten, M., Hagopian, W. A., Buse, J. B., von Herrath, M., Quan, J., King, R. S., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Garren, H., Steinman, L. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), there is an intense inflammatory response that destroys the cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, the site where insulin is produced and released. A therapy for T1D that targets the specific autoimmune response in this disease while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact, has long been sought. Proinsulin is a major target of the adaptive immune response in T1D. We hypothesized that an engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin (BHT-3021) would preserve cell function in T1D patients through reduction of insulin-specific CD8(+) T cells. We studied 80 subjects over 18 years of age who were diagnosed with T1D within the past 5 years. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive intramuscular injections of BHT-3021 or BHT-placebo, weekly for 12 weeks, and then monitored for safety and immune responses in a blinded fashion. Four dose levels of BHT-3021 were evaluated: 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg. C-peptide was used both as an exploratory efficacy measure and as a safety measure. Islet-specific CD8(+) T cell frequencies were assessed with multimers of monomeric human leukocyte antigen class I molecules loaded with peptides from pancreatic and unrelated antigens. No serious adverse events related to BHT-3021 were observed. C-peptide levels improved relative to placebo at all doses, at 1 mg at the 15-week time point (+19.5% BHT-3021 versus -8.8% BHT-placebo, P < 0.026). Proinsulin-reactive CD8(+) T cells, but not T cells against unrelated islet or foreign molecules, declined in the BHT-3021 arm (P < 0.006). No significant changes were noted in interferon-, interleukin-4 (IL-4), or IL-10 production in CD4 T cells. Thus, we demonstrate that a plasmid encoding proinsulin reduces the frequency of CD8(+) T cells reactive to proinsulin while preserving C-peptide over the course of dosing. Expansion of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells following SIRT1 inactivation in the adult brain. Rafalski, V. A., Ho, P. P., Brett, J. O., Ucar, D., Dugas, J. C., Pollina, E. A., Chow, L. M., Ibrahim, A., Baker, S. J., Barres, B. A., Steinman, L., Brunet, A. Oligodendrocytes-the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system-can be regenerated during adulthood. In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Amyloid Fibrils Composed of Hexameric Peptides Attenuate Neuroinflammation Kurnellas, M. P., Adams, C. M., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. The amyloid-forming proteins tau, B crystallin, and amyloid P protein are all found in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS). Our previous work established that amyloidogenic peptides from the small heat shock protein B crystallin (HspB5) and from amyloid fibrils, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, were therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reflecting aspects of the pathology of MS. To understand the molecular basis for the therapeutic effect, we showed a set of amyloidogenic peptides composed of six amino acids, including those from tau, amyloid A4, major prion protein (PrP), HspB5, amylin, serum amyloid P, and insulin B chain, to be anti-inflammatory and capable of reducing serological levels of interleukin-6 and attenuating paralysis in EAE. The chaperone function of the fibrils correlates with the therapeutic outcome. Fibrils composed of tau 623-628 precipitated 49 plasma proteins, including apolipoprotein B-100, clusterin, transthyretin, and complement C3, supporting the hypothesis that the fibrils are active biological agents. Amyloid fibrils thus may provide benefit in MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders. View details for A writing-intensive course improves biology undergraduates' perception and confidence of their abilities to read scientific literature and communicate science Most scientists agree that comprehension of primary scientific papers and communication of scientific concepts are two of the most important skills that we can teach, but few undergraduate biology courses make these explicit course goals. We designed an undergraduate neuroimmunology course that uses a writing-intensive format. Using a mixture of primary literature, writing assignments directed toward a layperson and scientist audience, and in-class discussions, we aimed to improve the ability of students to 1) comprehend primary scientific papers, 2) communicate science to a scientific audience, and 3) communicate science to a layperson audience. We offered the course for three consecutive years and evaluated its impact on student perception and confidence using a combination of pre- and postcourse survey questions and coded open-ended responses. Students showed gains in both the perception of their understanding of primary scientific papers and of their abilities to communicate science to scientific and layperson audiences. These results indicate that this unique format can teach both communication skills and basic science to undergraduate biology students. We urge others to adopt a similar format for undergraduate biology courses to teach process skills in addition to content, thus broadening and strengthening the impact of undergraduate courses.

Inflammatory Cytokines at the Summits of Pathological Signal Cascades in Brain Diseases When considering the hierarchical organization of pathological signaling cascades in immunological disorders of the brain, certain cytokines might be considered pinnacles of pathophysiological importance, with their presence determining the appearance or the course of a particular disease. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor are critical for the pathogenesis of inflammation in specific brain disorders. Targeting these cytokines or their receptors can alter the course of several neurological diseases, but the effects may be beneficial or harmful.

Journal of undergraduate neuroscience education : JUNE : a publication of FUN, Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience The discovery of natalizumab, a potent therapeutic for multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. There is strong evidence that an immune response in the brain is a critical component of the disease. In 1992, in a collaboration between academia and biotechnology, my colleagues and I showed that 4 integrin was the critical molecule involved in the homing of immune cells into the inflamed brain. Was it sheer luck that these results led to the development of a drug for MS?

V., Rajadas, J., Dolganov, G., Chopra, S., Schoolnik, G. K., Sobel, R. A., Webster, J., Ousman, S. S., Becker, R. A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. To determine whether the therapeutic activity of B crystallin, small heat shock protein B5 (HspB5), was shared with other human sHsps, a set of seven human family members, a mutant of HspB5 G120 known to exhibit reduced chaperone activity, and a mycobacterial sHsp were expressed and purified from bacteria. Each of the recombinant proteins was shown to be a functional chaperone, capable of inhibiting aggregation of denatured insulin with varying efficiency. When injected into mice at the peak of disease, they were all effective in reducing the paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Additional structure activity correlations between chaperone activity and therapeutic function were established when linear regions within HspB5 were examined. A single region, corresponding to residues 73-92 of HspB5, forms amyloid fibrils, exhibited chaperone activity, and was an effective therapeutic for encephalomyelitis. The linkage of the three activities was further established by demonstrating individual substitutions of critical hydrophobic amino acids in the peptide resulted in the loss of all of the functions. Reversal of Paralysis and Reduced Inflammation from Peripheral Administration of beta-Amyloid in T(H)1 and T(H)17 Versions of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Grant, J. L., Ghosn, E. E., Axtell, R. C., Herges, K., Kuipers, H. F., Woodling, N. S., Andreasson, K., Herzenberg, L. A., Herzenberg, L. A., Steinman, L. -Amyloid 42 (A42) and -amyloid 40 (A40), major components of senile plaque deposits in Alzheimer's disease, are considered neurotoxic and proinflammatory. In multiple sclerosis, A42 is up-regulated in brain lesions and damaged axons. We found, unexpectedly, that treatment with either A42 or A40 peptides reduced motor paralysis and brain inflammation in four different models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with attenuation of motor paralysis, reduction of inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), and suppression of lymphocyte activation. A42 and A40 treatments were effective in reducing ongoing paralysis induced with adoptive transfer of either autoreactive T helper 1 (T(H)1) or T(H)17 cells. High-dimensional 14-parameter flow cytometry of peripheral immune cell populations after in vivo A42 and A40 treatment revealed substantial modulations in the percentage of lymphoid and myeloid subsets during EAE. Major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were reduced in the blood after A peptide treatment. Protection conferred by A treatment did not require its delivery to the brain: Adoptive transfer with lymphocytes from donors treated with A42 attenuated EAE in wild-type recipient mice, and A deposition in the brain was not detected in treated EAE mice by immunohistochemical analysis. In contrast to the improvement in EAE with A treatment, EAE was worse in mice with genetic deletion of the amyloid precursor protein. Therefore, in the absence of A, there is exacerbated clinical EAE disease progression. Because A42 and A40 ameliorate experimental autoimmune inflammation targeting the CNS, we might now consider its potential anti-inflammatory role in other neuropathological conditions.

Comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic data from pathologically similar multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions reveals down-regulation of CD47 at the messenger RNA level and low abundance at the protein level. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that CD47 is expressed in normal myelin and in foamy macrophages and reactive astrocytes within active MS lesions. We demonstrate that CD47(-/-) mice are refractory to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), primarily as the result of failure of immune cell activation after immunization with myelin antigen. In contrast, blocking with a monoclonal antibody against CD47 in mice at the peak of paralysis worsens EAE severity and enhances immune activation in the peripheral immune system. In vitro assays demonstrate that blocking CD47 also promotes phagocytosis of myelin and that this effect is dependent on signal regulatory protein (SIRP-). Immune regulation and phagocytosis are mechanisms for CD47 signaling in autoimmune neuroinflammation. Depending on the cell type, location, and disease stage, CD47 has Janus-like roles, with opposing effects on EAE pathogenesis.

Z., Prat, A., Steinman, L., Dunn, S. E. Women develop certain autoimmune diseases more often than men. It has been hypothesized that this may relate to the development of more robust T-helper (Th)1 responses in women. To test whether women exhibit a Th1 bias, we isolated nave cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+) T cells from peripheral blood of healthy women and men and measured the proliferation and cytokine production by these cells in response to submaximal amounts of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. We observed that CD4(+) T cells from women produced higher levels of IFN as well as tended to proliferate more than male CD4(+) T cells. Intriguingly, male CD4(+) T cells instead had a predilection toward IL-17A production. This sex dichotomy in Th cytokine production was found to be even more striking in the Swiss/Jackson Laboratory (SJL) mouse. Studies in mice and humans indicated that the sexual dimorphism in Th1 and Th17 cytokine production was dependent on the androgen status and the T-cell expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) and PPAR. Androgens increased PPAR and decreased PPAR expression by human CD4(+) T cells. PPAR siRNA-mediated knockdown had the effect of increasing IFN by male CD4(+) T cells, while transfection of CD4(+) T cells with PPAR siRNAs increased IL-17A production uniquely by female T cells. Together, our observations indicate that human T cells exhibit a sex difference in the production of IFN and IL-17A that may be driven by expressions of PPAR and PPAR.

M., Van Haren, K., Wikoff, W. R., Kind, T., Khademi, M., Matloff, L. Y., Narayana, S., Hur, E. M., Lindstrom, T. M., He, Z., Fiehn, O., Olsson, T., Han, X., Han, M. H., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Lipids constitute 70% of the myelin sheath, and autoantibodies against lipids may contribute to the demyelination that characterizes multiple sclerosis (MS). We used lipid antigen microarrays and lipid mass spectrometry to identify bona fide lipid targets of the autoimmune response in MS brain, and an animal model of MS to explore the role of the identified lipids in autoimmune demyelination. We found that autoantibodies in MS target a phosphate group in phosphatidylserine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine derivatives. Administration of these lipids ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing activation and inducing apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, effects mediated by the lipids' saturated fatty acid side chains. Thus, phospholipids represent a natural anti-inflammatory class of compounds that have potential as therapeutics for MS. Protective effect of an elastase inhibitor in a neuromyelitis optica-like disease driven by a peptide of myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein Herges, K., de Jong, B. A., Kolkowitz, I., Dunn, C., Mandelbaum, G., Ko, R. M., Maini, A., Han, M. H., Killestein, J., Polman, C., Goodyear, A. L., Dunn, J., Steinman, L., Axtell, R. C. The pathology of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), in contrast to multiple sclerosis, comprises granulocyte infiltrates along extensive lengths of spinal cord, as well as optic nerve. Furthermore, IFN- treatment worsens NMO. We recently found that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced with Th17 cells is exacerbated by IFN-, in contrast to disease induced with Th1 where treatment attenuated symptoms.This study demonstrates the similarities between NMO and Th17 EAE and how neutrophils mediate pathology in Th17 disease.Levels of blood biomarkers in NMO were assessed by Luminex and ELISA. Effects of IFN- on neutrophils were assessed by culture assays and immunofluorescence. EAE was induced by transfer of myelin-specific Th1 or Th17 cells and treated with Sivelestat sodium hydrate, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor.We show Th17 cytokines, granulocyte chemokines, type 1 interferon and neutrophil elastase are elevated in patients with definitive NMO. In culture, we find that IFN- stimulates neutrophils to release neutrophil elastase. In Th17 EAE, we demonstrate neutrophilic infiltration in the optic nerve and spinal cord which was not present in Th1 EAE. Blockade of neutrophil elastase with Sivelestat had efficacy in Th17 EAE but not Th1 EAE.The similarities between Th17 EAE and NMO indicate that this model represents several aspects of NMO. Neutrophils are critical in the pathologies of both Th17-EAE and NMO, and therefore blockade of neutrophil elastase is a promising target in treating NMO.

P., Brownell, S., Adams, C. M., Su, L., Axtell, R. C., Chen, R., Fathman, C. G., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. The therapeutic benefit of the small heat shock protein B-crystallin (HspB5) in animal models of multiple sclerosis and ischemia is proposed to arise from its increased capacity to bind proinflammatory proteins at the elevated temperatures within inflammatory foci. By mass spectral analysis, a common set of 70 ligands was precipitated by HspB5 from plasma from patients with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis and mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These proteins were distinguished from other precipitated molecules because they were enriched in the precipitate as compared with their plasma concentrations, and they exhibited temperature-dependent binding. More than half of these ligands were acute phase proteins or members of the complement or coagulation cascades. Consistent with this proposal, plasma levels of HspB5 were increased in patients with multiple sclerosis as compared with normal individuals. The combination of the thermal sensitivity of the HspB5 combined with the high local concentration of these ligands at the site of inflammation is proposed to explain the paradox of how a protein believed to exhibit nonspecific binding can bind with some relative apparent selectivity to proinflammatory proteins and thereby modulate inflammation.

E., Rothbard, J. B., Chen, C., Ko, R. M., Pereira, M. P., Albers, G. W., Steinman, L., Steinberg, G. K. Tissue plasminogen activator is the only treatment option for stroke victims; however, it has to be administered within 4.5 h after symptom onset, making its use very limited. This report describes a unique target for effective treatment of stroke, even 12 h after onset, by the administration of B-crystallin (Cryab), an endogenous immunomodulatory neuroprotectant. In Cryab(-/-) mice, there was increased lesion size and diminished neurologic function after stroke compared with wild-type mice. Increased plasma Cryab was detected after experimental stroke in mice and after stroke in human patients. Administration of Cryab even 12 h after experimental stroke reduced both stroke volume and inflammatory cytokines associated with stroke pathology. Cryab is an endogenous anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectant molecule produced after stroke, whose beneficial properties can be augmented when administered therapeutically after stroke. View details for Functional rescue of experimental ischemic optic neuropathy with alpha B-crystallin Pangratz-Fuehrer, S., Kaur, K., Ousman, S. S., Steinman, L., Liao, Y. J. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is an important cause of acute vision loss in adults, and there is no effective treatment. We studied early changes following experimental AION and tested the benefit of a potential treatment.Materials andWe induced experimental AION in adult mice and tested the effects of short-term (daily for 3 days) and long-term (every other day for 3 weeks) B-crystallin (BC) treatment using histological and serial intracranial flash visual evoked potential recordings.One day after experimental AION, there was swelling at the optic nerve (ON) head and increased expression of BC, a small heat shock protein important in ischemia and inflammation. This upregulation coincided with microglial and astrocytic activation. Our hypothesis was that BC may be part of the endogenous protective mechanism against injury, thus we tested the effects of BC on experimental AION. Daily intraveneous or intravitreal BC injections did not improve visual evoked potential amplitude or latency at days 1-2. However, BC treatment decreased swelling and dampened the microglial and astrocytic activation on day 3. Longer treatment with intravenous BC led to acceleration of visual evoked potential latency over 3 weeks, without improving amplitude. This latency acceleration did not correlate with increased retinal ganglion cell survival but did correlate with complete rescue of the ON oligodendrocytes, which are important for myelination.We identified BC as an early marker following experimental AION. Treatment with BC enhanced this endogenous, post-ischemic response by decreasing microglial activation and promoting ON oligodendrocyte survival. View details for Interferon-beta exacerbates Th17-mediated inflammatory disease Interferon (IFN)- is the treatment most often prescribed for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). 30-50% of MS patients, however, do not respond to IFN-. In some cases, IFN- exacerbates MS, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO). To eliminate unnecessary treatment for patients who are non-responsive to IFN-, and to avoid possible harm, researchers are identifying biomarkers that predict treatment outcome before treatment is initiated. These biomarkers reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease. Recent discoveries on human samples from patients with RRMS, NMO, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis, indicate that IFN- is ineffective and might worsen clinical status in diverse diseases when a Th17 immune response is prominent. View details for Chaperone Activity of alpha B-Crystallin Is Responsible for Its Incorrect Assignment as an Autoantigen in Multiple Sclerosis Rothbard, J. B., Zhao, X., Sharpe, O., Strohman, M. J., Kurnellas, M., Mellins, E. D., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. For 15 y, B-crystallin (heat shock protein [Hsp] B5) has been labeled an autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS) based on humoral and cellular responses found in humans and animal models. However, there have been several scientific inconsistencies with this assignment, ranging from studies demonstrating small differences in anticrystallin responses between patients and healthy individuals to the inability of crystallin-specific T cells to induce symptoms of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in animal models. Experiments in this article demonstrate that the putative anti-HspB5 Abs from 23 MS patients cross-react with 7 other members of the human small Hsp family and were equally present in normal plasma. Biolayer interferometry demonstrates that the binding was temperature dependent, and that the calculated K(a) increased as the concentration of the sHsp decreased. These two patterns are characteristic of multiple binding sites with varying affinities, the composition of which changes with temperature, supporting the hypothesis that HspB5 bound the Ab and not the reverse. HspB5 also precipitated Ig heavy and L chains from sera from patients with MS. These results establish that small Hsps bind Igs with high affinity and refute much of the serological data used to assign B-crystallin as an autoantigen.

E., Bhat, R., Straus, D. S., Sobel, R. A., Axtell, R., Johnson, A., Nguyen, K., Mukundan, L., Moshkova, M., Dugas, J. C., Chawla, A., Steinman, L. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPAR-alpha, PPAR-delta, and PPAR-gamma) comprise a family of nuclear receptors that sense fatty acid levels and translate this information into altered gene transcription. Previously, it was reported that treatment of mice with a synthetic ligand activator of PPAR-delta, GW0742, ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating a possible role for this nuclear receptor in the control of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune inflammation. We show that mice deficient in PPAR-delta (PPAR-delta(-/-)) develop a severe inflammatory response during EAE characterized by a striking accumulation of IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(-) and IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(+) CD4(+) cells in the spinal cord. The preferential expansion of these T helper subsets in the CNS of PPAR-delta(-/-) mice occurred as a result of a constellation of immune system aberrations that included higher CD4(+) cell proliferation, cytokine production, and T-bet expression and enhanced expression of IL-12 family cytokines by myeloid cells. We also show that the effect of PPAR-delta in inhibiting the production of IFN-gamma and IL-12 family cytokines is ligand dependent and is observed in both mouse and human immune cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that PPAR-delta serves as an important molecular brake for the control of autoimmune inflammation. View details for Inverse vaccination, the opposite of Jenner's concept, for therapy of autoimmunity DNA-based vaccines to induce antigen-specific inhibition of immune responses in human autoimmune diseases represent the inverse of what Jenner intended when he invented vaccination. Jenner's vaccine induced antigen-specific immunity to small pox. DNA vaccines for autoimmunity have been developed in preclinical settings, and now tested in human trials. The first two clinical trials, one in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, and the other in type 1 diabetes indicate that specific inhibition of antigen-specific antibody and T-cell responses is attainable in humans. Further development of this approach is ongoing. This new version of immunization termed 'inverse vaccination' when applied to autoimmune diseases, may allow targeted reduction of unwanted antibody and T-cell responses to autoantigens, while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact. The method of specifically reducing a pathological adaptive autoimmune response is termed inverse vaccination.

H., Malefyt, R. d., Steinman, L., Raman, C. Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is the major treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, this treatment is not always effective. Here we have found congruence in outcome between responses to IFN-beta in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). IFN-beta was effective in reducing EAE symptoms induced by T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells but exacerbated disease induced by T(H)17 cells. Effective treatment in T(H)1-induced EAE correlated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by splenocytes. In T(H)17-induced disease, the amount of IL-10 was unaltered by treatment, although, unexpectedly, IFN-beta treatment still reduced IL-17 production without benefit. Both inhibition of IL-17 and induction of IL-10 depended on IFN-gamma. In the absence of IFN-gamma signaling, IFN-beta therapy was ineffective in EAE. In RRMS patients, IFN-beta nonresponders had higher IL-17F concentrations in serum compared to responders. Nonresponders had worse disease with more steroid usage and more relapses than did responders. Hence, IFN-beta is proinflammatory in T(H)17-induced EAE. Moreover, a high IL-17F concentration in the serum of people with RRMS is associated with nonresponsiveness to therapy with IFN-beta. View details for Inhibitory role for GABA in autoimmune inflammation PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Bhat, R., Axtell, R., Mitra, A., Miranda, M., Lock, C., Tsien, R. W., Steinman, L. GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, has a parallel inhibitory role in the immune system. We demonstrate that immune cells synthesize GABA and have the machinery for GABA catabolism. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) express functional GABA receptors and respond electrophysiologically to GABA. Thus, the immune system harbors all of the necessary constituents for GABA signaling, and GABA itself may function as a paracrine or autocrine factor. These observations led us to ask further whether manipulation of the GABA pathway influences an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Increasing GABAergic activity ameliorates ongoing paralysis in EAE via inhibition of inflammation. GABAergic agents act directly on APCs, decreasing MAPK signals and diminishing subsequent adaptive inflammatory responses to myelin proteins. View details for Innate and Adaptive Autoimmunity Directed to the Central Nervous System The immune system has two major components, an innate arm and an adaptive arm. Certain autoimmune diseases of the brain represent examples of disorders where one of these constituents plays a major role. Some rare autoimmune diseases involve activation of the innate arm and include chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome. In contrast, adaptive immunity is prominent in multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and the paraneoplastic syndromes where highly specific T cell responses and antibodies mediate these diseases. Studies of autoimmune brain disorders have aided in the elucidation of distinct neuronal roles played by key molecules already well known to immunologists (e.g., complement and components of the major histocompatibility complex). In parallel, molecules known to neurobiology and sensory physiology, including toll-like receptors, gamma amino butyric acid and the lens protein alpha B crystallin, have intriguing and distinct functions in the immune system, where they modulate autoimmunity directed to the brain.

M., Ho, P. P., Han, M. H., Lanz, T. V., Phillips, L. K., Goldstein, M. J., Bhat, R., Raine, C. S., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a major regulator of blood pressure. The octapeptide angiotensin II (AII) is proteolytically processed from the decapeptide AI by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and then acts via angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R). Inhibitors of ACE and antagonists of the AT1R are used in the treatment of hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We now show that the RAAS also plays a major role in autoimmunity, exemplified by multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using proteomics, we observed that RAAS is up-regulated in brain lesions of MS. AT1R was induced in myelin-specific CD4+ T cells and monocytes during autoimmune neuroinflammation. Blocking AII production with ACE inhibitors or inhibiting AII signaling with AT1R blockers suppressed autoreactive TH1 and TH17 cells and promoted antigen-specific CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) with inhibition of the canonical NF-kappaB1 transcription factor complex and activation of the alternative NF-kappaB2 pathway. Treatment with ACE inhibitors induces abundant CD4+FoxP3+ T cells with sufficient potency to reverse paralytic EAE. Modulation of the RAAS with inexpensive, safe pharmaceuticals used by millions worldwide is an attractive therapeutic strategy for application to human autoimmune diseases. View details for A molecular trio in relapse and remission in multiple sclerosis Two thirds of patients with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing-remitting form, which often progresses to more debilitating disease. Striking clinical recovery, termed remission, often follows these periodic neurological defects, termed relapses. Recent work has revealed the role of three key molecules in relapse and remission: alpha4beta1 integrin (also known as VLA4) is an adhesion molecule that mediates T cell migration from the blood into the brain; osteopontin binds to alpha4beta1 integrin, stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting apoptosis; and alphaB crystallin inhibits inflammation in the brain. This Review discusses how this molecular trio interacts to initiate relapses (in the case of osteopontin and alpha4beta1 integrin) and then to terminate them as remissions in multiple sclerosis (in the case of alphaB crystallin).

Insulin is a major target for the autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells during the pathogenesis of type I diabetes. A plasmid DNA vaccine encoding mouse proinsulin II reduced the incidence of diabetes in a mouse model of type I diabetes when administered to hyperglycemic (therapeutic mode) or normoglycemic (prophylactic mode) NOD mice. Therapeutic administration of proinsulin DNA was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the number of insulin-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells, whereas prophylactic treatment was accompanied by enhanced IFN-gamma-secreting cells and a decrease in insulin autoantibodies. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that the protection was not mediated by induction of CD25(+)/CD4(+) T regulatory cells. The efficacy of the DNA vaccine was enhanced by increasing the level of expression of the encoded Ag, more frequent dosing, increasing dose level, and localization of the protein product to the intracellular compartment. The efficacy data presented in this study demonstrate that Ag-specific plasmid DNA therapy is a viable strategy for preventing progression of type I diabetes and defines critical parameters of the dosing regime that influences tolerance induction. View details for Nuanced roles of cytokines in three major human brain disorders The three most prevalent human disorders of the CNS in which immunity and inflammation are likely to have vital roles (excluding infection of the CNS) are fever, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Alzheimer disease (AD). As reviewed here, cytokines are critical in the induction of fever, the pathogenesis of MS, and the pathobiology of AD. Indeed, antibodies targeting cytokines have been used as a therapy for individuals with unusual and persistent febrile reactions not responsive to common antipyretics, while a recombinant cytokine is the most popular treatment for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. Although cytokine-modulating therapies are not currently in clinical use for the treatment of AD, cytokines can ameliorate disease pathology in certain experimental models of AD, suggesting a potential for future therapeutic opportunities.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of BHT-3009 in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and to confirm that BHT-3009 causes immune tolerance.BHT-3009 is a tolerizing DNA vaccine for MS, encoding full-length human myelin basic protein. Relapsing-remitting MS patients were randomized 1:1:1 into three groups: placebo, 0.5 mg BHT-3009, or 1.5 mg BHT-3009, given intramuscularly at weeks 0, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter until week 44. The primary end point was the 4-week rate of occurrence of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance images from weeks 28 to 48. Protein microarrays were used to measure levels of anti-myelin autoantibodies.Compared with placebo, in the 267 patient analysis population the median 4-week rate of new enhancing lesions during weeks 28 to 48 was 50% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.07) and during weeks 8 to 48 was 61% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.05). The mean volume of enhancing lesions at week 48 was 51% lower on 0.5 mg BHT-3009 compared with placebo (p = 0.02). No significant improvement in magnetic resonance imaging lesion parameters was observed with 1.5 mg BHT-3009. Dramatic reductions in 23 myelin-specific autoantibodies in the 0.5 mg BHT-3009 arm were observed, but not with placebo or 1.5 mg BHT-3009.In relapsing-remitting MS patients, treatment with the lower dose (0.5 mg) of BHT-3009 for 44 weeks nearly attained the primary end point for reduction of the rate of new enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions (p = 0.07) and achieved several secondary end points including a reduction of the rate of enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions from weeks 8 to 48 (p = 0.05). Immunological data in a preselected subgroup of patients also indicated that treatment with 0.5 mg induced antigen-specific immune tolerance. The greater dose was ineffective.

H., Gerlitz, B., Robinson, W. H., Baranzini, S. E., Grinnell, B. W., Raine, C. S., Sobel, R. A., Han, D. K., Steinman, L. Understanding the neuropathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is essential for improved therapies. Therefore, identification of targets specific to pathological types of MS may have therapeutic benefits. Here we identify, by laser-capture microdissection and proteomics, proteins unique to three major types of MS lesions: acute plaque, chronic active plaque and chronic plaque. Comparative proteomic profiles identified tissue factor and protein C inhibitor within chronic active plaque samples, suggesting dysregulation of molecules associated with coagulation. In vivo administration of hirudin or recombinant activated protein C reduced disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and suppressed Th1 and Th17 cytokines in astrocytes and immune cells. Administration of mutant forms of recombinant activated protein C showed that both its anticoagulant and its signalling functions were essential for optimal amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. A proteomic approach illuminated potential therapeutic targets selective for specific pathological stages of MS and implicated participation of the coagulation cascade. Induction of antigen-specific tolerance in multiple sclerosis after immunization with DNA encoding myelin basic protein in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1/2 trial Bar-Or, A., Vollmer, T., Antel, J., Arnold, D.

J., Valone, F., Weiner, L., Steinman, L., Garren, H. To assess safety and immune modulation by BHT-3009, a tolerizing DNA vaccine encoding full-length human myelin basic protein, in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects receiving placebo were crossed over into an active arm after treatment unblinding.The trial was conducted at 4 academic institutions within North America. Patients Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS who were not taking any other disease-modifying drugs were enrolled in the trial. Further, the patients were required to have either 1 to 5 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on screening brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a relapse in the previous 2 years, or disease worsening in the previous 2 years.BHT-3009 was administered as intramuscular injections at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9 after randomization into the trial, with or without 80 mg of daily oral atorvastatin calcium in combination. Three dose levels of BHT-3009 were tested (0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, and 3 mg).The primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability of BHT-3009. Secondary outcome measures included the number and volume of gadolinium-enhanced lesions on MRI, relapses, and analysis of antigen-specific immune responses.BHT-3009 was safe and well tolerated, provided favorable trends on brain MRI, and produced beneficial antigen-specific immune changes. These immune changes consisted of a marked decrease in proliferation of interferon-gamma-producing, myelin-reactive CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and a reduction in titers of myelin-specific autoantibodies from cerebral spinal fluid as assessed by protein microarrays. We did not observe a substantial benefit of the atorvastatin combination compared with BHT-3009 alone.In patients with MS, BHT-3009 is safe and induces antigen-specific immune tolerance with concordant reduction of inflammatory lesions on brain MRI.

A., Sobel, R. A., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) is the most abundant gene transcript present in early active multiple sclerosis lesions, whereas such transcripts are absent in normal brain tissue. This crystallin has anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective functions. CRYAB is the major target of CD4+ T-cell immunity to the myelin sheath from multiple sclerosis brain. The pathophysiological implications of this immune response were investigated here. We demonstrate that CRYAB is a potent negative regulator acting as a brake on several inflammatory pathways in both the immune system and central nervous system (CNS). Cryab-/- mice showed worse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at the acute and progressive phases, with higher Th1 and Th17 cytokine secretion from T cells and macrophages, and more intense CNS inflammation, compared with their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, Cryab-/- astrocytes showed more cleaved caspase-3 and more TUNEL staining, indicating an anti-apoptotic function of Cryab. Antibody to CRYAB was detected in cerebrospinal fluid from multiple sclerosis patients and in sera from mice with EAE. Administration of recombinant CRYAB ameliorated EAE. Thus, the immune response against a negative regulator of inflammation, CRYAB, in multiple sclerosis, would exacerbate inflammation and demyelination. This can be countered by giving CRYAB itself for therapy of ongoing disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha expression in T cells mediates gender differences in development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity Dunn, S. E., Ousman, S. S., Sobel, R. A., Zuniga, L., Baranzini, S. E., Youssef, S., Crowell, A., Loh, J., Oksenberg, J., Steinman, L. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha is a nuclear receptor that mediates gender differences in lipid metabolism. PPARalpha also functions to control inflammatory responses by repressing the activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-jun in immune cells. Because PPARalpha is situated at the crossroads of gender and immune regulation, we hypothesized that this gene may mediate sex differences in the development of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We show that PPARalpha is more abundant in male as compared with female CD4(+) cells and that its expression is sensitive to androgen levels. Genetic ablation of this gene selectively removed the brake on NF-kappaB and c-jun activity in male T lymphocytes, resulting in higher production of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor (but not interleukin 17), and lower production of T helper (Th)2 cytokines. Upon induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, male but not female PPARalpha(-/-) mice developed more severe clinical signs that were restricted to the acute phase of disease. These results suggest that males are less prone to develop Th1-mediated autoimmunity because they have higher T cell expression of PPARalpha. View details for A brief history of T(H)17, the first major revision in the T(H)1/T(H)2 hypothesis of T cell-mediated tissue damage For over 35 years, immunologists have divided T-helper (T(H)) cells into functional subsets. T-helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells-long thought to mediate tissue damage-might be involved in the initiation of damage, but they do not sustain or play a decisive role in many commonly studied models of autoimmunity, allergy and microbial immunity. A major role for the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) has now been described in various models of immune-mediated tissue injury, including organ-specific autoimmunity in the brain, heart, synovium and intestines, allergic disorders of the lung and skin, and microbial infections of the intestines and the nervous system. A pathway named T(H)17 is now credited for causing and sustaining tissue damage in these diverse situations. The T(H)1 pathway antagonizes the T(H)17 pathway in an intricate fashion. The evolution of our understanding of the T(H)17 pathway illuminates a shift in immunologists' perspectives regarding the basis of tissue damage, where for over 20 years the role of T(H)1 cells was considered paramount. View details for Osteopontin-induced relapse and progression of autoimmune brain disease through enhanced survival of activated T cells Hur, E. M., Youssef, S., Haws, M. E., Zhang, S. Y., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. Relapses and disease exacerbations are vexing features of multiple sclerosis. Osteopontin (Opn), which is expressed in multiple sclerosis lesions, is increased in patients' plasma during relapses. Here, in models of multiple sclerosis including relapsing, progressive and multifocal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Opn triggered recurrent relapses, promoted worsening paralysis and induced neurological deficits, including optic neuritis. Increased inflammation followed Opn administration, whereas its absence resulted in more cell death of brain-infiltrating lymphocytes. Opn promoted the survival of activated T cells by inhibiting the transcription factor Foxo3a, by activating the transcription factor NF-kappaB through induction of phosphorylation of the kinase IKKbeta and by altering expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bak and Bax. Those mechanisms collectively suppressed the death of myelin-reactive T cells, linking Opn to the relapses and insidious progression characterizing multiple sclerosis.

J., Prod'homme, T., Weber, M. S., Zamvil, S. S., Steinman, L. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that regulates the biosynthesis of cholesterol as well as isoprenoids that mediate the membrane association of certain GTPases. Blockade of this enzyme by atorvastatin (AT) inhibits the destructive proinflammatory T helper cell (Th)1 response during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here we present evidence linking specific isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway to signaling pathways that regulate T cell autoimmunity. We demonstrate that the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) mediates proliferation, whereas both GGPP and its precursor, farnesyl-PP, regulate the Th1 differentiation of myelin-reactive T cells. Depletion of these isoprenoid intermediates in vivo via oral AT administration hindered these T cell responses by decreasing geranylgeranylated RhoA and farnesylated Ras at the plasma membrane. This was associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 phosphorylation and DNA binding of their cotarget c-fos in response to T cell receptor activation. Inhibition of ERK and p38 mimicked the effects of AT and induced a Th2 cytokine shift. Thus, by connecting isoprenoid availability to regulation of Th1/Th2 fate, we have elucidated a mechanism by which AT may suppress Th1-mediated central nervous system autoimmune disease. View details for Lipid microarrays identify key mediators of autoimmune brain inflammation Kanter, J. L., Narayana, S., Ho, P. P., Catz, I., Warren, K. G., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Recent studies suggest that increased T-cell and autoantibody reactivity to lipids may be present in the autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. To perform large-scale multiplex analysis of antibody responses to lipids in multiple sclerosis, we developed microarrays composed of lipids present in the myelin sheath, including ganglioside, sulfatide, cerebroside, sphingomyelin and total brain lipid fractions. Lipid-array analysis showed lipid-specific antibodies against sulfatide, sphingomyelin and oxidized lipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from individuals with multiple sclerosis. Sulfatide-specific antibodies were also detected in SJL/J mice with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of mice with sulfatide plus myelin peptide resulted in a more severe disease course of EAE, and administration of sulfatide-specific antibody exacerbated EAE. Thus, autoimmune responses to sulfatide and other lipids are present in individuals with multiple sclerosis and in EAE, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune demyelination. Treatment of autoimmune neuroinflammation with a synthetic tryptophan metabolite Platten, M., Ho, P. P., Youssef, S., Fontoura, P., Garren, H., Hur, E. M., Gupta, R., Lee, L. Y., Kidd, B. A., Robinson, W. H., Sobel, R. A., Selley, M. L., Steinman, L. Local catabolism of the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is considered an important mechanism of regulating T cell immunity. We show that IDO transcription was increased when myelin-specific T cells were stimulated with tolerogenic altered self-peptides. Catabolites of Trp suppressed proliferation of myelin-specific T cells and inhibited production of proinflammatory T helper-1 (T(H)1) cytokines. N-(3,4,-Dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (3,4-DAA), an orally active synthetic derivative of the Trp metabolite anthranilic acid, reversed paralysis in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Trp catabolites and their derivatives offer a new strategy for treating T(H)1-mediated autoimmune diseases such as MS. Design of effective immunotherapy for human autoimmunity A better understanding of the molecules involved in immune responses has identified many potential targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. But although successful therapies have been found for immune disorders in animal studies, few have passed the much harder test of treating human diseases. So far, non-antigen-specific approaches, such as the blocking of tumour-necrosis factor, are achieving some success but the same is not true for antigen-specific approaches. Future therapies will probably include both non-antigen-specific strategies that target cytokines (cell-cell signalling molecules) or block the molecules that stimulate immune responses, and antigen-specific therapies that induce tolerance to self antigens. View details for Blocking adhesion molecules as therapy for multiple sclerosis: Natalizumab Immunologists have long hypothesized that particular 'molecular addresses' govern lymphocyte entry to a given organ. In 1992, alpha4beta1 integrin was identified as the key molecule involved in homing to inflamed regions of the brain. An antibody to alpha4beta1integrin blocked paralysis in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, and the humanized monoclonal antibody natalizumab, which binds alpha4beta1 integrin, reduced relapses 66% in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis. Three months after its expedited approval by the FDA, natalizumab was removed from the market after two cases of deadly progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were reported among the few thousand patients who had taken this drug in those clinical trials. View details for Our increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease has revealed a number of checkpoints that can be targeted with immune therapy, including key mediators of lymphocyte adhesion and migration, destructive cytokines involved in tissue damage, and the complex of molecules critical in the presentation of self-antigen and the activation of autoaggressive T lymphocytes. In many organ-specific autoimmune diseases, the identity of the molecules attacked by T cells and autoantibodies is known and attempts are under way to tolerize the immune system with a high level of specificity to these targets.

A., Lanier, L., Lim, M., Steinman, L. Administration of a monoclonal antibody (GK1.5) that recognizes the L3T4 marker present on helper T cells prevented the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Furthermore, treatment with GK1.5 reversed EAE when the antibody was given to paralyzed animals. In vivo injection of GK1.5 selectively reduced the number of L3T4+ cells in the spleen and the lymph nodes. These results suggest that manipulation of the human equivalent of the murine L3T4+ T-cell subset with monoclonal antibodies may provide effective therapy for certain autoimmune diseases.

K., Hardy, R. R., Hayakawa, K., Steinman, L., Herzenberg, L. A., Herzenberg, L. A. Previous studies have shown that treatment with antibodies to the murine I-A antigen encoded in the major histocompatibility complex attenuates experimental allergic encephalitis and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. These studies were conducted with SJL mice, an inbred strain that is highly susceptible to the induction of these diseases. Here we show that injection of monoclonal anti-I-A antibody in the amounts used for the above studies rapidly depletes B cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) multiparameter analysis of the B-cell subpopulations in treated animals shows that maximum depletion occurs around 5 days after treatment and that recovery of some subpopulations i still incomplete 1 month later. SJL mice are more sensitive to this B-cell depletion and recover more slowly than putatively normal C3H.Ighb (CKB) mice. Some components of the primary, secondary and tertiary IgG antibody responses are reduced in anti-I-A-treated SJL animals immunized after the first and second anti-I-A injections. The persistence of some antibody response impairment well beyond the time when anti-I-A disappears raises a note of caution concerning human therapy protocols based on the injection of anti-Ia antibodies.

A monoclonal antibody to I-A gene products of the immune response gene complex attenuates both humoral and cellular responses to acetylcholine receptor and appears to suppress clinical manifestations of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. This demonstrates that use of antibodies against immune response gene products that are associated with susceptibility to disease may be feasible for therapy in autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis. View details for Mitigating alemtuzumab-associated autoimmunity in MS: A ""whack-a-mole"" B-cell depletion strategy. Meltzer, E., Campbell, S., Ehrenfeld, B., Cruz, R. A., Steinman, L., Parsons, M. S., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, E. M., Frohman, T. C. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the punctuated administration of low-dose rituximab, temporally linked to B-cell hyperrepopulation (defined when the return of CD19+ B cells approximates 40%-50% of baseline levels as measured before alemtuzumab treatment inception), can mitigate alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmunity.METHODS: In this hypothesis-driven pilot study, 10 patients received low-dose rituximab (50-150 mg/m2), a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, after either their first or second cycles of alemtuzumab. These patients were then routinely assessed for the development of autoimmune disorders and safety signals related to the use of dual monoclonal antibody therapy.RESULTS: Five patients received at least 1 IV infusion of low-dose rituximab, following alemtuzumab therapy, with a mean follow-up of 41 months. None of the 5 patients developed secondary autoimmune disorders. An additional 5 patients with follow-up over less than 24 months received at least 1 infusion of low-dose rituximab treatment following alemtuzumab treatment. No secondary autoimmune diseases were observed.CONCLUSIONS: An anti-CD20 ""whack-a-mole"" B-cell depletion strategy may serve to mitigate alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmunity in MS by reducing the imbalance in B- and T-cell regulatory networks during immune reconstitution. We believe that these observations warrant further investigation.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for people with MS, low-dose rituximab following alemtuzumab treatment decreases the risk of alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmune diseases.

SARS-CoV-2 triggered 'PANIC' attack in severe COVID-19. Frohman, E. M., Villemarette-Pittman, N. R., Melamed, E., Cruz, R. A., Longmuir, R., Varkey, T. C., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, T. C. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced a world-wide collapse of social and economic infrastructure, as well as constrained our freedom of movement. This respiratory tract infection is nefarious in how it targets the most distal and highly vulnerable aspect of the human bronchopulmonary tree, specifically, the delicate yet irreplaceable alveoli that are responsible for the loading of oxygen upon red cell hemoglobin for use by all of the body's tissues. In most symptomatic individuals, the disease is a mild immune-mediated syndrome, with limited damage to the lung tissues. About 20% of those affected experience a disease course characterized by a cataclysmic set of immune activation responses that can culminate in the diffuse and irreversible obliteration of the distal alveoli, leading to a virtual collapse of the gas-exchange apparatus. Here, in Part I of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we define severe COVID-19 as a consequence of the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to trigger what we now designate for the first time as a 'Prolific Activation of a Network-Immune-Inflammatory Crisis', or 'PANIC' Attack, in the alveolar tree. In Part II we describe an immunotherapeutic hypothesis worthy of the organization of a randomized clinical trial in order to ascertain whether a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent is capable of abolishing 'PANIC'; thereby preventing or mitigating severe COVID-19, with monumental ramifications for world health, and the global pandemic that continues to threaten it.

View details for New targets and therapeutics for neuroprotection, remyelination and repair in multiple sclerosis. Introduction: Immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) significantly decrease the risk of new relapses. However, the chronic compartmentalized inflammation and neurodegeneration that define progressive MS are not prevented by these therapies and so significant damage to the brain and spinal cord and resulting disability ensues. Hence, the possibility of combining current immunotherapies with neuroprotective, remyelinating or regenerative therapies should be pursued.Areas Covered: This article sheds light on neuroprotective, remyelination and neurorepair strategies for MS, the numerous mechanisms for therapeutic targeting and the new candidates for combination therapies. We searched PubMed for articles with the terms, 'neuroprotection', remyelination' or 'regeneration' and 'therapies' or 'drugs' and 'Multiple Sclerosis'.Expert Opinion: An enriched understanding of the neurobiology and molecular changes that are activated by inflammatory CNS damage will provide new opportunities for the identification of neuroprotective, remyelinating and regenerative therapies. Success will depend on the improvement of CNS drug delivery, the identification of new predictive biomarkers, the optimization of clinical trials by assessment of the damage to the visual pathway and the testing of novel therapies in acute optic neuritis.

M., Villemarette-Pittman, N. R., Cruz, R. A., Longmuir, R., Rowe, V., Rowe, E. S., Varkey, T. C., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, T. C. Here, in Part II of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we characterize the application of an innovative treatment regimen for the prevention of the transition from mild to severe COVID-19, as well as detail an intensive immunotherapy intervention hypothesis. We propose as a putative randomized controlled trial that high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin (HDMTX-LR) rescue can abolish 'PANIC', thereby 'left-shifting' severe COVID-19 patients to the group majority of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are designated as having mild, even asymptomatic, disease. HDMTX-LR is endowed with broadly pleiotropic properties and is a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent which can be administered early in the course of severe COVID-19 thus rescuing the critical and irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli. Further, we describe a preventative treatment intervention regimen for those designated as having mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, but who exhibit features which herald the transition to the severe variant of this disease. Both of our proposed hypothesis-driven questions should be urgently subjected to rigorous assessment in the context of randomized controlled trials, in order to confirm or refute the contention that the approaches characterized herein, are in fact capable of exerting mitigating, if not abolishing, effects upon SARS-CoV-2 triggered 'PANIC Attack'. Confirmation of our immunotherapy hypothesis would have far-reaching ramifications for the current pandemic, along with yielding invaluable lessons which could be leveraged to more effectively prepare for the next challenge to global health.

P., Pedotti, R., Sangaletti, S. The extrusion of DNA traps contributes to a key mechanism in which innate immune cells clear pathogens or induce sterile inflammation. Here we provide evidence that CD4+ T cells, a critical regulator of adaptive immunity, release extracellular threads of DNA on activation. These DNA extrusions convey autocrine costimulatory signals to T lymphocytes and can be detected in lymph nodes isolated during the priming phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4+ T cell-driven mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) abolishes the extrusion of DNA by CD4+ T cells, reducing cytokine production in vitro and T cell priming against myelin in vivo. Moreover, mtROS blockade during established EAE markedly ameliorates disease severity, dampening autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system. Taken together, these experimental results elucidate a mechanism of intrinsic immune costimulation mediated by DNA threads released by activated T helper cells, and identify a potential therapeutic target for such disorders as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and CD4+ T cell-mediated disorders.

The development of neuroprotective therapies is a sought-after goal. By screening combinatorial chemical libraries using in vitro assays, we identified the small molecule BN201 that promotes the survival of cultured neural cells when subjected to oxidative stress or when deprived of trophic factors. Moreover, BN201 promotes neuronal differentiation, the differentiation of precursor cells to mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, and the myelination of new axons. BN201 modulates several kinases participating in the insulin growth factor 1 pathway including serum-glucocorticoid kinase and midkine, inducing the phosphorylation of NDRG1 and the translocation of the transcription factor Foxo3 to the cytoplasm. In vivo, BN201 prevents axonal and neuronal loss, and it promotes remyelination in models of multiple sclerosis, chemically induced demyelination, and glaucoma. In summary, we provide a new promising strategy to promote neuroaxonal survival and remyelination, potentially preventing disability in brain diseases. Safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus interferon beta-1a in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RADIANCE): a multicentre, randomised, 24-month, phase 3 trial. Cohen, J. A., Comi, G., Selmaj, K. W., Bar-Or, A., Arnold, D. L., Steinman, L., Hartung, H. P., Montalban, X., Kubala Havrdov, E., Cree, B. A., Sheffield, J. K., Minton, N., Raghupathi, K., Huang, V., Kappos, L. Ozanimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, which selectively binds to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 with high affinity. In the RADIANCE phase 2 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was associated with better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures and was well tolerated. The RADIANCE phase 3 study aimed to confirm the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus interferon beta-1a in individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.We did a 24-month, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy phase 3 trial in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis at 147 medical centres and clinical practices in 21 countries. Participants were aged 18-55 years, had multiple sclerosis according to 2010 McDonald criteria, a relapsing clinical course, brain MRI lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis, an expanded disability status scale score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months before screening plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within the 12 months before randomisation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via an interactive voice response system to daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) over 24 months. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population of all participants who received study drug and safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received study drug, grouped by highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02047734, and EudraCT, 2012-002714-40.Between Dec 27, 2013, and March 31, 2015, we screened 1695 participants, of which 375 did not meet inclusion criteria. 1320 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to a group, of whom 1313 received study drug (433 assigned to ozanimod 10 mg, 439 assigned to ozanimod 05 mg, and 441 assigned to interferon beta-1a) and 1138 (867%) completed 24 months of treatment. Adjusted ARRs were 017 (95% CI 014-021) with ozanimod 10 mg, 022 (018-026) with ozanimod 05 mg, and 028 (023-032) with interferon beta-1a, with rate ratios versus interferon beta-1a of 062 (95% CI 051-077; p<00001) for ozanimod 10 mg and 079 (065 to 096; p=00167) for ozanimod 05 mg. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was higher in the interferon beta-1a group (365 [830%] of 440 participants) than in the ozanimod 10 mg group (324 [747%] of 434) or the ozanimod 05 mg group (326 [743%] of 439). More participants in the interferon beta-1a group had treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation than in the ozanimod groups. Incidences of infections and serious treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across treatment groups. No cases of ozanimod-related symptomatic reduction in heart rate and no second-degree or third-degree cases of atrioventricular block were reported.In this 24-month phase 3 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was well tolerated and associated with a significantly lower rate of clinical relapses than intramuscular interferon beta-1a. These findings show the potential of ozanimod as an effective oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

The RADIANCE phase 2 study showed that ozanimod had better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures, with a favourable safety profile, in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The SUNBEAM study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus intramuscular interferon beta-1a in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis.SUNBEAM was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled phase 3 trial done at 152 academic medical centres and clinical practices in 20 countries. We enrolled participants aged 18-55 years with relapsing multiple sclerosis, baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within the 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within 12 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 by a blocked algorithm stratified by country and baseline EDSS score to at least 12 months treatment of either once-daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) during the treatment period and was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants according to the highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02294058 and EudraCT, number 2014-002320-27.Between Dec 18, 2014, and Nov 12, 2015, 1346 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to ozanimod 10 mg (n=447), ozanimod 05 mg (n=451), or interferon beta-1a (n=448). 91 (68%) participants discontinued the study drug (29 in the ozanimod 10 mg group; 26 in the ozanimod 05 mg group; and 36 in the interferon beta-1a group). Adjusted ARRs were 035 (028-044) for interferon beta-1a, 018 (95% CI 014-024) for ozanimod 10 mg (rate ratio [RR] of 052 [041-066] vs interferon beta-1a; p<00001), and 024 (019-031) for ozanimod 05 mg (RR 069 [055-086] vs interferon beta-1a; p=00013). Few ozanimod-treated participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events (13 [29%] who received ozanimod 10 mg; seven [15%] who received ozanimod 05 mg; and 16 [36%] who received interferon beta-1a). No first-dose, clinically significant bradycardia or second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block was reported. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar across treatment groups (13 [29%] participants who received ozanimod 10 mg; 16 [35%] who received ozanimod 05 mg; and 11 [25%] who received interferon beta-1a). No serious opportunistic infections occurred in ozanimod-treated participants.In participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis treated for at least 12 months, ozanimod was well tolerated and demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate than interferon beta-1a. These findings provide support for ozanimod as an oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

To evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine profiles in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein IgG-positive (MOG-IgG+) disease in adult and paediatric patients.In this cross-sectional study, we measured 27 cytokines in the CSF of MOG-IgG+ disease in acute phase before treatment (n=29). The data were directly compared with those in aquaporin-4 antibody-positive (AQP4-IgG+) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) (n=20), multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=20) and non-inflammatory controls (n=14).In MOG-IgG+ disease, there was no female preponderance and the ages were younger (mean 18 years, range 3-68; 15 were below 18 years) relative to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD (41, 15-77) and MS (34, 17-48). CSF cell counts were higher and oligoclonal IgG bands were mostly negative in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD compared with MS. MOG-IgG+ disease had significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interferon-, IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 as compared with MS. No cytokine in MOG-IgG+ disease was significantly different from AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD. Moreover many elevated cytokines were correlated with each other in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut not in MS. No difference in the data was seen between adult and paediatric MOG-IgG+ cases.The CSF cytokine profile in the acute phase of MOG-IgG+ disease is characterised by coordinated upregulation of T helper 17 (Th17) and other cytokines including some Th1-related and regulatory T cells-related ones in adults and children, which is similar to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut clearly different from MS. The results suggest that as with AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD, some disease-modifying drugs for MS may be ineffective in MOG-IgG+ disease while they may provide potential therapeutic targets.

M., Glanville, J., Volkmuth, W., Emerling, D. E., Robinson, W. H. There is significant debate regarding whether B cells and their antibodies contribute to effective anti-cancer immune responses. Here we show that patients with metastatic but non-progressing melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma exhibited increased levels of blood plasmablasts. We used a cell-barcoding technology to sequence their plasmablast antibody repertoires, revealing clonal families of affinity matured B cells that exhibit progressive class switching and persistence over time. Anti-CTLA4 and other treatments were associated with further increases in somatic hypermutation and clonal family size. Recombinant antibodies from clonal families bound non-autologous tumor tissue and cell lines, and families possessing immunoglobulin paratope sequence motifs shared across patients exhibited increased rates of binding. We identified antibodies that caused regression of, and durable immunity toward, heterologous syngeneic tumors in mice. Our findings demonstrate convergent functional anti-tumor antibody responses targeting public tumor antigens, and provide an approach to identify antibodies with diagnostic or therapeutic utility.

Ozanimod, an oral immunomodulator, selectively targets sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5.Evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis.In the RADIANCE Part A phase II study (NCT01628393), participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis were randomized (1:1:1) to once-daily ozanimod hydrochloride (0.5 or 1mg) or placebo. After 24weeks, participants could enter a 2-year, dose-blinded extension. Ozanimod-treated participants continued their assigned dose; placebo participants were re-randomized (1:1) to ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5 or 1mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.46 and 0.92mg).A total of 223 (89.6%) of the 249 participants completed the blinded extension. At 2years of the extension, the percentage of participants who were gadolinium-enhancing lesion-free ranged from 86.5% to 94.6%. Unadjusted annualized relapse rate during the blinded extension (week 24-end of treatment) was 0.32 for ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5mg ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5mg, 0.18 for ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg, 0.30 for placebo ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5 mg, and 0.18 for placebo ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg. No second-degree or higher atrioventricular block or serious opportunistic infection was reported.Ozanimod demonstrated sustained efficacy in participants continuing treatment up to 2years and reached similar efficacy in participants who switched from placebo; no unexpected safety signals emerged. Amelioration of ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with fluoxetine Bhat, R., Mahapatra, S., Axtell, R. C., Steinman, L. In patients with multiple sclerosis, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, resulted in less acute disease activity. We tested the immune modulating effects of fluoxetine in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that fluoxetine delayed the onset of disease and reduced clinical paralysis in mice with established disease. Fluoxetine had abrogating effects on proliferation of immune cells and inflammatory cytokine production by both antigen-presenting cells and T cells. Specifically, in CD4 T cells, fluoxetine increased Fas-induced apoptosis. We conclude that fluoxetine possesses immune-modulating effects resulting in the amelioration of symptoms in EAE.

Demyelinated brain lesions, a hallmark of autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, result from oligodendroglial cell damage. Activated microglia are considered a major source of nitric oxide and subsequent peroxynitrite-mediated damage of myelin. Here, we provide biochemical and biophysical evidence that the oxidoreductase glutaredoxin 2 inhibits peroxynitrite formation by transforming nitric oxide into dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron-complexes. Glutaredoxin 2 levels influence both survival rates of primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and preservation of myelin structure in cerebellar organotypic slice cultures challenged with activated microglia or nitric oxide donors. Of note, glutaredoxin 2-mediated protection is not linked to its enzymatic activity as oxidoreductase, but to the disassembly of its uniquely coordinated iron-sulfur cluster using glutathione as non-protein ligand. The protective effect of glutaredoxin 2 is connected to decreased protein carbonylation and nitration. In line, brain lesions of mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, show decreased glutaredoxin 2 expression and increased nitrotyrosine formation indicating that this type of protection is missing in the inflamed central nervous system. Our findings link inorganic biochemistry to neuroinflammation and identify glutaredoxin 2 as a protective factor against neuroinflammation-mediated myelin damage. Thus, improved availability of glutathione-coordinated iron-sulfur clusters emerges as a potential therapeutic approach in inflammatory demyelination.

L., Fontana, E., Cominelli, M., Abolafio, G., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of targeting the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcepsilonRI), that plays a central role in allergic responses and is constitutively expressed on mast cells and basophils, in clinical disease and autoimmune T-cell response in experimental MS.METHODS: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55. Anti-FcepsilonRI alpha-chain antibody was administered intraperitoneally. CNS immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry analysis of immune cell populations, IgE and histamine serum concentration, immune cell proliferation, and cytokine measurement were performed. In BALB/c mice, EAE was induced by immunization with myelin proteolipid protein 185-206.RESULTS: Treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody resulted in exacerbation of EAE and increased CNS inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. Treated mice displayed long-lasting complete depletion of basophils in the blood stream and peripheral lymphoid organs and increased antigen-induced immune cell proliferation and production of interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In BALB/c mice, which are T-helper (Th) 2 prone and resistant to EAE, treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody restored susceptibility to EAE.CONCLUSION: Our observations that anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody increases Th1 and Th17 responses against myelin antigen and exacerbates EAE suggest that FcepsilonRI, basophils, and possibly other FcepsilonRI-bearing cells that might be affected by this antibody play important roles in influencing the severity of CNS autoimmunity.

View details for Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS To determine the average age of MS onset vs the age at which Epstein-Barr infection has previously occurred and stratify this analysis by sex and the blood level of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibody.Using infectious mononucleosis (IM) as a temporal marker in data from the Swedish epidemiologic investigation of MS, 259 adult IM/MS cases were identified and then augmented to account for ""missing"" childhood data so that the average age of MS onset could be determined for cases binned by age of IM (as stratified by sex and EBNA1 titer level).Mean age of IM vs mean age of MS reveals a positive time correlation for all IM ages (from 5 to 30 years), with IM-to-MS delay decreasing with increased age. When bifurcated by sex or EBNA1 blood titer levels, males and high-titer subpopulations show even stronger positive time correlation, while females and low-titer populations show negative time correlation in early childhood (long IM/MS delay). The correlation becomes positive in females beyond puberty.IM/MS time correlation implies causality if IM is time random. Alternative confounding models seem implausible, in light of constraints imposed by time-invariant delay observed here. Childhood infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in females and/or those genetically prone to low EBNA1 blood titers will develop MS slowly. Males and/or high EBNA1-prone develop MS more rapidly following IM infection at all ages. For all, postpubescent EBV infection is critical for the initiation and rapid development of MS.

Expression of Spam1/PH20 and its modulation of high/low molecular weight hyaluronan substrate have been proposed to play an important role in murine oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation in vitro and in normal and demyelinated central nervous system (CNS). We reexamined this using highly purified PH20.Steady-state expression of mRNA in OPCs was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction; the role of PH20 in bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH) inhibition of OPC differentiation was explored by comparing BTH to a purified recombinant human PH20 (rHuPH20). Contaminants in commercial BTH were identified and their impact on OPC differentiation characterized. Spam1/PH20 expression in normal and demyelinated mouse CNS tissue was investigated using deep RNA sequencing and immunohistological methods with two antibodies directed against recombinant murine PH20.BTH, but not rHuPH20, inhibited OPC differentiation in vitro. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was identified as a significant contaminant in BTH, and bFGF immunodepletion reversed the inhibitory effects of BTH on OPC differentiation. Spam1 mRNA was undetected in OPCs in vitro and in vivo; PH20 immunolabeling was undetected in normal and demyelinated CNS.We were unable to detect Spam1/PH20 expression in OPCs or in normal or demyelinated CNS using the most sensitive methods currently available. Further, ""BTH"" effects on OPC differentiation are not due to PH20, but may be attributable to contaminating bFGF. Our data suggest that caution be exercised when using some commercially available hyaluronidases, and reports of Spam1/PH20 morphogenic activity in the CNS may be due to contaminants in reagents.

F., Yoon, J., van Horssen, J., Han, M. H., Bollyky, P. L., Palmer, T. D., Steinman, L. The small heat shock protein B-crystallin (CRYAB) has been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Earlier studies have indicated that CRYAB inhibits inflammation and attenuates clinical disease when administered in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. In this study, we evaluated the role of CRYAB in primary demyelinating events. Using the cuprizone model of demyelination, a noninflammatory model that allows the analysis of glial responses in MS, we show that endogenous CRYAB expression is associated with increased severity of demyelination. Moreover, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the expression of CRYAB and the extent of reactive astrogliosis in demyelinating areas and in in vitro assays. In addition, we reveal that CRYAB is differentially phosphorylated in astrocytes in active demyelinating MS lesions, as well as in cuprizone-induced lesions, and that this phosphorylation is required for the reactive astrocyte response associated with demyelination. Furthermore, taking a proteomics approach to identify proteins that are bound by the phosphorylated forms of CRYAB in primary cultured astrocytes, we show that there is clear differential binding of protein targets due to the specific phosphorylation of CRYAB. Subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of these targets reveals implications for intracellular pathways and biological processes that could be affected by these modifications. Together, these findings demonstrate that astrocytes play a pivotal role in demyelination, making them a potential target for therapeutic intervention, and that phosphorylation of CRYAB is a key factor supporting the pathogenic response of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte injury.

C., Cen, S. Y., Tauhid, S., Neema, M., Steinman, L. The objective of this study was to evaluate monthly intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) gel versus intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) add-on therapy to interferon for breakthrough disease in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.This was a prospective, open-label, examiner-blinded, 15-month pilot study evaluating patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.0-6.5 and at least one clinical relapse or new T2 or gadolinium-enhanced lesion in the previous year. Twenty-three patients were randomized to ACTH (n = 12) or IVMP (n = 11) and completed the study. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative number of relapses. Secondary outcomes included EDSS, Mental Health Inventory (MHI), plasma cytokines, MS Functional Composite (MSFC), Quality-of-Life (MS-QOL) score, bone mineral density (BMD), and new or worsened psychiatric symptoms per month. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed post hoc. This was a preliminary and small-scale study.Relapse rates differed significantly [ACTH 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.54 versus IVMP 0.80, 95% CI 0.36-1.75; rate ratio, IVMP versus ACTH: 9.56, 95% CI 1.23-74.6; p = 0.03]. ACTH improved (p = 0.03) MHI (slope 0.95 0.38 points/month; p = 0.02 versus slope -0.38 0.43 points/month; p = 0.39). On-study decreases (all p < 0.05) in eight cytokine levels occurred only in the ACTH group. However, on-study EDSS, MSFC, MS-QOL, BMD, and MRI lesion changes were not significant between groups. Psychiatric symptoms per patient were greater with IVMP than ACTH (0.55, 95% CI 0.12-2.6 versus 0; p < 0.0001). Other common adverse events were insomnia and urinary tract infections (IVMP, seven events each) and fatigue or flu symptoms (ACTH, five events each).This study provided class II evidence that ACTH produced better examiner-assessed cumulative rates of relapses per patient than IVMP in the adjunctive treatment of breakthrough disease in multiple sclerosis. Regulator of oligodendrocyte maturation, miR-219, a potential biomarker for MS. Bruinsma, I. B., van Dijk, M., Bridel, C., van de Lisdonk, T., Haverkort, S. Q., Runia, T. F., Steinman, L., Hintzen, R. Q., Killestein, J., Verbeek, M. M., Teunissen, C. E., de Jong, B. A. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Normally, demyelination is followed by remyelination, which requires repopulation of a demyelinated area by oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Although large numbers of precursor cells are present in MS lesions, remyelination often fails, in part by the inability of precursor cells to differentiate into mature myelin-forming cells. In mouse and rat, miR-219 is required for this differentiation. Previously, we identified decreased miR-219 expression in tissue of MS patients compared to controls. Cell-free miRNAs have been detected in many different body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may reflect disease processes going on in the central nervous system. This prompted us to investigate the biomarker performance of CSF miR-219 for MS diagnosis.Quantitative PCR was performed measuring miR-219 levels in CSF of MS patients and controls in three independent cohorts.All three cohorts of MS patients and controls revealed that absence of miR-219 detection in CSF is consistently associated with MS.We have been able to identify and validate absence of miR-219 detection in CSF of MS patients compared to controls, suggesting that it may emerge as a candidate biomarker for MS diagnosis. Induction of Paralysis and Visual System Injury in Mice by T Cells Specific for Neuromyelitis Optica Autoantigen Aquaporin-4. Sagan, S. A., Cruz-Herranz, A., Spencer, C. M., Ho, P. P., Steinman, L., Green, A. J., Sobel, R. A., Zamvil, S. S. While it is recognized that aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific T cells and antibodies participate in the pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a human central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune demyelinating disease, creation of an AQP4-targeted model with both clinical and histologic manifestations of CNS autoimmunity has proven challenging. Immunization of wild-type (WT) mice with AQP4 peptides elicited T cell proliferation, although those T cells could not transfer disease to nave recipient mice. Recently, two novel AQP4 T cell epitopes, peptide (p) 135-153 and p201-220, were identified when studying immune responses to AQP4 in AQP4-deficient (AQP4-/-) mice, suggesting T cell reactivity to these epitopes is normally controlled by thymic negative selection. AQP4-/- Th17 polarized T cells primed to either p135-153 or p201-220 induced paralysis in recipient WT mice, that was associated with predominantly leptomeningeal inflammation of the spinal cord and optic nerves. Inflammation surrounding optic nerves and involvement of the inner retinal layers (IRL) were manifested by changes in serial optical coherence tomography (OCT). Here, we illustrate the approaches used to create this new in vivo model of AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA), which can now be employed to study mechanisms that permit development of pathogenic AQP4-specific T cells and how they may cooperate with B cells in NMO pathogenesis. Tolerance checkpoint bypass permits emergence of pathogenic T cells to neuromyelitis optica autoantigen aquaporin-4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Sagan, S.

J., Anderson, M. S., Sobel, R. A., Zamvil, S. S. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific T cells are expanded in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients and exhibit Th17 polarization. However, their pathogenic role in CNS autoimmune inflammatory disease is unclear. Although multiple AQP4 T-cell epitopes have been identified in WT C57BL/6 mice, we observed that neither immunization with those determinants nor transfer of donor T cells targeting them caused CNS autoimmune disease in recipient mice. In contrast, robust proliferation was observed following immunization of AQP4-deficient (AQP4(-/-)) mice with AQP4 peptide (p) 135-153 or p201-220, peptides predicted to contain I-A(b)-restricted T-cell epitopes but not identified in WT mice. In comparison with WT mice, AQP4(-/-) mice used unique T-cell receptor repertoires for recognition of these two AQP4 epitopes. Donor T cells specific for either determinant from AQP4(-/-), but not WT, mice induced paralysis in recipient WT and B-cell-deficient mice. AQP4-specific Th17-polarized cells induced more severe disease than Th1-polarized cells. Clinical signs were associated with opticospinal infiltrates of T cells and monocytes. Fluorescent-labeled donor T cells were detected in CNS lesions. Visual system involvement was evident by changes in optical coherence tomography. Fine mapping of AQP4 p201-220 and p135-153 epitopes identified peptides within p201-220 but not p135-153, which induced clinical disease in 40% of WT mice by direct immunization. Our results provide a foundation to evaluate how AQP4-specific T cells contribute to AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA) and suggest that pathogenic AQP4-specific T-cell responses are normally restrained by central tolerance, which may be relevant to understanding development of AQP4-reactive T cells in NMO.

G., Benners, E., Shinohara, M. L. Inflammation induced by innate immunity influences the development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that strong activation of innate immunity induced Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-independent and interferon- (IFN)-resistant EAE (termed type B EAE), whereas EAE induced by weak activation of innate immunity requires the NLRP3 inflammasome and is sensitive to IFN treatment. Instead, an alternative inflammatory mechanism, including membrane-bound lymphotoxin- receptor (LTR) and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), is involved in type B EAE development, and type B EAE is ameliorated by antagonizing these receptors. Relative expression of Ltbr and Cxcr2 genes was indeed enhanced in patients with IFN-resistant multiple sclerosis. Remission was minimal in type B EAE due to neuronal damages induced by semaphorin 6B upregulation on CD4(+) T cells.

Restoring immune tolerance in neuromyelitis optica: Part II. Bar-Or, A., Steinman, L., Behne, J. M., Benitez-Ribas, D., Chin, P. S., Clare-Salzler, M., Healey, D., Kim, J. I., Kranz, D. M., Lutterotti, A., Martin, R., Schippling, S., Villoslada, P., Wei, C., Weiner, H. L., Zamvil, S. S., Smith, T. J., Yeaman, M. R. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMO/SD) and its clinical variants have at their core the loss of immune tolerance to aquaporin-4 and perhaps other autoantigens. The characteristic phenotype is disruption of astrocyte function and demyelination of spinal cord, optic nerves, and particular brain regions. In this second of a 2-part article, we present further perspectives regarding the pathogenesis of NMO/SD and how this disease might be amenable to emerging technologies aimed at restoring immune tolerance to disease-implicated self-antigens. NMO/SD appears to be particularly well-suited for these strategies since aquaporin-4 has already been identified as the dominant autoantigen. The recent technical advances in reintroducing immune tolerance in experimental models of disease as well as in humans should encourage quantum leaps in this area that may prove productive for novel therapy. In this part of the article series, the potential for regulatory T and B cells is brought into focus, as are new approaches to oral tolerization. Finally, a roadmap is provided to help identify potential issues in clinical development and guide applications in tolerization therapy to solving NMO/SD through the use of emerging technologies. Each of these perspectives is intended to shine new light on potential cures for NMO/SD and other autoimmune diseases, while sparing normal host defense mechanisms. Restoring immune tolerance in neuromyelitis optica Part I Steinman, L., Bar-Or, A., Behne, J. M., Benitez-Ribas, D., Chin, P. S., Clare-Salzler, M., Healey, D., Kim, J. I., Kranz, D. M., Lutterotti, A., Martin, R., Schippling, S., Villoslada, P., Wei, C., Weiner, H. L., Zamvil, S. S., Yeaman, M. R., Smith, T. J., Guthy-Jackson Charitable Fdn Int Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and spectrum disorder (NMO/SD) represent a vexing process and its clinical variants appear to have at their pathogenic core the loss of immune tolerance to the aquaporin-4 water channel protein. This process results in a characteristic pattern of astrocyte dysfunction, loss, and demyelination that predominantly affects the spinal cord and optic nerves. Although several empirical therapies are currently used in the treatment of NMO/SD, none has been proven effective in prospective, adequately powered, randomized trials. Furthermore, most of the current therapies subject patients to long-term immunologic suppression that can cause serious infections and development of cancers. The following is the first of a 2-part description of several key immune mechanisms in NMO/SD that might be amenable to therapeutic restoration of immune tolerance. It is intended to provide a roadmap for how potential immune tolerance restorative techniques might be applied to patients with NMO/SD. This initial installment provides a background rationale underlying attempts at immune tolerization. It provides specific examples of innovative approaches that have emerged recently as a consequence of technical advances. In several autoimmune diseases, these strategies have been reduced to practice. Therefore, in theory, the identification of aquaporin-4 as the dominant autoantigen makes NMO/SD an ideal candidate for the development of tolerizing therapies or cures for this increasingly recognized disease. Genetic background modulates outcome of therapeutic amyloid peptides in treatment of neuroinflammation Kraus, A., Race, B., Phillips, K., Winkler, C., Saturday, G., Kurnellas, M., Rothbard, J. B., Groveman, B. R., Steinman, L., Caughey, B. Amyloid hexapeptide molecules are effective in the treatment of the murine model of neuroinflammation, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Efficacy however differs between two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and C57BL/10SnJ (B10). Amyloid hexapeptide treatments improved the clinical outcomes of B6, but not B10 mice, indicating that genetic background influences therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, although previous studies indicated that prion protein deficiency results in more severe EAE in B6 mice, we observed no such effect in B10 mice. In addition, we found that amyloid hexapeptide treatments of B10 and B6 mice elicited differential IL4 responses. Thus, the modulatory potential of prion protein and related treatments with other amyloid hexapeptides in EAE depends on mouse strain.

G., Marshall, P. L., Gebe, J. A., Ishak, H. D., Keswani, S. G., Bollyky, J., Frymoyer, A. R., Wight, T. N., Steinman, L., Bollyky, P. L. Recently, there has been considerable interest in using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) to inhibit hyaluronan synthesis in mouse models of cancer, autoimmunity, and a variety of other inflammatory disorders where hyaluronan (HA) has been implicated in disease pathogenesis. In order to facilitate future studies in this area, we have examined the dosing, treatment route, treatment duration, and metabolism of 4-MU in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Mice fed chow containing 5% 4-MU, a dose calculated to deliver 250 mg/mouse/day, initially lose substantial weight but typically resume normal weight gain after one week. It also takes up to a week to see a reduction in serum HA in these animals, indicating that at least a one-week loading period on the drug is required for most protocols. At steady state, over 90% of the drug is present in plasma as the glucuronidated metabolite 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (4-MUG), with the sulfated metabolite, 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (4-MUS) comprising most of the remainder. Chow containing 5% but not 0.65% 4-MU was effective at preventing disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis as well as in the DORmO mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. While oral 4-MU was effective at preventing EAE, daily intraperitoneal injections of 4-MU were not. Factors potentially affecting 4-MU uptake and plasma concentrations in mice include its taste, short half-life and low bioavailability. These studies provide a practical resource for implementing oral 4-MU treatment protocols in mice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

View details for CEACAM1 mediates B cell aggregation in central nervous system autoimmunity Rovituso, D. M., Scheffler, L., Wunsch, M., Kleinschnitz, C., Doerck, S., Ulzheimer, J., Bayas, A., Steinman, L., Erguen, S., Kuerten, S. B cell aggregates in the central nervous system (CNS) have been associated with rapid disease progression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we demonstrate a key role of carcinoembryogenic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule1 (CEACAM1) in B cell aggregate formation in MS patients and a B cell-dependent mouse model of MS. CEACAM1 expression was increased on peripheral blood B cells and CEACAM1(+) B cells were present in brain infiltrates of MS patients. Administration of the anti-CEACAM1 antibody T84.1 was efficient in blocking aggregation of B cells derived from MS patients. Along these lines, application of the monoclonal anti-CEACAM1 antibody mCC1 was able to inhibit CNS B cell aggregate formation and significantly attenuated established MS-like disease in mice in the absence of any adverse effects. CEACAM1 was co-expressed with the regulator molecule T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain -3 (TIM-3) on B cells, a novel molecule that has recently been described to induce anergy in T cells. Interestingly, elevated coexpression on B cells coincided with an autoreactive T helper cell phenotype in MS patients. Overall, these data identify CEACAM1 as a clinically highly interesting target in MS pathogenesis and open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the disease. Beginning of the end of two-stage theory purporting that inflammation then degeneration explains pathogenesis of progressive multiple sclerosis The review discusses future directions in research on multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, as long-held beliefs about these diseases are undermined with data from recent clinical trials.Results of clinical trials for registration (phase 3) were reported in the last year. Anti-inflammatory approaches, such as daclizumab high-yield process targeting IL-2 receptor, and ocrelizumab targeting CD20 B cells, confirmed a beneficial role of immune suppression in relapsing-remitting disease. And now for the first time achieving the primary end point in primary progressive multiple sclerosis was attained with ocrelizumab.The results in the past year challenge the long-held belief that relapsing-remitting disease is inflammatory, whereas progressive forms of the disease are 'less inflammatory' and more 'degenerative.'

D., Tangsombatvisit, S., Haynes, W. A., Diep, V., Steinman, L., Faix, J., Utz, P. J. Type I interferon (IFN) signaling is a central pathogenic pathway in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and therapeutics targeting type I IFN signaling are in development. Multiple proteins with overlapping functions play a role in IFN signaling, but the signaling events downstream of receptor engagement are unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the roles of the type I and type II IFN signaling components IFN-// receptor 2 (IFNAR-2), IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9), and STAT-1 in a mouse model of SLE.We used immunohistochemical staining and highly multiplexed assays to characterize pathologic changes in histology, autoantibody production, cytokine/chemokine profiles, and STAT phosphorylation in order to investigate the individual roles of IFNAR-2, IRF-9, and STAT-1 in MRL/lpr mice.We found that STAT-1(-/-) mice, but not IRF-9(-/-) or IFNAR-2(-/-) mice, developed interstitial nephritis characterized by infiltration with retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor t-positive lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. Despite pronounced interstitial kidney disease and abnormal kidney function, STAT-1(-/-) mice had decreased proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, and autoantibody production. Phosphospecific flow cytometry revealed shunting of STAT phosphorylation from STAT-1 to STAT-3/4.We describe unique contributions of STAT-1 to pathology in different kidney compartments in a mouse model, and provide potentially novel insight into tubulointerstitial nephritis, a poorly understood complication that predicts end-stage kidney disease in SLE patients.

To evaluate serum cytokine profiles for their utility to determine the heterogeneous responses to interferon (IFN)- treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).Patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or clinically isolated syndrome receiving de novo IFN- treatment were included in this prospective, observational study. Number of relapses and changes in disability were assessed 2 years prior to and 2 years after initiation of treatment. Sera were collected at baseline and after 3 months on therapy. Cytokine levels in sera were assessed by Luminex multiplex assays. Baseline cytokine profiles were grouped by hierarchical clustering analysis. Demographic features, changes in cytokines, and clinical outcome were then assessed in the clustered patient groups.A total of 157 patients were included in the study and clustered into 6 distinct subsets by baseline cytokine profiles. These subsets differed significantly in their clinical and biological response to IFN- therapy. Two subsets were associated with patients who responded poorly to therapy. Two other subsets, associated with a good response to therapy, showed a significant reduction in relapse rates and no worsening of disability. Each subset also had differential changes in cytokine levels after 3 months of IFN- treatment.There is heterogeneity in the immunologic pathways of the RRMS population, which correlates with IFN- response. Anti-Insulin Immune Responses Are Detectable in Dogs with Spontaneous Diabetes Kim, J., Furrow, E., Ritt, M. G., Utz, P. J., Robinson, W. H., Yu, L., Eckert, A., Stuebner, K., O'Brien, T. D., Steinman, L., Modiano, J. F. Diabetes mellitus occurs spontaneously in dogs. Although canine diabetes shares many features with human type-1 diabetes, there are differences that have cast doubt on the immunologic origin of the canine disease. In this study, we examined whether peripheral immune responses directed against islet antigens were present in dogs with diabetes. Routine diagnostics were used to confirm diabetic status, and serum samples from dogs with (N = 15) and without (N = 15) diabetes were analyzed for the presence of antibodies against islet antigens (insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulinoma-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase, and islet beta-cell zinc cation efflux transporter) using standard radioassays. Interferon- production from peripheral blood T cells stimulated by porcine insulin and by human insulin was tested using Elispot assays. Anti-insulin antibodies were detectable in a subset of diabetic dogs receiving insulin therapy. Pre-activated T cells and incipient insulin-reactive T cells in response to porcine or human insulin were identified in non-diabetic dogs and in dogs with diabetes. The data show that humoral and cellular anti-insulin immune responses are detectable in dogs with diabetes. This in turn provides support for the potential to ethically use dogs with diabetes to study the therapeutic potential of antigen-specific tolerance. The Safety of Adjuvanted Vaccines Revisited: Vaccine-Induced Narcolepsy Ahmed, S. S., Montomoli, E., Pasini, F. L., Steinman, L. Despite the very high benefit-to-risk ratio of vaccines, the fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in the reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis and diphtheria. This fear has been amplified more recently by multiple epidemiologic studies that confirmed the link of an AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine (Pandemrix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Germany) used in Europe during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [A(H1N1) pdm09] with the development of narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder, in children and adolescents. However, public misperceptions of what adjuvants are and why they are used in vaccines has created in some individuals a closed ""black box"" attitude towards all vaccines. The focus of this review article is to revisit this ""black box"" using the example of narcolepsy associated with the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine. View details for Multiplexed autoantigen microarrays identify HLA as a key driver of anti-desmoglein and -non-desmoglein reactivities in pemphigus PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Sajda, T., Hazelton, J., Patel, M., Seiffert-Sinha, K., Steinman, L., Robinson, W., Haab, B. B., Sinha, A. A. Patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) harbor antibodies reactive against self-antigens expressed at the surface of keratinocytes, primarily desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and, to a lesser extent, Dsg1. Conventionally, only antibodies targeting these molecules have been thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. This notion has been challenged by a growing pool of evidence that suggests that antibodies toward additional targets may play a role in disease. The aims of this study were to (i) establish high-throughput protein microarray technology as a method to investigate traditional and putative autoantibodies (autoAbs) in PV and (ii) use multiplexed protein array technology to define the scope and specificity of the autoAb response in PV. Our analysis demonstrated significant IgG reactivity in patients with PV toward the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes 3, 4, and 5 as well as thyroid peroxidase. Furthermore, we found that healthy first- and second-degree relatives of patients with PV express autoAbs toward desmoglein and non-Dsg targets. Our analysis also identified genetic elements, particularly HLA, as key drivers of autoAb expression. Finally, we show that patients with PV exhibit significantly reduced IgM reactivity toward disease-associated antigens relative to controls. The use of protein microarrays to profile the autoAb response in PV advanced the current understanding of disease and provided insight into the complex relationship between genetics and disease development. Hyaluronan synthesis is necessary for autoreactive T-cell trafficking, activation, and Th1 polarization. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Kuipers, H. F., Rieck, M., Gurevich, I., Nagy, N., Butte, M. J., Negrin, R. S., Wight, T. N., Steinman, L., Bollyky, P. L. The extracellular matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) accumulates at sites of autoimmune inflammation, including white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS), but its functional importance in pathogenesis is unclear. We have evaluated the impact of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an oral inhibitor of HA synthesis, on disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Treatment with 4-MU decreases the incidence of EAE, delays its onset, and reduces the severity of established disease. 4-MU inhibits the activation of autoreactive T cells and prevents their polarization toward a Th1 phenotype. Instead, 4-MU promotes polarization toward a Th2 phenotpye and induction of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Further, 4-MU hastens trafficking of T cells through secondary lymphoid organs, impairs the infiltration of T cells into the CNS parenchyma, and limits astrogliosis. Together, these data suggest that HA synthesis is necessary for disease progression in EAE and that treatment with 4-MU may be a potential therapeutic strategy in CNS autoimmunity. Considering that 4-MU is already a therapeutic, called hymecromone, that is approved to treat biliary spasm in humans, we propose that it could be repurposed to treat MS.

To study the safety profile and characterize the immunologic effects of high- vs low-dose cholecalciferol supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).In this double-blind, single-center randomized pilot study, 40 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were randomized to receive 10,400 IU or 800 IU cholecalciferol daily for 6 months. Assessments were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months.Mean increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from baseline to final visit was larger in the high-dose group (34.9 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.0-44.7 ng/mL) than in the low-dose group (6.9 ng/mL; 95% CI 1.0-13.7 ng/mL). Adverse events were minor and did not differ between the 2 groups. Two relapses occurred, one in each treatment arm. In the high-dose group, we found a reduction in the proportion of interleukin-17(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.016), CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.03), and effector memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.021) with a concomitant increase in the proportion of central memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.018) and naive CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.04). These effects were not observed in the low-dose group.Cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and tolerable in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS, which include reduction of interleukin-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and decreased proportion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells with concomitant increase in central memory CD4(+) T cells and naive CD4(+) T cells.This study provides Class I evidence that cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and well-tolerated in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects. Identification of Candidate Tolerogenic CD8(+) T Cell Epitopes for Therapy of Type 1 Diabetes in the NOD Mouse Model. Yu, C., Burns, J. C., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Ho, P. P., Steinman, L., Frey, A. B. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells are the target of self-reactive B and T cells. T cells reactive with epitopes derived from insulin and/or IGRP are critical for the initiation and maintenance of disease, but T cells reactive with other islet antigens likely have an essential role in disease progression. We sought to identify candidate CD8(+) T cell epitopes that are pathogenic in type 1 diabetes. Proteins that elicit autoantibodies in human type 1 diabetes were analyzed by predictive algorithms for candidate epitopes. Using several different tolerizing regimes using synthetic peptides, two new predicted tolerogenic CD8(+) T cell epitopes were identified in the murine homolog of the major human islet autoantigen zinc transporter ZnT8 (aa 158-166 and 282-290) and one in a non- cell protein, dopamine -hydroxylase (aa 233-241). Tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with a cDNA plasmid expressing full-length proinsulin prevented diabetes, whereas plasmids encoding ZnT8 and DH did not. However, tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with the proinsulin plasmid in combination with plasmids expressing ZnT8 and DH decreased insulitis and enhanced prevention of disease compared to vaccination with the plasmid encoding proinsulin alone.

Tissue Transglutaminase contributes to experimental multiple sclerosis pathogenesis and clinical outcome by promoting macrophage migration van Strien, M. E., de Vries, H. E., Chrobok, N. L., Bol, J. G., Breve, J. J., van der Pol, S. M., Kooij, G., van Buul, J. D., Karpuj, M., Steinman, L., Wilhelmus, M. M., Sestito, C., Drukarch, B., Van Dam, A. Multiple sclerosis is a serious neurological disorder, resulting in e.g., sensory, motor and cognitive deficits. A critical pathological aspect of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the influx of immunomodulatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS). Identification of key players that regulate cellular trafficking into the CNS may lead to the development of more selective treatment to halt this process. The multifunctional enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) can participate in various inflammation-related processes, and is known to be expressed in the CNS. In the present study, we question whether TG2 activity contributes to the pathogenesis of experimental MS, and could be a novel therapeutic target. In human post-mortem material, we showed the appearance of TG2 immunoreactivity in leukocytes in MS lesions, and particular in macrophages in rat chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (cr-EAE), an experimental MS model. Clinical deficits as observed in mouse EAE were reduced in TG2 knock-out mice compared to littermate wild-type mice, supporting a role of TG2 in EAE pathogenesis. To establish if the enzyme TG2 represents an attractive therapeutic target, cr-EAE rats were treated with TG2 activity inhibitors during ongoing disease. Reduction of TG2 activity in cr-EAE animals dramatically attenuated clinical deficits and demyelination. The mechanism underlying these beneficial effects pointed toward a reduction in macrophage migration into the CNS due to attenuated cytoskeletal flexibility and RhoA GTPase activity. Moreover, iNOS and TNF levels were selectively reduced in the CNS of cr-EAE rats treated with a TG2 activity inhibitor, whereas other relevant inflammatory mediators were not affected in CNS or spleen by reducing TG2 activity. We conclude that modulating TG2 activity opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in MS which does not affect peripheral levels of inflammatory mediators.

This region of EPO has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Use of a peptide sequence from this region provides the potential for an effective therapeutic without effects on erythropoiesis. The re-emergence of antigen-specific tolerance as a potential therapy for MS Ideal therapy for inflammatory disease in the nervous system would preserve normal immune function, while suppressing only the pathologic immune responses that damage tissue and allowing for repair. In principle, antigen-specific therapy would eradicate unwanted adaptive immune responses-antibody and T-cell mediated--while preserving the integrity of other adaptive responses to infectious agents and retaining the ability to fight malignancy. However, at this time, for multiple sclerosis (MS) we do not have compelling evidence that would support any particular dominant immune response to any specific antigen or even a limited group of antigens. In fact, there are adaptive immune responses to a wide swathe of proteins and lipids found on neurons and myelin in MS. Unless controlling a few of the known immune responses is sufficient, antigen-specific therapy in MS may not have enough of an impact to modulate clinical outcome. However, in other neuroinflammatory conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica, the adaptive immune response is highly focused. Trials of antigen-specific therapy for neuroinflammatory disease might first be tested in diseases with a more limited adaptive immune response like neuromyelitis optica. The likelihood of a significant success for this therapeutic strategy might then ensue.

View details for mir-181a-1/b-1 Modulates Tolerance through Opposing Activities in Selection and Peripheral T Cell Function Schaffert, S. A., Loh, C., Wang, S., Arnold, C. P., Axtell, R. C., Newell, E. W., Nolan, G., Ansel, K. M., Davis, M. M., Steinman, L., Chen, C. Understanding the consequences of tuning TCR signaling on selection, peripheral T cell function, and tolerance in the context of native TCR repertoires may provide insight into the physiological control of tolerance. In this study, we show that genetic ablation of a natural tuner of TCR signaling, mir-181a-1/b-1, in double-positive thymocytes dampened TCR and Erk signaling and increased the threshold of positive selection. Whereas mir-181a-1/b-1 deletion in mice resulted in an increase in the intrinsic reactivity of naive T cells to self-antigens, it did not cause spontaneous autoimmunity. Loss of mir-181a-1/b-1 dampened the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and reduced basal TCR signaling in peripheral T cells and their migration from lymph nodes to pathogenic sites. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tolerance can be modulated by microRNA gene products through the control of opposing activities in T cell selection and peripheral T cell function. View details for HDL-bound sphingosine-1-phosphate restrains lymphopoiesis and neuroinflammation. Blaho, V. A., Galvani, S., Engelbrecht, E., Liu, C., Swendeman, S. L., Kono, M., Proia, R. L., Steinman, L., Han, M. H., Hla, T. Lipid mediators influence immunity in myriad ways. For example, circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a key regulator of lymphocyte egress. Although the majority of plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle, the immunological functions of the ApoM-S1P complex are unknown. Here we show that ApoM-S1P is dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking yet restrains lymphopoiesis by activating the S1P1 receptor on bone marrow lymphocyte progenitors. Mice that lacked ApoM (Apom(-/-)) had increased proliferation of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) cKit(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells (LSKs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in bone marrow. Pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression of S1P1 suppressed LSK and CLP cell proliferation in vivo. ApoM was stably associated with bone marrow CLPs, which showed active S1P1 signalling in vivo. Moreover, ApoM-bound S1P, but not albumin-bound S1P, inhibited lymphopoiesis in vitro. Upon immune stimulation, Apom(-/-) mice developed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, characterized by increased lymphocytes in the central nervous system and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the ApoM-S1P-S1P1 signalling axis restrains the lymphocyte compartment and, subsequently, adaptive immune responses. Unique biological functions imparted by specific S1P chaperones could be exploited for novel therapeutic opportunities. Gaps in knowledge and prospects for research of adjuvanted vaccines Seder, R., Reed, S. G., O'Hagan, D., Malyala, P., D'Oro, U., Laera, D., Abrignani, S., Cerundolo, V., Steinman, L., Bertholet, S. A panel of researchers working in different areas of adjuvanted vaccines deliberated over the topic, ""Gaps in knowledge and prospects for research of adjuvanted vaccines"" at, ""Enhancing Vaccine Immunity and Value"" conference held in July 2014.

Abou-Hamdan, M., Costanza, M., Fontana, E., Di Dario, M., Musio, S., Congiu, C., Onnis, V., Lattanzi, R., Radaelli, M., Martinelli, V., Salvadori, S., Negri, L., Poliani, P. L., Farina, C., Balboni, G., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. To investigate the potential role of prokineticin 2 (PK2), a bioactive peptide involved in multiple biological functions including immune modulation, in CNS autoimmune demyelinating disease.We investigated the expression of PK2 in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), and in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. We evaluated the biological effects of PK2 on expression of EAE and on development of T-cell response against myelin by blocking PK2 in vivo with PK2 receptor antagonists. We treated with PK2 immune cells activated against myelin antigen to explore the immune-modulating effects of this peptide in vitro.Pk2 messenger RNA was upregulated in spinal cord and lymph node cells (LNCs) of mice with EAE. PK2 protein was expressed in EAE inflammatory infiltrates and was increased in sera during EAE. In patients with relapsing-remitting MS, transcripts for PK2 were significantly increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with healthy controls, and PK2 serum concentrations were significantly higher. A PK2 receptor antagonist prevented or attenuated established EAE in chronic and relapsing-remitting models, reduced CNS inflammation and demyelination, and decreased the production of interferon (IFN)- and interleukin (IL)-17A cytokines in LNCs while increasing IL-10. PK2 in vitro increased IFN- and IL-17A and reduced IL-10 in splenocytes activated against myelin antigen.These data suggest that PK2 is a critical immune regulator in CNS autoimmune demyelination and may represent a new target for therapy.

Y., Steinman, L. Natalizumab treatment alters peripheral CD4 cells counts in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, providing a way to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. The study was undertaken to assess whether CD4 cell counts correlate with different phases of natalizumab treatment of relapsing MS patients, including during a 12-week planned treatment interruption, and whether that might provide insights on lymphocyte trafficking. Clinical outcomes, MRI data, and CD4 cell counts were assessed at baseline prior to initiating natalizumab, while on regular dosing, at the end of the 12-week extended dosing interval, and at the time of reinitiation of natalizumab. The 12-week interruption was well tolerated and not associated with return of MS activity, disability progression, or new or worsened MRI data. Observed significant shifts in CD4 counts - dramatically increasing from the baseline while on treatment and decreasing back to the baseline level off treatment, then rising in a similar manner on natalizumab reinitiation, suggest that these measurements may aid in monitoring modulation of lymphocyte trafficking and cell redistribution. IFN- Treatment Requires B Cells for Efficacy in Neuroautoimmunity. Schubert, R. D., Hu, Y., Kumar, G., Szeto, S., Abraham, P., Winderl, J., Guthridge, J. M., Pardo, G., Dunn, J., Steinman, L., Axtell, R. C. IFN- remains the most widely prescribed treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Despite widespread use of IFN-, the therapeutic mechanism is still partially understood. Particularly, the clinical relevance of increased B cell activity during IFN- treatment is unclear. In this article, we show that IFN- pushes some B cells into a transitional, regulatory population that is a critical mechanism for therapy. IFN- treatment increases the absolute number of regulatory CD19(+)CD24(++)CD38(++) transitional B cells in peripheral blood relative to treatment-naive and Copaxone-treated patients. In addition, we found that transitional B cells from both healthy controls and IFN--treated MS patients are potent producers of IL-10, and that the capability of IFN- to induce IL-10 is amplified when B cells are stimulated. Similar changes are seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IFN- treatment increases transitional and regulatory B cell populations, as well as IL-10 secretion in the spleen. Furthermore, we found that IFN- increases autoantibody production, implicating humoral immune activation in B cell regulatory responses. Finally, we demonstrate that IFN- therapy requires immune-regulatory B cells by showing that B cell-deficient mice do not benefit clinically or histopathologically from IFN- treatment. These results have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Prolactin: A versatile regulator of inflammation and autoimmune pathology Costanza, M., Binart, N., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. Prolactin (PRL) has long been proposed as an immune-stimulating and detrimental factor in autoimmune disorders. However, recent findings have challenged this common view, showing that PRL does not play a crucial role in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS), and even protects against adjuvant-induced model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this review we provide a critical overview of data supporting a role for PRL in the regulation of immune responses. In addition, we focus on studies exploring the involvement of PRL in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, MS and RA, in light of the recently-outlined regenerative properties of this hormone. View details for B-Lymphocyte-Mediated Delayed Cognitive Impairment following Stroke. Doyle, K. P., Quach, L. N., Sol, M., Axtell, R. C., Nguyen, T. V., Soler-Llavina, G. J., Jurado, S., Han, J., Steinman, L., Longo, F. M., Schneider, J. A., Malenka, R. C., Buckwalter, M. S. Each year, 10 million people worldwide survive the neurologic injury associated with a stroke. Importantly, stroke survivors have more than twice the risk of subsequently developing dementia compared with people who have never had a stroke. The link between stroke and the later development of dementia is not understood. There are reports of oligoclonal bands in the CSF of stroke patients, suggesting that in some people a B-lymphocyte response to stroke may occur in the CNS. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke could contribute to the onset of dementia. We discovered that, in mouse models, activated B-lymphocytes infiltrate infarcted tissue in the weeks after stroke. B-lymphocytes undergo isotype switching, and IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies are found in the neuropil adjacent to the lesion. Concurrently, mice develop delayed deficits in LTP and cognition. Genetic deficiency, and the pharmacologic ablation of B-lymphocytes using an anti-CD20 antibody, prevents the appearance of delayed cognitive deficits. Furthermore, immunostaining of human postmortem tissue revealed that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke also occurs in the brain of some people with stroke and dementia. These data suggest that some stroke patients may develop a B-lymphocyte response to stroke that contributes to dementia, and is potentially treatable with FDA-approved drugs that target B cells. View details for Role reversal: infiltrating T cells protect the brain Inflammatory conditions intensify and then resolve, often sparing and recovering some of the injured tissue. While the ebb and flow of inflammation can be followed in many tissues, there is not a great deal of information on how inflammation regresses in the brain. In this issue of the JCI, Walsh, Hendrix, and colleagues illuminate a cellular mechanism whereby T cells that infiltrate the brain after nerve crush or contusion actually protect neurons from injury. These infiltrating T cells produce IL-4 and do so independently of a classic adaptive T cell immune response. The T cells respond to mediators produced by damaged neurons, without the classic three-way interaction among antigen, the major histocompatibility complex, and the T cell receptor. After brain injury, these protective T cells produce IL-4, which attenuates damage via IL-4 receptors on neurons.

Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England) Ideal therapy for inflammatory disease in the nervous system would preserve normal immune function, while suppressing only the pathologic immune responses that damage tissue and allowing for repair. In principle, antigen-specific therapy would eradicate unwanted adaptive immune responses-antibody and T-cell mediated--while preserving the integrity of other adaptive responses to infectious agents and retaining the ability to fight malignancy. However, at this time, for multiple sclerosis (MS) we do not have compelling evidence that would support any particular dominant immune response to any specific antigen or even a limited group of antigens. In fact, there are adaptive immune responses to a wide swathe of proteins and lipids found on neurons and myelin in MS. Unless controlling a few of the known immune responses is sufficient, antigen-specific therapy in MS may not have enough of an impact to modulate clinical outcome. However, in other neuroinflammatory conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica, the adaptive immune response is highly focused. Trials of antigen-specific therapy for neuroinflammatory disease might first be tested in diseases with a more limited adaptive immune response like neuromyelitis optica. The likelihood of a significant success for this therapeutic strategy might then ensue.

View details for Self-Assembling Peptides Form Immune Suppressive Amyloid Fibrils Effective in Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis. Amyloidogenic proteins have long been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. However, amyloid fibrils composed of six amino acids are protective in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decrease in the number of inflammatory foci in the parenchyma and meninges of the brain and spinal cord, and amelioration of the neurological signs of EAE when amyloid fibril-forming hexapeptides are administered reveal that some fibrils provide benefit. The therapeutic activity of the amyloid fibrils arise from diverse pathways that include binding of pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma, reduction of IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- levels, and induction of type 1 interferon (IFN). Type 1 IFN has been used widely as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of MS and has been shown to be therapeutic in EAE with adoptive transfer of Th1 lymphocytes. However, type 1 IFN is known to exacerbate EAE with adoptive transfer of Th17 lymphocytes. Indeed, the amyloid fibril-forming peptide Tau 623-628 was therapeutic in Th1 adoptively transferred EAE, but ineffective in Th17 adoptively transferred EAE. However, the therapeutic effect of Tau 623-628 was restored in IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) knockout mice, indicating that other immune pathways independent of type 1 IFN induction play a role in the amelioration of EAE. Moreover, Amylin 28-33, a polar, non-ionizable peptide that does not form fibrils as rapidly as Tau 623-628, induces a small fraction of type 1 IFN compared to Tau 623-628 and is therapeutic in Th17 EAE. The diverse immunological pathways modulated by the self-assembling hexapeptides are under investigation with a goal to develop novel, safe, and potent therapeutics for neuroinflammation. Gene expression analysis of histamine receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with clinically-isolated syndrome and different stages of multiple sclerosis Costanza, M., Di Dario, M., Steinman, L., Farina, C., Pedotti, R. Along with their established role in allergic reactions, histamine and its receptors have been implicated in the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In this study we analyzed the gene expression of histamine receptor 1 (HRH1), HRH2 and HRH4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, secondary-progressive (SP) MS, primary-progressive (PP) MS, and healthy controls (HC). We found that HRH1 transcript was significantly down-modulated in SP-MS compared with HC, and HRH4 was increased in this group compared to HC, CIS and RR-MS. No other differences in the expression of histamine receptors were observed between HC, CIS and other clinical forms of definite MS.

Their application of the animal model, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), for the discovery of Copaxone, opened a new path for testing of drug candidates in MS. By measuring clinical, pathologic, and immunologic outcomes, the biological implications of new drugs could be elucidated. Using EAE they established the efficacy of Copaxone as a therapy for preventing and reducing paralysis and inflammation in the central nervous system without massive immune suppression. This had a huge impact on the field of drug discovery for MS. Much like the use of parabiosis to discover soluble factors associated with obesity, or the replica plating system to probe antibiotic resistance in bacteria, the pioneering research on Copaxone using the EAE model, paved the way for the discovery of other therapeutics in MS, including Natalizumab and Fingolimod. Future applications of this approach may well elucidate novel therapies for the neurodegenerative phase of multiple sclerosis associated with disease progression. View details for Conflicting consequences of immunity to cancer versus autoimmunity to neurons: Insights from paraneoplastic disease Immunologists are well aware that cancer regression and increased patient survival with the use of checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, an antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, CTLA-4 (CD152), is accompanied by concomitant autoimmunity. For over 30 years, a small group of investigators have shown that the rare paraneoplastic syndromes are caused by immunity to shared antigens found on both tumors and on components of the nervous system. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Blachre et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2014. 44: 3240-3251] elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tolerance to neuronal antigens which share epitopes with oncologic antigens, observed in the context of paraneoplastic syndromes in mice. The presence of the shared tumor antigen on a nonhematopoietic cell underlies the basis for a certain level of tolerance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, preventing these cells from attacking the brain, but allowing them to lyse the tumor upon transfer into tumor-bearing recipient mice. Comparisons between the paraneoplastic syndromes and the new autoimmune conditions seen with antibodies to immune checkpoints at CD152 or at CD279 are likely to illuminate shared mechanisms and solutions to these vexing diseases.

The most significant developments in neuroimmunology will involve explorations of the roles for the immune system in neurodegenerative conditions often associated with the presence of amyloid deposits. Here I present my personal perspectives on four of the most intriguing challenges that we face in the future of neuroimmunology: (1) Why are the traditional hallmarks of innate and adaptive inflammation conspicuously absent from brains of individuals with prion disease and amyloid pathology? (2) What is the role of adaptive and innate immunity in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis? (3) Is molecular mimicry an adequate explanation for the initiation of neuroinflammatory disease and for exacerbations in conditions like multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, and neuromyelitis optica?

M., Mausberg, A. K., Cordes, S., El-Haddad, H., Partke, H., Leussink, V. I., Roden, M., Martin, S., Steinman, L., Hartung, H., Kieseier, B. C. The NOD mouse strain spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes. A deficiency in costimulatory molecules, such as B7-2, on the NOD genetic background prevents diabetes but instead triggers an inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. This constitutes a shift in the target of autoimmunity, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that NOD mice deficient for isoforms of ICAM-1, which comediate costimulatory functions, spontaneously develop a chronic autoimmune peripheral neuritis instead of diabetes. The disease is transferred by CD4(+) T cells, which infiltrate peripheral nerves together with macrophages and B cells and are autoreactive against peripheral myelin protein zero. These Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit unaltered numbers of regulatory T cells, but increased IL-17-producing T cells, which determine the severity, but not the target specificity, of autoimmunity. Ab-mediated ICAM-1 blockade triggers neuritis only in young NOD mice. Thymic epithelium from Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice features an altered expression of costimulatory molecules and induces neuritis and myelin autoreactivity after transplantation into nude mice in vivo. Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit a specifically altered TCR repertoire. Our findings introduce a novel animal model of chronic inflammatory neuropathies and indicate that altered expression of ICAM-1 on thymic epithelium shifts autoimmunity specifically toward peripheral nerves. This improves our understanding of autoimmunity in the peripheral nervous system with potential relevance for human diseases.

The CSF aquaporin-4 antibody levels during attacks (but not in sera) closely correlated with pleocytosis, inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 that can regulate antibody-producing plasmablasts, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in the CSF. The amount of aquaporin-4 antibodies present in the central nervous system may have therapeutic implications, as it is associated with astrocyte injury and inflammatory responses during NMOSD attacks.

We have been exploring the brains of multiple sclerosis patients to identify molecules that are associated with protection from inflammation and degeneration. In 2001 we noted that aB crystallin (cryab) was the most abundant transcript found in MS lesions, but not in healthy brains. Cryab can reverse paralysis and attenuate inflammation in several models of inflammation including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and various models of ischemia. Cryab is an amyloid forming molecule. We have identified a core structure common to many amyloids including amyloid protein A A4, tau, amylin, prion protein, serum amyloid protein P, and cryab. The core hexapeptide structure is highly immune suppressive and can reverse paralysis in EAE when administered systemically. Administration of this amyloid forming hexapeptide quickly lowers inflammatory cytokines in plasma like IL-6 and IL-2.

The beneficial properties of amyloid forming hexapeptides provide a potential new therapeutic direction.

Uncovering Cryptic Glycan Markers in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) Wang, D., Bhat, R., Sobel, R. A., Huang, W., Wang, L., Olsson, T., Steinman, L. Using an integrated antigen microarray approach, we observed epitope-spreading of autoantibody responses to a variety of antigenic structures in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in the serum of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These included previously described protein- and lipid-based antigenic targets and newly discovered autoimmunogenic sugar moieties, notably, autoantibodies specific for the oligomannoses in both MS patient CSF and the sera of mice with EAE. These glycans are often masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of cryptic autoantigens. We further determined that these targets are highly expressed on multiple cell types in MS and EAE lesions. Co-immunization of SJL/J mice with a Man9-KLH conjugate at the time of EAE induction elicited highly significant levels of anti-Man9-cluster autoantibodies. Nevertheless, this anti-glycan autoantibody response was associated with a significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE. The potential of these cryptic glycan markers and targeting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions of neurological disorders has yet to be explored.

View details for Development of therapies for autoimmune disease at Stanford: a tale of multiple shots and one goal The title of this contribution on Immunology at Stanford is purposely ambiguous. One goal is the development of safe and effective therapy for autoimmune diseases. Another definition of goal is to score, and this would ultimately mean the development of an approved drug. Indeed, the efforts in my four decades at Stanford, have included the discovery and subsequent development of a monoclonal antibody to block homing to the inflamed brain, leading to natalizumab, an approved therapeutic for two autoimmune diseases: relapsing-remitting MS and for inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple attempts to develop new therapies for autoimmune disease are described here: The trimolecular complex and the immune synapse serve as one major set of targets, with attempts to inhibit particular major histocompatibility molecules, the variable regions of the T cell receptor, and CD4. Other approaches focusing on antigen-specific tolerance include ongoing attempts with tolerizing DNA vaccines in type 1 diabetes. Finally, the repurposing of popular drugs approved for other indications, including statins and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme is under development and showing promise in the clinic, particularly for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The milieu within Stanford Immunology has helped to nurture these efforts to translate discoveries in immunology and to take them from bench to bedside. View details for Narcolepsy, 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza, and pandemic influenza vaccinations: What is known and unknown about the neurological disorder, the role for autoimmunity, and vaccine adjuvants Ahmed, S. S., Schur, P. H., MacDonald, N. E., Steinman, L. The vaccine safety surveillance system effectively detected a very rare adverse event, narcolepsy, in subjects receiving AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine made using the European inactivation/purification protocol. The reports of increased cases of narcolepsy in non-vaccinated subjects infected with wild A(H1N1) pandemic influenza virus suggest a role for the viral antigen(s) in disease development. However, additional investigations are needed to better understand what factor(s) in wild influenza infection trigger(s) narcolepsy in susceptible hosts. An estimated 31 million doses of European AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine were used in more than 47 countries. The Canadian AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine was used with high coverage in Canada where an estimated 12 million doses were administered. As no similar narcolepsy association has been reported to date with the AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine made using the Canadian inactivation/purification protocol, this suggests that the AS03 adjuvant alone may not be responsible for the narcolepsy association. To date, no narcolepsy association has been reported with the MF59-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine. This review article provides a brief background on narcolepsy, outlines the different types of vaccine preparations including the ones for influenza, reviews the accumulated evidence for the safety of adjuvants, and explores the association between autoimmune diseases and natural infections. It concludes by assimilating the historical observations and recent clinical studies to formulate a feasible hypothesis on why vaccine-associated narcolepsy may not be solely linked to the AS03 adjuvant but more likely be linked to how the specific influenza antigen component of the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine was prepared. Careful and long-term epidemiological studies of subjects who developed narcolepsy in association with AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine prepared with the European inactivation/purification protocol are needed. View details for Antiviral drug ganciclovir is a potent inhibitor of microglial proliferation and neuroinflammation. Ding, Z., Mathur, V., Ho, P. P., James, M. L., Lucin, K. M., Hoehne, A., Alabsi, H., Gambhir, S. S., Steinman, L., Luo, J., Wyss-Coray, T. Aberrant microglial responses contribute to neuroinflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases, but no current therapies target pathogenic microglia. We discovered unexpectedly that the antiviral drug ganciclovir (GCV) inhibits the proliferation of microglia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as in kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity. In EAE, GCV largely prevented infiltration of T lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) and drastically reduced disease incidence and severity when delivered before the onset of disease. In contrast, GCV treatment had minimal effects on peripheral leukocyte distribution in EAE and did not inhibit generation of antibodies after immunization with ovalbumin. Additionally, a radiolabeled analogue of penciclovir, [(18)F]FHBG, which is similar in structure to GCV, was retained in areas of CNS inflammation in EAE, but not in naive control mice, consistent with the observed therapeutic effects. Our experiments suggest GCV may have beneficial effects in the CNS beyond its antiviral properties. Neither T-helper type 2 nor Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells are necessary for therapeutic benefit of atorvastatin in treatment of central nervous system autoimmunity Weber, M. S., Prod'homme, T., Youssef, S., Dunn, S. E., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Oral atorvastatin has prevented or reversed paralysis in the multiple sclerosis (MS) model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and reduced development of new MS lesions in clinical trials. Besides inhibiting development of encephalitogenic T cells, atorvastatin treatment of EAE has been associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory myelin-reactive T-helper type (Th)-2 cells. To investigate the clinical significance of atorvastatin-mediated Th2 differentiation, we first evaluated atorvastatin treatment in interleukin (IL)-4 green fluorescent protein-enhanced transcript (4-GET) reporter mice. Atorvastatin treatment failed to induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo; however, when T cells from atorvastatin-treated 4-GET mice were reactivated in vitro, T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 cells, while antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor and IL-12) were reduced. Oral atorvastatin also prevented or reversed EAE in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-deficient (STAT6-/-) mice, which cannot generate IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Further, atorvastatin treatment did not induce or expand Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in either wild-type or STAT6-/- mice. In vivo proliferation of T cells, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, was inhibited in atorvastatin-treated wild-type and STAT6-/- mice. These data imply that atorvastatin ameliorates central nervous system autoimmune disease primarily by inhibiting proliferation of proinflammatory encephalitogenic T cells, and not simply through induction of anti-inflammatory Th2 cells. This cytostatic effect may be a relevant mechanism of action when considering use of statins in MS and other inflammatory conditions.

J., Lazovic, J., Housman, C., Antonetti, D. A., Koeller, D. M., Connor, J. R., Steinman, L. Metabolic stroke is the rapid onset of lasting central neurological deficit associated with decompensation of an underlying metabolic disorder. Glutaric aciduria type I (GA1) is an inherited disorder of lysine and tryptophan metabolism presenting with metabolic stroke in infancy. The clinical presentation includes bilateral striatal necrosis and spontaneous subdural and retinal hemorrhages, which has been frequently misdiagnosed as non-accidental head trauma. The mechanisms underlying metabolic stroke and spontaneous hemorrhage are poorly understood.Using a mouse model of GA1, we show that metabolic stroke progresses in the opposite sequence of ischemic stroke, with initial neuronal swelling and vacuole formation leading to cerebral capillary occlusion. Focal regions of cortical followed by striatal capillaries are occluded with shunting to larger non-exchange vessels leading to early filling and dilation of deep cerebral veins. Blood-brain barrier breakdown was associated with displacement of tight-junction protein Occludin.Together the current findings illuminate the pathophysiology of metabolic stroke and vascular compromise in GA1, which may translate to other neurometabolic disorders presenting with stroke.

CRYAB modulates the activation of CD4(+) T cells from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients Que Lan Quach, Q. L., Metz, L. M., Thomas, J. C., Rothbard, J. B., Steinman, L., Ousman, S. S. BACKGROUND: Suppression of activation of pathogenic CD4(+) T cells is a potential therapeutic intervention in multiple sclerosis (MS). We previously showed that a small heat shock protein, CRYAB, reduced T cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and clinical signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a model of MS. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether the ability of CRYAB to reduce the activation of T cells translated to the human disease. METHODS: CD4(+) T cells from healthy controls and volunteers with MS were activated in vitro in the presence or absence of a CRYAB peptide (residues 73-92). Parameters of activation (proliferation rate, cytokine secretion) and tolerance (anergy, activation-induced cell death, microRNAs) were evaluated. RESULTS: The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CD4(+) T cells was decreased in the presence of CRYAB in a subset of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) participants with mild disease severity while no changes were observed in healthy controls. Further, there was a correlation for higher levels of miR181a microRNA, a marker upregulated in tolerant CD8(+) T cells, in CD4(+) T cells of MS patients that displayed suppressed cytokine production (responders). CONCLUSION: CRYAB may be capable of suppressing the activation of CD4(+) T cells from a subset of RRMS patients who appear to have less disability but similar age and disease duration. View details for Clinical optimization of antigen specific modulation of type 1 diabetes with the plasmid DNA platform Gottlieb, P., Utz, P. J., Robinson, W., Steinman, L. Some clinical trials in humans have aimed at modulation of type 1 diabetes (T1D) via alteration of the immune response to putative islet cell antigens, particularly proinsulin and insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase and the peptide, DiaPep 277, derived from heat shock protein 60. The focus here is on development of a specially engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin to treat T1D. The plasmid is engineered to turn off adaptive immunity to proinsulin. This approach yielded exciting results in a randomized placebo controlled trial in 80 adult patients with T1D. The implications of this trial are explored in regards to the potential for sparing inflammation in islets and thus allowing the functioning beta cells to recover and produce more insulin. Strategies to further strengthen the effects seen thus far with the tolerizing DNA plasmid to proinsulin will be elucidated. The DNA platform affords an opportunity for easy modifications. In addition standard exploration of dose levels, route of administration and frequency of dose are practical. Optimization of the effects seen to date on C-peptide and on depletion of proinsulin specific CD8 T cells are feasible, with expected concomitant improvement in other parameters like hemoglobin A1c and reduction in insulin usage. T1D is one of the few autoimmune conditions where antigen specific therapy can be achieved, provided the approach is tested intelligently. Tolerizing DNA vaccines to proinsulin and other islet cell autoantigens is a worthy pursuit to potentially treat, prevent and to perhaps even 'cure' or 'prevent' type 1 diabetes. View details for Serum autoantibodies to myelin peptides distinguish acute disseminated encephalomyelitis from relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England) Van Haren, K., Tomooka, B. H., Kidd, B. A., Banwell, B., Bar-Or, A., Chitnis, T., Tenembaum, S. N., Pohl, D., Rostasy, K., Dale, R. C., O'Connor, K. C., Hafler, D. A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) share overlapping clinical, radiologic and laboratory features at onset. Because autoantibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, we sought to identify autoantibody biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing them. METHODS: We used custom antigen arrays to profile anti-myelin-peptide autoantibodies in sera derived from individuals with pediatric ADEM (n = 15), pediatric multiple sclerosis (Ped MS; n = 11) and adult MS (n = 15). Using isotype-specific secondary antibodies, we profiled both IgG and IgM reactivities. We used Statistical Analysis of Microarrays software to confirm the differences in autoantibody reactivity profiles between ADEM and MS samples. We used Prediction Analysis of Microarrays software to generate and validate prediction algorithms, based on the autoantibody reactivity profiles. RESULTS: ADEM was characterized by IgG autoantibodies targeting epitopes derived from myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein, and alpha-B-crystallin. In contrast, MS was characterized by IgM autoantibodies targeting myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte-specific protein. We generated and validated prediction algorithms that distinguish ADEM serum (sensitivity 62-86%; specificity 56-79%) from MS serum (sensitivity 40-87%; specificity 62-86%) on the basis of combined IgG and IgM anti-myelin autoantibody reactivity to a small number of myelin peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Combined profiles of serum IgG and IgM autoantibodies identified myelin antigens that may be useful for distinguishing MS from ADEM. Further studies are required to establish clinical utility. Further biological assays are required to delineate the pathogenic potential of these antibodies.

The Interdependent, Overlapping, and Differential Roles of Type I and II IFNs in the Pathogenesis of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Naves, R., Singh, S. P., Cashman, K. S., Rowse, A. L., Axtell, R. C., Steinman, L., Mountz, J. D., Steele, C., De Sarno, P., Raman, C. Type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) and type II IFN (IFN-) mediate both regulation and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the underlying mechanism for these Janus-like activities of type I and II IFNs in neuroinflammation remains unclear. Although endogenous type I IFN signaling provides a protective response in neuroinflammation, we find that when IFN- signaling is ablated, type I IFNs drive inflammation, resulting in exacerbated EAE. IFN- has a disease stage-specific opposing function in EAE. Treatment of mice with IFN- during the initiation phase of EAE leads to enhanced severity of disease. In contrast, IFN- treatment during the effector phase attenuated disease. This immunosuppressive activity of IFN- required functional type I IFN signaling. In IFN-/ receptor-deficient mice, IFN- treatment during effector phase of EAE exacerbated disease. Using an adoptive transfer EAE model, we found that T cell-intrinsic type I and II IFN signals are simultaneously required to establish chronic EAE by encephalitogenic Th1 cells. However, in Th17 cells loss of either IFN signals leads to the development of a severe chronic disease. The data imply that type I and II IFN signals have independent but nonredundant roles in restraining encephalitogenic Th17 cells in vivo. Collectively, our data show that type I and II IFNs function in an integrated manner to regulate pathogenesis in EAE.

IMPORTANCE High serum levels of interleukin 17F (IL-17F) at baseline have been associated with suboptimal response to interferon beta in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE To further investigate the role of IL-17F in predicting treatment response to interferon beta-1b in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis using the Singulex Erenna IL-17F immunoassay. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Serum samples were analyzed from 239 randomly selected patients treated with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years in the Betaferon Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose Study. EXPOSURE Treatment with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Levels of IL-17F at baseline and month 6 as well as the difference between the IL-17F levels at month 6 and baseline were compared between the following: (1) patients with less disease activity vs more disease activity; (2) patients with no disease activity vs some disease activity; and (3) responders vs nonresponders. RESULTS Levels of IL-17F measured at baseline and month 6 did not correlate with lack of response to treatment after 2 years using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Relapses and new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were not associated with pretreatment serum IL-17F levels. When patients with neutralizing antibodies were excluded, the results did not change. All patients with levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL were associated with poor response with some clinical or radiological activity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An increase of IL-17F before and early after treatment with interferon beta-1b was not associated with poor response. These data do not support the value of IL-17F as a treatment response indicator for therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis with interferon beta, although high levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL may predict nonresponsiveness. View details for Th17 cells induce Th1-polarizing monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Davidson, M. G., Alonso, M. N., Yuan, R., Axtell, R. C., Kenkel, J. A., Suhoski, M. M., Gonzlez, J. C., Steinman, L., Engleman, E. G. In chronically inflamed tissues, such as those affected by autoimmune disease, activated Th cells often colocalize with monocytes. We investigate in this study how murine Th cells influence the phenotype and function of monocytes. The data demonstrate that Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets promote the differentiation of autologous monocytes into MHC class II(+), CD11b(+), CD11c(+) DC that we call DCTh. Although all Th subsets induce the formation of DCTh, activated Th17 cells uniquely promote the formation of IL-12/IL-23-producing DCTh (DCTh17) that can polarize both naive and Th17 cells to a Th1 phenotype. In the inflamed CNS of mice with Th17-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Th cells colocalize with DC, as well as monocytes, and the Th cells obtained from these lesions drive the formation of DCTh that are phenotypically indistinguishable from DCTh17 and polarize naive T cells toward a Th1 phenotype. These results suggest that DCTh17 are critical in the interplay of Th17- and Th1-mediated responses and may explain the previous finding that IL-17-secreting Th cells become IFN--secreting Th1 cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and other autoimmune disorders.

A., Chow, L. M., Ibrahim, A., Baker, S. J., Barres, B. A., Steinman, L., Brunet, A. Oligodendrocytes-the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system-can be regenerated during adulthood. In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. The gender gap in multiple sclerosis: intersection of science and society. Type I Interferons: Beneficial in Th1 and Detrimental in Th17 Autoimmunity In relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), type I interferon (IFN) is considered immuno-modulatory, and recombinant forms of IFN- are the most prescribed treatment for this disease. However, within the RRMS population, 30-50% of MS patients are nonresponsive to this treatment, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a disease once considered to be a form of RRMS. In contrast to RRMS, type I IFNs have been shown to have properties that drive the inflammatory pathologies in many other autoimmune diseases. These diseases include Sjgren's syndrome, system lupus erythematosus (SLE), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Historically, autoimmune diseases were thought to be driven by a TH1 response to auto-antigens. However, since the discovery of the TH17 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is now generally thought that TH17 plays an important role in MS and all other autoimmune diseases. In this article, we will discuss recent clinical and basic research advances in the field of autoimmunity and argue that IFN- and other type I IFNs are immuno-modulatory in diseases driven predominantly by TH1 but in contrast are inflammatory in diseases that have a predominant Th17 response.

A recent type 1 diabetes (T1D) clinical trial of rituximab (a B cell-depleting anti-CD20 antibody) achieved some therapeutic benefit in preserving C-peptide for a period of approximately nine months in patients with recently diagnosed diabetes. Our previous data in the NOD mouse demonstrated that co-administration of antigen (insulin) with anti-CD3 antibody (a T cell-directed immunomodulator) offers better protection than either entity alone, indicating that novel combination therapies that include a T1D-related autoantigen are possible. To accelerate the identification and development of novel combination therapies that can be advanced into the clinic, we have evaluated the combination of a mouse anti-CD20 antibody with either oral insulin or a proinsulin-expressing DNA vaccine. Anti-CD20 alone, given once or on 4 consecutive days, produced transient B cell depletion but did not prevent or reverse T1D in the NOD mouse. Oral insulin alone (twice weekly for 6 weeks) was also ineffective, while proinsulin DNA (weekly for up to 12 weeks) showed a trend toward modest efficacy. Combination of anti-CD20 with oral insulin was ineffective in reversing diabetes in NOD mice whose glycemia was controlled with SC insulin pellets; these experiments were performed in three independent labs. Combination of anti-CD20 with proinsulin DNA was also ineffective in diabetes reversal, but did show modest efficacy in diabetes prevention (p = 0.04). In the prevention studies, anti-CD20 plus proinsulin resulted in modest increases in Tregs in pancreatic lymph nodes and elevated levels of proinsulin-specific CD4+ T-cells that produced IL-4. Thus, combination therapy with anti-CD20 and either oral insulin or proinsulin does not protect hyperglycemic NOD mice, but the combination with proinsulin offers limited efficacy in T1D prevention, potentially by augmentation of proinsulin-specific IL-4 production.

Natalizumab was granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004, only 12 years after its molecular target was cloned. Shortly after initial approval, natalizumab use was suspended pending a safety review when several natalizumab recipients were diagnosed as having progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. After the safety review, natalizumab was reintroduced to the market in 2006. Since then, more than 92,000 patients have been treated with the drug. Risk stratification algorithms and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy management strategies have been developed, which facilitate more personalized decision making and safer natalizumab use. This review article summarizes the evolution of natalizumab from target molecule discovery through regulatory approval, voluntary suspension, reapproval, and clinical use. The natalizumab story highlights both the opportunities and risks inherent in a novel biological therapy for a progressive neurologic disease.

There is a significant unmet need for serum biomarkers in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) that are predictive of therapeutic response to disease-modifying therapies. Following a recent Stanford study which reported that pretreatment levels of serum interleukin (IL)-17F could predict poor response to interferon- (IFN) therapy, we sought to validate the finding using samples from a large clinical trial.The validation cohort included 54 good responders (GR) and 64 poor responders (PR) selected from 762 subjects with RRMS from the IM IFN-1a dose comparison study (Avonex study C94-805). Subjects were classified as GR and PR based on the number of relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and new and enlarging T2 lesions on MRI. Serum samples were assayed for IL-17F using a multiplexed Luminex assay and for IL-17F/F using an ELISA. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study were also assayed to assure reproducibility of methods.Median pretreatment and post-treatment serum IL-17F levels were not statistically significantly different between GR and PR, and serum IL-7/IL-17F ratios were also not predictive of response status. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study showed good correlation to their original cohort (r = 0.77).We were unable to validate the finding that serum IL-17F is a predictor of PR in a large independent cohort of subjects with RRMS. Differences in patient populations and methodology might explain the failure to validate the results from the Stanford study.

Not only are the linguistic concepts expressed in the words ""synapse"" and ""memory"" shared between the fields, but the actual molecules of physiologic importance in one system play parallel roles in the other: complement, the major histocompatibility molecules, and even ""neuro""-transmitters all have major impacts on health and on disease in both the brain and the immune system. Not only are the same molecules found in diverse roles in each system, but we have learned that there is real ""hard-wired"" crosstalk between nerves and lymphoid organs. This issue of the JCI highlights some of the lessons learned from experts who are working at this scintillating intersection between immunology and neuroscience.

Historically, small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) have been extensively studied in the context of being intracellular molecular chaperones. However, recent studies looking at the role of sHSPs in neurological diseases have demonstrated a near universal upregulation of certain sHSPs in damaged and diseased brains. Initially, it was thought that sHSPs are pathological in these disease states because they are found in the areas of damage. However, transgenic overexpression and exogenous administration of sHSPs in various experimental disease paradigms have shown just the contrary - that sHSPs are protective, not pathological. This review examines sHSPs in neurological diseases and highlights the potential for using these neuroprotective sHSPs as novel therapeutics. It first addresses the endogenous expression of sHSPs in a variety of neurological disorders. Although many studies have examined the expression of sHSPs in neurological diseases, there are no review articles summarizing these data. Furthermore, it focuses on recent studies that have investigated the therapeutic potential of sHSPs for neurological diseases.

A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination. Although considered a T cell-mediated disease, multiple sclerosis involves the activation of both adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as resident cells of the central nervous system, which synergize in inducing inflammation and thereby demyelination. Differentiation, survival, and inflammatory functions of innate immune cells and of astrocytes of the central nervous system are regulated by tyrosine kinases. Here, we show that imatinib, sorafenib, and GW2580-small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors-can each prevent the development of disease and treat established disease in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In vitro, imatinib and sorafenib inhibited astrocyte proliferation mediated by the tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), whereas GW2580 and sorafenib inhibited macrophage tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production mediated by the tyrosine kinases c-Fms and PDGFR, respectively. In vivo, amelioration of disease by GW2580 was associated with a reduction in the proportion of macrophages and T cells in the CNS infiltrate, as well as a reduction in the levels of circulating TNF. Our findings suggest that GW2580 and the FDA-approved drugs imatinib and sorafenib have potential as novel therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune demyelinating disease.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is predominantly produced by T helper 17 cells distinct from T helper 1 or T helper 2 cells, participates in the pathogenesis of infectious, autoimmune, and allergic disorders. However, the precise role in allograft rejection remains uncertain. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17 in acute allograft rejection using IL-17-deficient mice.Donor hearts from FVB mice were heterotopically transplanted into either C57BL/6J-IL-17-deficient (IL-17(-/-)) or -wild-type mice. Allograft survival was significantly prolonged in IL-17(-/-) recipient mice due to reduced local inflammation accompanied by decreased inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine expression. IL-17(-/-) recipient mice exhibited decreased IL-6 production and reciprocally enhanced regulatory T cell expansion, suggesting a contribution of regulatory T cells to prolonged allograft survival. Indeed, allografts transplanted into anti-CD25 mAb-treated IL-17(-/-) recipient mice (regulatory T cell-depleted) developed acute rejection similar to wild-type recipient mice. Surprisingly, we found that gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were key IL-17 producers in the allografts. In support, equivalent allograft rejection was observed in Rag-2(-/-) recipient mice engrafted with either wild-type or IL-17(-/-) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Finally, hearts transplanted into gamma delta T cell-deficient mice resulted in decreased allograft rejection compared with wild-type controls.During heart transplantation, (1) IL-17 is crucial for acceleration of acute rejection; (2) IL-17-deficiency enhances regulatory T cell expansion; and (3) gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are a potential source of IL-17. IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

L., Liu, H., Rohowsky-Kochan, C., Ichiyama, K., Yoshimura, A., Steinman, L., Christakos, S., Youssef, S. A new class of inflammatory CD4(+) T cells that produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) (termed Th17) has been identified, which plays a critical role in numerous inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3. Our results describe novel mechanisms and new concepts with regard to vitamin D and the immune system and suggest therapeutic targets for the control of autoimmune diseases.

The interleukin-7 receptor chain (IL-7R) gene was identified as a top non-major histocompatibility complex-linked risk locus for multiple sclerosis (MS). Recently, we showed that a T helper 1 (T(H)1)-driven, but not a T(H)17-driven, form of MS exhibited a good clinical response to interferon- (IFN-) therapy. We now demonstrate that high serum levels of IL-7, particularly when paired with low levels of IL-17F, predict responsiveness to IFN- and hence a T(H)1-driven subtype of MS. We also show that although IL-7 signaling is neither necessary nor sufficient for the induction or expansion of T(H)17 cells, IL-7 can greatly enhance both human and mouse T(H)1 cell differentiation. IL-7 alone is sufficient to induce human T(H)1 differentiation in the absence of IL-12 or other cytokines. Furthermore, targeting IL-7/IL-7R is beneficial in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Mice treated with IL-7R-blocking antibodies before or after onset of paralysis exhibited reduced clinical signs of EAE, with reduction in peripheral nave and activated T cells, whereas central memory T, regulatory T, B, and natural killer cell populations were largely spared. IL-7R antibody treatment markedly reduced lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system in mice with EAE. Thus, a serum profile of high IL-7 may signify a T(H)1-driven form of MS and may predict outcome in MS patients undergoing IFN- therapy. Blockade of IL-7 and the IL-7R pathway may have therapeutic potential in MS and other autoimmune diseases.

H., Chung, J., Itoh, S., Rothbard, J., Yang, P. C., Steinman, L., Robbins, R. C., Fischbein, M. P. This study investigates the protective effect of exogenous B-crystallin (CryAB) on myocardial function after ischemia-reperfusion injury.Mice underwent temporary left anterior descending artery occlusion for 30 minutes. Either CryAB (50 g) or phosphate-buffered saline (100 L [n=6, each group]) were injected in the intramyocardial medial and lateral perinfarct zone 15 minutes before reperfusion. Intraperitoneal injections were administered every other day. Left ventricular ejection fraction was evaluated on postoperative day 40 with magnetic resonance imaging. To investigate the effect of CryAB on apoptosis after hypoxia/reoxygenation in vitro, murine atrial cardiomyocytes (HL-1 cells) or human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were incubated with either 50 g CryAB (500 g /10 mL) or phosphate-buffered saline in a hypoxia chamber for 6, 12, and 24 hours, followed by 30 minutes of reoxygenation at room air. Apoptosis was then assessed by western blot (Bcl-2, free bax, cleaved caspases-3, 9, PARP) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses (cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments and caspase-3 activity).On postoperative day 40, CryAB-treated mice had a 1.8-fold increase in left ventricular ejection fraction versus control mice (27%6% versus 15%4% SD, p<0.005). In vitro, (1) the HL-1 cells showed no significant difference in apoptotic protein expression, cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, or caspase-3 activity; (2) the HMEC-1 cells had increased but not significant apoptotic protein expression with, however, a significant decrease in cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (1.5-fold, p<0.01) and caspase-3 activity (2.7-fold, p<0.005).Exogenous CryAB administration significantly improves cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion injury, in vivo. The protective anti-apoptotic affects of CryAB may target the endothelial cell.

Total serum 25(OH)D levels were measured using the DiaSorin Liaison Assay during the third trimester and 2, 4, and 6 months after giving birth. The data were analyzed using longitudinal multivariable methods.Levels of 25(OH)D and relapse rate.Fourteen (50%) women breastfed exclusively, and 12 women (43%) relapsed within 6 months after giving birth. During pregnancy, the average 25(OH)D levels were 25.4 ng/mL (range, 13.7-42.6) and were affected only by season (P=.009). In contrast, in the postpartum period, 25(OH)D levels were significantly affected by breastfeeding and relapse status. Levels of 25(OH)D remained low in the exclusive breastfeeding group, yet rose significantly in the nonexclusive breastfeeding group regardless of season (P=.007, unadjusted; P=.02, adjusted for season). By 4 and 6 months after childbirth, 25(OH)D levels were, on average, 5 ng/mL lower in the women who breastfed exclusively compared with the nonbreastfeeding group (P=.001).Pregnancy and exclusive breastfeeding are strongly associated with low 25(OH)D levels in women with MS. However, these lower vitamin D levels were not associated with an increased risk of postpartum MS relapses. These data suggest that low vitamin D in isolation is not an important risk factor for postpartum MS relapses. View details for Common variants in P2RY11 are associated with narcolepsy Kornum, B.

Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that narcolepsy with cataplexy is an autoimmune disease. We here report genome-wide association analyses for narcolepsy with replication and fine mapping across three ethnic groups (3,406 individuals of European ancestry, 2,414 Asians and 302 African Americans). We identify a SNP in the 3' untranslated region of P2RY11, the purinergic receptor subtype P2Y gene, which is associated with narcolepsy (rs2305795, combined P = 6.1 10, odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.39, n = 5689). The disease-associated allele is correlated with reduced expression of P2RY11 in CD8(+) T lymphocytes (339% reduced, P = 0.003) and natural killer (NK) cells (P = 0.031), but not in other peripheral blood mononuclear cell types. The low expression variant is also associated with reduced P2RY11-mediated resistance to ATP-induced cell death in T lymphocytes (P = 0.0007) and natural killer cells (P = 0.001). These results identify P2RY11 as an important regulator of immune-cell survival, with possible implications in narcolepsy and other autoimmune diseases.

N., Srinagesh, H., Axtell, R., Zhang, H., Platten, M., Wyss-Coray, T., Steinman, L. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key hormonal system regulating blood pressure. However, expression of RAAS components has recently been detected in immune cells, and the RAAS has been implicated in several mouse models of autoimmune disease. Here, we have identified Ang II as a paracrine mediator, sustaining inflammation in the CNS in the EAE mouse model of MS via TGF-beta. Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) were found to be primarily expressed in CNS-resident cells during EAE. In vitro, astrocytes and microglia responded to Ang II treatment by inducing TGF-beta expression via a pathway involving the TGF-beta-activating protease thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). TGF-beta upregulation in astrocytes and microglia during EAE was blocked with candesartan (CA), an inhibitor of AT1R. Treatment of EAE with CA ameliorated paralysis and blunted lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS, outcomes that were also seen with genetic ablation of AT1Ra and treatment with an inhibitor of TSP-1. These data suggest that AT1R antagonists, frequently prescribed as antihypertensives, may be useful to interrupt this proinflammatory, CNS-specific pathway in individuals with MS.

M., Bsibsi, M., Gerritsen, W. H., van der Valk, P., Bajramovic, J. J., Steinman, L., Amor, S. We present the first comparative analysis of serum immunoglobulin G reactivity profiles against the full spectrum of human myelin-associated proteins in multiple sclerosis patients and healthy control subjects. In both groups, serum antibodies display a consistent and prominent reaction to alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) versus other myelin proteins. As an apparently major target for the adaptive immune system in humans, CRYAB selectively accumulates in oligodendrocytes, but not in astrocytes, or axons in so-called preactive multiple sclerosis lesions. These are clusters of activated HLA-DR-expressing microglia in myelinated normal-appearing white matter with no obvious leukocyte infiltration. They are found in most multiple sclerosis patients at all stages of disease. In these lesion areas, CRYAB in oligodendrocytes may come directly in contact with activated HLA-DR+ microglia. We demonstrate that CRYAB activates innate responses by microglia by stimulating the secretion of leukocyte-recruiting factors, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 17, CCL5, and CCL1, and immune-regulatory cytokines such as interleukin 10, transforming growth factor-beta, and interleukin 13. Together, these data suggest that CRYAB accumulation in preactive lesions may be part of a reversible reparative local response that involves both oligodendrocytes and microglia. At the same time, however, accumulated CRYAB may represent a major target for adaptive immune responses that could contribute to progression of preactive lesions to a stage of demyelination.

Although interleukin-17 (IL-17) has been reported to participate in the pathogenesis of infectious, autoimmune and allergic disorders, the precise role in allograft rejection remains uncertain. This study illustrates that IL-17 contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic allograft rejection.Utilizing a murine heterotopic heart transplant model system, IL-17-deficient recipient mice had decreased allograft inflammatory cell recruitment, decreased IL-6, MCP-1, and KC production, and reduced graft coronary artery disease (GCAD). Intragraft gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells appear to be the predominant source of IL-17 production.Therefore, IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

P., Steinman, L., Utz, P. J., Ho, P. P. Activation of the innate immune system by DNA containing hypomethylated CpG motifs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we examined the consequences of immunostimulatory CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and inhibitory GpG-ODN treatment in the NZB x NZW F1 (NZB/W) murine model of SLE. Beginning at 5 months of age, we administered CpG-ODN or GpG-ODN at regular intervals to female NZB/W animals. We also determined the effects of ODN administration on NZB/W mouse lymphocyte function, and the specificity of ODN binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) other than TLR-9. While CpG-ODN treatment did not appear to have a major impact on disease severity, GpG-ODN treatment significantly delayed the onset of proteinuria in NZB/W mice. Interestingly, short-term GpG-ODN treatment promoted Th2-type T and B cell responses, and inhibited B lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. On the other hand, extended GpG-ODN treatment did not result in sustained Th2 responses or significantly reduced renal disease. Moreover, the binding of CpG-ODN and GpG-ODN was not restricted to TLR-9 as both ODNs also interacted with TLR-3, TLR-7, and TLR-8. Taken together, the data indicate that the protective mechanism of GpG-ODN treatment in the NZB/W model of lupus nephritis involves modulating T cell cytokine profiles and B lymphocyte activation through the inhibition of several TLRs, including TLR-7 and TLR-9.

Intervention We prospectively followed up the pregnant women with MS and the age-matched, pregnant controls; conducted structured interviews; and collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells during each trimester and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post partum.Sixteen functional cell types, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)- and tumor necrosis factor-producing T-cell subsets, were measured using multicolor flow cytometry. Since these cell types may also fluctuate with pregnancy, lactational amenorrhea, or MS treatment, the data were analyzed taking into account these factors.Fifteen women with MS (58%) had relapses during the postpartum year. CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells fluctuated with MS relapses, declining during pregnancy in women with MS (P < .001) and continuing to decline after parturition in women with relapses (P = .001), yet rising or remaining stable in women with nonrelapsing MS or healthy pregnant women. Lactational amenorrhea was associated with a rise in CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells in women with MS (P = .009). In contrast, CD4(+) tumor necrosis factor-producing cells decreased during lactational amenorrhea in all groups of women and, once this was taken into account, obscured any relationship to MS relapses. CD8(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells were elevated in women with MS throughout the study (P < .001) but did not fluctuate with relapses.Our findings suggest that a decline in circulating CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells leads to postpartum MS relapses. Our findings also suggest that the decline in these cells may begin during late pregnancy and that lactational amenorrhea induced by exclusive breastfeeding may be able to interrupt this process.

Little is known about the acute hospitalization costs and characteristics. We examined the trends in MS hospitalizations from 1993 to 2006.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was searched using the ICD-9 code 340 (MS). Diagnostic, treatment and administrative data were analyzed using basic statistical software.A total of 288,454 hospital admissions with the primary diagnosis of MS occurred between 1993 and 2006, an average of 20,604 admissions annually. The percentage admitted from the emergency department (ED) increased from 19.4 to 60.0% during 1993-2006. The mean cost for each inpatient increased from USD 7,965 to 20,076. The percentage of discharges to home health care increased from 8.6 to 14.9%, and the percentage of discharges to nursing homes and rehabilitation services increased from 8.3 to 22.6%. In 2006, Medicaid patients were significantly more likely to be admitted from the ED (p < 0.001). Medicare payers were significantly more likely to be discharged to a nursing home/rehabilitation (p < 0.0001).National health insurance policies have made measurable effects on MS disease management. MS is becoming more expensive to treat acutely, and improved treatment modalities geared toward decreasing acute flare-ups may provide substantial cost savings by reducing ED visits, inpatient hospitalizations and the need for rehabilitation.

To determine whether autoimmunity against fibrinogen can mediate inflammatory arthritis, we immunized a variety of common mouse strains with fibrinogen and found that DBA/1 and SJL mice developed an inflammatory and erosive arthritis. Mice with fibrinogen-induced arthritis (FIA) possess fibrinogen-reactive T cells that produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. FIA can be adoptively transferred with either plasma or fibrinogen-specific T cells from diseased mice. Mice with FIA possess rheumatoid factor, circulating immune complexes, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide Abs, all of which are characteristic of human RA. These observations demonstrate that fibrinogen is arthritogenic in mice and that the pathogenesis of FIA is mediated by both autoantibodies and fibrinogen-reactive T cells. Mixed results with modulation of T-H-17 cells in human autoimmune diseases The outcomes of clinical trials provide the most convincing data to clarify the role of particular cytokines in the pathogenesis of human diseases. The immunology community, for a variety of practical reasons, spends most of its research time and funds on studies in model systems, mainly mice. In this perspective I discuss results of clinical trials assessing the effect of blocking the differentiation and/or function of interleukin-17-producing CD4(+) T cells on human autoimmune disease, and devote more limited attention to corroborating preclinical studies from animal models. Thus far, these outcomes in human trials have been mixed, with notable success in psoriasis and Crohn's disease but a negative result in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

V., Youssef, S., Sun, A., Xiong, A., Prugpichailers, T., Veeravagu, A., Hou, L. C., Steinman, L., Tse, V. Statins are thought to have tumorolytic properties, reducing angiogenesis by inhibiting pro-angiogenic factors and inducing apoptosis of mural pericytes within the tumor vascular tree.An orthotopic mouse glioblastoma (GL-26) model was used to investigate the effect of simvastatin on glioblastoma vasculature in vivo. GL-26 cells were implanted into the striatum of C5LKa mice treated with either control, low- or high-dose simvastatin. Brains were analyzed for necrotic volume, apoptosis, morphology and pericytic cells within the vascular tree.Low-dose simvastatin increased necrosis and apoptosis compared to both control and high-dose simvastatin groups. High-dose simvastatin increased vessel caliber by reducing pericytic cells along the tumor vessel wall compared to both control and low-dose simvastatin groups.Simvastatin has a dual effect on tumorigenesis. At high doses, it may worsen instead of 'normalizing' tumor angio-architecture, albeit low doses affect tumor cell survival by promoting necrosis and apoptosis.

R., Goh, Y. P., Eagle, A. R., Dunn, S. E., Awakuni, J. U., Nguyen, K. D., Steinman, L., Michie, S. A., Chawla, A. Macrophages rapidly engulf apoptotic cells to limit the release of noxious cellular contents and to restrict autoimmune responses against self antigens. Although factors participating in recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells have been identified, the transcriptional basis for the sensing and the silent disposal of apoptotic cells is unknown. Here we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) is induced when macrophages engulf apoptotic cells and functions as a transcriptional sensor of dying cells. Genetic deletion of PPAR-delta decreases expression of opsonins such as complement component-1qb (C1qb), resulting in impairment of apoptotic cell clearance and reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This increases autoantibody production and predisposes global and macrophage-specific Ppard(-/-) mice to autoimmune kidney disease, a phenotype resembling the human disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, PPAR-delta has a pivotal role in orchestrating the timely disposal of apoptotic cells by macrophages, ensuring that tolerance to self is maintained. Shifting therapeutic attention in MS to osteopontin, type 1 and type 2 IFN It is widely debated whether MS is mediated solely by Th1, or solely by Th17, whether it might be mediated by both pathways, or perhaps by neither pathway. We must integrate the following four facts: first, MS lesions have a signature of IL-6-, IL-17-, osteopontin- and IFN-driven transcriptional activity. Second, MS is worsened with administration of IFN-gamma, the quintessential type 2 IFN and Th1 cytokine. Third, blockade of TNF-alpha worsened MS in clinical trials. Fourth, inhibiting the main driver of Th17, IL-23, failed to modulate relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Against this backdrop, standing outside the framework of the Th1 and Th17 pathways are the type 1 IFN, notably IFN-beta, the most widely used approved therapy for RRMS. A paper in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology demonstrates that IFN-beta suppresses production in CD4(+) T cells of both osteopontin and IL-17. In this commentary, the roles of these two molecules, i.e. osteopontin and IL-17, are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of MS. Osteopontin may be more important than Th1 or Th17 in the pathogenesis of RRMS. Trials targeting this small integrin-binding protein ought to be pursued in RRMS.

J., Pedotti, R. Induction of T helper 1 (Th1) to Th2 deviation through administration of self- or altered self-peptides holds promise for treatment of autoimmunity. However, administration of self-peptides in models of autoimmunity can result in anaphylactic reactions. Although both IgE and IgG1 antibodies might be involved in the development of anaphylaxis to myelin peptides in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, the effector cells and molecules involved are not fully understood. Here we show that systemic anaphylaxis to the self-antigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 can occur in mice lacking mast cells (Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice) or histamine (histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice), but is prevented in mice lacking IL-4. Treatment of mice with CV6209, a platelet-activating factor antagonist, slightly reduced the incidence of anaphylaxis to self-MOG35-55 in this model, but more effectively protected mice against anaphylaxis to this peptide when self-MOG35-55 was administered in a different immunization protocol that omitted the use of Bordetella pertussis toxin as an adjuvant at the time of immunization. Thus, anaphylactic reactions to self-MOG can occur in the absence of mast cells or histamine, key elements of the classical IgE-, mast cell-, and histamine-dependent pathway of anaphylaxis. View details for Enhanced Immune Recognition of Cryptic Glycan Markers in Human Tumors Newsom-Davis, T. E., Wang, D., Steinman, L., Chen, P. F., Wang, L., Simon, A. K., Screaton, G. R. Abnormal glycosylation is one of the hallmarks of the cancer cell and is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. The development of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) vaccines has been problematic due to poor immunogenicity. However, when appropriate targets can be identified, passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against TACAs has been shown to have antitumor activity. Fas ligand (FasL) is a transmembrane protein that induces apoptosis in cells expressing its receptor, Fas. When grafted into mice, FasL-expressing tumor cells break immunologic tolerance to self-antigens and induce antibody-mediated tumor immunity. Here, five IgM mAbs were produced from mice vaccinated with FasL-expressing B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. They recognize various syngeneic and allogeneic murine tumor cell lines. One mAb, TM10, recognizes a range of human tumor cell lines, including melanoma, prostate, and ovarian cancer. It does not bind to untransformed cells. The epitopes recognized by all the mAbs were carbohydrates expressed on proteins. Using carbohydrate microarrays, the antigenic targets of TM10 were found to be high-mannose core structures of N-linked glycans. In normal cells, high-mannose clusters are hidden by extensive saccharide branching but they become exposed in cancer cells as a result of abnormal glycosylation pathways. Vaccination with FasL-expressing tumors therefore enables the immune system to break tolerance to self-antigens, allowing identification of novel TACAs that can form the basis of future humoral anticancer therapy.

W., Wang, P., Kattah, M. G., Youssef, S., Steinman, L., DeFea, K., Straus, D. S. The IL-23/IL-17 pathway plays an important role in chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. In inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal epithelial cells are an important source of chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells. We examined the effect of IL-17 on chemokine expression of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells. IL-17 strongly repressed TNF-alpha-stimulated expression of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5, but synergized with TNF-alpha for induction of CXCL8, CXCL1, and CCL20 mRNAs. For CXCL10, IL-17 strongly inhibited promoter activity but had no effect on mRNA stability. In contrast, for CXCL8, IL-17 slightly decreased promoter activity but stabilized its normally unstable mRNA, leading to a net increase in steady-state mRNA abundance. IL-17 synergized with TNF-alpha in transactivating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and in activating ERK and p38 MAPK. The p38 and ERK pathway inhibitors SB203580 and U0126 reversed the repressive effect of IL-17 on CXCL10 mRNA abundance and promoter activity and also reversed the inductive effect of IL-17 on CXCL8 mRNA, indicating that MAPK signaling mediates both the transcriptional repression of CXCL10 and the stabilization of CXCL8 mRNA by IL-17. The EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 partially reversed the effects of IL-17 on CXCL8 and CXCL10 mRNA, demonstrating a role for EGFR in downstream IL-17 signaling. The overall results indicate a positive effect of IL-17 on chemokines that recruit neutrophils (CXCL8 and CXCL1), and Th17 cells (CCL20). In contrast, IL-17 represses expression of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCR5, three chemokines that selectively recruit Th1 but not other effector T cells.

M., Baumgarth, N., Chien, Y. gammadelta T cells uniquely contribute to host immune defense, but how this is accomplished remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I T10 and T22-specific gammadelta T cells in mice and found that encountering antigen in the thymus was neither required nor inhibitory for their development. But when triggered through the T cell receptor, ligand-naive lymphoid-gammadelta T cells produced IL-17, whereas ligand-experienced cells made IFN-gamma. Immediately after immunization, a large fraction of IL-17(+) gammadelta T cells were found in the draining lymph nodes days before the appearance of antigen-specific IL-17(+) *beta T cells. Thus, thymic selection determines the effector fate of gammadelta T cells rather than constrains their antigen specificities. The swift IL-17 response mounted by antigen-naive gammadelta T cells suggests a critical role for these cells at the onset of an acute inflammatory response to novel antigens.

Inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme (statins) are cholesterol-lowering drugs that have shown promise as therapeutic agents in various animal models of autoimmune disease. The results of initial clinical trials with statins in multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis have also been encouraging. In this study, we attempted to treat a widely studied murine model of spontaneous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with atorvastatin.(NZB x NZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mice received daily oral doses of atorvastatin for 20 weeks. The mice were monitored weekly for survival and proteinuria. Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels in sera were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). T lymphocyte cytokine production in vitro, as well as cytokine levels in vivo, were measured by ELISA. T cell proliferation was assessed by thymidine incorporation assay. Serum cholesterol levels were determined using a standard fluorometric assay. Kidney tissue was harvested and evaluated for pathologic changes.In NZB/NZW mice, oral atorvastatin had significant effects on T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. Atorvastatin also induced significant increases in serum levels of interleukin-4. However, atorvastatin treatment in NZB/NZW mice had no significant impact on proteinuria, survival, serum anti-dsDNA antibody and cholesterol levels, or extent of renal disease.Monotherapy with oral atorvastatin has no protective effects in a murine model of spontaneous SLE. The efficacy of atorvastatin in human SLE remains to be determined.

Y., Steinman, L., Rossi, F. M., Blau, H. M. Transplanted bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been reported to fuse with cells of diverse tissues, but the extremely low frequency of fusion has led to the view that such events are biologically insignificant. Nonetheless, in mice with a lethal recessive liver disease (tyrosinaemia), transplantation of wild-type BMDCs restored liver function by cell fusion and prevented death, indicating that cell fusion can have beneficial effects. Here we report that chronic inflammation resulting from severe dermatitis or autoimmune encephalitis leads to robust fusion of BMDCs with Purkinje neurons and formation of hundreds of binucleate heterokaryons per cerebellum, a 10-100-fold higher frequency than previously reported. Single haematopoietic stem-cell transplants showed that the fusogenic cell is from the haematopoietic lineage and parabiosis experiments revealed that fusion can occur without irradiation. Transplantation of rat bone marrow into mice led to activation of dormant rat Purkinje neuron-specific genes in BMDC nuclei after fusion with mouse Purkinje neurons, consistent with nuclear reprogramming. The precise neurological role of these heterokaryons awaits elucidation, but their frequency in brain after inflammation is clearly much higher than previously appreciated. View details for CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells specific for a thymus-expressed antigen prevent the development of anaphylaxis to self Scabeni, S., Lapilla, M., Musio, S., Gallo, B., Ciusani, E., Steinman, L., Mantegazza, R., Pedotti, R. A role for CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the control of allergic diseases has been postulated. We developed a mouse model in which anaphylaxis is induced in SJL mice by immunization and challenge with the fragment of self myelin proteolipid protein (PLP)(139-151), that is not expressed in the thymus, but not with fragment 178-191 of the same protein, that is expressed in the thymus. In this study, we show that resistance to anaphylaxis is associated with naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for the self peptide expressed in the thymus. These cells increase Foxp3 expression upon Ag stimulation and suppress peptide-induced proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells. Depletion of Tregs with anti-CD25 in vivo significantly diminished resistance to anaphylaxis to PLP(178-191), suggesting an important role for CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs in preventing the development of allergic responses to this thymus-expressed peptide. These data indicate that naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for a peptide expressed under physiological conditions in the thymus are able to suppress the development of a systemic allergic reaction to self. View details for Bioluminescence in vivo imaging of autoimmune encephalomyelitis predicts disease Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a widely used animal model to understand not only multiple sclerosis but also basic principles of immunity. The disease is scored typically by observing signs of paralysis, which do not always correspond with pathological changes.Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in transgenic mice expressing an injury responsive luciferase reporter in astrocytes (GFAP-luc). Bioluminescence in the brain and spinal cord was measured non-invasively in living mice. Mice were sacrificed at different time points to evaluate clinical and pathological changes. The correlation between bioluminescence and clinical and pathological EAE was statistically analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis.Bioluminescence from the brain and spinal cord correlates strongly with severity of clinical disease and a number of pathological changes in the brain in EAE. Bioluminescence at early time points also predicts severity of disease.These results highlight the potential use of bioluminescence imaging to monitor neuroinflammation for rapid drug screening and immunological studies in EAE and suggest that similar approaches could be applied to other animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.

L., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies have a diagnostic role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, little is known about their origins and contribution to pathogenesis. Citrullination is the post-translational conversion of arginine to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase, and increased citrullination of proteins is observed in the joint tissue in RA and in brain tissue in multiple sclerosis (MS).We applied synovial and myelin protein arrays to examine epitope spreading of B cell responses to citrullinated epitopes in both the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model for RA and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model for MS. Synovial and myelin protein arrays contain a spectrum of proteins and peptides, including native and citrullinated forms, representing candidate autoantigens in RA and MS, respectively. We applied these arrays to characterise the specificity of autoantibodies in serial serum samples derived from mice with acute and chronic stages of CIA and EAE.In samples from pre-disease CIA and acute-disease EAE, we observed autoantibody targeting of the immunising antigen and responses to a limited set of citrullinated epitopes. Over the course of diseases, the autoantibody responses expanded to target multiple citrullinated epitopes in both CIA and EAE. Using immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified citrullination of multiple polypeptides in CIA joint and EAE brain tissue that have not previously been described as citrullinated.Our results suggest that anti-citrulline antibody responses develop in the early stages of CIA and EAE, and that autoimmune inflammation results in citrullination of joint proteins in CIA and brain proteins in EAE, thereby creating neoantigens that become additional targets in epitope spreading of autoimmune responses.

View details for Preemptive HMG-CoA reductase inhibition provides graft-versus-host disease protection by Th-2 polarization while sparing graft-versus-leukemia activity Zeiser, R., Youssef, S., Baker, J., Kambham, N., Steinman, L., Negrin, R. S. We investigated whether atorvastatin (AT) was capable of protecting animals from acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) across major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatch barriers. AT treatment of the donor induced a Th-2 cytokine profile in the adoptively transferred T cells and reduced their in vivo expansion, which translated into significantly reduced aGVHD lethality. Host treatment down-regulated costimulatory molecules and MHC class II expression on recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and enhanced the protective statin effect, without impacting graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. The AT effect was partially reversed in STAT6(-/-) donors and abrogated by L-mevalonate, indicating the relevance of STAT6 signaling and the L-mevalonate pathway for AT-mediated aGVHD protection. AT reduced prenylation levels of GTPases, abolished T-bet expression, and increased c-MAF and GATA-3 protein in vivo. Thus, AT has significant protective impact on aGVHD lethality by Th-2 polarization and inhibition of an uncontrolled Th-1 response while maintaining GVL activity, which is of great clinical relevance given the modest toxicity profile of AT. Glia-dependent TGF-beta signaling, acting independently of the TH17 pathway, is critical for initiation of murine autoimmune encephalomyelitis Luo, J., Ho, P. P., Buckwalter, M. S., Hsu, T., Lee, L. Y., Zhang, H., Kim, D., Kim, S., Gambhir, S. S., Steinman, L., Wyss-Coray, T. Autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model for multiple sclerosis, is characterized by the activation of immune cells, demyelination of axons in the CNS, and paralysis. We found that TGF-beta1 synthesis in glial cells and TGF-beta-induced signaling in the CNS were activated several days before the onset of paralysis in mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis. While early production of TGF-beta1 was observed in glial cells TGF-beta signaling was activated in neurons and later in infiltrating T cells in inflammatory lesions. Systemic treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling ameliorated the paralytic disease and reduced the accumulation of pathogenic T cells and expression of IL-6 in the CNS. Priming of peripheral T cells was not altered, nor was the generation of TH17 cells, indicating that this effect was directed within the brain, yet affected the immune system. These results suggest that early production of TGF-beta1 in the CNS creates a permissive and dangerous environment for the initiation of autoimmune inflammation, providing a rare example of the brain modulating the immune system. Importantly, inhibition of TGF-beta signaling may have benefits in the treatment of the acute phase of autoimmune CNS inflammation. Recent evidence points to tryptophan (Trp) degradation as a potent immunosuppressive mechanism involved in the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Both Trp depletion and downstream Trp catabolites (TCs) appear to synergistically confer protection against excessive inflammation. In this review, we give an overview of the immunosuppressive properties of Trp degradation with special focus on TCs. Constitutive and inducible Trp degradation in different cell types and tissues of human and murine origin is summarized. We address the influence of Trp degradation on different aspects of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Possible therapeutic approaches for autoimmune disorders targeting Trp degradation are presented, and key issues relevant for the development of such therapeutic strategies are discussed. View details for Nanosensor detection of an immunoregulatory tryptophan influx/kynurenine efflux cycle Kaper, T., Looger, L. L., Takanaga, H., Platten, M., Steinman, L., Frommer, W. B. Mammalian cells rely on cellular uptake of the essential amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan sequestration by up-regulation of the key enzyme for tryptophan degradation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), e.g., in cancer and inflammation, is thought to suppress the immune response via T cell starvation. Additionally, the excreted tryptophan catabolites (kynurenines) induce apoptosis of lymphocytes. Whereas tryptophan transport systems have been identified, the molecular nature of kynurenine export remains unknown. To measure cytosolic tryptophan steady-state levels and flux in real time, we developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer nanosensors (FLIPW). The transport properties detected by FLIPW in KB cells, a human oral cancer cell line, and COS-7 cells implicate LAT1, a transporter that is present in proliferative tissues like cancer, in tryptophan uptake. Importantly, we found that this transport system mediates tryptophan/kynurenine exchange. The tryptophan influx/kynurenine efflux cycle couples tryptophan starvation to elevation of kynurenine serum levels, providing a two-pronged induction of apoptosis in neighboring cells. The strict coupling protects cells that overproduce IDO from kynurenine accumulation. Consequently, this mechanism may contribute to immunosuppression involved in autoimmunity and tumor immune escape. View details for Inhibition of HMGcoA reductase by atorvastatin prevents and reverses MYC-induced lymphomagenesis Shachaf, C. M., Perez, O. D., Youssef, S., Fan, A. C., Elchuri, S., Goldstein, M. J., Shirer, A. E., Sharpe, O., Chen, J., Mitchell, D. J., Chang, M., Nolan, G. P., Steinman, L., Felsher, D. W. Statins are a class of drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGcoA) reductase, a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Several reports document that statins may prevent different human cancers. However, whether or not statins can prevent cancer is controversial due to discordant results. One possible explanation for these conflicting conclusions is that only some tumors or specific statins may be effective. Here, we demonstrate in an in vivo transgenic model in which atorvastatin reverses and prevents the onset of MYC-induced lymphomagenesis, but fails to reverse or prevent tumorigenesis in the presence of constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D). Using phosphoprotein fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, atorvastatin treatment was found to result in the inactivation of the Ras and ERK1/2 signaling pathways associated with the dephosphorylation and inactivation of MYC. Correspondingly, tumors with a constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D) did not exhibit dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MYC. Atorvastatin's effects on MYC were specific to the inhibition of HMGcoA reductase, as treatment with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, abrogated these effects and inhibited the ability of atorvastatin to reverse or suppress tumorigenesis. Also, RNAi directed at HMGcoA reductase was sufficient to abrogate the neoplastic properties of MYC-induced tumors. Thus, atorvastatin, by inhibiting HMGcoA reductase, induces changes in phosphoprotein signaling that in turn prevent MYC-induced lymphomagenesis. Antigen-specific therapy of multiple sclerosis: The long-sought magic bullet The adaptive immune response in multiple sclerosis (MS) targets various myelin proteins and even some inducible heat shock proteins. A few attempts have been made to tolerize relapsing-remitting patients with MS to either full-length myelin basic protein or to a key peptide epitope between residues 83-99. These trials have demonstrated that this approach may potentially provide benefit to patients with relapsing- remitting MS. However, manipulation of responses to myelin proteins can have deleterious effects. The immune response to myelin components is positioned at a key tipping point in the pathophysiology of the disease. Clarification of the key target antigens in MS, and better understanding of practical methods to attain tolerance to a wide variety of myelin and neuronal molecules will provide the basis for the ultimately successful antigen specific therapy. View details for Statins-treatment option for central nervous system autoimmune disease? Statins, inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are well-established agents to lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular morbidity. Independent of their lipid-lowering properties, statins have been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in various animal models of human autoimmune disease. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model for multiple sclerosis, statins prevented disease onset and even reversed paralysis when treatment was initiated after experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was fully established. Furthermore, well-tolerated oral statins were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in combination with existing agents for multiple sclerosis therapy. Based primarily on these encouraging results, statins are now being tested in clinical trials as a monotherapy for multiple sclerosis, as well as in combination with approved disease-modifying therapies.

C., Stuve, O., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Treatment with glatiramer acetate (GA, copolymer-1, Copaxone), a drug approved for multiple sclerosis (MS), in a mouse model promoted development of anti-inflammatory type II monocytes, characterized by increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and decreased production of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This anti-inflammatory cytokine shift was associated with reduced STAT-1 signaling. Type II monocytes directed differentiation of T(H)2 cells and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (T(reg)) independent of antigen specificity. Type II monocyte-induced regulatory T cells specific for a foreign antigen ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating that neither GA specificity nor recognition of self-antigen was required for their therapeutic effect. Adoptive transfer of type II monocytes reversed EAE, suppressed T(H)17 cell development and promoted both T(H)2 differentiation and expansion of T(reg) cells in recipient mice. This demonstration of adoptive immunotherapy by type II monocytes identifies a central role for these cells in T cell immune modulation of autoimmunity.

P., Idrissova, Z., Viglietta, V., Rostasy, K., Pohl, D., Dale, R. C., Freedman, M., Steinman, L., Kuchroo, V. K., Hafler, D. A., Wucherpfennig, K. W. The role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases is controversial, in part because widely used western blotting and ELISA methods either do not permit the detection of conformation-sensitive antibodies or do not distinguish them from conformation-independent antibodies. We developed a sensitive assay based on self-assembling radiolabeled tetramers that allows discrimination of antibodies against folded or denatured myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) by selective unfolding of the antigen domain. The tetramer radioimmunoassay (RIA) was more sensitive for MOG autoantibody detection than other methodologies, including monomer-based RIA, ELISA or fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). Autoantibodies from individuals with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) selectively bound the folded MOG tetramer, whereas sera from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced with MOG peptide immunoprecipitated only the unfolded tetramer. MOG-specific autoantibodies were identified in a subset of ADEM but only rarely in adult-onset MS cases, indicating that MOG is a more prominent target antigen in ADEM than MS.

A., Steinman, L., Soares, M. P. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, encoded by HMOX1) dampens inflammatory reactions via the catabolism of heme into CO, Fe, and biliverdin. We report that expression of HO-1 dictates the pathologic outcome of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Induction of EAE in Hmox1(-/- )C57BL/6 mice led to enhanced CNS demyelination, paralysis, and mortality, as compared with Hmox1(+/+) mice. Induction of HO-1 by cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) administration after EAE onset reversed paralysis in C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice and disease relapse in SJL/J mice. These effects were not observed using zinc protoporphyrin IX, which does not induce HO-1. CoPPIX protection was abrogated in Hmox1(-/-) C57BL/6 mice, indicating that CoPPIX acts via HO-1 to suppress EAE progression. The protective effect of HO-1 was associated with inhibition of MHC class II expression by APCs and inhibition of Th and CD8 T cell accumulation, proliferation, and effector function within the CNS. Exogenous CO mimicked these effects, suggesting that CO contributes to the protective action of HO-1. In conclusion, HO-1 or exposure to its end product CO counters autoimmune neuroinflammation and thus might be used therapeutically to treat MS.

Current therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases non-specifically suppress immune function, and there is great need for fundamental approaches such as antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. In this paper we describe development of antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines to treat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, and use of protein microarrays to monitor response to therapy and to identify potential additional autoimmune targets for next generation vaccines. We demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding type II collagen (CII) reduced the incidence and severity of CIA. Atorvastatin, a statin drug found to reduce the severity of autoimmunity, potentiated the effect of DNA vaccines encoding CII. Analysis of cytokines produced by collagen-reactive T cells derived from mice receiving tolerizing DNA encoding CII, as compared to control vaccines, revealed reduced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Arthritis microarray analysis demonstrated reduced spreading of autoantibody responses in mice treated with DNA encoding CII. The development of tolerizing DNA vaccines, and the use of antibody profiling to guide design of and to monitor therapeutic responses to such vaccines, represents a promising approach for the treatment of RA and other autoimmune diseases. Type IIHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins) provide acute-graft-versus-host disease protection by Th-2 cytokine induction while sparing graft-versus-leukemia activity. 48th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Hematology Zeiser, R., Youssef, S., Baker, J., Steinman, L., Negrin, R.

P., Tomooka, B. H., Thomas, F. M., Song, J. J., Goodman, S. B., Lee, D. M., Genovese, M. C., Utz, P. J., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Tyrosine kinases play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways and cellular responses that mediate the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed to treat Bcr/Abl-expressing leukemias and subsequently found to treat c-Kit-expressing gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We demonstrate that imatinib potently prevents and treats murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We further show that micromolar concentrations of imatinib abrogate multiple signal transduction pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis, including mast cell c-Kit signaling and TNF-alpha release, macrophage c-Fms activation and cytokine production, and fibroblast PDGFR signaling and proliferation. In our studies, imatinib attenuated PDGFR signaling in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and TNF-alpha production in synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMCs) derived from human RA patients. Imatinib-mediated inhibition of a spectrum of signal transduction pathways and the downstream pathogenic cellular responses may provide a powerful approach to treat RA and other inflammatory diseases.

S., Youssef, S., Dunn, S. E., Prod'homme, T., Neuhaus, O., Stuve, O., Greenwood, J., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are widely prescribed for their cholesterol-lowering properties to reduce atherogenesis and cardiovascular morbidity. Over recent years, statins have also been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects that might be of therapeutic benefit in autoimmune disorders. The primary mechanism by which statins alter immune function appears to be mediated through the inhibition of post-translational protein prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins and is largely independent of lipid-lowering. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), statins prevent or reverse paralysis and were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit when combined with agents approved for MS therapy. Based primarily upon the beneficial effects in EAE, statins are now being tested in patients in MS clinical trials.

Four easy pieces: interconnections between tissue injury, intermediary metabolism, autoimmunity, and chronic degeneration. Four questions are posed: (1) Can tissue damage itself provoke autoimmunity? (2) Can genetic mutations of key structures produce tissue pathology and thus provoke autoimmunity? (3) Can acute immune damage produce tissue degeneration without further hallmarks of an immune response? (4) Can intermediary metabolism modulate immune damage to tissues? Four answers are given: (1) Tissue injury itself may lead to autoimmunity. Both innate and adaptive immunity may arise as a response to tissue injury, and the immune attack can further damage tissue. (2) Genetic mutations can lead to an immune response indistinguishable from autoimmunity, exemplified from Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. (3) Chronic immune damage may lead to tissue degeneration, with or without further hallmarks of an immune response. Variations on this theme, including inverse scenarios, are also possible: Inborn errors of metabolism may lead to tissue damage that may provoke an adaptive and or innate immune response. The immune response might further damage tissue. (4) Finally, perturbations of intermediary metabolism may modulate the immune response, controlling the extent of immune-mediated damage. Examples are taken from perturbations in the cholesterol pathway that influence the characteristics of the immune response, and with tryptophan metabolites that modulate autoimmunity and graft rejection. Inflammatory, degenerative, and autoimmune neurological disease will be discussed in terms of their implications for pathogenic mechanisms underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. How to successfully apply animal studies in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis to research on multiple sclerosis In their Point of View entitled ""Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis: A Misleading Model of Multiple Sclerosis,"" Sriram and Steiner(1) wrote, ""The most disappointing aspect of EAE [experimental allergic encephalomyelitis] as a potential model for MS is its almost total inability to point toward a meaningful therapy or therapeutic approach for MS."" Actually, EAE has led directly to the development of three therapies approved for use in multiple sclerosis (MS): glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, and natalizumab. Several new approaches to MS are in clinical trials based on positive indications in preclinical work relying on EAE. New clues to the pathogenesis of MS and new potential surrogate markers for MS are shown from research involving EAE when it is critically coupled with actual findings in MS. There are pitfalls in overreliance on the EAE model, or on any animal model for any human disease. Nevertheless, over the past 73 years, the EAE model has proved itself remarkably useful for aiding research on MS. View details for Nogo in multiple sclerosis: Growing roles of a growth inhibitor Symposium on Cognitive Decline in Multiple Sclerosis In recent years, knowledge about the physiological functions of the Nogo-A protein has grown considerably, and this molecule has evolved from being one of the most important axonal regrowth inhibitors present in central nervous system (CNS) myelin, to several other potentially important roles in different areas such as nervous system development, epilepsy, vascular physiology, muscle pathology and CNS tumors. Therapeutically, targeting the Nogo-A protein by means of the immune response has been tried in an attempt to block neurite growth inhibition and promote regeneration in spinal cord injury models; the immune response to Nogo-A, however, has not been extensively studied. We propose to review recent evidence that Nogo-A may also play an important role in autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, including that Nogo-66 derived epitopes are encephalitogenic antigens in susceptible mouse strains, and that the immune response to Nogo-66 antigens includes both strong T cell and B cell activation, with epitope spreading of the antibody response to other myelin molecules. In CNS immunotherapy, careful targeting of neural self-antigens is a prerequisite in order to avoid unexpected deleterious effects, and increasing knowledge about the immune response to Nogo-A may provide a safe basis for the development of relevant therapeutic alternatives for several neurological conditions. View details for Emerging therapeutic targets in multiple sclerosis The aim of this review is to describe the recent findings regarding the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and their translation to new therapies.Basic research is providing new insights into the immune elements involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, both in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system. Unveiling the complex interplay of the molecules involved in the immunological cascade of the disease supplies new targets for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies. Similarly, clinical studies and identification of distinct subgroups of patients based on their responsiveness to immunotherapies provides support for the existence of immunopathological disease subtypes that seem to require different therapeutic approaches. These studies extend the theoretical basis that facilitates development of neuroprotective and repair-promoting therapeutic strategies.The application of novel and cutting-edge technologies in the fields of genomics and proteomics is providing a better understanding of the genetic and environmental factors involved in multiple sclerosis susceptibility and progression, as well as the detection of biomarkers for disease activity and response to therapy. Implementation of these facilitates identification of new targets for therapy towards tailoring treatment to the individual patient with multiple sclerosis. View details for Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and multiple sclerosis: Lessons from natalizumab Three patients have developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while being treated with natalizumab for their autoimmune diseases. One patient had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), one had Crohn's disease, and one (who had been enrolled in an RRMS phase III trial) had no evidence of multiple sclerosis on autopsy. The patient with RRMS now has severe, permanent neurologic damage and the other two patients died. In this article, we recommend revised entry and diagnostic criteria to prevent enrollment of RRMS patients with a favorable prognosis or questionable diagnosis into trials of drugs with unknown safety profiles. In light of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, we strongly recommend that RRMS patients who are at low risk of disability not be treated with natalizumab. Finally, we discuss what additional natalizumab efficacy data need to be presented before any decisions should be made about treating RRMS patients with a high risk of developing long-term disability.

View details for Statin therapy and autoimmune disease: from protein prenylation to immunomodulation Statins have been prescribed extensively for their cholesterol-lowering properties and efficacy in cardiovascular disease. However, compelling evidence now exists that statins also have extensive immunomodulatory properties that operate independently of lipid lowering. Consequently, much attention has been directed towards their potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Modulation of post-translational protein prenylation seems to be a key mechanism by which statins alter immune function. In this Review, the effect of statin therapy on immune function, and how this relates to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, is reviewed alongside current opinion of what the key biological targets of statins are. View details for A neuropeptide in immune-mediated inflammation, Y? Prod'homme, T., Weber, M. S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Disturbances in crosstalk between the immune system and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) can contribute to the pathogenesis of Th1-mediated autoimmunity. Recent studies indicate that neuropeptide Y (NPY) has a major role in the regulation of Th1 responses. The precise role of NPY has been an enigma, but a recent study provides a breakthrough, demonstrating that NPY has a bimodal role as a negative regulator of T cells and an activator of antigen-presenting cell function.

C., Hemmer, B., Prod'homme, T., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. One approach to improving efficacy in MS therapy is to identify medications that provide additive or synergistic benefit in combination. Orally administered cholesterol-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (known as statins), which exhibit immunomodulatory properties and are effective in treatment of the MS model EAE, are being tested in MS. As atorvastatin can enhance protective Th2 responses and has a different mechanism of action than glatiramer acetate (GA), a parenterally administered immunomodulatory agent approved for MS treatment, we tested whether the combination of these agents could be beneficial in EAE. Combination therapy using suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA prevented or reversed clinical and histologic EAE. Secretion of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines was reduced--and conversely Th2 cytokine secretion was increased--in these mice, but not in mice treated with each drug alone at the same doses. Monocytes treated with the combination of suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA secreted an antiinflammatory type II cytokine pattern and, when used as APCs, promoted Th2 differentiation of naive myelin-specific T cells. Our results demonstrate that agents with different mechanisms of immune modulation can combine in a synergistic manner for the treatment of CNS autoimmunity and provide rationale for testing the combination of atorvastatin and GA in MS.

L., Matarese, G., Ohtsu, H., GALLI, S. J., Mantegazza, R., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. Histamine can modulate the cytokine network and influence Th1 and Th2 balance and Ab-isotype switching. Thus, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of specific histamine receptors has been shown to reduce the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a prototypic Th1-mediated disease with similarities to human multiple sclerosis. To study the comprehensive contribution of endogenous histamine to the expression of EAE, we attempted to induce EAE in histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice, which are genetically unable to make histamine. In this study, we show that EAE is significantly more severe in HDC-/-, histamine-deficient mice, with diffuse inflammatory infiltrates, including a prevalent granulocytic component, in the brain and cerebellum. Unlike splenocytes from wild-type mice, splenocytes from HDC-/- mice do not produce histamine in response to the myelin Ag, whereas production of IFN-gamma, TNF, and leptin are increased in HDC-/- splenocytes in comparison to those from wild-type mice. Endogenous histamine thus appears to regulate importantly the autoimmune response against myelin and the expression of EAE, in this model, and to limit immune damage to the CNS. Understanding which receptor(s) for histamine is/are involved in regulating autoimmunity against the CNS might help in the development of new strategies of treatment for EAE and multiple sclerosis.

H., Steinman, L. Targeting pathogenic T cells with Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding autoantigens is a powerful and feasible therapeutic strategy for Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. However, plasmid DNA contains abundant unmethylated CpG motifs, which induce a strong Th1 immune response. We describe here a novel approach to counteract this undesired side effect of plasmid DNA used for vaccination in Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. In chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), combining a myelin cocktail plus IL-4-tolerizing DNA vaccine with a suppressive GpG oligodeoxynucleotide (GpG-ODN) induced a shift of the autoreactive T cell response toward a protective Th2 cytokine pattern. Myelin microarrays demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccination plus GpG-ODN further decreased anti-myelin autoantibody epitope spreading and shifted the autoreactive B cell response to a protective IgG1 isotype. Moreover, the addition of GpG-ODN to tolerizing DNA vaccination therapy effectively reduced overall mean disease severity in both the chronic relapsing EAE and chronic progressive EAE mouse models. In conclusion, suppressive GpG-ODN effectively counteracted the undesired CpG-induced inflammatory effect of a tolerizing DNA vaccine in a Th1-mediated autoimmune disease by skewing both the autoaggressive T cell and B cell responses toward a protective Th2 phenotype. These results demonstrate that suppressive GpG-ODN is a simple and highly effective novel therapeutic adjuvant that will boost the efficacy of Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines used for treating Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Virtues and pitfalls of EAE for the development of therapies for multiple sclerosis Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a useful model for aiding the development of new treatments for MS. All therapies approved for MS ameliorate EAE. Two approved medications, glatiramer acetate and Natalizumab, were developed directly from studies in EAE. Several trials are ongoing in MS after success in EAE, including altered peptide ligands of myelin, DNA vaccines and statins. However, EAE has failed to predict the outcome of certain approaches. The reasons underlying such failures are discussed here.

In the management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), providers are all faced with the highly formidable challenge of ascertaining whether, and to what degree, disease-modifying therapy is effective in the individual patient. While much has been learned in randomized, controlled clinical trials, we cannot simply extrapolate the outcomes of these initiatives and apply them to the care of a single patient. In the future, the application of pharmacogenetic techniques, proteomics, and microarray analysis will yield novel profiling information on individual patients that will substantially refine the specific therapeutic questions of relevance: (1) What is the best treatment for an individual patient? (2) Which patients require intensive therapeutic combination regimens to optimize control of the disease process? (3) What are the appropriate drug dosing targets for an individual patient? and (4) Which patients will be predisposed to the development of drug-related adverse events? Such data may provide a novel variable of drug responsiveness that will mandate its inclusion into the process of covariate analyses for clinical trials. View details for Antigen-specific therapies in multiple sclerosis: Going beyond proteins and peptides Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex immune-mediated disease resulting largely from an autoimmune attack against components of central nervous system myelin, including several proteins and lipids. Knowledge about the details of this anomalous immune response has come mostly from studies in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this model, it has been possible to prevent and effectively treat established disease through several antigen-specific therapeutic strategies, which have included administration of whole myelin or myelin proteins by various routes, random copolymers consisting of the main major histocompatability complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) contact amino acid residues, altered peptide ligands of dominant myelin epitopes in which one or more residues are selectively substituted, and lately DNA vaccination encoding self-myelin antigens. However, there have been difficulties in making successful transitions from animal models to human clinical trials, due either to lack of efficacy or unforeseen complications. Despite these problems, antigen-specific therapies have retained their attraction for clinicians and scientists alike, and hopefully the upcoming generation of agents--including altered peptide ligands and DNA vaccines--will benefit from the increasing knowledge about this disease and surmount existing difficulties to make an impact in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

Major advancements have been achieved in our ability to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) and to commence treatment intervention with agents that can favorably affect the disease course. Although MS exacerbations and the emergence of disability constitute the more conspicuous aspects of the disease process, evidence has confirmed that most of the disease occurs on a constitutive and occult basis. Disease-modifying therapies appear to be modest in the magnitude of their treatment effects, particularly in the progressive stage of the disease. Therapeutic strategies currently used for MS primarily target the inflammatory cascade. Several potential mechanisms appear to be involved in the progression of MS. Characterizing these mechanisms will result in a better understanding of the various forms of the disorder and how to effectively treat its clinical manifestations. It is our objective within this 2-part series on progression in MS to offer both evidence-based observations and hypothesis-driven expert perspectives on what constitutes the cause of progression in MS. We have chosen areas of inquiry that appear to have been most productive in helping us to better conceptualize the landscape of what MS looks like pathologically, immunologically, neuroscientifically, radiographically, and genetically. We have attempted to advance hypotheses focused on a deeper understanding of what contributes to the progression of this illness and to illustrate new technical capabilities that are catalyzing novel research initiatives targeted at achieving a more complete understanding of progression in MS.

Nogo-66, the extracellular 66 aa loop of the Nogo-A protein found in CNS myelin, interacts with the Nogo receptor and has been proposed to mediate inhibition of axonal regrowth. It has been shown that immunization with Nogo-A promotes recovery in animal models of spinal cord injury through induction of Ab production. In this report, studies were performed to characterize the immune response to Nogo-66 and to determine the role of Nogo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of EAE-susceptible mouse strains with peptides derived from Nogo-66 induced a CNS immune response with clinical and pathological similarities to EAE. The Nogo-66 peptides elicited strong T cell responses that were not cross-reactive to other encephalitogenic myelin Ags. Using a large scale spotted microarray containing proteins and peptides derived from a wide spectrum of myelin components, we demonstrated that Nogo-66 peptides also generated a specific Ab response that spreads to several other encephalitogenic myelin Ags following immunization. Nogo-66-specific T cell lines ameliorated established EAE, via Nogo-66-specific Th2 cells that entered the CNS. These results indicate that some T cell and B cell immune responses to Nogo-66 are associated with suppression of ongoing EAE, whereas other Nogo-66 epitopes can be encephalitogenic. The multifaceted role of transglutaminase in neurodegeneration: Review article 8th International Congress on Amino Acids and Proteins A critical role for transglutaminase [TGase] has been hypothesized in the pathogenesis of the CAG trinucleotide repeat diseases, characterized by proteins with abnormal expansions of a polyglutamine domain. In the last few years the involvement of TGase in neurodegenerative diseases [NDS], including its role in aggregate formation, has been broadened to include Alzheimer's [AD] and Parkinson's Disease [PD]. It is clear that reduction of TGase activity is beneficial for prolonged survival in mouse models of NDS. The pathological progression of these diseases might reflect in part increases of TGase induced aggregates, or changes in other pathways influenced by increases in TGase activity. Neurodegeneration may be influenced by increased TGase activity affecting apoptosis, modulation of GTPase activity and signal transduction. This review will focus on the leading hypotheses in relation to both old and new experimental results.

Numerous groups have now validated high-throughput approaches to autoantibody profiling in a variety of systems. Recently, we have used autoantigen microarray technology to identify distinct autoantibody profiles in H-2 congenic MRL/lpr mice (Sekine et al., manuscript in preparation), and we are expanding this platform to study human and mouse models of IDDM and RA. We are also developing protein arrays for multiplex analysis of serum antibody isotypes. Multiplexed methods for autoantibody profiling will undoubtedly continue to uncover novel aspects of autoimmunity and B cell biology. It is now time to move these technologies beyond the proof-of-concept phase, and start addressing the next series of important questions. These include, but certainly are not limited to: identifying ""autoantibody signatures"" associated with disease state or outcome; profiling autoantibodies during the natural course of murine and human disease; and monitoring changes in autoantibody profiles of patients in response to therapeutic intervention. However, the next set of challenges is just right around the corner. As data and statistical analysis tools become more robust, it will be possible to generate and approach new hypotheses at an unprecedented pace. View details for Elaborate interactions between the immune and nervous systems The immune system and the nervous system maintain extensive communication, including 'hardwiring' of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves to lymphoid organs. Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and histamine modulate immune activity. Neuroendocrine hormones such as corticotropin-releasing factor, leptin and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone regulate cytokine balance. The immune system modulates brain activity, including body temperature, sleep and feeding behavior. Molecules such as the major histocompatibility complex not only direct T cells to immunogenic molecules held in its cleft but also modulate development of neuronal connections. Neurobiologists and immunologists are exploring common ideas like the synapse to understand properties such as memory that are shared in these two systems. View details for Statins as potential therapeutic agents in multiple sclerosis. Stve, O., Prod'homme, T., Youssef, S., Dunn, S., Neuhaus, O., Weber, M., Hartung, H., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (ie, statins) are oral cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins are well tolerated and have an excellent safety record. These agents competitively inhibit HMG CoA reductase, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to L-mevalonate. Although L-mevalonate is a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis, several of its metabolites are involved in post-translational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties, statins have important pleiotropic biologic effects. Recent reports indicate that statins have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Whether statins will be of clinical benefit for patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system will only be known after they are evaluated in prospective randomized clinical trials.

View details for Genomic and proteomic analysis of multiple sclerosis - Opinion Multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases result from the dysregulation of genetic and proteomic programs. In MS, the loss of immune homeostasis leads to aberrant targeting and destruction of the myelin sheath, which manifests as the clinical syndrome of MS. The advent of technologies to perform large-scale analysis of mRNA transcript and protein expression will transform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of MS, and will yield new targets for therapeutic intervention. An immunomodulatory GpG oligonucleotide for the treatment of autoimmunity via the innate and adaptive immune systems Ho, P. P., Fontoura, P., Ruiz, P. J., Steinman, L., Garren, H. Bacterial DNA and immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) activate the innate immune system to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Shown to be potent Th1-like adjuvants, stimulatory CpG motifs are currently used as effective therapeutic vaccines for various animal models of infectious diseases, tumors, allergies, and autoimmune diseases. In this study, we show that the application of an immunomodulatory GpG ODN, with a single base switch from CpG to GpG, can effectively inhibit the activation of Th1 T cells associated with autoimmune disease. Moreover, this immunomodulatory GpG ODN suppresses the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, a prototypic Th1-mediated animal disease model for multiple sclerosis.

S. 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, 'statins' are widely used oral cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to L-mevalonate, a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis. Certain metabolites of mevalonate are also involved in posttranslational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, statins have important biologic effects that may be independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties. Recent studies indicate that statins have antiinflammatory and neuroprotective properties which may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis as well as other central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative diseases. This article will outline current experimental evidence that may suggest potential clinical benefits for patients with CNS autoimmune disorders. Ultimately, clinical trials will have to determine the safety and efficacy of statins in this patient population. View details for Protein arrays for autoantibody profiling and fine-specificity mapping Protein arrays provide a powerful approach to study autoimmune disease. Autoimmune responses activate B cells to produce autoantibodies that recognize self-molecules termed autoantigens, many of which are proteins or protein complexes. Protein arrays enable profiling of the specificity of autoantibody responses against panels of peptides and proteins representing known autoantigens as well as candidate autoantigens. In addition to identifying autoantigens and mapping immunodominant epitopes, proteomic analysis of autoantibody responses will further enable diagnosis, prognosis, and tailoring of antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. Statins and their potential targets in multiple sclerosis therapy Stuve, O., Prod'homme, T., Slavin, A., Youssef, S., Dunn, S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a CNS-demyelinating disease characterised by relapsing and chronic neurological impairment. While traditionally CNS autoantigen-specific CD4(+) T cells have been considered the culprits in the initial phase of the disease, recent observations have altered this concept. It is now recognised that other T lymphocyte subclasses can initiate CNS demyelination. In addition, other cell types and molecules may play an important role in MS pathogenesis. There is overwhelming evidence that MS is a dynamic process, in which recurrent episodes of blood-brain barrier disruption and CNS inflammation play a crucial role in early disease stages, leading eventually to the largely irreversible changes of demyelination, gliosis and axonal degeneration. These observations may have important therapeutic implications. Within the last ten years, several medications have been approved for MS treatment. These agents, all of which are given parenterally, are only partially effective and are often associated with adverse effects and potential toxicities. The number and different types of medications used for MS are likely to increase in the near future, as several novel therapies are currently tested in clinical trials. 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, 'statins', are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are given orally, are safe and have biological effects independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties. Recent reports have shown that statins have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties that may be beneficial in the treatment of MS. This article will outline experimental evidence that suggests potential clinical benefits of statins for MS patients.

E., Amara, R. R., Steinman, L., Utz, P. J., Robinson, H. L., Robinson, W. H. We developed antigen microarrays to profile the breadth, strength, and kinetics of epitope-specific antiviral antibody responses in vaccine trials with a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These arrays contained 430 distinct proteins and overlapping peptides spanning the SHIV proteome. In macaques vaccinated with three different DNA and/or recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) vaccines encoding Gag-Pol or Gag-Pol-Env, these arrays distinguished vaccinated from challenged macaques, identified three novel viral epitopes, and predicted survival. Following viral challenge, anti-SHIV antibody responses ultimately converged to target eight immunodominant B-cell regions in Env regardless of vaccine regimen, host histocompatibility type, and divergent T-cell specificities. After challenge, responses to nonimmunodominant epitopes were transient, while responses to dominant epitopes were gained. These data suggest that the functional diversity of anti-SHIV B-cell responses is highly limited in the presence of persisting antigen.

P., Amor, S., Olsson, T., Utz, P. J., Garren, H., Steinman, L. The diversity of autoimmune responses poses a formidable challenge to the development of antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. We developed 'myelin proteome' microarrays to profile the evolution of autoantibody responses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Increased diversity of autoantibody responses in acute EAE predicted a more severe clinical course. Chronic EAE was associated with previously undescribed extensive intra- and intermolecular epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Array analysis of autoantigens targeted in acute EAE was used to guide the choice of autoantigen cDNAs to be incorporated into expression plasmids so as to generate tolerizing vaccines. Tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding a greater number of array-determined myelin targets proved superior in treating established EAE and reduced epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Proteomic monitoring of autoantibody responses provides a useful approach to monitor autoimmune disease and to develop and tailor disease- and patient-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines. Diverse targets for intervention during inflammatory and neurodegenerative phases of multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease that causes relapsing and chronic neurologic impairment. Recent observations have altered certain traditional concepts regarding MS pathogenesis. A greater diversity of cell types and molecules involved in MS is now evident. While remyelination can occur during the early inflammatory phase when damage may be reversible, it is impaired in the later stages, which involve axonal death. These observations have important therapeutic implications. View details for Osteopontin polymorphisms and disease course in multiple sclerosis Caillier, S., Barcellos, L. F., Baranzini, S. E., Swerdlin, A., Lincoln, R. R., Steinman, L., Martin, E., Haines, J. L., Pericak-Vance, M., Hauser, S. L., Oksenberg, J. R. Osteopontin (OPN), also known as early T-cell activating gene (Eta-1), has been recently shown to be a critical factor in the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and perhaps multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we investigated whether the 327T/C, 795C/T, 1128A/G or 1284A/C single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the OPN gene were correlated with susceptibility or any of the several clinical end points in a cohort of 821 MS patients. Overall, we observed no evidence of genetic association between the OPN polymorphisms and MS. Although not reaching statistical significance, a modest trend for association with disease course was detected in patients carrying at least one wild-type 1284A allele, suggesting an effect on disease course. Patients with this genotype were less likely to have a mild disease course and were at increased risk for a secondary-progressive clinical type. View details for Statins as potential therapeutic agents in neuroinflammatory disorders Stuve, O., Youssef, S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating disease that is thought to have an autoimmune pathogenesis. Recent results indicate that 'statins', 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, which are the most commonly used oral cholesterol-lowering drugs, have immunomodulatory properties. In this article we will review those findings that indicate that statins may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disease, and ischemic stroke.It was reported that statin treatment could either inhibit or reverse chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis. Several immunomodulatory properties of statins may account for their beneficial clinical effect: Statins decreased the migration of leukocytes into the central nervous system, inhibited MHC class II and costimulatory signals required for activation of proinflammatory T cells, induced a T(H)2 phenotype in T cells, and decreased the expression of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system, including nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor alpha. It was also demonstrated that statin use significantly reduced beta-amyloid secretion in the cerebrospinal fluid of experimental animals. Clinically, there is emerging evidence that statins have beneficial effects in patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and ischemic stroke.In-vitro studies have indicated that statins may have anti-inflammatory properties. Results from in-vivo animal models suggest that statins may be beneficial in treatment of different central nervous system conditions. Larger scale, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to validate the role of statins as a treatment of inflammatory central nervous system diseases.

Pedotti, R., Sanna, M., Tsai, M., DeVoss, J., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H., Galli, S. J. Insulin dependent (i.e., ""type 1"") diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is considered to be a T cell mediated disease in which TH1 and Tc autoreactive cells attack the pancreatic islets. Among the beta-cell antigens implicated in T1DM, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 appears to play a key role in the development of T1DM in humans as well as in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the experimental model for this disease. It has been shown that shifting the immune response to this antigen from TH1 towards TH2, via the administration of GAD65 peptides to young NOD mice, can suppress the progression to overt T1DM. Accordingly, various protocols of ""peptide immunotherapy"" of T1DM are under investigation. However, in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), another autoimmune TH1 mediated disease that mimics human multiple sclerosis, anaphylactic shock can occur when the mice are challenged with certain myelin self peptides that initially were administered with adjuvant to induce the disease.Here we show that NOD mice, that spontaneously develop T1DM, can develop fatal anaphylactic reactions upon challenge with preparations of immunodominant GAD65 self peptides after immunization with these peptides to modify the development of T1DM.These findings document severe anaphylaxis to self peptide preparations used in an attempt to devise immunotherapy for a spontaneous autoimmune disease. Taken together with the findings in EAE, these results suggest that peptide therapies designed to induce a TH1 to TH2 shift carry a risk for the development of anaphylactic reactivity to the therapeutic peptides. Multiple elements of the allergic arm of the immune response modulate autoimmune demyelination PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Pedotti, R., DeVoss, J. J., Youssef, S., Mitchell, D., Wedemeyer, J., Madanat, R., Garren, H., Fontoura, P., Tsai, M., GALLI, S. J., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. Analysis of mRNA from multiple sclerosis lesions revealed increased amounts of transcripts for several genes encoding molecules traditionally associated with allergic responses, including prostaglandin D synthase, histamine receptor type 1 (H1R), platelet activating factor receptor, Ig Fc epsilon receptor 1 (Fc epsilon RI), and tryptase. We now demonstrate that, in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), mediated by T helper 1 (Th1) T cells, histamine receptor 1 and 2 (H1R and H2R) are present on inflammatory cells in brain lesions. Th1 cells reactive to myelin proteolipid protein expressed more H1R and less H2R than Th2 cells. Pyrilamine, an H1R antagonist, blocked EAE, and the platelet activating factor receptor antagonist CV6209 reduced the severity of EAE. EAE severity was also decreased in mice with disruption of the genes encoding Ig Fc gamma RIII or both Fc gamma RIII and Fc epsilon RI. Prostaglandin D synthase and tryptase transcripts were elevated in EAE brain. Taken together, these data reveal extensive involvement of elements of the immune response associated with allergy in autoimmune demyelination. The pathogenesis of demyelination must now be viewed as encompassing elements of both Th1 responses and ""allergic"" responses.

View details for Protein and peptide array analysis of autoimmune disease Molecular cloning, sequencing of the human genome, and other major advances in biomedical research have contributed substantially to our understanding of autoimmune disease. Nevertheless, to date, such advances have failed to reveal the etiology of or yield curative therapies for autoimmune disease. New approaches are needed. Proteomics, the large-scale study of expression and function of proteins that compose our tissues and mediate disease, represents a powerful and promising strategy. We developed protein and peptide arrays to profile autoantibody responses in autoimmune disease. Protein and peptide array analysis of autoimmune samples is revealing human and pathogen proteins involved in initiation and perpetuation of autoimmunity. Proteomic determination of autoantibody profiles can be utilized for diagnosis, prognostication, and guiding tolerizing therapy for autoimmune disease. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, promotes a Th2 bias and reverses paralysis in central nervous system autoimmune disease Youssef, S., Stuve, O., Patarroyo, J. C., Ruiz, P. J., Radosevich, J. L., Hur, E. M., Bravo, M., Mitchell, D. J., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, which are approved for cholesterol reduction, may also be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) was tested in chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a CD4(+) Th1-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease model of multiple sclerosis. Here we show that oral atorvastatin prevented or reversed chronic and relapsing paralysis. Atorvastatin induced STAT6 phosphorylation and secretion of Th2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Conversely, STAT4 phosphorylation was inhibited and secretion of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) was suppressed. Atorvastatin promoted differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells. In adoptive transfer, these Th2 cells protected recipient mice from EAE induction. Atorvastatin reduced CNS infiltration and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression. Treatment of microglia inhibited IFN-gamma-inducible transcription at multiple MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) promoters and suppressed class II upregulation. Atorvastatin suppressed IFN-gamma-inducible expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules. l-Mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed atorvastatin's effects on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and T cells. Atorvastatin treatment of either APC or T cells suppressed antigen-specific T-cell activation. Thus, atorvastatin has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects involving both APC and T-cell compartments.

Pharmacotherapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) advanced with the demonstration that interferon beta and glatiramer acetate improve the clinical course of this disease. Mitoxantrone is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of secondary progressive MS. Despite this progress, the agents presently available are only partially effective, are difficult to administer, and may have significant side effects. Several orally administered immunomodulatory agents are presently being evaluated for treatment of MS. One class of drugs, HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), is safe and well-tolerated and could become another mainstay of MS therapy.This article reviews the clinical evidence for approved MS therapies and discusses their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the clinical and laboratory data suggesting a potential role for statins in MS therapy are discussed.Although treatment with interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and mitoxantrone, the approved therapies, provide important treatment options for patients with relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS, the potential benefits of other medications, including statins, should be explored in controlled clinical trials.

J., Steinman, L. Women with multiple sclerosis have significantly diminished disease activity during pregnancy. The purpose of our study was to identify the underlying mechanism for the diminished disease activity. We found that during the period of late pregnancy there is protection against paralysis, during both the induction and effector phases of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We did not find any changes in the cytokine secretion profiles or the proliferative activity of autoreactive T cells from mice induced during late pregnancy compared with virgin controls. In mice mated after disease onset, the inflammatory histologic lesions did not clear, despite marked clinical improvement during pregnancy. We found evidence for a serum factor present in late pregnancy that suppresses T cell activation. In the presence of sera taken from mice late in pregnancy, the proliferative response and IL-2 production of proteolipid protein p139-151-specific T cells were significantly diminished as compared with stimulation in the presence of normal mouse sera. In conclusion, serum from late pregnancy has the capacity to down-regulate T cell responses and might be associated with the amelioration of disease activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

The development of vaccines is arguably the most significant achievement in medicine to date. The practice of innoculation with the fluid from a sore to protect from a disease actually dates back to ancient China; however, with the introduction of Jenner's smallpox vaccine, and greater understanding of the immune system, vaccines have become specific and systematic. Traditional vaccines have used killed pathogens (hepatitis A and the Salk polio vaccines), immunogenic subunits of a given pathogen (hepatitis B subunit vaccine), or live attenuated pathogens (measles, mumps, rubella, Sabin polio vaccines) to generate protective immunity. Currently, a new generation of vaccines that use the genetic material of a pathogen to elicit protective immunity are being developed. Although the most widespread and successful use of vaccines today remains in the arena of infectious diseases, manipulations of immune responses to protect against cancers, neurologic diseases, and autoimmunity are being explored rigorously.

J., Oksenberg, J. R., Raine, C. S., Heller, R., Steinman, L. Microarray analysis of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions obtained at autopsy revealed increased transcripts of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 and -17, interferon-gamma and associated downstream pathways. Comparison of two poles of MS pathology--acute lesions with inflammation versus 'silent' lesions without inflammation--revealed differentially transcribed genes. Some products of these genes were chosen as targets for therapy of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is upregulated in acute, but not in chronic, MS lesions, and the effect on ameliorating EAE is more pronounced in the acute phase, in contrast to knocking out the immunoglobulin Fc receptor common gamma chain where the effect is greatest on chronic disease. These results in EAE corroborate the microarray studies on MS lesions. Large-scale analysis of transcripts in MS lesions elucidates new aspects of pathology and opens possibilities for therapy.

We constructed miniaturized autoantigen arrays to perform large-scale multiplex characterization of autoantibody responses directed against structurally diverse autoantigens, using submicroliter quantities of clinical samples. Autoantigen microarrays were produced by attaching hundreds of proteins, peptides and other biomolecules to the surface of derivatized glass slides using a robotic arrayer. Arrays were incubated with patient serum, and spectrally resolvable fluorescent labels were used to detect autoantibody binding to specific autoantigens on the array. We describe and characterize arrays containing the major autoantigens in eight distinct human autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. This represents the first report of application of such technology to multiple human disease sera, and will enable validated detection of antibodies recognizing autoantigens including proteins, peptides, enzyme complexes, ribonucleoprotein complexes, DNA and post-translationally modified antigens. Autoantigen microarrays represent a powerful tool to study the specificity and pathogenesis of autoantibody responses, and to identify and define relevant autoantigens in human autoimmune diseases.

V., Becher, M. W., Springer, J. E., Chabas, D., Youssef, S., Pedotti, R., Mitchell, D., Steinman, L. An expanded polyglutamine domain in huntingtin underlies the pathogenic events in Huntington disease (HD), characterized by chorea, dementia and severe weight loss, culminating in death. Transglutaminase (TGase) may be critical in the pathogenesis, via cross-linking huntingtin. Administration of the TGase competitive inhibitor, cystamine, to transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of huntingtin containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat, altered the course of their HD-like disease. Cystamine given intraperitoneally entered brain where it inhibited TGase activity. When treatment began after the appearance of abnormal movements, cystamine extended survival, reduced associated tremor and abnormal movements and ameliorated weight loss. Treatment did not influence the appearance or frequency of neuronal nuclear inclusions. Unexpectedly, cystamine treatment increased transcription of one of the two genes shown to be neuroprotective for polyglutamine toxicity in Drosophila, dnaj (also known as HDJ1 and Hsp40 in humans and mice, respectively). Inhibition of TGase provides a new treatment strategy for HD and other polyglutamine diseases. View details for Evidence for a role for transglutaminase in Huntington's disease and the potential therapeutic implications Transglutaminase (TGase) activity is increased in affected regions of brains from patients with Huntington's disease (HD).

Gamma-glutaminyl-lysyl cross-links have been detected in nuclear inclusions in HD brain, indicating that TGase may play a prominent role in the aggregation of huntingtin (htt). Attempts to ameliorate experimental disease, via inhibition of TGase in transgenic models of HD in mice, are under investigation. View details for Autoantibody profiling for the study and treatment of autoimmune disease Hueber, W., Utz, P. J., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Proteomics technologies enable profiling of autoantibody responses using biological fluids derived from patients with autoimmune disease. They provide a powerful tool to characterize autoreactive B-cell responses in diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Autoantibody profiling may serve purposes including classification of individual patients and subsets of patients based on their 'autoantibody fingerprint', examination of epitope spreading and antibody isotype usage, discovery and characterization of candidate autoantigens, and tailoring antigen-specific therapy. In the coming decades, proteomics technologies will broaden our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of and will further our ability to diagnose, prognosticate and treat autoimmune disease. Multiple sclerosis: Deeper understanding of its pathogenesis reveals new targets for therapy Steinman, L., Martin, R., Bernard, C., Conlon, P., Oksenberg, J. R. Recent technological breakthroughs allowing for large-scale analysis of gene transcripts and large-scale monitoring of the immune response with protein chips are revealing new participants in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Some of these participants may be useful targets for therapy.

R., Daikhin, Y., Yudkoff, M., Folk, J. E., Steinman, L., Browne, S. E., Beal, M. F., BLASS, J. P., Cooper, A. J. Pathological-length polyglutamine (Q(n)) expansions, such as those that occur in the huntingtin protein (htt) in Huntington's disease (HD), are excellent substrates for tissue transglutaminase in vitro, and transglutaminase activity is increased in post-mortem HD brain. However, direct evidence for the participation of tissue transglutaminase (or other transglutaminases) in HD patients in vivo is scarce. We now report that levels of N(epsilon)-(gamma-L-glutamyl)-L-lysine (GGEL)--a 'marker' isodipeptide produced by the transglutaminase reaction--are elevated in the CSF of HD patients (708 +/- 41 pmol/mL, SEM, n = 36) vs. control CSF (228 +/- 36, n = 27); p < 0.0001. These data support the hypothesis that transglutaminase activity is increased in HD brain in vivo.

R., Denhardt, D. T., Sobel, R. A., Lock, C., Karpuj, M., Pedotti, R., Heller, R., Oksenberg, J. R., Steinman, L. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease, characterized by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, possibly due to autoimmunity. Large-scale sequencing of cDNA libraries, derived from plaques dissected from brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), indicated an abundance of transcripts for osteopontin (OPN). Microarray analysis of spinal cords from rats paralyzed by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, also revealed increased OPN transcripts. Osteopontin-deficient mice were resistant to progressive EAE and had frequent remissions, and myelin-reactive T cells in OPN-/- mice produced more interleukin 10 and less interferon-gamma than in OPN+/+ mice. Osteopontin thus appears to regulate T helper cell-1 (TH1)-mediated demyelinating disease, and it may offer a potential target in blocking development of progressive MS.

J., DeVoss, J. J., Nguyen, L. V., Fontoura, P. P., Hirschberg, D. L., Mitchell, D. J., Garcia, K. C., Steinman, L. T cell-mediated destruction of the myelin sheath causes inflammatory damage of the CNS in multiple sclerosis (MS). The major T and B cell responses in MS patients who are HLA-DR2 (about two-thirds of MS patients) react to a region between residues 84 and 103 of myelin basic protein (1 ). The crystal structure of HLA-DR2 complexed with myelin basic protein(84-102) confirmed that Lys(91) is the major TCR contact site, whereas Phe(90) is a major anchor to MHC and binds the hydrophobic P4 pocket (2 ). We have tested peptides containing repetitive 4-aa sequences designed to bind critical MHC pockets and to interfere with T cell activation. One such sequence, EYYKEYYKEYYK, ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats, an animal model of MS.

Spinal cord injury results in a massive loss of neurons, and thus of function. We recently reported that passive transfer of autoimmune T cells directed against myelin-associated antigens provides acutely damaged spinal cords with effective neuroprotection. The therapeutic time window for the passive transfer of T cells was found to be at least 1 week. Here we show that posttraumatic T cell-based active vaccination is also neuroprotective. Immunization with myelin-associated antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) significantly promoted recovery after spinal cord contusion injury in the rat model. To reduce the risk of autoimmune disease while retaining the benefit of the immunization, we vaccinated the rats immediately after severe incomplete spinal cord injury with MBP-derived altered peptide ligands. Immunization with these peptides resulted in significant protection from neuronal loss and thus in a reduced extent of paralysis, assessed by an open-field behavioral test. Retrograde labeling of the rubrospinal tracts and magnetic resonance imaging supported the behavioral results. Further optimization of nonpathogenic myelin-derived peptides can be expected to lead the way to the development of an effective therapeutic vaccination protocol as a strategy for the prevention of total paralysis after incomplete spinal cord injury. View details for Immunization with DNA encoding an immunodominant peptide of insulin prevents diabetes in NOD mice Urbanek-Ruiz, I., Ruiz, P. J., Paragas, V., Garren, H., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G. DNA vaccination is an effective means of protecting experimental animals against infectious pathogens and cancer and has more recently been used to prevent autoimmune disease. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas. The NOD mouse is an animal model of IDDM in which several autoantigens, including insulin, have been identified. In this study we demonstrate that vaccination of NOD mice with DNA encoding an immunodominant peptide of insulin (residues 9-23 of the B chain) protects the animals from developing diabetes. Animals injected intramuscularly with a bacterial plasmid encoding the insulin B chain peptide show significantly lower disease incidence and delayed onset of disease when compared to controls. Protection appears to be mediated by insulin B (9-23)-specific down-regulation of IFN-gamma. Our results confirm that DNA vaccination has a protective effect on autoimmunity, the understanding of which will reveal new insights into the immune system and open doors for novel therapies.

A., Fontoura, P., Nguyen, L. V., Estline, E. R., Hirschberg, D. L., Steinman, L. Using a combination of local gene delivery and tolerizing DNA vaccination, we demonstrate that codelivery of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene and a DNA vaccine encoding the self-peptide proteolipid protein 139-151 (PLP139-151) provides protective immunity against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We provide evidence for a mechanism whereby IL-4 expressed from the naked DNA is secreted and acts locally on autoreactive T cells via activation of STAT6 to shift their cytokine profile to T helper 2. We also show that DNA vaccines can be used to reverse established EAE by covaccination with the genes for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and IL-4. This treatment strategy combines the antigen-specific effects of DNA vaccination and the beneficial effects of local gene delivery.

View details for Antigen specific immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis The development of antigen specific therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) involves specifically suppressing undesired immune responses targeting the myelin sheath and underlying axon. We have recently reported some success with altered peptide ligands for a major target of the autoimmune response in MS. Antigen specific therapy has the potential to suppress undesirable autoimmunity, while leaving the rest of the immune system intact. Induction of an antigen specific Th1-to-Th2 shift could achieve this aim, once side effects, such as allergic responses, are minimized with optimal dosing.

J., Steinman, L. EAE can refer either to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Although EAE is classically a prototypic T helper 1 (TH1) cell-mediated autoimmune disease, it can also be induced by TH2 cells. Characteristically, the most severe manifestation of allergy, anaphylaxis, is associated with exposure to a foreign antigen that is often derived from medication, insect venom or food. We report here that, after self-tolerance to myelin is destroyed, anaphylaxis may be triggered by a self-antigen, in this case a myelin peptide. ""Horror autotoxicus"", which was initially described by Ehrlich, may not only include autoimmunity to self, it may also encompass immediate hypersensitivity to self, which leads to shock and rapid death.

A., Mitchell, D. J., Pattabiraman, K., Pelkey, E. T., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Certain proteins contain subunits that enable their active translocation across the plasma membrane into cells. In the specific case of HIV-1, this subunit is the basic domain Tat(49-57) (RKKRRQRRR). To establish the optimal structural requirements for this translocation process, and thereby to develop improved molecular transporters that could deliver agents into cells, a series of analogues of Tat(49-57) were prepared and their cellular uptake into Jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. All truncated and alanine-substituted analogues exhibited diminished cellular uptake, suggesting that the cationic residues of Tat(49-57) play a principal role in its uptake. Charge alone, however, is insufficient for transport as oligomers of several cationic amino acids (histidine, lysine, and ornithine) are less effective than Tat(49-57) in cellular uptake. In contrast, a 9-mer of l-arginine (R9) was 20-fold more efficient than Tat(49-57) at cellular uptake as determined by Michaelis-Menton kinetic analysis. The d-arginine oligomer (r9) exhibited an even greater uptake rate enhancement (>100-fold). Collectively, these studies suggest that the guanidinium groups of Tat(49-57) play a greater role in facilitating cellular uptake than either charge or backbone structure. Based on this analysis, we designed and synthesized a class of polyguanidine peptoid derivatives. Remarkably, the subset of peptoid analogues containing a six-methylene spacer between the guanidine head group and backbone (N-hxg), exhibited significantly enhanced cellular uptake compared to Tat(49-57) and even to r9. Overall, a transporter has been developed that is superior to Tat(49-57), protease resistant, and more readily and economically prepared. View details for Polyarginine enters cells more efficiently than other polycationic homopolymers Mitchell, D. J., Kim, D. T., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G., Rothbard, J. B. Homopolymers or peptides containing a high percentage of cationic amino acids have been shown to have a unique ability to cross the plasma membrane of cells, and consequently have been used to facilitate the uptake of a variety of biopolymers and small molecules. To investigate whether the polycationic character of these molecules, or some other structural feature, was the molecular basis for the effect, the ability of a variety of homopolymers to enter cells was assayed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Polymers of L- or D-arginine containing six or more amino acids entered cells far more effectively than polymers of equal length composed of lysine, ornithine and histidine. Peptides of fewer than six amino acids were ineffective. The length of the arginine side-chain could be varied without significant loss of activity. These data combined with the inability of polymers of citrulline to enter cells demonstrated that the guanidine headgroup of arginine was the critical structural component responsible for the biological activity. Cellular uptake could be inhibited by preincubation of the cells with sodium azide, but not by low temperature (3 degrees C), indicating that the process was energy dependent, but did not involve endocytosis.

In this 'double-blind', randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we compared an altered peptide ligand of myelin basic protein with placebo, evaluating their safety and influence on magnetic resonance imaging in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. A safety board suspended the trial because of hypersensitivity reactions in 9% of the patients. There were no increases in either clinical relapses or in new enhancing lesions in any patient, even those with hypersensitivity reactions. Secondary analysis of those patients completing the study showed that the volume and number of enhancing lesions were reduced at a dose of 5 mg. There was also a regulatory type 2 T helper-cell response to altered peptide ligand that cross-reacted with the native peptide.

A., Gijbels, K., Tropper, F. D., Bednarski, M., Li, K. C., Steinman, L. The expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in the intact brains of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) was visualized by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) through the use of a new, target-specific MR contrast agent. Antibody-conjugated paramagnetic liposomes (ACPLs) were designed to achieve in vivo targeting of molecules expressed on vascular endothelium, while providing sufficient signal enhancement at these sites for detection by MRI. ACPLs targeted to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an endothelial leukocyte receptor upregulated on cerebral microvasculature during EAE, were administered to diseased mice. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that fluorescently-tagged ACPLs were localized to central nervous system (CNS) microvasculature in a pattern consistent with ICAM-1 upregulation described immunohistochemically. High resolution MRI of mouse brains ex vivo demonstrated that ACPL binding conferred significant enhancement of signal intensity (SI) as compared to control images. These results suggest that ACPLs can be used as MRI contrast agents to visualize specific molecules expressed on vascular endothelium during disease.

W., Hirschberg, D. L., Xiao, J., Lu, Q., Roederer, M., Lock, C. B., Herzenberg, L. A., Steinman, L., Herzenberg, L. A. Multigenic programs controlling susceptibility to apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation have not yet been defined. Here, using DNA microarrays, we show gene expression patterns in an apoptosis-sensitive and apoptosis-resistant murine B cell lymphoma model system both before and after irradiation. From the 11,000 genes interrogated by the arrays, two major patterns emerged. First, before radiation exposure the radioresistant LYar cells expressed significantly greater levels of message for several genes involved in regulating intracellular redox potential. Compared with LYas cells, LYar cells express 20- to 50-fold more mRNA for the tetraspanin CD53 and for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Expression of both of these genes can lead to the increase of total cellular glutathione, which is the principle intracellular antioxidant and has been shown to inhibit many forms of apoptosis. A second pattern emerged after radiation, when the apoptosis-sensitive LYas cells induced rapid expression of a unique cluster of genes characterized by their involvement in mitochondrial electron transport. Some of these genes have been previously recognized as proapoptotic; however others, such as uncoupling protein 2, were not previously known to be apoptotic regulatory proteins. From these observations we propose that a multigenic program for sensitivity to apoptosis involves induction of transcripts for genes participating in mitochondrial uncoupling and loss of membrane potential. This program triggers mitochondrial release of apoptogenic factors and induces the ""caspase cascade."" Conversely, cells resistant to apoptosis down-regulate these biochemical pathways, while activating pathways for establishment and maintenance of high intracellular redox potential by means of elevated glutathione.

A., Gussoni, E., Begovich, A. B., MURRAY, R. S., Zang, Y. Q., Appel, S. H., Steinman, L., Zhang, J. W. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disorder whose etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the presence of inflammatory infiltrates within ALS spinal cord and suggested the possibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron degeneration. We have analyzed the diversity of T-cells in the spinal cord in ALS. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with variable (V) region sequence specific oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify T-cell receptor (TCR)BV transcripts from spinal cords obtained at autopsy from patients with ALS, patients who died without inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, brains from patients with ALS, and brains from patients who died with inflammatory CNS disease. Sequencing was then performed on the amplified transcripts. An overall increase in the level of TCRBV 2 transcripts was detected in ALS specimens when compared to controls. This result was independent of the HLA genotype of the individual. Furthermore, enrichment of TCRBV2-positive T cells could be demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid derived from patients with ALS, using PCR analysis and a T cell stimulation assay with toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), a Vbeta2-specific superantigen. Our results suggest that an immunological process involving the specific expansion of Vbeta2 TCR-positive T-cells may be important in the pathogenesis of ALS.

V., Garren, H., Slunt, H., Price, D. L., Gusella, J., Becher, M. W., Steinman, L. The protein huntingtin (htt), aggregated in neuronal nuclear inclusions, is pathognomonic of Huntington's disease (HD). Constructs, translated in vitro from the N terminus of htt, containing either polyQ23 from a normal individual, or polyQ41 or polyQ67 from an HD patient, were all soluble. Transglutaminase (TGase) crosslinked these proteins, and the aggregations did not have the staining properties of amyloid. More TGase-catalyzed aggregates formed when the polyglutamine domain of htt exceeded the pathologic threshold of polyQ36. Furthermore, shorter htt constructs, containing 135 aa or fewer, formed more aggregates than did larger htt constructs. TGase activity in the HD brain was increased compared with the control, with notable increases in cell nuclei. The increased TGase activity was brain specific. In lymphoblastoid cells from HD patients, TGase activity was decreased. TGase-mediated crosslinking of htt may be involved in the formation of the nonamyloidogenic nuclear inclusions found in the HD brain. The staining properties of nuclear inclusions in the HD brain revealed that they were not amyloid.

L., VEROMAA, T. The role of various adhesion molecules in lymphocyte homing to the brain and in inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) was examined in mice. Activated T cell lines and clones expressed CD44 and integrin alpha4, but not L-selectin, and entered the CNS independent of their antigen specificity. mAbs directed against CD44 and integrin alpha4 prevented the transfer of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by myelin basic protein-specific T cells. T cells preincubated with anti-CD44 or antiintegrin alpha4 were blocked only partially from entering the brain parenchyma. However, both antibodies efficiently prevented CNS inflammation and clinical expression of EAE when injected in vivo. This effect lasted as long as antibodies were administered. Antibodies specific for L-selectin had no effect on homing of encephalitogenic T cells to the brain or development of EAE. Antiintegrin alpha4 and anti-CD44 did not impair the activation and function of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro and did not deplete integrin alpha4- or CD44-positive cells in vivo. These data suggest that, in the absence of leukocyte recruitment, the entry of a reduced number of activated myelin basic protein-reactive T cells in the CNS is not sufficient for the development and expression of EAE. We propose that antibodies to integrin alpha4 and CD44 prevent clinical disease by partially targeting the primary influx of encephalitogenic T cells and by preventing the secondary influx of leukocytes to lesions initiated by the transferred T cells.

M., Levite, M., Karpuj, M. V., Southwood, S., Sette, A., Conlon, P., Steinman, L. Molecular mimicry refers to structural homologies between a self-protein and a microbial protein. A major epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), p87-99 (VHFFKNIVTPRTP), induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). VHFFK contains the major residues for binding of this self-molecule to T cell receptor (TCR) and to the major histocompatibility complex. Peptides from papilloma virus strains containing the motif VHFFK induce EAE. A peptide from human papilloma virus type 40 (HPV 40) containing VHFFR, and one from HPV 32 containing VHFFH, prevented EAE. A sequence from Bacillus subtilis (RKVVTDFFKNIPQRI) also prevented EAE. T cell lines, producing IL-4 and specific for these microbial peptides, suppressed EAE. Thus, microbial peptides, differing from the core motif of the self-antigen, MBPp87-99, function as altered peptide ligands, and behave as TCR antagonists, in the modulation of autoimmune disease.

J., Garren, H., Ruiz, I. U., Hirschberg, D. L., Nguyen, L. V., Karpuj, M. V., Cooper, M. T., Mitchell, D. J., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Usually we rely on vaccination to promote an immune response to a pathogenic microbe. In this study, we demonstrate a suppressive from of vaccination, with DNA encoding a minigene for residues 139-151 of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP139-151), a pathogenic self-Ag. This suppressive vaccination attenuates a prototypic autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which presents clinically with paralysis. Proliferative responses and production of the Th1 cytokines, IL-2 and IFN-gamma, were reduced in T cells responsive to PLP139-151. In the brains of mice that were successfully vaccinated, mRNA for IL-2, IL-15, and IFN-gamma were reduced. A mechanism underlying the reduction in severity and incidence of paralytic autoimmune disease and the reduction in Th1 cytokines involves altered costimulation of T cells; loading of APCs with DNA encoding PLP139-151 reduced the capacity of a T cell line reactive to PLP139-151 to proliferate even in the presence of exogenous CD28 costimulation. DNA immunization with the myelin minigene for PLP-altered expression of B7.1 (CD80), and B7.2 (CD86) on APCs in the spleen.

T cells with somatically acquired mutations in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene were isolated from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) as representatives of populations potentially enriched for in vivo activated T cells. TCRB gene V region usage among mutant isolates from individual IDDM patients, but not from normal controls, showed a pronounced preference for BV14 and, to a lesser extent, BV6. Wild-type (nonmutant) isolates did not show such preferences. Extensive in vivo clonal expansions of the BV14 expressing mutant T cells from IDDM patients were revealed by sequence identity of TCRB chain junctional regions. These data support restricted TCRB gene usage in T cell populations enriched for in vivo activated clones in patients with IDDM.

P., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that serves as a model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. Paralysis is ""induced"" by CD4+ T cells of the Th1 phenotype. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a Th1 type cytokine, has been shown to be upregulated in the CNS during the onset of EAE, and systemic manipulations of TNF have had substantial effects on disease progression. However, the precise role of TNF in EAE has been called into question by recent experiments utilizing TNF and lymphotoxin knockout mice. We demonstrate here that the local delivery of TNF by myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells, retrovirally transduced to express TNF, exacerbated MBP-induced disease following adoptive transfer into syngeneic mice.

M., Liblau, R., Chelvanayagam, G., Steinman, L., Boston, T. Molecular mimicry has been suggested as a mode of autoreactive T cell stimulation in autoimmune diseases. Myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide 1-11 induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in susceptible strains of mice. Here we show that a herpesvirus Saimiri (HVS) peptide, AAQRRPSRPFA, with a limited homology to MBP1-11 peptide, ASQKRPSQRHG (underlined letters showing homology), can stimulate a panel of MBP-11-specific T cell hybridomas and more importantly cause EAE in mice. We demonstrate that this is due to cross-recognition of these two peptides by TCRs. Results presented in this communication are the first demonstration that a viral peptide with homology at just 5 amino acids with a self peptide can induce clinical signs of EAE in mice. These findings have important implications in understanding the breakdown of T cell tolerance to self Ags in autoimmune diseases by means of cross-reactivity with unrelated peptides.

L., Carmi, P., Erez, N., Garren, H., Herkel, J., Karpuj, M., Steinman, L., Rotter, V., Cohen, I. R. The p53 molecule might serve as a common tumor-associated antigen, as the tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated and the p53 protein is often over-expressed in tumor cells. We report that effective immunity to p53 can be induced through an idiotypic network by immunization of mice with a monoclonal antibody (PAb-240) specific for mutated p53, or with a peptide derived from the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of the variable domain of the light chain (VL) of this antibody. The immunized mice produced IgG antibodies to p53 and mounted a cytotoxic reaction to a tumor line bearing mutated p53. The idiotypically immunized mice were resistant to challenge with the tumor cells. Thus antibodies to p53 might serve as immunogens for activating resistance to some tumors. At the basic level, these findings indicate that a network of p53 immunity may be organized naturally within the immune system.

An immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), VHFFKNIVTPRTP (p87-99), is a major target of T cells in brain lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), and this peptide can trigger experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We designed truncated peptides based on this pathogenic 13-mer that are not antigenic. These short peptides reduced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in vivo. Moreover, paraplegic rats given the 7-mer FKNIVTP in soluble form showed total reversal of paralysis in 24 h. Truncated peptides that are too small to stimulate antigenic responses to pathogenic regions of myelin basic protein are nevertheless effective tolerogens and are able to anergize autoreactive T cells. Short peptide-based tolerogens, devoid of immunogenic and pathogenic potential, may be attractive for therapy of autoimmune diseases. View details for Dal Canto, R. A., Shaw, M.

A model will be proposed that includes the initial activation of naive T lymphocytes through T cell receptor-mediated recognition of microbial antigens presented by MHC class II molecules. This event might be followed by re-activation of autoreactive T cells by bacterial and viral superantigens. Both mechanisms could lead to acute and relapsing autoimmune disease. View details for Neuropeptides, via specific receptors, regulate T cell adhesion to fibronectin Levite, M., Cahalon, L., HERSHKOVIZ, R., Steinman, L., Lider, O. The ability of T cells to adhere to and interact with components of the blood vessel walls and the extracellular matrix is essential for their extravasation and migration into inflamed sites. We have found that the beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion of resting human T cells to fibronectin, a major glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix, is induced by physiologic concentrations of three neuropeptides: calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP), neuropeptide Y, and somatostatin; each acts via its own specific receptor on the T cell membrane. In contrast, substance P (SP), which coexists with CGRP in the majority of peripheral endings of sensory nerves, including those innervating the lymphoid organs, blocks T cell adhesion to fibronectin when induced by CGRP, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, and PMA. Inhibition of T cell adhesion was obtained both by the intact SP peptide and by its 1-4 N-terminal and its 4-11, 5-11, and 6-11 C-terminal fragments, used at similar nanomolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the parent SP peptide and its fragments were abrogated by an SP NK-1 receptor antagonist, suggesting they all act through the same SP NK-1 receptor. These findings suggest that neuropeptides, by activating their specific T cell-expressed receptors, can provide the T cells with both positive (proadhesive) and negative (antiadhesive) signals and thereby regulate their function. Thus, neuropeptides may influence diverse physiologic processes involving integrins, including leukocyte-mediated migration and inflammation.

Th1 cells, important for cell-mediated immunity by their production of IL-2, IFN-gamma and lymphotoxin, have been implicated in the immunopathology of certain organ-specific autoimmune diseases whereas a role as regulators has been suggested for IL-4 and IL-10 producing Th2 cells. Recent findings, however, beg re-evaluation of the direct role of Th2 cells in the induction or maintenance of tolerance, whereas evidence for the role of a distinct subset of regulatory T cells producing TGF-beta to suppress cell-mediated immunopathology is compelling.

W., Catz, I., Hausmann, S., STROMINGER, J. L., Steinman, L., Warren, K. G. Myelin basic protein (MBP) may be an important autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS), with the MBP(82-100) region being immunodominant for T cells and autoantibodies. The structural requirements for autoantibody recognition were compared to those previously defined for MBP-specific T cell clones. MBP autoantibodies were affinity-purified from central nervous system lesions of 11/12 postmortem cases studied. The MBP(83-97) peptide was immunodominant in all 11 cases since it inhibited autoantibody binding to MBP > 95%. Residues contributing to autoantibody binding were located in a 10-amino acid segment (V86-T95) that also contained the MHC/T cell receptor contact residues of the T cell epitope. In the epitope center, the same residues were important for antibody binding and T cell recognition. Based on the antibody-binding motif, microbial peptides were identified that were bound by purified autoantibodies. Autoantibody binding of microbial peptides required sequence identity at four or five contiguous residues in the epitope center. Microbial peptides previously found to activate T cell clones did not have such obvious homology to MBP since sequence identity was not required at MHC contacts. The similar fine specificity of B cells and T cells may be useful for tolerance induction to MBP in MS. View details for Perivascular T cells express the pro-inflammatory chemokine RANTES mRNA in multiple sclerosis lesions Hvas, J., McLean, C., Justesen, J., Kannourakis, G., Steinman, L., Oksenberg, J. R., Bernard, C. C. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by accumulation of mononuclear cells. The pathogenesis of MS is complex and probably involves soluble immune mediators, particularly cytokines, and activated memory T cells, that are thought to migrate into the CNS. During lesion formation in MS, cytokines regulate cell functions, such as cell recruitment and migration. Because the chemokine RANTES play a role in both activating and recruiting leucocytes, particularly memory T cells into inflammatory sites, the authors have assessed RANTES mRNA levels at the site of lesions. Expression levels were analysed in brain samples and compared with neurological, infectious and other controls. RANTES was expressed by activated perivascular memory T cells, predominantly located at the edge of active plaques. While RANTES mRNA was detected in all 17 MS brains analysed, it was only found in six of the 14 control patients and generally at a lower expression level. In view of the regulatory and chemotactic properties of RANTES, these results imply that RANTES in MS lesions may play an important role in the activation and/or selective accumulation of memory T cells and, thereby, in the pathogenic events associated with MS.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) exerts a major role in the stress response. Both CRF and urocortin, a newly discovered neuropeptide homologous to CRF, suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Suppression of paralysis with CRF involved stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and inhibitory effects on an encephalitogenic T cell line. While CRF increased glucocorticoid production, which is known to block EAE, it also suppressed EAE in adrenalectomized rats, where glucocorticoid stimulation via CRF plays no role. Moreover, the encephalitogenicity of a T cell line exposed to CRF in vitro was reduced. Stress may influence autoimmune disease through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and directly via the immune system.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system which serves as a model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. We demonstrate here that encephalitogenic T cells, transduced with a retroviral gene, construct to express interleukin 4, and can delay the onset and reduce the severity of EAE when adoptively transferred to myelin basic protein-immunized mice. Thus, T lymphocytes transduced with retroviral vectors can deliver ""regulatory cytokines"" in a site-specific manner and may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune disease. View details for Multiple sclerosis: a polygenic disease involving epistatic interactions, germline rearrangements and environmental effects Several regions of the human genome are associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS). We review studies of linkage of MS to germline genes using microsatellites. A modest effect on susceptibility was seen with markers in the vicinity of 6p21 (HLA) and 17q22. The influence of epistatic interactions between these genes is considered. The impact of genetic rearrangements of certain germline genes on susceptibility to MS is described. Analysis of TCR gene rearrangements has established some of the target antigens of the immune response in MS. Environmental influences on MS are described with particular attention given to how microbes might trigger demyelinating disease. View details for Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in IL-4-deficient mice Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in an inflammatory demyelinating disease which usually follows a monophasic course. Autoreactive Th1 CD4+ T cells are responsible for the lesions, whereas autoreactive Th2 CD4+ T cells can, upon adoptive transfer, suppress the disease process. However, the role of IL-4 and Th2 cells in the spontaneous remission of EAE and in the prevention of relapses is not known. We have addressed these issues using IL-4-deficient mice in which the differentiation of Th2 CD4+ T cells is severely compromised. The clinical course of actively induced EAE was compared in IL-4+/+, IL-4+ /- and IL-4-/- mice on the PL/J genetic background. No significant differences were noted between groups for the frequency, severity and duration of EAE, and the frequency of relapses. Our results indicate that IL-4, despite its well-documented regulatory role in EAE, is not necessary for the spontaneous remission of disease or for the prevention of relapses. Therefore, in the absence of IL-4, overlapping or compensatory immunoregulatory mechanisms can restrict an inflammatory response within the central nervous system.

A., Chalmers, D., Crowe, P. D., Pahuja, A., Ling, N., Brocke, S., Steinman, L., Conlon, P. J. T-cells specific for a region of human myelin basic protein, amino acids 87-99 (hMBP87-99), have been implicated in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Administration of soluble altered peptide ligand (APL), made by substituting native residues with alanine at either positions 91(91K > A or A91) or 97 (97R > A or A97) in the hMBP87-99 peptide, blocked the development of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), in the SJL mouse. The non-encephalitogenic APL A91, appears to induce cytokine shifts from Th1 to Th2 in the target T-cells, whereas the encephalitogenic superagonist APL A97 causes deletion of the MBP87-99 responsive cells. Thus, single amino acid changes at different positions in the same peptide epitope can lead to APL capable of controlling auto-immune disease by different mechanisms.

M., Steinman, L., Blau, H. M. We evaluated myoblast implantation in 10 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and absent dystrophin (age 5-10 years) who were implanted with 100 million myoblasts in the anterior tibial muscle of one leg and placebo in the other. Cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) was administered for 7 months. Pre- and postimplantation (after 1 and 6 months) muscle biopsies were analyzed. Force generation (tetanic tension and maximum voluntary contraction) was measured monthly in a double-blind design. There was increased force generation in both legs of all boys, probably due to cyclosporine. Using the polymerase chain reaction, evidence of myoblast survival and dystrophin mRNA expression was obtained in 3 patients after 1 month and in 1 patient after 6 months. These studies suggest a salutary effect of cyclosporine upon muscular force generation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; however, myoblast implantation was not effective in replacing clinically significant amounts of dystrophin in DMD muscle.

H., Steinman, L. Aminoguanidine (AG), a selective inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, prevented the clinical development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with a reduction in inflammation and demyelination. Administration of AG reduced the expression of nitrosotyrosine in inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system. Cytokine expression, determined by semiquantitative PCR, revealed increased expression of IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta, which was associated with protection from EAE, and reduced TNF-alpha, associated with the development of EAE. Furthermore, AG blocked the secretion of nitric oxide, TNF-alpha, and PGE2 in astrocyte cultures. AG did not influence the proliferation response of T cells to a pathogenic epitope of myelin basic protein. Down-regulation of nitric oxide by AG has widespread consequences for cytokine production in central nervous system inflammation and prevents EAE.

View details for IL-2 and TNF receptors as targets of regulatory T-T interactions - Isolation and characterization of cytokine receptor-reactive T cell lines in the Lewis rat T cells are considered to be of prime importance in immune regulation of both B and T cell functions. The targets of recognition in T-T cell interactions are not clear. Most recent experimental work has focused on the idiotypic regulatory interactions mediated by TCR peptides. There is experimental evidence that regulatory cells exist that do not recognize the TCR. This type of regulation is selectively induced by activated T cells. Therefore, we designed this study to examine the possible role of cytokine receptors as targets of immune regulation. We tested two peptides of IL-2R alpha-chain, 2 of IL-2R beta-chain, and one of TNFR (p60). All peptides were found to be immunogenic at inducing T cell proliferation and four induced Abs in Lewis rats. We generated T cell lines to these five peptides, and tested them both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the T cells exhibited a proliferative response when cultured with activated, irradiated stimulator cells that were augmented upon addition of the cytokine receptor peptide. The cytokine profile of the lines was characterized as well as the Vbeta gene composition. One of the lines significantly protected against active encephalomyelitis. These results point at cytokine receptors as possible targets of immune regulation and T-T cell interactions.

F., Martin, R. We have examined the functional consequences induced by interaction of DR2a-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) (87-99)-specific T cell clones (TCC) with altered peptide ligands (APL) derived from MBP peptide (87-99). The immunodominant MBP peptide (87-99) has been implicated as a candidate antigen in multiple sclerosis (MS) by several lines of evidence. In the present study, we have defined the T cell receptor (TCR) contact residues for DR2a-restricted, (87-99)-specific T helper type 1 T cells to design APL suitable to modify the functions of such T cells potentially relevant for the pathogenesis of MS. We show that neutral (L-alanine substitutions) or conservative exchanges of the primary and secondary TCR contact residues lead to various alterations of T cell function, ranging from differences in interleukin-2 receptor up-regulation to anergy induction and TCR antagonism. The potential usefulness of APL as an immunomodulating therapy for DR2+ MS patients is discussed. View details for The right stuff: Breaking through the xenotransplant barrier View details for Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease during which an autoimmune reaction is directed against oligodendrocytes. Alterations of normal myelin structure or oligodendrocyte metabolism may be primary events that influence the susceptibility to MS. Once triggered, the immune system attacks and destroys myelin and the myelin forming cell. Evidence is presented that the oligodendrocyte responds to the attack by immune cells and their secreted products through modulation of its metabolism and gene expression. Cytokines, immunoglobulins, and complement complexes may elicit a survival response in the oligodendrocytes, involving the induction of heat shock proteins and other protective molecules. The possibility of manipulating these complex glial cell functions and controlling their pathologic interactions with immune cells will illuminate how myelin damage can be contained and how the injured tissue can be repaired.

A variable region gene of the T-cell receptor, V beta 8.2, is rearranged, and its product is expressed on pathogenic T cells that induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in H-2u mice after immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP). Vaccination of these mice with naked DNA encoding V beta 8.2 protected mice from EAE. Analysis of T cells reacting to the pathogenic portion of the MBP molecule indicated that in the vaccinated mice there was a reduction in the Th1 cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gama. In parallel, there was an elevation in the production of IL-4, a Th2 cytokine associated with suppression of disease. A novel feature of DNA immunization for autoimmune disease, reversal of the autoimmune response from Th1 to Th2, may make this approach attractive for treatment of Th1-mediated diseases like multiple sclerosis, juvenile diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

We have examined the level of surface expression and functional properties of leukocyte function associated antigen-1, very late antigen-4, and CD45 isoforms on a panel of human CD4+ T-cell clones representative of TH0, TH1, and TH2 cells. There were no qualitative differences in the expression of these antigens among the three types of CD4+ T-cell clones. However, CD45RB was the only CD45 isoform that provided a costimulatory signal in a solid-phase antibody-induced cellular proliferation assay. Additionally, the antigen-induced proliferative response of T-cell clones was inhibited by soluble anti-CD45RO and anti-CD45RB antibodies. Our results suggest that CD45 isoforms differentially provide costimulatory signals to T cells. However, the ability of each CD45 isoform to provide a costimulatory signal does not differ among the TH0, TH1, or TH2 T-cell populations.

J., Driver, R., Steinman, L., Umetsu, D. T. The development of restricted cytokine profiles by subsets of CD4+ T cells is a pivotal point in the regulation of immune responses. T cells producing Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and interferon-gamma) induce cell-mediated immunity, whereas T cells producing Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) play a prominent role in the induction of humoral immunity. We examined a group of patients with multiple sclerosis, a disease caused by excess production of Th1 cytokines in myelin-reactive T cells, and control patients with noninflammatory neuroconvulsive disorders, for the presence of allergic disease, which is caused by excess production of Th2 cytokines in allergen-specific T cells. The patients with multiple sclerosis had significantly fewer allergic symptoms, a lower number of positive allergen-specific IgE test results, and lower composite allergy indexes than control subjects. These results demonstrate that the prevalence of IgE-mediated allergic disease is decreased in a group of patients with multiple sclerosis and support the hypothesis that genetic factors that promote susceptibility to Th1-mediated inflammatory disease in human beings protect against the development of Th2-mediated disease.

These specific cells recruit a population of nonspecific T cells and macrophages. The rare tissue-specific T cells in the infiltrate have the capacity to regulate both the influx and the efflux of cells from the tissue.

J., Wraith, D. C., OGARRA, A., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Following induction of experimental encephalomyelitis with a T-cell clone, L10C1, that is specific for the myelin basic protein epitope p87-99, the inflammatory infiltrate in the central nervous system contains a diverse collection of T cells with heterogeneous receptors. We show here that when clone L10C1 is tolerized in vivo with an analogue of p87-99, established paralysis is reversed, inflammatory infiltrates regress, and the heterogeneous T-cell infiltrate disappears from the brain, with only the T-cell clones that incited disease remaining in the original lesions. We found that antibody raised against interleukin-4 reversed the tolerance induced by the altered peptide ligand. Treatment with this altered peptide ligand selectively silences pathogenic T cells and actively signals for the efflux of other T cells recruited to the site of disease as a result of the production of interleukin-4 and the reduction of tumour-necrosis factor-alpha in the lesion.

A., Brocke, S., TAYLOREDWARDS, C., Ridgway, W., Dinisco, C., Steinman, L., Dalton, D., Fathman, C. G. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, is an autoimmune disorder seen in mice and rats following immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) or MBP-derived peptides. IFN-gamma, a cytokine produced by a variety of cells, is involved in many inflammatory and immune regulatory events. Contradictory results concerning exacerbations and the disease course were seen comparing injections of IFN-gamma in humans suffering from multiple sclerosis to studies using anti-IFN-gamma Abs in mice with EAE. To study the role of IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-producing cells in EAE, we crossed IFN-gamma knockout mice (H-2b) (unable to produce IFN-gamma due to the disruption of the IFN-gamma gene) with an EAE-susceptible mouse strain, B10.PL (H-2u). EAE was seen in IFN-gamma knockout mice, heterozygotic (IFN-gamma +/-) mice, as well as wild-type littermates following immunization with MBP. Histologic analyses of the central nervous system of IFN-gamma knockout mice with EAE revealed massive infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. We conclude that the presence of IFN-gamma is not crucial to the induction or the clinical course of EAE.

S., Szafer, F., HENSLEEDOWNEY, P. J., Walker, M., King, S., Godder, K., Pati, A. R., BEST, R., Steinman, L., Geier, S. S., Gee, A. P. The purpose of this study was to characterize the phenotype and clonality of the T cell population in patients who experience acute rejection (AR) following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a partially mismatched related donor (PMRD). Phenotypic analysis was performed using flow cytometry, assignment of donor/host lineage by cytogenetics or HLA-specific flow cytometry, and analysis of the T cell receptor (TCR) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We have previously reported the initial appearance in the blood of AR patients of host CD8+brightCD3low T cells that progressively express increasing amounts of CD3+ cells. We now report that this cell population can differentiate into either a cytotoxic T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+CD57-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched unrelated donors or a suppressor T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+CD57+HLA-DR-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched sibling donors. Analysis of the TCR V beta subsets from two patients revealed sorted host CD3+CD8+ cells (purity 90-95%) from the first patient to express V beta 18 almost exclusively. In a second patient with late rejection (55 days post-BMT), the CD3+CD8+ cells were predominantly restricted to V beta 1, 5.1, 7, 9, and 18. Although CD3+CD8+ T cells are known to be associated with AR, cytotoxic and suppressor lineages in AR from the same type of BMT and clonal distribution of T cells in AR have not been reported. Preliminary results suggest that V beta expression in AR of PMRD grafts is restricted and host T cell phenotype may vary. Further studies will investigate whether specific mismatches correlate with specific V beta usage and/or host T cell phenotype.

S., Steinman, L. We previously demonstrated the local production of the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the central nervous system (CNS) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for the human disease multiple sclerosis.To assess the role of IL-6 in autoimmune CNS inflammation, we administered neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 in the EAE model. Their effect was examined at the clinical and histopathological level. Levels of administered antibody and IL-6 bioactivity were followed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Systemically administered antibodies penetrated into the fluid CSF in animals in which EAE was induced. Administration of anti-IL-6 reduced the development of actively induced as well as adoptively transferred EAE and was associated with increased levels of IL-6 activity in the CSF and to a lesser extent in the serum. Anti-IL-6 was still effective when given 1 day before the onset of disease signs in adoptively transferred EAE. The disease-reducing effect of anti-IL-6 was also reflected at the pathological level by the absence of inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS.Our study indicates that IL-6 plays an important role in autoimmune CNS inflammation. However, due to the complex nature of the in vivo interactions of administered antibodies, the disease-reducing effect of the anti-IL-6 antibodies could be caused by neutralization of IL-6 activity or by enhancement of IL-6 activity via induction of higher IL-6 levels in the CNS.

Analysis of pathogen-reactive T cell clones (CD3+4+8-TCR alpha beta +), isolated from the synovial fluid of 2 HLA-B27-positive patients with Yersinia enterocolitica-triggered reactive arthritis, has provided important information about the cellular immune response to this disease-inciting pathogen. This study demonstrates that the proteins secreted by Y. enterocolitica, including a protein with tyrosine phosphatase activity (YopH), are potent immunogens stimulating CD4+ cells within the inflamed joint. The pathogen-reactive T cell clones preferentially utilized a limited set of T cell receptor variable region gene segments. A purified Yersinia superantigen triggered a proliferative response in most of the antigen-reactive T cell clones tested. These results suggest that the activity of this pathogen's superantigen influences the cellular immune response to its antigens.

T cells found in EAE lesions show similarities in the VJ and VDJ regions of their alpha and beta chains with T cells in MS lesions, and with T cells that are specific for MBPp84-103 isolated from patients with MS. If this region of MBP is critical in the pathogenesis of MS, then therapy aimed at controlling the immune response to this immunodominant region of MBP may be beneficial in treating MS. View details for REINDUCTION OF EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN MICE Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats and some strains of mice is typically a monophasic disease, and recovered animals are resistant to reinduction of disease. We demonstrate that SJL mice remain susceptible to disease after recovery, and suffer a second episode of disease when reinjected with spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant. Reinduced disease occurs earlier after injection than the initial disease (mean onset 7.3 days compared with 14.5 days), and has comparable severity and incidence. The susceptibility to reinduced disease is present for at least 20 weeks after the initial injection. If the initial episode of EAE is elicited using a synthetic peptide of proteolipid protein, then reinjection of the same peptide causes reinduced disease. PL/J mice and PL/J x SJL F1 mice are also susceptible to reinduced disease which occurs with an accelerated onset and higher incidence than the initial disease. We conclude that SJL and PL/J mice have a defect in immunoregulation which causes them to be susceptible to recurrent episodes of autoimmune disease.

One strategy was to sequence TCR gene rearrangements directly from MS lesions. The second strategy utilized T-cell clones with a selectable mutation that are found only in MS patients. The selection of T-cell clones with mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene was used to isolate T-cells reactive to myelin basic protein (MBP) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These T-cell clones are activated in vivo, and are not found in healthy individuals. The third complementarity determining regions (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains are the putative contact sites for peptide fragments of MBP bound in the groove of the HLA molecule. The TCR V gene usage and CDR3s of these MBP-reactive hprt- T-cell clones are homologous to TCRs from other T-cells relevant to MS, including T-cells causing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and T-cells found in brain lesions and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients. In vivo activated MBP-reactive T-cells in MS patients may be critical in the pathogenesis of MS.

L., Porteus, M., Steinman, L., Stevens, D. A. CSF lymphocytes from patients with Coccidioides immitis meningitis exhibited a significant antigen-specific response to in vitro stimulation with C. immitis antigens. In some patients, lesser responses to control antigens (Candida and PPD) were also detected. Antigen-specific responses by CSF lymphocytes were seen early in the course of this disease as well as several years after patients had entered remission. When compared to CSF cells, the response of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells was similar but of a much smaller magnitude and at times undetectable. Fluorescence activated cell sorting revealed an increased percentage of CD3+ (T-cells), CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD3+/HLA-DR+ (activated T-cell) cells in the CSF of C. immitis meningitis patients compared to their blood. Most of the antigen-specific proliferative response resided in the CD4+ lymphocyte subset. CSF T-cell proliferation assays may have a role in the diagnosis of C. immitis meningitis.

D., Michie, S. A., Tisch, R., Karin, N., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. To elucidate the role of cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and to determine the predominant lymphocytic homing pathway(s) involved in the selective lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets (insulitis), nonobese diabetic mice were treated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the L-selectin and integrin alpha 4 lymphocyte adhesion molecules. Treatment of neonatal mice with either anti-L-selectin or anti-integrin alpha 4 monoclonal antibodies for the first 4 weeks of life led to a significant and long-term protection against spontaneous occurrence of insulitis and diabetes. The same treatment failed to inhibit lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands (sialadenitis). This tissue-specific inhibition of inflammation may be attributed to differences between the pancreas and salivary gland in their expression of endothelial ligands for L-selectin (peripheral vascular addressin) and for integrin alpha 4 (mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1). Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 is highly expressed by vessels within the inflamed islets but was not detected in the salivary glands. In contrast, peripheral vascular addressin- and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1-expressing vessels can be found in almost every area of inflammation within the salivary glands but are seen in only 40-50% of inflamed islets. Anti-L-selectin and anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment had no demonstrable effect on anti-beta-cell autoimmunity or on the immune responses to foreign antigens. Therapeutic treatment with anti-L-selectin after the onset of insulitis from 10 to 14 weeks of age delayed the onset but failed to prevent spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, whereas anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment resulted in a significant and long-lasting suppression of the disease. These data strongly suggest that integrin alpha 4 plays a prominent role in the spontaneous development of insulitis and diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice. View details for CELL-ADHESION MOLECULES - A SELECTIVE THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR ALLEVIATION OF IDDM Yang, X. D., Michie, S. A., Tisch, R., Karin, N., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Selective homing of autoreactive lymphocytes to the pancreatic islets of Langerhans is essential for triggering the cascade of molecular and cellular interactions which culminate in the specific destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells. Based upon the sequential multistep model of lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelium, we investigated the possibility of preventing the progression of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) by selectively blocking L-selectin and alpha 4-integrin homing receptors, which function at different stages of the adhesion process. Treatment of NOD mice with mAb specific for L-selectin or alpha 4-integrin resulted in a significant inhibition of lymphocytic infiltration (insulitis). Both spontaneous development and acute transfer of IDDM were completely prevented by administration of anti-alpha 4-integrin antibody and partially inhibited by anti-L-selectin antibody. The protective effect was of long duration. Interestingly, the autoimmune T cell responses to a panel of beta cell autoantigens and the lymphocytic infiltration of salivary glands (sialadenitis) appeared unaffected by anti-L-selectin or anti-alpha 4-integrin treatment. These data suggest that prevention of lymphocyte homing to the pancreatic islets may provide a selective target for prevention/treatment of IDDM in patients. View details for REVERSAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS WITH A HYDROXAMATE INHIBITOR OF MATRIX METALLOPROTEASES Gelatinases, belonging to the matrix metalloproteases, contribute to tissue destruction in inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis. We used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model to evaluate the effect of a hydroxamate matrix metalloprotease inhibitor (GM 6001) on inflammatory demyelination. A single dose of the inhibitor, given intraperitoneally, provided sufficient levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of animals with EAE to induce at least a partial inhibition of the gelatinase activity in the cerebrospinal fluid. When administered daily either from the time of disease induction or from the onset of clinical signs, GM 6001 suppressed the development or reversed clinical EAE in a dose-dependent way, respectively. Animals returned to the same clinical course as the nontreated group after cessation of treatment. Animals treated from the onset of clinical signs had normal permeability of the blood-brain barrier, compared with the enhanced permeability in nontreated animals. These results indicate that matrix metalloprotease inhibition can reverse ongoing EAE. This effect appears to be mediated mainly through restoration of the damaged blood-brain barrier in the inflammatory phase of the disease, since, the degree of demyelination and inflammation did not differ between the treatment groups.

J., Brocke, S., Ling, N., Steinman, L. An immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), VHFFKNIVTPRTP (p87-99), is a major target of T cells in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). T cells found in EAE lesions bear the same amino acids in the third complementary determining region of the T cell receptor (TCR) as those found in MS lesions. We analyzed the trimolecular interactions between MBP p87-99, class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and TCR, and designed soluble inhibitors for therapy. F, N, I, and V at positions 90, 92, 93, and 94 interact with MHC, whereas K, T, and P at positions 91, 95, and 96 interact with TCR. The peptides, p87-99[95T > A] and p87-99[96P > A] could compete more effectively with p87-99 for binding to MHC and could antagonize the in vitro response to T cells to p87-99 more effectively than p87-99[91K > A]. However, only p87-99[91K > A] prevented and reversed EAE, indicating that the extent of MHC or TCR competition does not predict success in treating EAE. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of EAE, draining lymph node cells from rats immunized with the native peptide alone or together with each of the three TCR antagonists were challenged in vitro with p87-99. Administration of p87-99[91K > A], but not p87-99 [95T > A] or p87-99[96P > A], reduced the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha and interferon (IFN) gamma. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are two cytokines that are critical in the pathogenesis of EAE and MS.

Using a quantitative PCR, we first characterized the T cells infiltrating muscle biopsies from six DMD patients. High levels of TCR V beta 2 transcripts were observed in DMD muscle tissue. TCR V beta 2 transcripts from seven DMD patients and five controls were sequenced, and the VDJ junctional region analyzed in 166 clones. One specific amino acid motif, RVSG, was found in the third complementary determining region (CDR3) of TCR V beta 2 chains in samples from five DMD patients, but not in controls. A specific immune reaction at the site of tissue degeneration may play an important role in the pathogenesis of DMD.

A., Allegretta, M., Steinman, L., Sriram, S. Characterization of T cells responding to autoantigens is central to understanding autoimmune disease. We have used somatic mutation at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene as an index of T-cell amplification in vivo. With this strategy we previously showed that myelin basic protein-reactive T cells can be isolated only from the HPRT mutant T-cell population cultured from the peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis patients and not from normal individuals. In this study, 165 HPRT mutant and 104 wild-type clones were examined for their reactivity to myelin basic protein and overlapping peptides of myelin basic protein. Five HPRT mutant clones that recognized myelin basic protein and myelin basic protein peptides along with three clones that responded to myelin basic protein peptide alone were isolated. All but one of the eight clones recognized peptides derived from the carboxy terminus of myelin basic protein (p84-168). Sequence analysis showed heterogeneous expression of T-cell receptor V alpha and V beta genes and CDR3s. These studies showed that in vivo amplified autoimmune T cells from patients with long-standing disease use diverse T-cell receptor elements in the recognition of C-terminal myelin basic protein peptides.

We treated 21 multiple sclerosis patients with two to four doses of cM-T412, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD4 antigen found on helper/inducer T lymphocytes. The mean number (+/- standard error) of circulating CD4 lymphocytes decreased from 888 (+/- 81) cells/mm3 at baseline to 246 (+/- 18) after treatment. At 1 year after the last treatment, the CD4 count had recovered to only 335 (+/- 32). The antibody had no effect on CD8 lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, or other leukocytes. Side effects were minimal. Despite the prolonged depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, no opportunistic infections occurred. Only 1 patient had a possible allergic reaction. Most patients were clinically stable, but a few progressed. We conclude that repeated treatment with cM-T412 is effective in reducing the number of circulating CD4 lymphocytes and has no limiting side effects.

Brocke, S., VEROMAA, T., Weissman, I. L., Gijbels, K., Steinman, L. The association of infection with autoimmune diseases is enigmatic, partly because cause and effect are difficult to establish in chronic diseases. Microorganisms might initiate multiple sclerosis and trigger relapses of disease. Superantigens might be involved in autoimmunity through the (re)activation of T cells, including autoreactive cells, expressing certain T cell receptor beta chain variable regions.

J., Steinman, L., Weiner, H. L., Kuchroo, V. K. Immunization with the multideterminant autoantigen myelin basic protein (MBP) causes experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease that serves as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). MBP peptides Ac1-11 and p35-47 induce potent EAE in mice of the H-2u haplotype. T cells specific for Ac1-11 predominantly utilize one T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta gene segment, V beta 8.2. All T-cell clones and hybridomas analyzed, regardless of TCR V beta usage, utilize D beta 2 and J beta 2 elements. The NZW mouse strain (H-2z), which contributes to the spontaneous 'lupus-like' illness in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, has a genomic deletion encompassing D beta 2 and J beta 2 gene segments. The NZW strain expresses class II (I-A and I-E) genes which share identical sequences with H-2u class II. We investigated whether these strains are susceptible to EAE induced with intact MBP and known encephalitogenic MBP peptides. In vitro analysis demonstrated that NZW antigen-presenting cells (APC) can present MBP and MBP peptide Ac1-11 to an encephalitogenic T-cell clone derived from an H-2u mouse, confirming the functional identity of NZW class-II (I-A) molecules with their respective H-2u class-II gene products. In vivo results demonstrated that NZW and (NZB x NZW)F1 mice are susceptible to EAE induced with intact MBP and Ac1-11. MBP p35-47 caused EAE in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, which express alleles for both the normal (NZB) TCR beta-gene locus, and the abnormal (NZW) TCR beta-gene locus containing the J beta 2 deletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) View details for A HIPPOCAMPAL PROTEIN ASSOCIATED WITH PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC SYNDROME AND SMALL-CELL LUNG-CARCINOMA BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS Sakai, K., GOFUKU, M., Kitagawa, Y., Ogasawara, T., Hirose, G., Yamazaki, M., Koh, C.

A hippocampal 38 kd autoantigen recognized by an autoantibody from the serum of a patient with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) was isolated by screening a human hippocampal cDNA library. The 1,991-nucleotide ple21 clone was obtained and the deduced 350-residue protein encoded by the ple21 cDNA clone was found to be highly homologous to the neuron-specific RNA recognition motifs (RRMs)-containing proteins. The homologies were confined to the RRMs and the RRM connecting region. The presence of RRM in the antigenic protein may be important in the pathogenesis of SCLC-associated paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome.

We conducted an open trial of cM-T412, a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody, in 29 patients with MS. This antibody caused a prompt and long-lasting depletion of circulating CD4 (helper/inducer) lymphocytes. The mean (+/- SE) CD4 count for the group decreased from 870 (+/- 66) cells/mm3 at baseline to 76 (+/- 11) 3 hours after treatment, and then increased to 425 (+/- 38) at 1 month after treatment and 475 (+/- 39) at 6 months after treatment. Numbers of CD8 (cytotoxic/suppressor) lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes changed transiently but showed no significant long-term effects. The most common side effects were headache, nausea, myalgia, fever, and tachycardia occurring in the first few hours after treatment. No serious or unexpected infections or other significant adverse effects occurred. Kurtzke EDSS scores remained stable, and MRI scans showed less contrast enhancement 1 week after treatment. We conclude that treatment of MS patients with cM-T412 chimeric anti-CD4 antibody is well tolerated at the doses tested and produces a long-lasting, selective depletion of CD4 lymphocytes.

M., Lock, C. B., Smilek, D. E., Pearson, C. I., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. The precise mechanisms of failure of immunological tolerance to self proteins are not known. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) susceptibility alleles, the target peptides, and T cells with anti-self reactivity must be present to cause autoimmune diseases. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a murine model of a human autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. In EAE, residues 1-11 of myelin basic protein (MBP) are the dominant disease-inducing determinants in PL/J and (PL/J x SJL/J)F1 mice. Here we report that a six-residue peptide (five of them native) of MBP can induce EAE. Using peptide analogues of the MBP-(1-11) peptide, we demonstrate that only four native MBP residues are required to stimulate MBP-specific T cells. Therefore, this study demonstrates lower minimum structural requirements for effective antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules. Many viral and bacterial proteins share short runs of amino acid similarity with host self proteins, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry. Since a six-residue peptide can sensitize MBP-specific T cells to cause EAE, these results define a minimum sequence identity for molecular mimicry in autoimmunity.

D., Karin, N., Tisch, R., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial venules in the pancreatic islets is thought to be one of the initial steps in the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It has been suggested that leukocyte adhesion to endothelium is a sequential multistep process involving various different homing receptors. We report here that blocking different homing receptors--namely, L-selectin and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4)--which function during different stages of the adhesion process, by specific monoclonal antibodies inhibits insulitis and prevents diabetes in mice. Moreover, leukocyte attachment to the inflamed vessels within pancreatic sections could be inhibited by anti-L-selectin and anti-VLA-4 antibodies. Interestingly, anti-L-selectin or anti-VLA-4 antibody did not appear to influence the autoimmune response to a panel of pancreatic beta-cell autoantigens. These data suggest that L-selectin and VLA-4 receptors are involved in mediating leukocyte homing to the islets and that intervention of these two adhesion pathways may provide a novel approach for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

CD4 and CD8 were not quantifiable at baseline, became detectable at 5 days after immunization, and increased steadily to a peak during clinical disease. I-A increased after CD4 and CD8, but before onset of disease. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 did not increase until after onset of clinical disease. CD4, CD8, and I-A remained elevated long after recovery from disease. These results suggest that infiltration of CD4 and CD8 cells into the spinal cord and subsequent upregulation of I-A mRNA play an important role in the development of EAE, but reversal of these processes is not necessary for recovery. Upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA does not appear to be important for development of disease.

G., Steinman, L. The role of infection in the pathogenesis of clinical relapses that occur in most autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, remains to be established. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) serves as a model for multiple sclerosis, with episodes of relapsing paralysis. In certain strains of mice, T-lymphocytes expressing the V beta 8 T-cell receptor (TCR) engage the amino-terminal epitope Ac1-11 of myelin basic protein, leading to EAE. The bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activates V beta 8-expressing T cells. Here we show that after immunization with Ac1-11, or after transfer of encephalitogenic T-cell lines or clones reactive to Ac1-11, SEB induces exacerbation or relapses of paralytic disease in mice that are in clinical remission following an initial episode of paralysis, and triggers paralysis in mice with subclinical disease. Tumour necrosis factor has a critical role in the mechanism underlying SEB-induced exacerbation of disease, because anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody given in vivo delays the onset of paralysis triggered by SEB. On reactivation of autoaggressive cells through their T-cell receptor, superantigens may induce clinical relapses of autoimmune disease.

In this study we analyzed the usage frequencies of the TCR V-gene segments by alpha beta+ T cells present in synovial fluid of 17 patients with chronic arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis. The results of this study, obtained from semiquantitative PCR analyses, showed that in all patients most of the TCR V alpha- and V beta-gene segments could be detected both in fresh PBMCs and in fresh SFMCs. The relative frequencies of use of these V-region genes were variable between the different patients. Although there was some skewing of increased usage frequencies of particular TCR V alpha and V beta genes among SFMC-derived TCRs when compared with PBMCs, we could not correlate such increased TCR V-gene usage with the inflammation in the joints as a disease-specific marker. View details for GAMMA-DELTA T-CELL RECEPTOR REPERTOIRE IN BRAIN-LESIONS OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS Hvas, J., Oksenberg, J. R., Fernando, R., Steinman, L., Bernard, C. C. The identification of activated T cells in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that these cells are critical in the pathogenesis of this disease. Recently we have used the PCR method to analyse rearrangements of V alpha and V beta genes of the T cell receptor (TCR) in samples of MS and control brains. The results of these studies showed that TCR V gene usage in MS brains may be restricted and in particular that V beta genes may be preferentially rearranged in certain HLA haplotypes associated with susceptibility to MS. In view of the recent evidence that T lymphocytes bearing the gamma delta chains may have autoreactive potential, we have assessed whether or not such TCR-bearing lymphocytes were also present in chronic MS lesions. TCR V gamma and V delta were analysed by the PCR method using a panel of V gamma and V delta primers paired with C gamma or C delta primers in 12 MS brains, as well as in brain samples of ten normal post-mortem cases and three neurological controls. TCR V gamma-C gamma and V delta-C delta rearrangements were confirmed using Southern blotting and hybridisation of the PCR products with specific C gamma and C delta probes. Only one to four rearranged TCR V gamma and V delta transcripts were detected in each of the 23 brain samples obtained from 12 MS patients, with the majority of gamma delta T cells expressing the V gamma 2 and V delta 2 chains. In marked contrast, V gamma and V delta transcripts could only be found in one of the ten non-neurological control brains analysed. To assess the clonality of V gamma 2 and V delta 2 T cell receptor chains in the brain samples of MS patients, we have sequenced the junctional regions of the TCR V gamma-N-J gamma-C gamma and V delta-N-D delta-N-J delta-C delta segments amplified from brain tissues, CSF and spleens of two MS patients and from the spleen of two control subjects. The sequence analysis obtained so far shows no compelling evidence of an MS specific expansion of one or more clones expressing particular types of gamma delta T cell receptors. In contrast, a clonal expansion of a different population of TCR gamma delta-bearing T cells was found in the spleen of both an MS patient and one of the control individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for CLONAL ANALYSIS OF INVIVO ACTIVATED CD8+ CYTOTOXIC T-LYMPHOCYTES FROM A MELANOMA PATIENT RESPONSIVE TO ACTIVE SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY KANMITCHELL, J., Huang, X. Q., Steinman, L., Oksenberg, J. R., Harel, W., Parker, J. W., Goedegebuure, P. S., Darrow, T. L., Mitchell, M. S. To study in vivo activated cytolytic T cells, CD8+ T cells clones were isolated from a melanoma patient (HLA A2, A11) treated with active specific immunotherapy for 5 years. CD8+ T lymphocytes, purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, were cloned directly from the peripheral blood without antigen-presenting cells in the presence of irradiated autologous melanoma cells and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4. These conditions were inhibitory to de novo in vitro immunization. Of the 28 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones, 21 lysed the autologous melanoma cell line (M7) but not the autologous lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL-7) nor the two melanoma cell line, M1 (HLA A28) and M2 (HLA A28, A31), used to immunize the patient. The remaining 7 clones were also melanoma-specific, although their reactivities were broader, lysing several melanoma cell lines but not HLA-matched lymphoblastoid cells. Eight clones from the first group, ostensibly self-MHC-restricted, were expanded for further analysis. All expressed cluster determinants characteristic of mature, activated T cells, but not those of thymocytes, naive T cells, B cells or natural killer (NK) cells. They also expressed CD13, a myeloid marker. Of the 8 clones, 3 expressed both CD4 and CD8, but dual expression was not correlated with specificity of lysis. Two CD8+ and 2 CD4+ CD8+ clones were specific for the autologous melanoma cells, the other 4 were also reactive against other HLA-A2-positive melanomas. Cytotoxicity for both singly and doubly positive clones was restricted by HLA class I but not class II antigens. Analysis of the RNA expression of the T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta gene segments revealed heterogeneous usage by the A2-restricted clones and, perhaps, also by the broadly melanoma-specific clones. Apparent TCR-restricted usage was noted for the self-MHC-restricted clones; 2 of the 4 expressed the V alpha 17/V beta 7 dimer. Since the T cell clones were derived from separate precursors of circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), the V alpha 17/V beta 7 TCR was well represented in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of this patient. In summary, we show that melanoma cells presented their own antigens to stimulate the proliferation of melanoma-reactive CD8+ CTL. CTL with a range of melanoma specificities and different TCR alpha beta dimers were encountered in this patient, perhaps as a result of hyperimmunization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for T-CELL RECEPTOR GENE USAGE OF ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR-SPECIFIC T-HELPER CELLS Melms, A., Oksenberg, J.

W., Pararajasegaram, G., Sun, Y. M., Steinman, L. Improved molecular methods allow identification of the specific autoaggressive T cells involved in autoimmune inflammations. In this study of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein-induced uveitis, TCR V beta usage was studied using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of transcripts derived directly from ocular tissues and from T cell lines obtained from the spleen. Specific V beta 5' primers from the major murine TCR V beta families were coupled with a common 3' primer from the V beta C region. Amplification of rearranged TCR V beta-D beta-J beta-C beta sequences was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. In ocular tissue from sensitized mice, TCR V beta expression was limited mainly to one to three V beta families, with predominant expression of V beta 2, V beta 12, and V beta 15. In most animals there was similar, albeit limited, TCR gene usage in both the recognition of autoantigen in uveitogenic T cell lines and at the site of inflammation in the eye. Identification of a limited TCR V beta repertoire in Ag-reactive T cell lines correlated with TCR usage at the target site of autoimmune expression. The gene products of the restricted TCR V beta rearrangements found in lesions and in the cell lines may serve as the target for selective immunotherapy. View details for SELECTIVE AND NONSELECTIVE STAGES IN HOMING OF T-LYMPHOCYTES TO THE CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM DURING EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS Karin, N., Szafer, F., Mitchell, D., Gold, D. P., Steinman, L. The diversity of Ag-specific receptors on T cells homing to an inflammatory infiltrate in the central nervous system has been analyzed. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, was induced in Lewis rats with a CD4+, CD8- T cell line specific for peptide 68-86 of myelin basic protein. Within the line a wide array of TCR V beta genes was transcribed including the V beta 8, V beta 10, V beta 15, V beta 16, and V beta 19 families. Accumulation of T cells at the site of inflammation was determined by using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of rearranged TCR V beta transcripts derived from brain. By 8 to 10 h after i.p. infusion of the pathogenic T cell line, TCR V beta transcripts, including mainly V beta families that were predominantly rearranged by the line, could be identified in brains. Restricted TCR V gene transcripts with predominance of the V beta 8 family were identified in brain 48 h after injection, before onset of disease. Paralysis was apparent by 4 to 5 days after injection. At this time diverse V beta gene transcripts were detected in brain, reaching a maximum by day 9, when paralyzed rats have recovered. By day 14 a second stage of limited heterogeneity in the T cell infiltrate could be identified with predominant expression of V beta 8, V beta 9, V beta 10, and V beta 19. Interestingly, three out of these four V beta families were predominantly expressed within the encephalitogenic line. Thus, T cell migration to brain in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is characterized by a rapid penetration of T cells followed by a selective trapping of T cells before the clinical manifestations of disease. When clinical disease was present the T cell infiltrate was diverse, whereas in the post-acute phase of disease the T cells in the central nervous system had limited heterogeneity with selective accumulation of T cells transcribing the same V regions that were detected in the line that incited disease.

A., Hodgkinson, S., Steinman, L. The repertoire of TCR V beta genes transcribed and expressed within the central nervous system was determined in mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Disease was induced in (PL/J x SJL/)F1 mice by immunizing with myelin basic protein-acetylated peptide 1-11, and mice were sacrificed at intervals from day 3 postimmunization to 3 wk after recovery from disease. Transcription of V beta genes was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on RNA extracted from spinal cord, and expression of the V beta gene products was detected by immunohistochemistry with mAb specific for various V beta proteins. Multiple V beta genes were found to be transcribed and expressed in the central nervous system starting 7 days after immunization, and continuing up to 3 wk after clinical recovery. Preferential utilization of a single TCR V beta gene was not detected in the central nervous system at any time in the course of disease.

C., ALLSUP, A., SODERBERG, C., Anzola, J., Freitas, V., Turck, C., Steinman, L., Peltz, G. Forty-three CD3+4+8- TCR alpha beta+ Borrelia burgdorferi-reactive T cell clones isolated from the peripheral blood of a single patient with clinically active chronic Lyme arthritis were characterized. The spirochetal Ag recognized by 16 of these T cell clones was determined by reactivity with a panel of recombinant spirochetal Ag, which included the OspA, OspB, flagellin, Hsp60 and Hsp70 proteins. All three T cell clones reactive with heat shock proteins recognized a non-cross-reactive epitope unique to the spirochetal Ag. Analysis of the TCR V regions revealed preferential usage of V beta 5.1; 5 of 15 T cell clones that recognized an unidentified spirochetal Ag utilized this V beta gene segment. Most of the T cell clones recognized a given spirochetal Ag exclusively within the context of one HLA class II allele. However, two T cell clones, which recognized an unidentified Ag in the spirochetal lysate within the context of different HLA class II alleles, were both TCR V beta 5.1+, although each displayed a distinct alpha-chain. Moreover, in vitro incubation of this patient's PBMC with B. burgdorferi Ag resulted in a specific increase in the percentage of T cells expressing TCR V beta 5.1. These results indicate that B. burgdorferi has a V beta-selective factor influencing the cellular immune response in a patient with clinically active Lyme disease.

G., Steinman, L., Brocke, S. Superantigens have the ability to stimulate a subset of T cells based upon their expressed TCR beta-chain. It has been demonstrated that the administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in mice leads to unresponsiveness in V beta 8+ T cells in vivo which are the same T cells that could be stimulated in vitro by this enterotoxin. We present here data on the effect of SEB administration in DBA/2 and (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice on their T cell response to two different T cell determinants, the responses against which are dominated by the use of V beta 8+ T cells. Treatment of mice with SEB not only diminished their primary T cell proliferative response to these determinants, but also was able to effectively reduce the memory T cell response. SEB treatment, however, showed only a modest effect in preventing Ac 1-11-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in H-2u mice.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in which a restricted cellular immune response has been observed. In order to establish whether such T cell responses are likely to be antigen-specific particularly with regard to myelin basic protein (MBP), we analysed T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements directly from MS brain plaques, using the polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed messenger RNA, and compared these with TCR of previously described MBP-specific T cell clones from MS and the rat model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Rearranged V beta 5.2 genes were detected in the brains of all patients who were HLA DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401. The V beta 5.2-D beta-J beta sequences in these MS brain plaques revealed five motifs. One of the common motifs was identical to that described for the VDJ region of a V beta 5.2 T-cell clone. This clone was from an MS patient who was HLA DRB1*1501, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401, and it was cytotoxic towards targets containing the MBP peptide 89-106 (ref. 1). The deduced amino-acid sequence of this VDJ rearrangement, Leu-Arg-Gly, has also been described in rat T cells cloned from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis lesions, which are specific for MBP peptide 87-99 (ref. 2). VDJ sequences with specificity for this MBP epitope constitute a large fraction (40%) of the TCR V beta 5.2 N(D)N rearrangements in MS lesions. The capacity of rat T cells with these VDJ sequences to cause experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and the prevalence of such sequences in demyelinated human lesions indicate that T cells with this rearranged TCR may be critical in MS.

Each episode improved after treatment with steroids. Laboratory studies revealed no evidence of multiple sclerosis or a structural spinal lesion. He had antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies and the HLA-A1, B8, DR3 haplotype known to be associated with certain autoimmune diseases. We propose an autoimmune cause for the recurrent episodes of myelitis. View details for RECURRENT TRANSVERSE MYELITIS, MYASTHENIA-GRAVIS, AND AUTOANTIBODIES The minimum structural requirements for peptide interactions with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and with T cell receptors (TCRs) were examined. In this report we show that substituting alanines at all but five amino acids in the myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide Ac1-11 does not alter its ability to bind A alpha uA beta u (MHC class II molecules), to stimulate specific T cells and, surprisingly, to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in (PL/J x SJL/J)F1 mice. Most other amino acid side chains in the Ac1-11 peptide are essentially irrelevant for T cell stimulation and for disease induction. Further analysis revealed that binding to A alpha uA beta u occurred with a peptide that consists mainly of alanines and only three of the original residues of Ac1-11. Moreover, when used as a coimmunogen with MBP Ac1-11, this peptide inhibited EAE. The finding that a specific in vivo response can be generated by a peptide containing only five native residues provides evidence that disease-inducing TCRs recognize only a very short sequence of the MHC-bound peptide.

O. Expression of the lymphokine genes in human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma, one neuroblastoma cell line and 4 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). mRNA transcripts of neither IL-1 nor IL-3, the biological activities of which were observed in rat primary cultured astrocytes, could be detected within these cell lines. Two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U138 and U373, expressed IL-6 genes. IL-8 gene was detected within U87, U138, U251, U373 glioma cells. After stimulation with IL-1 beta, all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell line expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma specimens. The result shows that three out of four glioma specimens expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-6 or IL-8 may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the central nervous system. [An analysis of lymphokine gene expression within astrocytoma]. The profile of lymphokines secreted by 14 T cell clones and 24 T cell lines reactive with Yersinia Ag isolated from the synovial fluid cells of two HLA-B27+ patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis was characterized. In response to Ag-specific or -nonspecific stimulation, all of the Yersinia-reactive T cell clones and lines had a pattern of lymphokine secretion resembling that of murine (Th1) cells. A total of 50% of T cell lines and clones randomly isolated from a reactive arthritis patient, without prior in vitro stimulation with Yersinia Ag, also exhibited a Th1-like profile of cytokine secretion upon nonspecific activation. This indicates that the selective expansion of this subset of T cells had already occurred in vivo. The possibility that the predominance of Th1-like T cells was an artefact generated by the T cell cloning procedure was excluded; 50% of the randomly isolated T cell clones and lines produced IL-4, IL-5, or both cytokines upon nonspecific activation. These results indicate that Yersinia Ag selectively activate a Th1-like subset of T cells in patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis. Accumulation of such cells in the synovial tissue of patients with reactive arthritis may play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory neurologic disease initiated by myelin basic protein-reactive CD4+ T cells, which are restricted by a particular MHC class II molecule. Recent studies have utilized inhibitor peptides that bind to restricting MHC class II molecules in order to inhibit EAE, presumably by means of competing with encephalitogenic epitopes. However, these studies leave open the possibility of alternative explanations, such as Ag-specific nonresponsiveness and immunodominance. In order to demonstrate that competition for MHC binding alone can inhibit EAE, the inhibitor peptide should ideally be structurally unrelated and nonimmunogenic yet physically associate with the MHC class II molecule. In this study, we show that the OVA-323-339 peptide, which is unrelated to the disease-inducing peptide, binds to A alpha uA beta u. However, although OVA-323-339 is extremely immunogenic in A alpha dA beta d-expressing BALB/c mice, it is nonimmunogenic in (PL/J x SJL)F1 and PL/J mice expressing A alpha uA beta u. When administered as a coimmunogen with Ac1-11, OVA-323-339 inhibited induction of EAE in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice. Myelin basic protein-89-101, which does not bind A alpha uA beta u, had no effect on the disease process. This study provides evidence that MHC class II binding alone can modulate the induction of EAE. The use of a nonimmunogenic non-self peptide to modulate an autoimmune disease minimizes the potential complications of immunodominance or alternative regulatory mechanisms associated with immunogenic peptide therapies and further confirms the MHC-blocking model of immunosuppression.

Applications of PCR have revolutionized the field of immunogenetics particularly in studies of human leukocyte antigen class II polymorphism and more recently in the analysis of T cell receptor usage. The diversity of the variable region of the T cell receptor, however, has made it difficult to amplify the complete repertoire of T cell receptor transcripts. We have chosen to address this problem through the design of oligonucleotide primers specific for each of the known V alpha- and V beta-region T cell receptor families in order to characterize the T cell receptor repertoire. Using nonradioactive probes labeled with horse radish peroxidase, the system presented here allows for the rapid elucidation of the T cell receptor repertoire expressed in cells or tissue samples, such as those derived from autoimmune lesions. The identification of the T cell receptor repertoire involved in a pathogenic process can have therapeutic implications given the success of reversing experimental autoimmune disorders by directing specific forms of immunotherapy against V region gene products.

Expression of T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta genes in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within human malignant brain tumor was examined. Primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families were used to analyze TCRV-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements in TILs in 8 human malignant glioma specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we detected limited TCR variable region, V alpha gene expression in malignant glial tumors and also V alpha 7 and V alpha 12 TCR genes were preferentially expressed. Usage of TCR V beta gene was not as restricted as in TCR V alpha. These TILs expressing a limited repertoire of TCRs might be isolated, expanded, and used therapeutically for treatment of malignant brain tumors.

Gene delivery by transplantation of normal myoblasts has been proposed as a treatment of the primary defect, lack of the muscle protein dystrophin, that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal human muscle degenerative disorder. To test this possibility, we transplanted normal myoblasts from a father or an unaffected sibling into the muscle of eight boys with DMD, and assessed their production of dystrophin. Three patients with deletions in the dystrophin gene expressed normal dystrophin transcripts in muscle biopsy specimens taken from the transplant site one month after myoblast injection. Using the polymerase chain reaction we established that the dystrophin in these biopsies derived from donor myoblast DNA. These results show that transplanted myoblasts persist and produce dystrophin in muscle fibres of DMD patients.

Applications of the polymerase chain reaction have revolutionized the field of immunogenetics, particularly in studies of human leukocyte antigen class II polymorphism, and more recently in the analysis of T-cell receptor usage. However, the enormous diversity and variability of the T-cell receptor complex have made the amplification of the complete repertoire difficult. Several methods have been devised to address this problem. Each system is described with recent examples of its use and an assessment of its advantages and disadvantages. The use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction in T-cell receptor analysis is also discussed. The elucidation of the T-cell repertoire involved in a pathogenic process can have therapeutic implications, given the success of reversing experimental autoimmune disorders by directing specific forms of immunotherapy against V region gene products. View details for THE POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION FOR DETECTION OF T-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION The interaction of the immunodominant pertussis toxin peptide containing residues 30-42 (p30-42) with soluble DR1 molecules and the T-cell receptor (TCR) of 12 DR1-restricted human T-cell clones has been analyzed. Peptide analogues of p30-42 containing single alanine substitutions were used in DR1-binding and T-cell proliferation assays to identify the major histocompatibility complex and TCR contact residues. Each T-cell clone was found to recognize p30-42 with a different fine specificity. However, a common core comprising amino acids 33-39 was found to be important for stimulation of all T-cell clones. Within this core two residues, Leu33 and Leu36, interact with the DR1 molecule, whereas Asp34, His35, Thr37, and Arg39 are important for TCR recognition in most of the clones. Computer modeling of the structure of p30-42 showed that an alpha-helical conformation is compatible with the experimental data. The analysis of TCR rearrangement revealed that the peptide was recognized by T-cell clones expressing different variable region alpha (V alpha) and variable region beta (V beta) chains, although a preferential use of V alpha 8-V beta 13 and V alpha 11-V beta 18 combinations was found in clones from the same donor. Understanding the details of the interaction of antigenic peptides with the major histocompatibility complex and TCR molecules should provide the theoretical basis to design T-cell epitopes and obtain more immunogenic vaccines.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory condition of the central nervous system with similarities to multiple sclerosis. In both diseases, circulating leukocytes penetrate the blood-brain barrier and damage myelin, resulting in impaired nerve conduction and paralysis. We sought to identify the adhesion receptors that mediate the attachment of circulating leukocytes to inflamed brain endothelium in EAE, because this interaction is the first step in leukocyte entry into the central nervous system. Using an in vitro adhesion assay on tissue sections, we found that lymphocytes and monocytes bound selectively to inflamed EAE brain vessels. Binding was inhibited by antibodies against the integrin molecule alpha 4 beta 1, but not by antibodies against numerous other adhesion receptors. When tested in vivo, anti-alpha 4 integrin effectively prevented the accumulation of leukocytes in the central nervous system and the development of EAE. Thus, therapies designed to interfere with alpha 4 beta 1 integrin may be useful in treating inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis.

C., SANCHEZMADRID, F., Steinman, L., Karin, N. Anti-I-A antibodies, administered in vivo at the time of S-antigen injection, suppress development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in Lewis rats. While the effects of anti-I-A are profound, the exact mechanism for this suppression is unknown. We attempted adoptive transfer of this form of suppression by injecting lymphocytes from anti-I-A-treated animals into syngeneic recipients which were later injected with S-antigen. Histologically, globes of 75% of the anti-I-A-treated animals showed no inflammation while 25% of these animals developed mild uveitis. In the group of animals which were injected with S-antigen and also received spleen cells from anti-I-A-treated rats, only 1 showed mild uveitis while the remaining 7 had no inflammation. The animals undergoing adoptive transfer of spleen cells and which were primed with an irrelevant antigen, readily developed uveitis. Suppression of S-antigen-induced EAU was abrogated by pretreatment of donor animals with cyclophosphamide. In vitro studies revealed that spleen cells of S-antigen-primed, anti-I-A-treated donors specifically suppressed lymphocyte responses to S-antigen. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that generation of antigen-specific suppressor cells play a role in the anti-I-A immunotherapy of EAU.

View details for ASSOCIATION OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS WITH TCR GENES With the aim of investigating the distribution of T cells expressing different T-cell receptors (TCR) in the inflamed synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients, we have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify TCR V alpha and V beta transcripts from synovial biopsies obtained by arthroscopy from patients with arthritis of variable duration. From each of nine patients a single biopsy was taken. Southern hybridization analysis of amplified products revealed extensive heterogeneity of TCR V beta in most patients. On the other hand, restriction in V alpha gene expression was seen in several patients. A highly restricted V alpha repertoire was observed in all cases with arthritis of short duration. In addition, two of three samples of short duration yielded a more limited number of V beta transcripts than the others. No conformity was, however, seen in usage of individual V alpha and V beta transcripts among the investigated patients. The present data thus demonstrate variability in synovial TCR expression between rheumatoid arthritis patients, but they also indicate a development towards greater diversity with increasing disease duration, implicating the necessity for careful choice of cases, preferentially selecting for early stages of disease, when further analysing rheumatoid synovial T cells for TCR usage as well as for antigen specificity.

Expression of granulocyte (G) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factor (CSF) genes in human cells of astroglial lineage was studied. Primers for CSFs were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and 8 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM-CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell lines, and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138 MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1 beta + tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The results show that some of the tumor and its surrounding reactive lesions express G- and GM-CSF genes but normal brains do not. The concentration of G- and GM-CSF in supernatants of cultured cells was assessed at the protein level by ELISA. A low level of GM-CSF activity was constitutively present in all astrocytomas. G-CSF was detected in unstimulated U87MG and U138MG and other cell lines could synthesize G-CSF after the stimulation of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha at the level of mRNA. Furthermore, the concentration of CSFs increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta and/or TNF-alpha in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived CSFs may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the brain.

This study has led to novel immunotherapeutic approaches, many of which are based on the administration of synthetic peptides. Since short peptides are understood to be the minimal antigenic units bound by MHC molecules for recognition by T cells, they are attractive experimental tools for finely modulating specific immune responses. It is clear that a large number of defined peptides can dramatically influence the course of EAE. Table IV lists a number of potential mechanisms which may mediate disease prevention. Increasing evidence supports the idea that prevention of autoimmune disease can result from MHC-blockade by peptides which competitively bind to class II molecules. However, for some peptides such as the perplexing partial agonist Ac1-11[4A], the mechanism by which these precisely defined units act is not yet fully understood. Numerous hurdles hinder immediate clinical application of peptide-based immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the knowledge gained by probing experimental autoimmunity with defined peptides promises to inspire original and practical approaches to treating human autoimmune disease. EAE: a model for immune intervention with synthetic peptides. Smilek, D. E., Gautam, A. M., Pearson, C., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Expression of lymphokine genes in the human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and fresh brain specimens by PCR. mRNA transcripts for IL-8 were detected in all neuroglial cells. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The result shows that tumor and cells of the surrounding reactive lesion express IL-8 genes, but it is not expressed in normal brains. Next, the concentration of IL-8 in supernatants of cultured cells was measured quantitatively by a solid phase ELISA assay. IL-8 activity was produced constitutively in all astrocytomas and increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF alpha, in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-8 may take part in neutrophil-mediated inflammation which accompanies infection, degeneration and malignancy in the brain.

View details for Prevention of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by antibodies against a4b1 integrin Steinman L, Yednock T, Cannon C, Fritz L, Sanchez-Madrid F, Karin N Expression of the Cytokine genes in human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 5 different human cytokine, TNF-alpha, -beta, IFN-gamma, G-CSF and GM-CSF, were used to analyze messenger RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma, one neuroblastoma cell lines and fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U138, U251, U373 MG and IMR32 neuroblastoma cells expressed TNF-alpha genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta (1000 U/ml) all these cell lines expressed TNF-alpha genes. TNF-beta genes could not be detected in these cell lines even in the presence of any cytokine stimuli. We were able to detect expression of IFN-gamma genes within 2 astrocytoma cell lines (U87MG and A172), which interestingly did not show TNF-alpha activity. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM -CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition, we also examined gene expression of these cytokines within 4 human malignant astrocytoma specimens, 2 peritumoral brain and 2 autopsied normal brains. The results show that tumor and surrounding lesions express TNF-alpha (4 of 6), TNF-beta (1/6), IFN-gamma (4/6), G-CSF (3/6) and GM-CSF (5/6) but not normal brains. One tumor specimen also expresses TNF-beta as well as TNF-alpha genes (case 2). From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived cytokines may participate in local immune reactions accompanying glioma in the brain. PROSPECTS FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY DIRECTED TO THE T-CELL RECEPTOR IN HUMAN AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an experimental demyelinating disease of rodents. In (PL/J x SJL) F1 mice, it is induced by immunization with the myelin basic protein peptide Ac1-11. Ac1-11 [4A], a myelin basic protein peptide analog with a single amino acid substitution, (i) binds to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and stimulates encephalitogenic T cells in vitro better than Ac1-11, (ii) is nonimmunogenic and nonencephalitogenic in vivo in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice, (iii) prevents EAE when administered before or at the time of immunization with Ac1-11, and (iv) prevents EAE when administered later, near the time of disease onset. Initial studies suggest that Ac1-11 [4A] does not prevent EAE by competitive inhibition or by activation of regulatory cells. Thus, substitution of a single amino acid in a myelin basic protein peptide confers the capacity to prevent rather than induce EAE, even after peptide-specific encephalitogenic T cells have been activated.

Expression of T-cell-receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta genes in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of 29 patients, 15 melanomas and 14 malignant glial tumors (glioma and medulloblastoma), was investigated. The identification and propagation of T cells with anti-tumor reactivity is crucial to the understanding of the human immune response to tumors, which may possibly be useful in the successful implementation of adoptive immunotherapy against cancer. Despite clinical evidence that a more favorable prognosis is associated with the degree of lymphocyte infiltration within a tumor, the actual role of TIL remains uncertain. In order to address this question, we examined the diversity of the RNA transcripts of TCR genes in TILs within 29 specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) method and primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families to analyze TCR V-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements, we detected a limited expression of TCR variable-region V alpha genes of TILs. TCR V beta gene rearrangements were more diverse than those for V alpha. In addition to restricted usage of TCR V alpha genes, preferential expression of V alpha 7 genes was found in 20 out of 29 cases (69%). Predominant usage of V alpha 7 genes was more remarkable in melanoma TILs (14/15) than in glial tumor TILs (6/14). These findings were also confirmed by Southern blot analysis with oligonucleotide probes for the constant (C) region of TCR alpha and beta chains. We suspect that some specific T-cell populations may be directed to antigenic determinants in melanoma cells.

E., Wraith, D. C., Hodgkinson, S., Dwivedy, S., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Expression of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within primary and metastatic melanoma specimens was studied. In order to analyze TCR gene transcription in TILs within these tissues, we analyzed reverse transcribed complementary DNA from mRNA directly from tissues using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified products were confirmed by dot or Southern blot hybridization with C alpha or C beta oligoprobes. First, we investigated the diversity of TCR V alpha and V beta gene usage in human malignant melanoma patients with multiple metastasis. We found in one patient, bearing multiple skin lesions, that the patterns of TCR V alpha and V beta repertoires in different sites of the skin (leg and chest wall) were almost the same. However, in another patient with skin and brain melanomas, different TCR repertoires were presented. Next, we examined the usage of murine TCR V beta genes in TILs within the primary and metastatic sites (liver, lung, and brain) of C57BL/6 mice bearing B16-F10 murine melanoma. The population of TILs in each primary and metastatic site expressed from one to four TCR V beta genes. In each metastatic site, the profile of TCR V beta gene expression was different. A different TCR V beta usage in TILs distributed within metastases of various organs may reflect differences in tumor antigenicity at these sites or may be due to differential homing patterns to these tumors.

Many lessons that have been learned in an animal model of central nervous system demyelinating disease, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, also apply to multiple sclerosis and certain successful approaches for the treatment of this disease are now being attempted in humans. T-CELL RECEPTOR V-BETA GENE-EXPRESSION DIFFERS IN TUMOR-INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES WITHIN PRIMARY AND METASTATIC MELANOMA NITTA, T., Bell, R., Okumura, K., Sato, K., Steinman, L. Some investigators have proposed myoblast transfer as a potential therapy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Little is known about the immunobiology of myoblast transplantation. Transplantation rejection is mediated to a large extent by CD8+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class I HLA genes, and by CD4+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class II HLA genes. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is a potent inducer of HLA class II molecules as well as beta 2-microglobulin, which is co-expressed with HLA class I. IFN-gamma may be a critical cytokine involved in graft rejection. We purified human myoblasts by flow cytometry and incubated them in vitro for varying time periods with recombinant human IFN-gamma. The inducibility of HLA-DR and -DP molecules raises a note of caution concerning possible rejection phenomenon which might occur following myoblast transplantation.

To study antitumor immunity in patients with choroidal melanoma, T cells were generated from the peripheral blood of choroidal melanoma patients by mixed lymphocyte/tumor cell culture (MLTC). Because autologous tumors are generally unavailable, an allogeneic choroidal melanoma cell line, OCM-1, was used as the specific stimulus. Lymphocyte cultures from 27 patients were characterized by cell-surface phenotypes, patterns of reactivity towards cells of the melanocytic origin and T-cell-receptor gene usage. Antimelanoma reactivity was found in cell-sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. To analyze this reactivity, sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ cells from a MLTC were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of exogenous interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 as well as irradiated OCM-1. Under these conditions, CD4+ T cells did not proliferate, perhaps because of the absence of antigen-presenting cells. However, CD8+ grew vigorously and 29 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones were isolated. On the basis of their pattern of lysis of OCM-1, a skin melanoma cell line M-7 and its autologous lymphoblastoid cell line LCL-7, the clones were categorized into three groups. Group 1, representing 52% of the clones, lysed all three target cells, and are alloreactive. However, since OCM-1 and M-7 did not share class I antigens, these clones recognized cross-reactive epitope(s) of the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) molecule. Group 2, constituting 28% of the clones, lysed both the ocular and skin melanoma cell lines but not LCL-7, and were apparently melanoma-specific. Unlike classical HLA-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes, these T cells might mediate the lysis of melanoma cells via other ligands or a more degenerate type of HLA restriction. For the latter, the HLA-A2 and -A28 alleles would have to act interchangeably as the restriction element for shared melanoma-associated antigen(s). Group 3, representing only 10% of the T cell clones, was cytotoxic only to OCM-1, but not to M-7 or LCL-7. These clones may recognize antigens unique to ocular melanoma cells. Our data suggest that choroidal melanoma patients can recognize melanoma-associated antigens common to both ocular and cutaneous melanoma cells, and presumbly their autologous tumor. Thus, choroidal melanoma, like its skin counterpart, may be responsive to immunotherapeutic regimens such as active specific or adoptive cellular immunotherapy. View details for MODULATION OF MHC CLASS-II ANTIGEN EXPRESSION IN HUMAN MYOBLASTS AFTER TREATMENT WITH IFN-GAMMA Mantegazza, R., Hughes, S. M., Mitchell, D., Travis, M., Blau, H. M., Steinman, L. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T cell mediated model of demyelinating disease that develops as a result of an autoimmune response to the myelin structural antigen, myelin basic protein (MBP). Much information has accumulated on the nature of trimolecular interactions which lead to the activation of self-reactive T lymphocytes in this disorder. Many parallels exist in the etiopathogenesis of EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS). Based upon these similarities selective immunotherapy that targets either class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex or T cell receptor variable region genes will be described for EAE with consideration given to application of these principles in MS. LYMPHOCYTES CYTOTOXIC TO UVEAL AND SKIN MELANOMA-CELLS FROM PERIPHERAL-BLOOD OF OCULAR MELANOMA PATIENTS KANMITCHELL, J., LIGGETT, P. E., Harel, W., Steinman, L., NITTA, T., Oksenberg, J. R., Posner, M. R., Mitchell, M. S. Oligonucleotide probes were used to investigate the role of DQ beta molecules in susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Although shared amino acid and nucleotide sequences in DQ beta 1 have been suggested to be critical in disease development, we find that the distribution of sequences corresponding to residues 71-77 is not greater in patients versus controls.

View details for THE DEVELOPMENT OF RATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR SELECTIVE IMMUNOTHERAPY AGAINST AUTOIMMUNE DEMYELINATING DISEASE Chimeric (murine/human) anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody was infused into seven patients with mycosis fungoides. Successive patients received doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg of antibody twice a week for 3 consecutive weeks. All patients had some clinical improvement, but responses were of relatively short duration. Serum levels of chimeric antibody varied as a function of dose. At the 80-mg dose level, antibody was readily observed in biopsied skin lesions. Although there was coating by antibody of most CD4 positive cells in the blood, there was no significant depletion of CD4 positive cells. Low-level antibody responses against the mouse Ig variable region and human Ig allotypic constant region determinants were observed in several patients, but none were of clinical significance. All but two patients made primary antibody and T-cell proliferative responses to a simultaneously administered foreign protein test antigen. However, there was marked suppression of the mixed lymphocyte reaction. We conclude that at the dose levels studied, a chimeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (1) had some clinical efficacy against mycosis fungoides; (2) was well tolerated; (3) had a low level of immunogenicity; (4) had immediate immunosuppressive effects; and (5) did not induce tolerance to a co-injected antigen.

G., Steinman, L., Majumdar, S., Almada, A., PAVLATH, G. K., Blau, H. M. We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody. Unexpectedly, the transcript of this gene was detected not only in the cerebellum and the brain stem but also in an extraneural tissue, the intestine.

S., Hoppe, R., Abel, E. A., Steinman, L., Berger, R. G., Gaiser, C., Young, G., Bindl, J., Hanham, A., Reichert, T. Over the past decade monoclonal antibodies have been successfully employed in a number of animal models of autoimmune disease. We have used antibodies to the class II gene products of the major histocompatibility complex, the CD4 molecule on helper T cells, and the T-cell receptor. Monoclonal anti-class II antibodies have been administered to treat paralytic disease in the animal model of multiple sclerosis--experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These antibodies not only reverse acute paralytic disease but also decrease the number of relapses in a model of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis when given after the first attack. The advantage of this form of therapy is that it is haplotype specific. In other words, in a heterozygous individual it is possible to block the major histocompatibility gene associated with disease susceptibility while leaving other major histocompatibility gene products free for antigen presentation. Thus, animals given this form of immunotherapy are not significantly immunosuppressed. Antibodies to the CD4 molecule have been equally effective in treating animal models of autoimmunity. We and others have reversed ongoing paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Relapses have been diminished after the administration of anti-CD4. Antibodies to CD4 have been used successfully to treat animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis. Recent trials with anti-CD4 have been successful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The latter trial employed a chimeric human/mouse antibody. Antibodies to the variable region of the T-cell receptor have been employed to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ISOLATION OF A COMPLEMENTARY-DNA CLONE ENCODING AN AUTOANTIGEN RECOGNIZED BY AN ANTINEURONAL CELL ANTIBODY FROM A PATIENT WITH PARANEOPLASTIC CEREBELLAR DEGENERATION Sakai, K., Mitchell, D. J., Tsukamoto, T., Steinman, L. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) was recently reported to be etiologically associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and brain plaques of patients with MS was analyzed for the presence of sequences homologous to the HTLV-I pol gene using the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot techniques. Comparison of DNA amplification patterns between patients with MS, and with control subjects who have other autoimmune conditions, with those in healthy control subjects and with an HTLV-I-infected cell line indicates that HTLV-I pol sequence is not present in the peripheral blood of patients with MS, and that the virus is not active in MS brain plaques.

The First Pediatric MS Center in the United States I became a neurologist because of my fascination with the brain, my interest in neurology and immunology, and my desire to improve clinical care. My career in neurology began with treating adults with multiple sclerosis, or MS, and conditions resembling MS that involve brain and spinal cord inflammation. However, when I realized that relatively few specialists were treating pediatric patients with MS—who were increasingly being diagnosed because of improved diagnostic techniques—I began to focus on treating children as well. From my personal life, I know how important it is to parents that their child’s physician has extensive background and experience in caring for children with the same rare condition. I became determined to gain as much experience and expertise as possible in managing pediatric MS. I opened the first dedicated center for children with MS in the United States. Now, I lead NYU Langone’s , and I have launched its Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Center. The diagnostic and treatment process is difficult for both children and adults with MS, so we are committed to making their engagement with our centers as smooth as possible. As part of our clinical assessment, we evaluate fatigue, dexterity, and cognitive abilities and use sensitive neuroimaging techniques to confirm diagnoses and monitor the course of the disease.  Everyone on my team, which includes nurses, other neurologists, psychologists, and social workers, knows that each person we see is different. Although treatment decisions are often the result of a collaborative effort between our team and patients, we recognize that families have different wants and needs. Some prefer to let our team take the lead in making treatment decisions, whereas others have strong preferences about their medication choices. Overall, I aim for treatments to be highly personalized, while also balancing safety, efficacy, and convenience.  Our research is also geared toward enhancing quality of life, in addition to finding a cure and understanding the genetic and environmental interactions that lead to MS. We are also taking into account how each person feels in the moment and how we can make day-to-day experiences as positive as possible. Through clinical trials, we are leading the way in improving the disease course, identifying the biologic factors underlying MS, and controlling symptoms. I lead clinical research programs aimed at reducing fatigue and improving cognitive functions, such as memory and attention, in people with MS. I try to balance convenience and the benefits of therapies with potential side effects and risks. One of my clinical trials uses interventions that can be done at home for convenience. I believe it’s important for people to live productive, active lives while participating in clinical trials that can be integrated into their daily activities in the least intrusive way possible. I was the founding chair of the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group, and I have been invited to chair or lecture multiple meetings, both internationally and nationally, and speak about treating pediatric patients with MS. I am also honored to have been named Multiple Sclerosis Physician of the Year by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and to have received the Michael A. Maffetone Community Service Award from Stony Brook University Hospital.

In 2017 your support has been fantastic, so thank you! I am looking forward to a bright 2018 as we celebrate our 25th anniversary of supporting people affected by multiple sclerosis. We will be re-open at 9am on Tuesday 02 January 2018, so until then, Merry Christmas! Sarah is running the Virgin Money London Marathon for . Here she tells of how she raised funds for her marathon fundraising by holding a mince pie and mulled wine afternoon... I am so happy to be running the for MS-UK. The reason that I am running for MS-UK is because my sister has multiple sclerosis. She was over 10 years ago and she never seems to let it rule her even though I know some days she really does struggle but she won’t let it beat her. She truly does inspire me and when things are tough in my training I will think of her and it will really help keep me going. So, to get my fundraising started, I hosted a mulled wine and mince pie party at my home for my friends and family. The idea was that they would donate some money for the privilege. I thought it would be a great idea as Christmas is coming and what a fab reason to get together and raise some money whilst doing so. I also have a teddy which needs a name and a home for £1 entry. Everyone loved him/her and most definitely wanted to take it home. The draw will take place next week but has so far raised £26. I had also made a few bits of jewellery to sell which I made about £5. I also used the opportunity to sell some of my old Christmas decorations. These included Winnie the Pooh, Tigger and Piglet. These were in great condition but my children had out grown them, I got £7. It really was a really great afternoon and in total I raised £112.50. We would like to wish you all a very merry Christmas on behalf of the whole team! Over Christmas the service will be closing from 1pm on Friday 22 December. This service will be up and running again at 9am on Tuesday 02 January. Our local wellness centre for anyone affected by multiple sclerosis, will be open for some of the Christmas period. Our opening hours over Christmas are as follows: Saturday 23 December, 10am – 4pm Monday 25 – Tuesday 26 December  Wednesday 27 December, 10am – 2pm Thursday 28 December  Friday 29 December, 10am – 2pm Saturday 30 December, 10am – 4pm Monday 01 January  Tuesday 02 January 9am – 5pm In her latest guest blog Joanne writes about Christmas and (MS)... Sorry it’s taken me so long to write. I’ve been battling bugs and the MonSter has come out with vengeance. With Christmas only around the corner, I put my best foot forward (left if you’re asking!), grab my stick (I’ve realised it doesn’t work well in winter) put some lippy on and carry on Christmas starts in full swing. I may look like I’m in the Christmas spirit, but on the inside, my MS is bubbling away. I probably sound all bah hum bug as on the one hand, it is the most wonderful time of the year but it also feels like an assault course. Twinkly lights, the smell of evergreen, secret eating of cheap chocolate coins, knowing the big FC is coming soon and everyone running around like headless chickens. Little man is still too young to fully understand but he does love Christmas like his mummy. Christmas and MS don’t mix. MS is holding me back. I’ve had to scale back. What am I doing to make Christmas run as smoothly as possible: Don’t stress out. With pressure to have this perfect Christmas, whatever perfect is, I try to ease the pressure by focusing on what’s important and remembering I live with MS, that’s pressure enough. Remember it’s only one day. Don’t over commit yourself. Do what’s right for you. Tiring for all, but exhausting for you. There’s more travelling whether it’s seeing folks or going out and about. Food and drink topped with long days have their toll. Don’t ignore any vegging opportunities but plan rest. Like Christmas presents, MSers need our batteries charged too! Blooming heck it is cold! It’s snowed recently, dark days and the heating is on full whack, so I’m feeling more tired, the cold is making my MS worse, getting out of a warm shower is my cryptonite and if someone sneezes, I’ll probably get the germs. Many things to contend with, so the girl guide in me is being even more prepared. I’ve bought supplements, wear lots of layers and my wheat toy monkey is on standby for placing on my MS mad hands or warming me up. Plus little man thinks it’s funny seeing him spin round in the microwave. I can’t write, so no card writing. Annoying but probably a blessing. I try to focus on what’s important, rather than what I can’t do. Charities get my card money instead of the card manufacturers. I insist on hubby having time to help, whether it is present wrapping or shopping. Instead of list writing, I use the internet to save all my gift ideas and finally shop. It also helps with requests for buying for little man. Christmas is about many things, for me, it’s also about random acts of kindness. When little man saw the big man, the kind staff made it easier for me. Obviously you’d like it to be magical (and value for money) but I was also thinking about me. Not judging my mobility, was the cherry on the cake. Recently I emailed ahead to get a table at a local bar. The bar reserved the table, so I could sit and enjoy drinks with ease. My friends have cooked meals and brought as a surprise. Many acts of random kindness. Before I wanted handbags or shoes, now I dream of kindness ( I still have the bag and shoes, although make them lovely flat ones!) So as the saying goes, I hope this isn’t just for Christmas. So whatever your Christmas brings, let’s hope it’s happy, merry and kind. Remember kindness costs nothing (not like a drone at £500!) Martin, James and Stirling: A Christmas tale of running In this guest blog, we celebrate our Fundraisers of the Month for December. Martin, James and Stirling all took on the Santa Run on 03 December to raise vital funds for MS-UK, so we can continue our work supporting people affected by . Here is their Christmas tale of running... I first decided to throw myself into fundraising for multiple sclerosis after my partner Dominique was diagnosed earlier on in the year after having our first baby. This is something that had been hanging over us for about three years but up until then she didn’t have enough symptoms to be diagnosed. Even so with us always knowing there would be a chance it was still a massive shock for all of us. I didn’t know how to help her or how to get my head around it, so I decided to put my energy into helping other people with MS. This way I felt like I was making a difference. I hope to raise money to help the people already affected but I’d also like to raise money to help find a cure also. That would be my ultimate goal, to help find a cure for Dominique. I first decided to do the Santa Run as a starting point for me to see how I got on with raising money and to see how well I would do. It also seemed fitting to have a bit of fun also, I think everyone needed that. Mine and Dominique’s friend James Paskins heard about my plans and jumped at the chance to join in and help with the fundraising and to also run with me. Following that our friend Stirling Woodside also wanted to help raise some money to do the Santa Run because of the ties he also has to MS. His girlfriend’s Mum also has the condition. So for our own personal reasons we put all of our efforts into doing the cause proud by fundraising and spreading awareness. James and I decided to put on a family and friends fundraising event at Dominique’s parents’. This also being a starting point for more ideas in the future but it was a huge success and we were extremely chuffed. We cooked big pots of stew, casserole and chilli the night before. Dominique and myself organised the pub quiz and a raffle, which went down so well. All we asked for was a donation of their choice to participate in the evening. It was good fun and everybody enjoyed themselves. We are still now being asked when the next one is going to be. Just in that one night alone we raised £385 with roughly 18 people. We are hoping to do more of these with friends and family who couldn’t attend this one, and then to hopefully branch out with more public fundraisers. On the build up to the Santa Run, I had good intentions of preparing for the run. I’m usually athletic in playing football every week but I had been injured so hadn’t played for a little while. I’d torn my hamstring, but this wasn’t going to stop me participating in what I’d planned to do for so long. So I got there on the day with no training and hardly any fitness behind me. It was hard, but not only did I do it but I finished it in under an hour and that was what I was always aiming for. Would I do it again? Yes! It was good fun and I’m hoping to get a few more people involved in doing it next year. In total we have all raised just over £1,500 and we are still going. Never did we expect the support we’ve been given but we do appreciate it so much. If you would like to donate to MS-UK our links are underneath, it really is a great cause and helps the lives of so many that are affected by multiple sclerosis. We thank everybody that has donated and that has helped us with the first of many fundraisers we hope to do in the future. In 2018, Sophie Bury is running the Virgin Money London Marathon. In this guest blog, Sophie tells us all about running a tuck shop at work as part of her fundraising! To raise money for is something that I am really proud to do as we lost a very close friend of my dad’s to multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2013. On 17 November I ran my first fundraising event at work and I decided to run a tuck shop, reminiscent of the ones you used to get a school, because who doesn’t love sweeties on a Friday! I’d had a few ideas for my first event but I wanted to run something that was easy to organise, fun and would include everyone. I enlisted the help of some very supportive colleagues and started selling at 11am, within 20 minutes the sweets had nearly sold out so we had to make a quick dash to Tesco to restock. It was really nice to see such a positive response so early on and I wanted to make a success of my first event. On our return with lots more sweets we carried on selling throughout the afternoon, with some really generous donations and comments about MS-UK. By 3pm it was a complete sell out, I was amazed at the response my tuck shop received and the kindness given from everyone in the office! I decided to go for the old fashioned pick’n’mix type sweets and along with that I bought some pink pinstriped paper bags to sell them in. I spoke to our internal communication team about featuring my event in our weekly Huddle, made a poster to advertise the stand and got to work. Running events can be daunting especially when it’s the first one and you’re doing it on your own. But the support received from my colleagues, friends and family has been so valuable and I’m really keen to make the tuck shop a regular event whilst I’m fundraising. My next event will be a Christmas themed bake sale on 15 December and I’m really excited to continue my . In her latest blog Jo explores the effect of the cold on (MS), a very topical subject with temperatures dropping and the 'threat' of a white Christmas... Sometimes I feel a bit like Goldilocks when it comes to finding the right temperature. I easily get too hot and I easily get too cold, in fact it can be rather tricky getting it just right! It is well documented that heat can make . Usually only temporarily, but worse all the same. In fact in times gone by, before MRI scans and the like, the test for MS was to put the patient in a hot bath and see if the symptoms got worse. If they did you had MS and if not you didn’t. A bit like how they ‘identified’ witches! Except without the risk of drowning as hopefully they pulled people out if it made their symptoms too bad! But a lesser known fact is the effect of the cold on MS symptoms. For some MSers that can be a real problem too. As the autumn starts to change into full on winter this is becoming rather difficult. I live in fear of snow and ice. It’s hard enough to walk with MS and a stick on level, dry ground, but to negotiate icy pavements or walk in the snow is a whole new level of challenge! And just generally trying to keep warm in winter is tricky. It’s ok if I’m at home with access to jumpers, thick socks and the central heating thermostat, but dressing to keep warm outside…especially watching football (either my son’s team or the mighty York City) is something I haven’t quite mastered yet. I’ve experimented with different types of thermals, socks, layers, gloves and hats, but to no avail. I’m seriously contemplating some heated gloves and I’ve seen a fabulous jacket with a rechargeable battery pack that powers heat in different sections…it’s a bit pricey though! When I get cold it’s not just the usual unpleasant feeling of being cold, it actually makes my symptoms worse. My legs stiffen up, the tremors start, the pain gets worse and the fatigue hits me and because my internal thermostat is faulty due to the MS it takes a long time to get warm again. I usually dive under the duvet, fully clothed with a hot water bottle and wait for the thaw to set in… I have recently found some hand and feet warmers (called Hothands) that are activated by the air once opened and last up to 10 hours. I tried them last weekend at a very cold football match and they helped a lot. I’ve just found that M&S do two different thicknesses of thermals too so I’ve ordered a thicker top to try. I’ve also bought some new thermal socks that have a Tog rating! Like duvets! Now surely they will do the trick! So, I will continue to hunt for things to keep me warm, pray for another mild winter and look forward to warmer, but not too warm, summer days. In this guest blog, Jamie Macpherson gives a personal account of how the ‘Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis’ program has helped with his multiple sclerosis (MS) and his life... My story is an interesting one as both I and my Mother have MS, six years and twenty nine years respectively. My mother is now considered secondary progressive and confined to a wheelchair currently. I, despite been with the label MS, consider myself the healthiest I've ever been and intend to be for the rest of my life. Before the introduction of internet and more recently the findings and practice of George Jelinek there wouldn’t have been much help for my mother as there wasn’t even many options for disease modifying drugs. So this will have led my mother to only be able to try methods such as the oxygen chamber therapy or the will of God. So as my Mother, Jeanette, slowly declined in health, I for a period of time became her run-around whilst my father Peter worked to keep a roof over our heads. All this time I’m doing this I am smoking, eating poor food, no exercise and unknowingly to me becoming ill with each day of this poor lifestyle whilst thinking ‘I’m wonderful because I’m helping my Mum!’ When I had my first episode of MS the pain was very hard to describe and something I would not like to go through again. Obviously I had all the tests MRI etc. and the confirmation by the neurologist was MS and his words were ‘go away and see how it progresses’ (lovely thank you very much)! The state of my body at that time, other than having MS, included weighing 22 stone, a BMI of 38, waist size 42 and more importantly really low self-esteem and depressive thoughts daily. What did I do? Well despite having a loving caring family of partner and two young children 13 and 9, I lost the plot and left home and sat for a time feeling very sorry for myself and my position in life. Then one day I visited my Mum and she had a magazine delivered called , which had a reference to a guy called George Jelinek, who had written a book called ‘Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis’, so I ordered the book and couldn’t believe the similarities that both he and I had had, Mothers with MS, and then sadly for George his mother passed away. Well this book gave me hope, a chance and an opportunity to maybe, just maybe, get out of this position and make something of my life. I attended the seminar that George and his team held in Brighton in 2013 and was completely amazed at all the people that had been following the seven step program and how well they were doing. Six years later my life is the best it has been ever. I now weigh 15 stone, my waist size 34, BMI around 18 my thoughts are of ‘what can I do today to help people like me?’How have I got here? Obviously the OMS program is a must and I follow as best I can daily. Other things I have implemented include, acupuncture once every two weeks with a fantastic lady, Gisela Conclaves, in Heywood Rainbow clinic, I only eat foods to my blood group, I take high doses of Vitamin D3 and daily flaxseed oil with Herbalife breakfast nutritional shake. More recently I have been trying the virtually no side-effects drug Low Dose Naltrexone which has been a real help in fighting the dreaded fatigue which I no longer suffer from. Above all these I tell myself ‘Every day in every way I get fitter and stronger.’ Find out about the Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis program on their .

HR Specialist and MSer, Rebecca Armstrong offers her advice... Rebecca Armstrong has a background in HR and Leadership Development at a Senior Level. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2013 and she now focuses on helping organisations embrace Equality and Diversity in their management practice. She established the Facebook group MS & Work in order to use her knowledge to support people with MS facing challenges in the workplace. Here are her top tips for those who are feeling discriminated against. If you think you are being treated unfairly keep a log of everything. Keep copies of emails and log all conversations. Ensure you keep this factual; record specifically what was said and what happened. Try to minimise emotion as much as you can – tribunals work mainly on the facts. Be open to helping your employer understand. If they get it wrong assess whether it was through naivety or discrimination. Think about how much you knew about MS before you were diagnosed and help educate. Use resources such as leaflets and booklets from MS-UK to help. If you are being discriminated against act in a timely manner, it is easier to ‘nip things in the bud’ than let them escalate and become stressful. Remember stress is a major factor in MS relapses and progression, often a simple conversation can remove it quickly. Put your concerns (with specifics) in writing under your company grievance process. In a tribunal a judge will consider what opportunity the company has had to do the right thing or to put right what’s wrong.

7c2fce34-30ff-4b27-94e7-47cd30a37ef2,"Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) Ageusia is the loss of taste functions on the tongue, which means you lose the ability to distinguish what is sweet, sour, bitter, or salty. Allodynia is a high sensitivity to touch, resulting in intense pain even with minimal contact, and refers specifically to a painful response to a normally innocuous stimulus. Allodymia is a specific type of dysesthesia, which is the abnormal sense of touch. Any substance that triggers the immune system to produce an antibody; generally refers to infectious or toxic substances, e.g. viruses or bacteria, or the small molecules that form part of these microorganisms. Anxiety is the most common mental health disorder. It is characterised by constantly feeling or showing worry, nervousness, or unease about something. It can also cause fatigue, restlessness and hypervigilance resulting from excessive worry and/or fear, which in turn can affect the ability to concentrate, sleep and carry out ordinary tasks. Astrocytes are star-shaped cells found in the brain and spinal cord. They perform many functions, including biochemical support of cells that form the blood–brain barrier, provision of nutrients to the nervous tissue, and play a role in the repair and scarring process of the brain and spinal cord following traumatic injuries. The incoordination and unsteadiness that result from the brain’s failure to regulate the body’s posture and the strength and direction of limb movements. Ataxia is most often caused by disease activity in the cerebellum (the part of the brain at the back of the skull). A wasting away or decrease in size of a cell, tissue, or organ of the body because of disease or lack of use. An antibody produced by the body’s immune system which target the body’s own cells, which it mistakenly recognizes as a threat. Autoimmune processes or autoimmunity is when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (AHSCT) Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant refers to a treatment scheme where a patient’s haematopoietic (or blood) stem cells are isolated from their bone marrow, before their immune system is removed either by chemotherapy or whole body irradiation. The patient’s own haematopoietic stem cells are then reintroduced back into their body to rebuild the immune system. A nerve fibre that carries information from the nerve cell body to another nerve cell or muscle fibre. B cells also known as B lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell in the immune system. B cells are important for ‘policing’ the human body for foreign substances. In particular, B cells are responsible for the production of antibodies and cytokines (chemical signals that circulate around the body), they are also important for presenting foreign substances (antigen presenting) to the rest of the immune system. The Babinski Reflex is often used to test MS, normally when stimulated with a blunt instrument the toes natural respond by pointing downwards, in newborns and some people with nerve damage the big toe points up and the toes splay outwards, this latter reaction is known as the Babinski reflex and may indicate an issue in the brain or the CNS. The word biomarker is short for biological markers. Biomarkers are measurable indicators of a biological process. Biomarkers can usually be measured through external testing such as tests of blood, urine or other body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or can be measured by scans or other physical tests. Often the term biomarker is used to describe indicators which are observable during disease, or a factor which may predict disease onset. Biomarkers may also been used during clinical trials to determine whether treatment being tested is working. MS attacks the central nervous system, which controls the normal functions of the body, including controlling the bladder. Bladder dysfunction is a breakdown in the communication between nerves and the bladder. The blood-brain barrier is a selective barrier that separates the circulating blood from the fluid that surrounds the tissue of the brain and spinal cord. A common symptom of MS is brain fog, or brain haze. It is a term used to describe the forgetfulness, trouble concentrating, and confusion. Brain tissue refers to any cells or connective tissue that make up the brain. Brain tissue is further subdivided into two categories, grey matter or white matter. The grey matter is the part that contains the main body of the nerve cells, and the white matter is mainly made up of axons or the projections that nerves cells use to connect and communicate with other nerve cells. The central nervous system refers to the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. It is named the central nervous system because it integrates information it receives from all of our senses, and coordinates and influences the activity of all the parts of the body. Clinically Isolated Syndrome is diagnosed when a person has only experienced a single episode of neurologic symptoms (such as visual blurriness, numbness, tingling and weakness of the limbs).  It is caused by inflammation and/or loss of the myelin sheath that covers the nerve fibres. It can be associated with future development of MS, but is not always associated with the development of MS. A diagnosis of MS can only be made if a person has experienced two or more attacks occur separated by time (for example 2 months) and affecting different parts of the central nervous system. The central nervous system (CNS) refers to the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. It is named the central nervous system because it integrates information it receives from all of our senses, and coordinates and influences the activity of all the parts of the body. Cognitive Impairment is the noticeable decline in memory, learning, language, thinking or judgment, and memory. AKA as brain fog. A permanent shortening of the muscles and tendons adjacent to a joint, which can result from severe, untreated spasticity and interferes with movement around the joint. An experiment or clinical trial in which two groups are used for comparison purposes. This includes drug trials where one groups of participants are given a substance or treatment whereas the other group (the control group) are not, or are given a mock treatment. Messenger chemicals produced by immune cells, to influence the activity of other cells. The process where the protective myelin sheath which surrounds nerve fibres is attacked and destroyed during an active phase of MS. A mental health condition characterised by a persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life. Disease Modifying Drugs (DMD) or Disease Modifying Therapies (DMT) are treatments which slow down or reduce the damage caused by MS, as opposed to symptom modifying treatments which work to control the symptoms. Short for deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA constitutes the chemical basis for genes, the basic units of heredity. A study in which none of the participants nor examining doctors, know who is taking the test drug and who is taking control agent (also known as a simulated medication or placebo). The purpose of this research design is to avoid inadvertent bias of the test results. This is considered the gold standard for clinical trial design. The double-blind refers to neither the patient nor the treating doctor knowing whether a patient is receiving active treatment or not until the completion of the trial Dysathria is a reduced control of the speech muscles resulting in slurred speech. It is often associated with damage to the nervous system. Dysesthesia is an unpleasant abnormal sense of touch. It can present as pain – Allodymia, but it may also present as abnormal response to touch such as burning, wetness, itching, electric shock, pins and needles, and can affect any body part. Dysmetria is the lack of coordination of movement, and is a subtype of ataxia. Dysmetria is characterised by when the limb undershoots or overshoots the intended position. It is sometimes described as an inability to judge distance or scale. Dysphagia is problem swallowing, which can be a symptom of MS resulting from loss of control over the muscles controlling the pharynx or oesophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), or loss of sensation of the pharynx, leading to disruption to the swallowing mechanism. Dysphonia is the weakness or spasticity of the muscles that control the voice, resulting the issues with producing the voice. This can include issues with pitch control and hoarseness of the voice amongst other symptoms. Encephalomyelitis is inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, a characteristic of MS. Epigenetics means on top of genetics. It refers to external modifications to DNA that turn genes ""on"" or ""off."" These modifications do not change the DNA sequence, but instead, they affect how cells ""read"" genes. A flareup or relapse is a period of worsening symptoms that can either be new symptoms or the return or worsening of existing ones. The EDSS is a scoring system for quantifying the impairment brought on by MS. It includes measurements assessing weakness of limbs, tremor, speech and swallowing difficulties, numbness, bowel and bladder function and visual function amongst others. It is a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = no impairment, 10 = the greatest severity. EAE is an animal model where the mice develop an MS-like illness (an autoimmune demyelination disease), where the animal’s immune system is deliberately made to target the nerve myelin sheath. Mice with EAE are the most common laboratory model of MS used in research. Is a feeling of constant tiredness or weakness and can be physical, mental or a combination of both. It is distinct from and more debilitating than general feelings of sleepiness or physical tiredness. Fatigue is the most commonly reported symptom of MS. A flareup or relapse is a period of worsening symptoms that can either be new symptoms or the return or worsening of existing ones. The Food and Drug Administration is an American government agency which is responsible for regulating and supervising the use of medications and medical devices. One of its roles is to certify medications. Medications are typically submitted to either the FDA or the European equivalent the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before they being submitted to the Australian equivalent known as the Therapeutic Goods Agency (TGA). Free radicals are highly reactive chemicals that can react and damage DNA and proteins within the body. They are by-products of the energy producing mechanism of cells. The body produces antioxidants to help counteract free radicals. Gd is an abbreviation for Gadolinium, a chemical which is sometimes injected into a person’s blood during an MRI. Gadolinium normally cannot pass from the bloodstream into the brain, however during an MS relapse the blood brain barrier is disrupted, allowing gadolinium to enter into the brain where it enters MS lesions, creating a bright spot on an MRI. It is therefore used to identify ‘active’ lesions in the brain to distinguish them from old lesions (scars) or repairing lesions. A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes, which are made up of DNA, encode instructions to make molecules called proteins. Genetic susceptibility or genetic risk or predisposition is an increased likelihood of developing a particular disease based on an individual’s genetic makeup.  It may be determined by just one gene or by a combination of many genes. Glial cells, sometimes called simply glia, are non-neuronal cells that provide support and protection for neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hypogeusia is a reduction in ability to detect sweet, sour, bitter, or salty tastes. From a therapeutic point of view, immunomodulation refers to any process in which an immune response is altered. MS can disrupt the nerve signalling between the central nervous system and the bladder, disrupting the control of the movement of urine, causing urine to leave the body at any stage. Inflammation is when the immune system acts to defend the body against invading microbes or to heal damaged tissue. In the skin, inflammation is typically associated with redness, heat, swelling and pain. Is a type of interferon. Interferons are signalling molecules (cytokine) that are found naturally in the body. They are released by cells in response to the presence of foreign objects. Interferon beta can also be manufactured as a drug and is used as a treatment for MS; it is thought act to reduce MS symptoms by modulating inflammatory signals. An injection or infusion of medicines into the fluid filled canal in the spinal cord or the fluid that surrounds the spinal cord. This allows the medicine to directly reach the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain. It is sometimes used to deliver anesthetics or pain relief medicines or certain types of chemotherapy. This drug delivery method allows certain drugs to reach the brain without being stopped or blocked by the ‘[blood-brain barrier]’ – the blood-brain barrier is a barrier that lines the blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that selectively allows only certain cells and chemicals through to protect the brain. An injection or infusion of medicines directly into a vein in the body. This drug delivery method allows drugs to reach the body that would otherwise be digested or broken down if given as a pill or tablet. It also allows higher doses of medicines to be delivered straight into the blood stream. A lesion is an area of abnormal tissue or scarring (sclerosis) of the brain tissue or spinal cord due to a previous inflammatory attack. In MS these are typically detected during life by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They can also be seen in post mortem tissue using specialised tissue staining and microscope techniques. A lumbar puncture is a diagnostic test for multiple sclerosis that involves removing and analysing a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord within the skull and backbone. It is also known as a spinal tap. The fluid is then examined to see whether there is a higher than normal white blood cell count and/or higher levels of antibodies (also known as oligoclonal bands due to the test carried out on the fluid). Lymphocytes are cells of the immune system. They are small cells found in the blood that circulate through the body looking for foreign objects/microorganisms. They further subgroup into two major groups B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging procedure. It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of the inside of the body. It is particularly useful to collect pictures of soft tissue such as the brain or spinal cord which can reveal tell-tale MS scars (lesions) on the brain or spinal cord. Methylation is a biochemical process in cells where a chemical tag (a methyl group) is added to DNA. This is a form of epigenetics, or another layer of control over the DNA in cells changing the genes which cells use. Microglia are a special type of immune cell located throughout the brain and spinal cord. They help in defending the brain and spinal cord from infection by engulfing and digests debris, foreign substances, microbes and if needed can attract other cells in the immune system to mount a full response. Mitochondria are small sub-units of cells which turn sugars, fats and proteins that we eat, into forms of chemical energy that cells can use to carry out their functions. MS Hug is a band of tight pain around your torso that can range from dull and achy to sharp and burning. The pain can sometimes make it hard to breathe, giving it the nickname ""MS girdle."" Myelin is a white fatty substance that surrounds the axon of some nerve cells. The myelin sheath forms an electrically insulating layer. It is essential for the proper electrical conduction of nerve signals along nerve axons. The production of the myelin sheath is called myelination. Neurodegeneration is a term to describe the loss of function of neurons, or nerve cells in the brain or spinal cord. Neurodegenerative Disease is an umbrella term which covers conditions which are characterised by progressive nervous system dysfunction. Neurology is the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of disorders of the nervous system. The ability of the central nervous system to form and re-form nerve connections between the brain and muscles of the body in response to education, or to reroute messages around sites of damage or injury to restore muscle function. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic's syndrome, is a diverse condition consisting of the simultaneous inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). While MS and NMO are similar, they are considered to be different diseases due to the specific regions under inflammatory attack in NMO. In NMO it known that the immune system targets a protein called AQP4 whereas the target in MS is unknown. Neurons or nerve cells are specialised cells which are electrically excitable. They process and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. They are the core component of the nervous system which includes the brain, the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. The brain’s ability to form and re-form connections. This can be in response to learning or other memory forming tasks, or can be the brain rewiring itself to circumvent areas of damage or injury. Nocturia is the need to wake and pass urine at night. Waking up once during the night is considered normal. Nocturia is a when the night-time urination occurs more frequently. Normal appearing white matter or Normal appearing grey matter Areas of the brain that appear normal under standard MRI conditions but look abnormal when pulsed with specific radiofrequencies (known as magnetization transfer MRI). These areas can occur in white matter regions or grey matter regions. Why the normal appearing areas appear in the brain is unknown, but they can be used to help predict the course of the disease. Oligoclonal bands are bands of antibodies that are seen in a patient's blood serum, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is analysed. They are an important indicator in the diagnosis of MS. More than 95% of all patients with multiple sclerosis have permanently observable oligoclonal bands. The cell in the central nervous system that makes myelin. The nerve that transmits signals from the light sensitive layer at the back of the eye (the retina) to the brain. Inflammation of an optic nerve, causing blurred vision or other visual disturbances. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production of free radicals and antioxidants in your body. Free radicals are molecules that can be produced in the body during normal biological processes and during disease. They contain oxygen with an uneven number of electrons which leaves them slightly unstable and able to react easily with other molecules, sometimes causing damage. Antioxidants are molecules naturally found in the body, or also consumed in our food, that can safely react with, and essentially mop up, free radicals. Paresthesia refers to a burning or prickling sensation that is usually felt in the hands, arms, legs, or feet, but can also occur in other parts of the body. The PBAC is an independent expert body appointed by the Australian Government. It is made up of doctors, health professionals, health economists and consumer representatives.  Its primary role is to recommend whether medications should be subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Physical therapy is a therapy using mechanical force and movements, in an effort to remediate impairments and promote mobility. An initial study, often with fewer samples or participants, designed in order to determine the effects and results of a drug, procedure or observation and decide whether further larger studies are warranted. A placebo is a substance or treatment of no intended therapeutic value. Common placebos include inactive tablets or injections, but can also include any medical procedure which resembles an active treatment. A placebo is used to prevent the influence of people’s expectation of treatment, which can impact results. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare and usually fatal viral disease. It is caused by a virus called the JC virus which is normally controlled by the immune system, but in people whose immune systems are compromised by either disease or by medications which suppress the immune system, the virus can cause progressive damage to the brain. Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis affects about 10-15% of people with MS. PPMS is characterised by a progressive worsening of symptoms and disability without periods of recovery or remission. Proteins are large biomolecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within living organisms. Proteins are the functional units encoded by genes; they are the ‘components’ of the living machinery in our cells. A flareup or relapse is a period of worsening symptoms that can either be new symptoms or the return or worsening of existing ones. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is the most common form of MS; it is characterised by flare-ups of the neurological symptoms of MS, also known as relapses or attacks, followed by periods of recovery or remission. A remission is a lessening in the severity of MS symptoms or even their temporary disappearance. Remyelination is the process in which oligodendrocytes (specialised cells in the central nervous system) recreate new protective myelin sheaths to surround nerve fibres. Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis is a secondary phase of relapsing remitting MS; it follows an initial period of relapsing-remitting MS. SPMS is characterised by a progressive worsening of symptoms (accumulation of impairments) over time, with no obvious signs of remission. Spasticity refers to the feeling of stiffness or involuntary muscle spasms. It can range from relatively mild with a feeling of tightness in the muscles, to very severe with large uncontrollable spasms. The human body is made up of different kinds of specialised cells such as muscle cells, nerve cells, fat cells and skin cells. All specialised cells originate from stem cells. A stem cell is a cell that is not yet specialised, and specialises into a specific cell type. Stem cells can be further separated into categories depending on whether they have started the specialisation process, for example haematopoietic stem cells are cells which can give rise to all the different haematopoietic cells. T cells also known as T lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell in the immune system. T cells can be further divided into subcategories, including T Helper Cells, Cytotoxic T cells, and Memory T cells. Together they help form a full immune response against invading objects or microorganisms. T1 and T2 are technical terms applied to different MRI methods used to generate magnetic resonance images. Specifically, T1 and T2 refers to the time taken between magnetic pulses and the image is taken. These different methods are used to detect different structures or chemicals in the central nervous system. T1 and T2 lesions refers to whether the lesions were detected using either the T1 or T2 method. A T1 MRI image supplies information about current disease activity by highlighting areas of active inflammation. A T2 MRI image provides information about disease burden or lesion load (the total amount of lesion area, both old and new). The Therapeutic Goods Agency is the Australian government agency which is responsible for regulating and supervising the use of medications and medical devices in Australia. Medications are typically submitted to the American FDA (Food and Drug Administration) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before being submitted to the TGA. Trigeminal Neuralgia is pain of the nerve (trigeminal nerve) responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. It can manifest in multiple forms including severe, sudden, shock like pain in one side of the face but can include burning and other unpleasant feelings. Uhthoff's phenomenon (also known as Uhthoff's syndrome, Uhthoff's sign, and Uhthoff's symptom) is the worsening of MS symptoms when the body gets overheated, whether it be from hot weather, exercise, fever, or saunas and hot tubs. Vertigo is the feeling that your surroundings are spinning even if you’re standing still. It is a balance issue commonly associated with MS and its interruption of nerve signals. This relates to the central cavity of the inner ear (the vestibule), which affects a person’s balance and movement.

863b7f9b-480e-4e6a-8008-1e2714f7e6d6,"Safety and Toxicology of Cannabinoids , –() There is extensive research on the safety, toxicology, potency, and therapeutic potential of cannabis. However, uncertainty remains facilitating continued debate on medical and recreational cannabis policies at the state and federal levels. This review will include a brief description of cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system; a summary of the acute and long-term effects of cannabis; and a discussion of the therapeutic potential of cannabis. The conclusions about safety and efficacy will then be compared with the current social and political climate to suggest future policy directions and general guidelines. There are more than 60 systematic reviews and meta-analyses discussing the safety, toxicology, potency, and therapeutic potential of exogenous cannabinoids. However, the general consensus of these reports is largely mixed and inconclusive. The uncertainty surrounding safety and efficacy of exogenous cannabinoids is not a product of the lack of research, but rather a product of the extreme variability in study methodology and quality. This review provides a summary of the current research on the safety and efficacy of exogenous cannabinoids, including a brief description of the chemical constituents of cannabis and how it interacts with the endocannabinoid system; a summary of what is known about the acute and long-term effects of cannabis; and a discussion of the therapeutic potential. Conclusions on safety and efficacy will then be compared with the current social and political climate in order to highlight the need for policy changes and general guidelines. Marijuana, or cannabis, colloquially referred to as weed, pot, grass, herb, bud, ganja, and so on, is the most commonly used illicit drug both nationally and internationally. Roughly, 180.6 million people worldwide report lifetime cannabis use [], and 24.6 million people in the USA report past-month use []. Cannabis is derived from the plant , , or , which is includes 70 known cannabinoids, including 7 cannabigerols, 5 cannabichromenes, 7 cannabidiols (CBD), 9-Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabidiols (THC-9), 2-Δ-8-tetrahydrocannabidiols (THC-8), 3 cannabicyclols, 5 cannabielsoins, 7 cannabinols, 2 cannabinodiols, and 9 cannabitriols []. In addition to whole-plant cannabinoids, there are a variety of synthetic cannabinoids (e.g., dronabinol and nabilone, both synthetic THCs) and cannabinoid extracts (e.g., the oro-mucosal spray nabiximols that contain both THC and CBD) that are used both clinically and in research []. THC and CBD are the most commonly researched cannabinoids in the literature and there is variability in the location, mechanism, and consequences of their actions. THC has a high affinity for cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CBR) [], which are found in the highest densities in the neuron terminals of the basal ganglia, cerebellum, hippocampus, neocortex, and hypothalamus and limbic cortex [–]. These brain regions are involved in motor activity, coordination, short-term memory, executive function, and appetite and sedation, respectively, and it is possible that THC activity in CBR in these regions may explain many of the acute effects of cannabis use [], which will be addressed later. The endocannabinoid system also contains cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CBR), which are found primarily in immune cells and tissues [, ]. There is evidence that activity of endogenous cannabinoids (e.g., anadamide) and exogenous cannabinoids (e.g., THC) at CBR may have opposing effects on the immune system, with endogenous cannabinoids enhancing immune response and exogenous cannabinoids having immunosuppressant effects []. In contrast to THC, CBD has relatively low affinity for both CBR and CBR []. Despite the relatively low affinity of CBD at CBR and CBR, it demonstrates high potency as an antagonist. Furthermore, there is evidence that CBD may mitigate some of the effects of THC [–], potentially through indirect agonism, either by augmenting CBR constitutional activity or endocannabinoid tone []. The already complex interactions of exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids in the cannabinergic system are further obfuscated by different methods of administration, inconsistent dosing measures, and highly variable cannabinoid content of cannabis plants. Cannabinoid content and consequent potency has shown extreme variance depending on the light, temperature, humidity, and soil type during cultivation, as well as genetic factors [–]. This is evidenced by changes in potency over time as more cannabis is grown in doors and as strains are engineered with different THC and CBD ratios [, , ]. Furthermore, the method of administration (e.g., oral, smoked, vaporized) and form of cannabinoid consumed (e.g., stems and buds, hashish, hash oil, extract, synthetic) can impact the bioavailability and consequently the response to use [, , , –]. This is particularly salient when comparing recreational and medical forms of cannabis. Collectively, these factors contribute to the difficulty in deciphering the relative safety and efficacy of cannabinoids both medically and recreationally. Despite the variability in research methodology and quality, there are some generalizable findings regarding the acute and long-term effects of exogenous cannabinoids. Cannabinoids have shown both acute and long-term cardiovascular effects. Acute dose-dependent effects of cannabis include tachycardia, increased cardiac labor, systemic vasodilation, and increased blood pressure [, –]. More severe effects such as increased angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and cardiomyopathy have been recorded in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions [, , , ], and as such it is recommended that these individuals avoid cannabis use []. Paradoxically, the long-term cardiac effects of chronic cannabis use include bradycardia and hypotension, which may reflect tolerance and down-regulation over time [, , ]. Smoking is one of the main methods of cannabis administration. As such, the impact that smoking cannabis has on the respiratory system has been a point of serious concern for policy makers. A number of acute and chronic effects on the respiratory system are associated with cannabis use. Specifically, acute cannabis use has been shown to increase inflammation of large airways, increase airway resistance, and destroy lung tissue [, , ]. Further, there is evidence that chronic cannabis use also results in increased risk of chronic bronchitis [, , ], increased risk of emphysema [], chronic respiratory inflammation [, , , ], and impaired respiratory function [, ]. Although there is a pathophysiological process by which chronic cannabis use could confer an increased risk of cancer the epidemiological literature on the causal relationship is mixed [–]. Hashibe et al. [] found that smoking cannabis was not associated with an increased risk of smoking-related cancers (e.g., lung, head, and neck), but might be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, cervical cancer, and glioma. Conversely, Reece [] reported that smoking cannabis is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Other findings suggest that while cannabis does increase the risk of lung cancer, it is still lower than the risk of lung cancer associated with tobacco []. Comparisons of cannabis and tobacco smoke have produced mixed findings. Repp and Raich [] found that cannabis smoke contains ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, nitric oxide, and aromatic amines at 3–5 times the rate of tobacco smoke. However, Maertens et al. [] found that aside from the cannabinoids and nicotine, cannabis and tobacco smoke condensates contained mixtures that were qualitatively similar. They also found that cannabis smoke condensate and tobacco smoke condensate influence the same molecular processes but have subtle pathway differences that potentially account for differential toxicities and the mixed results with respect to lung cancer []. Given the prevalence of CBR in immune cells and tissues, exogenous cannabinoids likely produce immunological impacts both acutely and chronically []. However, the influence of exogenous cannabinoids on the immune system is multifaceted and while comprehension is improving, continued research is required []. While there is some evidence of immunosuppressive properties of cannabis [, ], there is evidence of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of CBD []. Specifically, CBD inhibits interleukin-10, while also increasing interleukin-8, which could have potentially therapeutic results in immune disorders []. The presence of both positive and negative impacts of cannabis on the immune system illustrate the potential biphasic impact on the immune system, with benefits at high and low levels and detriments at moderate levels [, , ]. Similarly, Suarez-Pinilla et al. [] found that endocannabinoids enhanced immune response, while exogenous cannabinoids had immunosuppressant effects. There is mixed evidence regarding the impact of cannabinoids on sleep []. Sedation and somnolence are commonly described acute adverse effects of heavy cannabis use [, –]. Furthermore, cannabis has been shown to increase total sleep time in individuals with difficulty sleeping, including in cancer patients with chronic pain [], individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder [], and individuals with insomnia []. However, cannabis has been show to decrease slow wave sleep [, ]. This suggests that a consequence of the increased sleep time may be decreased sleep quality. There is also some evidence that sleep difficulty is a withdrawal symptom associated with cannabis use disorders [, ]. It is clear that exogenous cannabinoids have an effect on cognition; however, there is considerable variability between the acute neuropsychological, chronic neuropsychological, and neuroimaging findings. Cannabis use has well evidenced acute impacts on cognition [, , , , , –]. Specifically, it has been reported to impair free recall [, , ], acquisition [], working memory [, ], and procedural memory [, ]. Impairments are also demonstrated on measures of attention [, , ], impulsivity [, ], inhibition [], sensory perception [], and executive function [, , –]. On other measures of cognitive function the, evidence of deficits is less clear. Some studies report impairments in gross and simple motor tasks after acute cannabis use [, , , , ], whereas others find that evidence on impairments in psychomotor function is inconclusive []. Likewise, evidence for the impact of acute cannabis use on abstract reasoning and decision making is mixed, with some reports of impairment [, ], and other studies demonstrating no impact [, ]. Although there are clear acute cognitive effects of cannabis use, the majority are relatively short lived and diminish over time with abstinence [, , , , ]. Most studies have found limited evidence of persistent neuropsychological deficits among cannabis users [, , , , –], particularly for those who initiated cannabis use as adults []. However, the risk of long-term cognitive effects of cannabis use appears to increase with earlier age of onset [, , , , –], frequency of use [, , , , , ], and duration of use [, , , , ]. For instance, Repp and Raich [] found that adolescents who initiate cannabis use before the age of 15 years demonstrate persistent pronounced deficits in visual attention, verbal fluency, inhibition, short-term recall, impulsivity, and executive functioning. Similarly, Meier et al. [] found that cessation of cannabis did not fully restore cognitive deficits among adolescent-onset cannabis users, and may result in a greater loss of IQ in adolescence [, ]. Moreover, adolescent-onset users diagnosed with cannabis dependence prior to the age of 18 years were more likely to become persistent users and showed impairments in executive functioning and processing speed []. Other factors that may influence long-term neuropsychological effects and make between-study comparisons difficult include length of abstinence and the THC to CBD ratio [, , ]. This is particularly interesting because studies of acute administration suggest that CBD may be protective against the negative cognitive impacts of THC []. In addition to the neuropsychological assessments, a number of studies have applied neuroimaging techniques to examine the effects of exogenous cannabinoids on brain structure, function, and connectivity. Recent morphological studies of adults and adolescents have found structural abnormalities in CBR-rich areas, particularly in the medial temporal and frontal cortices and cerebellum, and most notably among chronic cannabis users [, , , –]. Specifically, structural neuroimaging findings suggest there are reductions in parahippocampal, hippocampal, and thalamic volume associated with chronic cannabis use when compared with healthy controls []. Studies of chronic adolescent cannabis users also showed structural differences in the hippocampus and amygdala []; gray matter volume reduction in the medial temporal cortex, temporal pole, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex []; and reduced prefrontal volumes and white matter integrity when compared with controls [, ]. Studies of marijuana users who have also used alcohol or tobacco have also shown changes in brain morphometry. Heavy marijuana using adolescents with co-occurring alcohol use were found to have increased cortical thickness, particularly in frontal and parietal regions []. An investigation by Wetherill et al. [] comparing adult cannabis users with and without co-occurring tobacco use reported that both groups showed smaller thalamic gray matter volume than nonusers; however, both cannabis groups and a cohort of tobacco smokers showed increased left putamen volumes. Reduced left cerebellum gray matter in nicotine users but not in cannabis users suggested that nicotine and cannabinoids exert differential effects on regional brain tissue volume []. Moreover, evidence suggests that in adolescents functional alterations may appear shortly after starting drug use []. Therefore, while cannabis use may result in morphological alteration in adults and adolescents, early onset, longer duration, and heavier use are associated with more significant alterations in structural integrity []. Alterations in brain function have also been observed during cannabis use. There is strong evidence that acute cannabis administration increases cerebellar and prefrontal blood flow [, , ]. However, resting state prefrontal blood flow is lower in chronic cannabis users when compared with controls [, , ]. This may represent the down-regulation of CBR receptors during the resting state among chronic users []. Additionally, acute administration of cannabis may increase anterior cingulate cortex activity during cognitive tasks and increase brain metabolism in multiple regions during impulsivity tasks [, , , ]. The greater task-related activation among chronic cannabis users may reflect impaired efficiency and recruitment of additional regions [, , , ]. Furthermore, there is also evidence that adults who initiated regular cannabis use in adolescence may have impaired functional connectivity []. Specifically, neuroimaging data indicate reduced connectivity within prefrontal networks, which may be partially responsible for deficits in executive function among regular heavy cannabis uses who initiated use in adolescence []. These abnormalities may be explained by the influence of cannabis on the still-developing endocannabinoid system, particularly the disruption of normal pruning during adolescence when extensive re-organization of gray and white matter is occurring [, ]. However, while changes in white matter have been reported in adolescent cannabis users, the mechanisms for the change and long-term effects have not been fully characterized []. Finally, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive measurement technique that enables the quantification of a range of neurometabolites, including γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. The effects of chronic marijuana exposure have been examined through the application of MRS imaging. For example Chang et al. [] reported reduced glutamate, choline, and myoinositol concentrations in the basal ganglia of chronic marijuana users. Applying MRS imaging, Hermann et al. [] identified lower concentrations of -acetyl aspartate in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of adult smokers. Prescot et al. applied recently completed a small pilot study using proton MRS to the anterior cingulate of marijuana smoking and non-smoking adolescents and also found reduced -acetyl aspartate, as well as reduced glutamate and creatine in marijuana-using individuals []. Disruptions of the cannabinergic system may have important implications for a number of neurobehavioral processes []. There is evidence of an association between cannabis use and both acute and chronic mental illness and psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and an amotivational state [, ]. However, given the variation in the disease process, as well as inconsistent cannabis dosing and composition, the full nature of the associations remains to be clarified. In studies of cannabis use and bipolar disorder, it appears that cannabis use may exacerbate or trigger manic symptoms among individuals previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Gibbs et al. [] found a 3-fold increase in risk for onset of manic symptoms after cannabis use []. However, there does not seem to be evidence that cannabis use is a risk factor for developing bipolar disorder []. Mixed findings are found when examining the relationship between cannabis use and depression and anxiety. There is some evidence that cannabis use and cannabis withdrawal may result in acute depressed mood [, , ]. Similarly, studies suggest that cannabis may increase acute anxiety [, , ]. The picture of chronic anxiety and depression and cannabis use is more complicated, in part because frequent cannabis users have both a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, and individuals with anxiety have high rates of cannabis use [, ]. The fact that individuals who initiate cannabis use in adolescence may develop depression and anxiety that persists after cessation may also influence this relationship []. Furthermore, interpreting causality is complicated by the fact that a low concentration of THC may have anxiolytic effects, whereas higher concentrations produce anxiogenic effects [, ], and the evidence that CBD may mitigate the effects of THC in animal models of anxiety []. A significant portion of the literature dedicated to cannabis use and mental health focuses on the relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia and psychosis. A number of studies suggest that acute cannabis exposure may induce temporary psychosis [, ]. Additionally, chronic cannabis use may trigger psychosis and schizophrenia in individuals with a predisposition or genetic susceptibility to mental illness [, , , , , , ]. This appears to occur in a dose-dependent manner, such that heavy cannabis use, longer duration, greater potency, and early onset of use may be more closely aligned with disease trajectory, often significantly advancing the first psychotic episode and development of schizophrenia [, , , , , ]. Additionally, lifetime cannabis use has been associated with higher schizotypy scores [], and cannabis may exacerbate pre-existing symptoms of psychosis and schizophrenia []. Furthermore, individuals with psychosis may be more vulnerable to brain volume loss, which has been suggested as a result of cannabis exposure [, , ]. Although there is strong evidence that early cannabis use among at-risk individuals may increase the likelihood of developing schizophrenia or psychosis at a later time point, additional research is necessary to parse out the intricacies of the interaction between THC and CBD on the cannabinergic system. For example, several systematic reviews found that while cannabis use may increase subclinical symptoms of psychosis, the findings to date do not support an association between cannabis use and first psychosis []. Additionally, there is some evidence that cannabis with a high CBD and low THC content may mitigate psychosis [, , ]. In addition to the physical, psychological, and cognitive effects of cannabis, there are clear concerns about public health and safety. A potentially serious public health effect of cannabis use is a high incidence of drugged driving and motor vehicle accidents [, ]. Moreover, driving impairment occurs in a dose-dependent fashion [, ], and individuals driving under the influence of cannabis are anywhere from 2 to 7 times more likely to be involved in both fatal and nonfatal motor vehicle collisions [, ]. Another risk associated with cannabis use is addiction and cannabis dependence. Nine to ten percent of individuals who initiate cannabis use will become addicted [, , ]. That number increases to 16–17 % among individuals who initiate use as an adolescent and 25–50 % among individuals who use cannabis daily []. The risk for addiction appears to wane as the individual ages, such that it is rarely addictive if use begins after the age of 25 years []. However, currently 6.5 % of twelfth graders in the USA report daily cannabis use [], and there is evidence to suggest that as perception of harm decreases, prevalence of use increases []. This is particularly important because early exposure to cannabinoids may alter the reactivity of the dopamine reward centers in the brain, thereby increasing vulnerability to abuse of and addiction to other substances, and adding support to the gateway hypothesis [, ]. Furthermore, heavy cannabis use may be linked to negative consequences downstream, including lower income, greater need for socioeconomic assistance, unemployment, and lower life satisfaction []. There is also evidence of negative impacts on maternal and child health. Cannabis use during pregnancy is associated with poor physical outcomes, including birth defects, low birth weight, and an increased risk of childhood cancer, as well as poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including aggressive behavior and attention problems in girls [, , ]. For example, children who were exposed to marijuana prenatally are more likely to demonstrate decreased problem-solving skills, as well as poor memory and attention [, ]. Similarly, babies exposed to marijuana prenatally show traits indicative of neurological development problems [, ]. Despite the acute and chronic side effects of cannabis use, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting the therapeutic potential of cannabis. This is likely facilitated, in part, by the fact that certain cannabinoids, like CBD, have been well-studied and are well tolerated and safe in humans, even at high doses and chronically []. Exogenous cannabinoids, including nabiximols, CBD extract, and even smoked cannabis, have been recommended medically for cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, and other illnesses for which cannabis provides relief [, ]. Additionally, the American Academy of Neurology published a position statement concluding that medical cannabis is ‘probably effective’ for some symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including spasticity, central pain, spasms, and urinary dysfunction; is ‘probably ineffective’ for levodopa-induced dyskinesia of Parkinson’s disease (PD); and of ‘unknown efficacy’ in nonchorea symptoms of Huntington’s disease (HD), Tourette’s syndrome, cervical dystonia, and epilepsy [, ]. The literature on the therapeutic potential of exogenous cannabinoids in the treatment of MS has been the most promising. There is evidence that cannabinoids may have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in individuals with MS through the regulation of cytokine levels []. However, it should be noted that the degree of therapeutic potential varies according to preparation. There is evidence that oral cannabis extract and nabiximols, an oral mucosal spray containing a 1:1 ratio of CBD:THC, reduce spasticity in patients with MS [, , , ]; however, smoked marijuana is of uncertain efficacy []. Similarly, the American Medical Association found that a review of small, short-term randomized controlled trials demonstrated that smoked cannabis reduces neuropathic pain, improves appetite, and may relieve spasticity and pain in patients with MS []. There is also some evidence of reduced muscle stiffness, relief from pain, and improved sleep quality among patients with MS using oral cannabis extract []; however, these findings arise from subjective assessment of symptom relief and may be secondary to improvements in spasticity [, ]. While many studies suggest that cannabis may be a useful therapy for MS-related symptoms, it is important to note that not all studies assess adverse physical and cognitive impacts. Wade et al. [] found that patients with MS who demonstrate symptom relief after use of nabiximols can continue use in the long term without tolerance, intoxication, serious adverse effects, or decrease in subjective symptomatic relief. Although the literature suggests only mild adverse physical effects associated with medical cannabis use for treatment of MS, recent studies of cannabis use in patients with MS have reported cognitive diminishment and impairment of cerebral compensatory mechanisms when compared directly with patients with MS who have not used cannabis [–]. Investigators from these studies raised concerns regarding the use of cannabis in a patient group with cognitive challenges prior to cannabis use. Evidence for efficacy in other neurological conditions relies heavily on testimonials and anecdotes []. Animal models demonstrate the antiepileptic potential of cannabis [, ], and suggest that CBD may enhance the efficacy in preclinical models of epilepsy []. Nevertheless, there have been few controlled trials. One systematic review found that short-term daily cannabis use is safe in individuals with epilepsy, but there is currently insufficient evidence to form a conclusion about efficacy [, ]. Similarly, preclinical models Alzheimer’s disease, PD, and HD are mechanistically promising [, , ]. CBR expression correlates with levels of β-amyloid-42 and plaque density []. Furthermore, cannabinoids may inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation and prevent β-amyloid aggregation [, ], suggesting therapeutic potential in models of Alzheimer’s disease. Similarly, the presence of striatal cannabinoid receptors on GABA terminals demonstrates a mechanism in which cannabinoids could improve dyskinesia by improving GABA transmission in the globus pallidus in patients with PD []. Finally, animal models of HD using cannabinoids as treatment demonstrate preservation of striatal neurons []. However, despite the success of these preclinical animal models, evidence from human studies remains scant []. Research on the therapeutic benefits of exogenous cannabinoids on psychological conditions is equally sparse. Early clinical trials have demonstrated that high-dose oral CBD may have an anxiolytic effect, possibly through 5-HT agonism [, ]. In patients with schizophrenia elevated anadamide levels are negatively correlated with psychotic symptomology, which suggests a protective role []. In spite of this, the benefits of CBD monotherapy are not consistently demonstrated in individuals with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [, , ]. There is some evidence that cannabis may have a beneficial impact on sleep quality among individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder [, ]. However, more research is needed to confirm and further explore the therapeutic effects of cannabis or synthetic cannabinoids on psychological conditions. Some of the first conditions medicinal cannabis was approved for include glaucoma, chronic pain, and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer treatments and AIDS. There is good evidence that exogenous cannabinoids can decrease intraocular pressure in individuals with glaucoma [, ]. However, in order to have a clinically significant impact the dose and frequency of use needs to be extremely high, which may increase the likelihood of negative side effects []. Medicinal cannabis has also been used to treat chronic neuropathic pain, particularly when conventional methods do not work. Current research suggests that cannabinoids, including oral cannabis, THC, and nabiximols, provide effective analgesia [, , , –]. There is also some evidence that cannabinoids may be safe and moderately effective in the treatment of pain associated with fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis [, , ]. Treatment with medicinal cannabis has resulted in decreased need for antiemetic in individuals undergoing chemotherapy [, , , , ]. Additionally, while medicinal cannabinoids (e.g., nabilone, dronabinol, and levonantradol) are not significantly better at treating nausea or vomiting than conventional medications, patients receiving chemotherapy often prefer them [, , , ]. Although there is evidence for the therapeutic potential of exogenous cannabinoids in the treatment of a number of conditions there is still serious trepidation regarding the potential negative side effects. A large systematic review of the adverse events associated with the use of medical cannabis demonstrated that short-term use of existing medical cannabinoids increases the risk of nonserious adverse events including mild-to-moderate sedation, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, and poor attention []. The rates of serious adverse events (e.g., relapse of MS, vomiting, and urinary tract infections) were not different from controls []. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of medical cannabis. Perceptions and policy regarding cannabis have vacillated widely over the years, reflecting the relative temporal valence of scientific evidence compared with public opinion at a given point in time. For example, California legalized medical cannabis in 1996, despite the federal ban []. Shortly thereafter, the Institute of Medicine issued a report acknowledging the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis, but calling for more research. More recently, the pace and quality of research has been limited by stagnant policy. Cannabis was and still is categorized as a Schedule I drug, which means it is identified as potentially addictive without any medical benefit. As a Schedule I drug, the process for conducting research is extremely complicated. Researchers must have a Drug Enforcement Agency Schedule I license, approval from their institution, and funding. Obtaining all 3 is extremely challenging and has been a limiting factor in the advancement of current cannabis research. In lieu of the ability to conduct randomized controlled trials, many researchers must instead focus their efforts on retrospective cohort studies, case reports, and observational studies. There has been significant debate over the merits of re-classifying cannabis as a Schedule II drug, as it would greatly increase research accessibility and consequently methodological quality []. Ironically, the limited clinical research coupled with divisive public opinion and perception hinders the reclassification. In addition to reclassification, research regarding cannabis safety and efficacy is affected by a lack of standardization. Current clinical research findings are constrained by inconsistency in definitions of what constitutes a standard dose and how to quantify and standardize methods of administration []. Additionally, a great deal of the research relies on subjective, patient report, and patient-driven symptoms rating scales []. Ultimately, the federal policies remain stagnant because the process is circular; the clinical research methods and standardization are limited by the current policy, but the current policy is difficult to change because the lack of research standardization produces mixed findings. Despite the stagnant federal policy, public perspective and perceived risk has demonstrated a noticeable shift. According to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the USA with a national prevalence of cannabis use in the past month at 7 % []. Similarly, the Monitoring the Future Study has documented increased rates of use and decreased perceived risk between 2002 and 2012 among high-school students [, ]. This is further evidenced by the fact that 62 % of recent cannabis initiates were 18 years of age or younger when they first used []. The epidemiological evidence on use and perceived risk demonstrates a relatively clear trend in public opinion that is reflected in state but not federal policy. Despite a federal ban and limitations in the quality of evidence surrounding the potential risks associated with cannabis use, medical cannabis is currently legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia, and recreational cannabis is legal in 4 states [, ]. Currently, there is state-by-state variation in the way medical cannabis legislation is designed and implemented. Specifically, there is inconsistency in the way in which states regulate patient use and access, caregiver rights, the role of dispensaries, and product safety and packaging requirements []. First and foremost, states can choose to enact medical cannabis legislation by 1 of 2 mechanisms, either through the introduction of statutory provisions or through the creation of an amendment to the state’s constitution. The majority of states with medical cannabis laws have opted to enact statutory provisions, in part because the process is easier, though also less stable. The next aspect of legislative design is determining who qualifies for medical use and how they obtain permission. Because physicians are subject to sanctions from the federal government, they cannot prescribe cannabis but rather must recommend use. The contexts for which a recommendation can be given vary. Some states require diagnosis of a medical condition in addition to a physician recommendation, whereas others simply require a physician recommendation []. After obtaining a physician recommendation there are 2 approaches an individual can follow to procure medical cannabis: home cultivation or from an approved dispensary. Currently, 15 out of 24 jurisdictions allow home cultivation; however, the circumstances under which home cultivation is permissible and the defined quantity allowed in circulation varies by jurisdiction (Table ) []. Similarly, 19 out of 24 states allow dispensaries or compassionate care centers to engage in some combination of dispensing activities, including acquisition, possession, cultivation, manufacturing, delivery, transfer, selling, supplying, and dispensing of cannabis [, ]. Finally, there is variation in legal protections afforded to physicians, caregivers, and patients who may be involved in recommending, acquiring, or using medical cannabis. There are 2 types of protections: legal privilege that prevents the state from bringing criminal chargers, and affirmative defense that allows the individual to prevail against the criminal charges. Currently, legal protections for patients and caregivers differ from those for recommending physicians. Namely, the protections prevent the state from bringing charges against the physicians, whereas patients and caregivers may be tried but have affirmative defense that excuses criminal culpability []. While policy should be supported by the scientific evidence, the ability to generate quality evidence thus far has been hindered by federal policy. This has resulted in a piecemeal state-based system without the ability to fully assess or implement safeguards []. As legalization of medical and recreational cannabis at the state level becomes more prevalent, jurisdictions are making an effort to implement safeguards, including safety testing, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, media advertisement restrictions, and distribution site features. However, of the 24 jurisdictions that have legal medical or recreational cannabis law, only 15 have product testing and regulation requirements, and only 8 have mandatory testing []. Therefore, while public perspective trends suggest continued state-based legislative change, the lack of federal regulation and infrastructure poses serious safety concerns. The literature on medical and recreational cannabis suggests clear discordance between current federal and state policies, public opinion, and the scientific evidence. Moreover, this discordance appears to hinder the implementation of both high quality research and adequate safeguards. The scientific evidence is often inconclusive and burdened by methodological inconsistency. The classification of cannabis as a Schedule I drug limits the type and quality of research, forcing assessments of safety and efficacy to rely on observational studies. Furthermore, definitions of standard dose vary, as do means of administration, cannabinoid content, potency, and reason for use (recreational and medical). Despite the methodological challenges, the findings to date illustrate relatively clear acute cardiovascular, respiratory, cognitive, psychological, and public health effects associated with both recreational and medical cannabis use. However, the documented persistence of these acute effects is considerably more variable. Long-term cardiovascular and respiratory consequences of cannabis use are fairly well evidenced. However, the findings regarding long-term cognitive, psychological, and immune effects are less clear. Few studies have assessed the long-term impact of cannabis on the immune system, and questions remain regarding the relative impacts of THC and CBD on immunity. Likewise, among healthy adults there is mixed evidence for long-term cognitive and psychological impacts of heavy cannabis use after discontinuation and washout [, , –, ]. Some studies do report long-term deficits in learning and memory, but the findings are inconsistent [, , , , , ]. It appears that persistent cognitive diminishment and psychological impacts are closely related to early age of onset, increased duration, and frequency of use. Age of onset and frequency of use also have an impact substance abuse and dependency later on, with addiction rates of 16–17 % among individuals who initiate use as an adolescent and 25–50 % among individuals who use cannabis daily []. Collectively, these findings begin to depict vulnerable populations who may be negatively affected by the effects of by cannabis use, including adolescents, individuals with current or past substance use disorders, individuals with a personal or family history of mental illness, those that have compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, or immune systems, and those who are pregnant []. However, among the average adult user the health risks associated with cannabis use are likely no more dangerous than many other indulgences, including alcohol, nicotine, acetaminophen, fried foods, and downhill skiing [–]. This viewpoint is echoed in regard to medical cannabis as therapy. The side effects of conventional medications are weighted against the potential benefits, but this same logic is rarely applied to discussions of medical cannabis. This dilemma is further exacerbated by the fact that research on the therapeutic potential of cannabis relies on testimony and anecdote and is consequently heavily subjective. Given these findings one option for the future direction of research on cannabis is to approach cannabis as a legitimate therapeutic agent. This would include reclassification, as well as more stringent and uniform supervision of its use and distribution in a safe, ethically, and scientifically justified manner [–]. Such policies would allow for improved research and consequently a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of cannabis. In addition to rescheduling cannabis, further thought may be given to policy design. As state-based legalization becomes more common policymakers should consider how their policies affect production, price, and use. There is some evidence that legalization deflates production costs [, ], thereby potentially decreasing the market price. However, it has also been suggested that decreased cost may lead to increased use, particularly among adolescents []. As a result, policy makers ought to consider mechanisms to control cost. Taxes may be a useful tool to influence price and potentially adolescent use [, ]. Furthermore, revenue from those taxes can be utilized to promote prevention programs. Another mechanism to alter use includes limiting media promotion. Currently, only 6 jurisdictions have implemented policies restricting media advertising [], so there is limited evidence on efficacy, but evidence from similar policies in alcohol and tobacco prevention is promising. In conclusion, despite the general uncertainty on the safety and efficacy of medical and recreational cannabis use there are some general themes that remain consistent. There are clear acute cardiovascular, respiratory, cognitive, psychological, and public health effects of cannabis use. Additionally, persistent cardiovascular and respiratory consequences are fairly well documented in chronic users. The evidence of other long-term impacts of cannabis are mixed, and likely influenced by age of first use, duration of use, frequency of use, potency, and co-morbid conditions. Finally, there is evidence suggesting a therapeutic impact of cannabis on reducing spasticity associated with MS, chronic neuropathic pain, and nausea and vomiting in individuals undergoing chemotherapy. However, studies of patients with MS who used cannabis raise a cautionary note regarding further cognitive diminishment, which may affect clinical outcomes. Therapeutic potential in the treatment of other diseases is unclear and requires more research. Collectively, these findings support the continued therapeutic use of cannabis when conventional treatments are ineffective. However, when recommending medical cannabis, physicians and patients would benefit from discussions of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties associated with cannabis use. Furthermore, medical cannabis should be avoided in vulnerable populations, including individuals under the age of 25 years, individuals with current or past substance use disorders, individuals with a personal or family history of mental illness, those that have compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, or immune systems, and those who are pregnant. Finally, efforts to reclassify cannabis should continue and policy makers must consider impacts on production, price, and use when crafting legislation. UNODC. World Drug Report 2013.

91693732-5802-4202-865a-11aaca7d945a,"— — Nerves send and receive messages from every part of your body and process them in your brain. They allow you to: Many nerves are coated in myelin. Myelin is an insulating material. When it’s worn away or damaged, nerves can deteriorate, causing problems in the brain and throughout the body. Damage to myelin around nerves is called demyelination. Nerves are made up of neurons. Neurons are composed of: The axon sends messages from one neuron to the next. Axons also connect neurons to other cells, such as muscle cells. Some axons are extremely short, while others are 3 feet long. Axons are covered in myelin. Myelin protects the axons and helps carry axon messages as quickly as possible. Myelin is made of membrane layers that cover an axon. This is similar to the idea of an electrical wire with coating to protect the metal underneath. Myelin allows a nerve signal to travel faster. In unmyelinated neurons, a signal can travel along the nerves at about 1 meter per second. In a myelinated neuron, the signal can travel 100 meters per second. Certain medical conditions can damage myelin. Demyelination slows down messages sent along axons and causes the axon to deteriorate. Depending upon the location of the damage, axon loss can cause problems with: Inflammation is the most common cause of myelin damage. Other causes include: Demyelination prevents nerves from being able to conduct messages to and from the brain. The effects of demyelination can occur rapidly. In (GBS), myelin may only be under attack for a few hours before symptoms appear. Not everyone is affected by demyelinating conditions in the same way. However, some demyelinating symptoms are very common. Early symptoms — which are among the first signs of demyelination — include: Symptoms associated with the effect of demyelination on nerves Nerves are a key part of your body functions, so a wide range of symptoms can occur when nerves are affected by demyelination, including: Symptoms can come and go in chronic conditions, like (MS), and progress over years. There are different types of demyelination. These include inflammatory demyelination and viral demyelination. Inflammatory demyelination happens when the body’s immune system attacks myelin. Types of demyelination like MS, , and are caused by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. GBS involves inflammatory demyelination of peripheral nerves in other parts of the body. Viral demyelination occurs with (PML). PML is caused by the JC virus. Myelin damage can also occur with: Hypoxic-ischemic demyelination occurs due to vascular disease or a lack of oxygen in the brain. MS is the most common demyelinating condition. According to the , it affects 2.3 million people worldwide. In MS, demyelination occurs in the white matter of the brain and in the spinal cord. Lesions or “plaques” then form where myelin is under attack by the immune system. Many of these plaques, or scar tissue, occur throughout the brain over the course of years. There’s no cure for demyelinating conditions, but new myelin growth can occur in areas of damage. However, it’s often thinner and not as effective. Researchers are looking into ways to increase the body’s ability to grow new myelin. Most treatments for demyelinating conditions reduce the immune response. Treatment involves using drugs like interferon beta-1a or glatiramer acetate. People with low vitamin D levels more easily develop MS or other demyelinating conditions. High levels of vitamin D may reduce inflammatory immune responses. Demyelinating conditions, especially MS and optic neuritis, or inflammation of the optic nerve, are detectable with MRI scans. MRIs can show demyelination plaques in the brain and nerves, especially those caused by MS. Your healthcare provider may be able to locate plaques or lesions affecting your nervous system. Treatment can then be directed specifically at the source of demyelination in your body. The central nervous system (CNS) is able to produce its own cholesterol. Current show that if you take statins to reduce the cholesterol in your body, they’re not likely to affect your CNS cholesterol. Many have also found that statin treatment may protect against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in people who haven’t already experienced cognitive impairment and are still relatively young. have found that statins may slow the rate of cognitive decline and delay the onset of AD. Research continues, and we don’t have a definite answer yet. Some studies show that statins don’t affect the CNS or remyelination, and still others say they do. Currently, most of the evidence doesn’t show statin therapy to be harmful to remyelination within the CNS. Still, the effects of statins on cognitive function remain controversial at this time. Activating the immune system with a vaccine can trigger an autoimmune reaction. This tends to occur only in a few individuals with hypersensitive immune systems. Some children and adults experience “acute demyelinating syndromes” after exposure to certain vaccines, such as those for influenza or HPV. But there have only been , and it’s not certain that vaccines were the cause of the demyelination. Demyelinating conditions can seem painful and unmanageable at first. However, it’s still possible to live well with MS and other common conditions. There’s promising new research about the causes of demyelination and how to treat the biological sources of myelin deterioration. Treatments are also being improved for the management of pain caused by demyelination. Demyelinating conditions may not be curable. However, you can talk to your healthcare about medications and other treatments that may help you learn more about your condition. The more you know, the more you can do to address the symptoms, such as making lifestyle changes, to help you effectively manage the pain. — — Everything You Should Know About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM): What You Should Know Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Possible Ways to Improve Remyelination Multiple sclerosis is a chronic illness of the central nervous system.

228423aa-3b08-4adc-9bcd-c22940e16116,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). According to the CDC, vaccine-preventable childhood diseases in the United States are near an all-time low. But some viruses and bacteria are still around and can cause serious illness. It's important that all children, especially infants and young children, receive recommended immunizations on time. In other countries, many vaccine-preventable diseases are relatively common. Because of travel, these diseases could return to the U.S., resulting in increased, and unnecessary, illness, disability, and death among children. The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends that infants be fully immunized or vaccinated because recent studies have shown that infants who are vaccinated have a decreased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  Immunizations start at birth. The first immunization given is the hepatitis B vaccine. Listed below are some facts about hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV).  Potentially, there may not be any symptoms present when first infected; the likelihood of early symptoms decreases with the person's age. If present, yellow skin or eyes, tiredness, stomachache, loss of appetite, nausea, or joint pain may occur. The younger the person is when infected with HBV, the greater the likelihood of staying infected and having life-long liver problems, such as scarring of the liver and liver cancer. The disease can be spread from an infected pregnant mother to her baby, through contact with the blood of an infected person, or by having sex with an infected person. It can also be spread by sharing objects, such as toothbrushes or razors.  The HBV vaccine will prevent this disease. This vaccine is given to nearly all newborns. Additional doses are given before age 18 months. If newborns are exposed to HBV before, during, or after birth, both the vaccine and a special HBV immune globulin dose are given within 12 hours of birth. The CDC recommends that all babies complete the HBV vaccine series between age 6 months and 18 months to be fully protected against HBV infection. This full series gives long-term protection against HBV and booster shots are typically not needed in people who have a healthy immune system. ",59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,-13.238446235656738,153

Responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and cellular waste products throughout the body, the cardiovascular system is powered by the body’s hardest-working organ — the heart, which is only about the size of a closed fist. Even at rest, the average heart easily pumps over 5 liters of blood throughout the body every minute.

The is a muscular pumping organ located medial to the lungs along the body’s midline in the thoracic region. The bottom tip of the heart, known as its apex, is turned to the left, so that about 2/3 of the heart is located on the body’s left side with the other 1/3 on right. The top of the heart, known as the heart’s base, connects to the great blood vessels of the body: the , vena cava, pulmonary trunk, and pulmonary veins. There are 2 primary circulatory loops in the human body: the and the . Pulmonary circulation transports deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the , where the blood picks up oxygen and returns to the left side of the heart. The pumping chambers of the heart that support the pulmonary circulation loop are the right atrium and right ventricle. Systemic circulation carries highly oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to all of the tissues of the body (with the exception of the heart and lungs). Systemic circulation removes wastes from body tissues and returns deoxygenated blood to the right side of the heart. The left atrium and left ventricle of the heart are the pumping chambers for the systemic circulation loop. Blood vessels are the body’s highways that allow blood to flow quickly and efficiently from the heart to every region of the body and back again. The size of blood vessels corresponds with the amount of blood that passes through the vessel. All blood vessels contain a hollow area called the lumen through which blood is able to flow. Around the lumen is the wall of the vessel, which may be thin in the case of capillaries or very thick in the case of arteries. All are lined with a thin layer of simple squamous epithelium known as the endothelium that keeps blood cells inside of the blood vessels and prevents clots from forming. The endothelium lines the entire circulatory system, all the way to the interior of the heart, where it is called the endocardium. There are three major types of blood vessels: arteries, capillaries and veins. Blood vessels are often named after either the region of the body through which they carry blood or for nearby structures. For example, the carries blood into the brachial (arm) and cephalic (head) regions. One of its branches, the subclavian artery, runs under the clavicle; hence the name subclavian. The subclavian artery runs into the axillary region where it becomes known as the axillary artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. Blood carried by arteries is usually highly oxygenated, having just left the lungs on its way to the body’s tissues. The pulmonary trunk and arteries of the pulmonary circulation loop provide an exception to this rule — these arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated. Arteries face high levels of blood pressure as they carry blood being pushed from the heart under great force. To withstand this pressure, the walls of the arteries are thicker, more elastic, and more muscular than those of other vessels. The largest arteries of the body contain a high percentage of elastic tissue that allows them to stretch and accommodate the pressure of the heart. Smaller arteries are more muscular in the structure of their walls. The smooth muscles of the arterial walls of these smaller arteries contract or expand to regulate the flow of blood through their lumen. In this way, the body controls how much blood flows to different parts of the body under varying circumstances. The regulation of blood flow also affects blood pressure, as smaller arteries give blood less area to flow through and therefore increases the pressure of the blood on arterial walls. Arterioles are narrower arteries that branch off from the ends of arteries and carry blood to capillaries. They face much lower blood pressures than arteries due to their greater number, decreased blood volume, and distance from the direct pressure of the heart. Thus arteriole walls are much thinner than those of arteries. Arterioles, like arteries, are able to use smooth muscle to control their aperture and regulate blood flow and blood pressure. Capillaries are the smallest and thinnest of the blood vessels in the body and also the most common. They can be found running throughout almost every tissue of the body and border the edges of the body’s avascular tissues. connect to arterioles on one end and venules on the other. Capillaries carry blood very close to the cells of the tissues of the body in order to exchange gases, nutrients, and waste products. The walls of capillaries consist of only a thin layer of endothelium so that there is the minimum amount of structure possible between the blood and the tissues. The endothelium acts as a filter to keep blood cells inside of the vessels while allowing liquids, dissolved gases, and other chemicals to diffuse along their concentration gradients into or out of tissues. Precapillary sphincters are bands of smooth muscle found at the arteriole ends of capillaries. These sphincters regulate blood flow into the capillaries. Since there is a limited supply of blood, and not all tissues have the same energy and oxygen requirements, the precapillary sphincters reduce blood flow to inactive tissues and allow free flow into active tissues. Veins are the large return vessels of the body and act as the blood return counterparts of arteries. Because the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries absorb most of the force of the heart’s contractions, veins and venules are subjected to very low blood pressures. This lack of pressure allows the walls of veins to be much thinner, less elastic, and less muscular than the walls of arteries. Veins rely on gravity, inertia, and the force of skeletal muscle contractions to help push blood back to the heart. To facilitate the movement of blood, some veins contain many one-way valves that prevent blood from flowing away from the heart. As skeletal muscles in the body contract, they squeeze nearby veins and push blood through valves closer to the heart. When the muscle relaxes, the valve traps the blood until another contraction pushes the blood closer to the heart. Venules are similar to arterioles as they are small vessels that connect capillaries, but unlike arterioles, venules connect to veins instead of arteries. Venules pick up blood from many capillaries and deposit it into larger veins for transport back to the heart. The heart has its own set of blood vessels that provide the myocardium with the oxygen and nutrients necessary to pump blood throughout the body. The left and right coronary arteries branch off from the aorta and provide blood to the left and right sides of the heart. The coronary sinus is a vein on the posterior side of the heart that returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the vena cava. The veins of the stomach and intestines perform a unique function: instead of carrying blood directly back to the heart, they carry through the . Blood leaving the digestive organs is rich in nutrients and other chemicals absorbed from food. The removes toxins, stores sugars, and processes the products of digestion before they reach the other body tissues. Blood from the liver then returns to the heart through the inferior vena cava. The average human body contains about 4 to 5 liters of blood. As a liquid connective tissue, it transports many substances through the body and helps to maintain homeostasis of nutrients, wastes, and gases. Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and liquid plasma. Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, are by far the most common type of blood cell and make up about 45% of blood volume. Erythrocytes are produced inside of from stem cells at the astonishing rate of about 2 million cells every second. The shape of erythrocytes is biconcave—disks with a concave curve on both sides of the disk so that the center of an erythrocyte is its thinnest part. The unique shape of erythrocytes gives these cells a high surface area to volume ratio and allows them to fold to fit into thin capillaries. Immature erythrocytes have a nucleus that is ejected from the cell when it reaches maturity to provide it with its unique shape and flexibility. The lack of a nucleus means that red blood cells contain no DNA and are not able to repair themselves once damaged. Erythrocytes transport oxygen in the blood through the red pigment hemoglobin. Hemoglobin contains iron and proteins joined to greatly increase the oxygen carrying capacity of erythrocytes. The high surface area to volume ratio of erythrocytes allows oxygen to be easily transferred into the cell in the lungs and out of the cell in the capillaries of the systemic tissues. White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, make up a very small percentage of the total number of cells in the bloodstream, but have important functions in the body’s . There are two major classes of white blood cells: granular leukocytes and agranular leukocytes. Granular Leukocytes: The three types of granular leukocytes are neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Each type of granular leukocyte is classified by the presence of chemical-filled vesicles in their cytoplasm that give them their function. Neutrophils contain digestive enzymes that neutralize bacteria that invade the body. Eosinophils contain digestive enzymes specialized for digesting viruses that have been bound to by antibodies in the blood. Basophils release histamine to intensify allergic reactions and help protect the body from parasites. Agranular Leukocytes: The two major classes of agranular leukocytes are lymphocytes and monocytes. Lymphocytes include T cells and natural killer cells that fight off viral infections and B cells that produce antibodies against infections by pathogens. Monocytes develop into cells called macrophages that engulf and ingest pathogens and the dead cells from wounds or infections. Also known as thrombocytes, platelets are small cell fragments responsible for the clotting of blood and the formation of scabs. Platelets form in the red bone marrow from large megakaryocyte cells that periodically rupture and release thousands of pieces of membrane that become the platelets. Platelets do not contain a nucleus and only survive in the body for up to a week before macrophages capture and digest them. Plasma is the non-cellular or liquid portion of the blood that makes up about 55% of the blood’s volume. Plasma is a mixture of water, proteins, and dissolved substances. Around 90% of plasma is made of , although the exact percentage varies depending upon the hydration levels of the individual. The within plasma include antibodies and albumins. Antibodies are part of the immune system and bind to antigens on the surface of pathogens that infect the body. Albumins help maintain the body’s osmotic balance by providing an isotonic solution for the cells of the body. Many different substances can be found dissolved in the plasma, including glucose, oxygen, carbon dioxide, electrolytes, nutrients, and cellular waste products. The plasma functions as a transportation medium for these substances as they move throughout the body. The cardiovascular system has three major functions: transportation of materials, protection from pathogens, and regulation of the body’s homeostasis. : The cardiovascular system transports blood to almost all of the body’s tissues. The blood delivers essential nutrients and oxygen and removes wastes and carbon dioxide to be processed or removed from the body. Hormones are transported throughout the body via the blood’s liquid plasma. : The cardiovascular system protects the body through its white blood cells. White blood cells clean up cellular debris and fight pathogens that have entered the body. Platelets and red blood cells form scabs to seal wounds and prevent pathogens from entering the body and liquids from leaking out. Blood also carries antibodies that provide specific immunity to pathogens that the body has previously been exposed to or has been vaccinated against. : The cardiovascular system is instrumental in the body’s ability to maintain homeostatic control of several internal conditions. Blood vessels help maintain a stable body temperature by controlling the blood flow to the surface of the . Blood vessels near the skin’s surface open during times of overheating to allow hot blood to dump its heat into the body’s surroundings. In the case of hypothermia, these blood vessels constrict to keep blood flowing only to vital organs in the body’s core. Blood also helps balance the body’s pH due to the presence of bicarbonate ions, which act as a buffer solution. Finally, the albumins in blood plasma help to balance the osmotic concentration of the body’s cells by maintaining an isotonic environment. Many serious conditions and diseases can cause our cardiovascular system to stop working properly. Quite often, we don’t do enough about them proactively, resulting in emergencies. Browse our content to learn more about . Also, explore how can allow you to begin important conversations with your doctor about genetic risks for disorders involving clotting, hemophilia, hemochromatosis (a common hereditary disorder causing iron to accumulate in the heart) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (which affects about 1 in 10 African American men). The heart is a four-chambered “double pump,” where each side (left and right) operates as a separate pump. The left and right sides of the heart are separated by a muscular wall of tissue known as the septum of the heart. The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the systemic veins and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. The left side of the heart receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it through the systemic arteries to the tissues of the body. Each heartbeat results in the simultaneous pumping of both sides of the heart, making the heart a very efficient pump. Several functions of the cardiovascular system can control blood pressure. Certain hormones along with autonomic nerve signals from the brain affect the rate and strength of heart contractions. Greater contractile force and heart rate lead to an increase in blood pressure. Blood vessels can also affect blood pressure. Vasoconstriction decreases the diameter of an artery by contracting the smooth muscle in the arterial wall. The sympathetic (fight or flight) division of the autonomic nervous system causes vasoconstriction, which leads to increases in blood pressure and decreases in blood flow in the constricted region. Vasodilation is the expansion of an artery as the smooth muscle in the arterial wall relaxes after the fight-or-flight response wears off or under the effect of certain hormones or chemicals in the blood. The volume of blood in the body also affects blood pressure. A higher volume of blood in the body raises blood pressure by increasing the amount of blood pumped by each heartbeat. Thicker, more viscous blood from clotting disorders can also raise blood pressure. Hemostasis, or the clotting of blood and formation of scabs, is managed by the platelets of the blood. Platelets normally remain inactive in the blood until they reach damaged tissue or leak out of the blood vessels through a wound. Once active, platelets change into a spiny ball shape and become very sticky in order to latch on to damaged tissues. Platelets next release chemical clotting factors and begin to produce the protein fibrin to act as structure for the blood clot. Platelets also begin sticking together to form a platelet plug. The platelet plug will serve as a temporary seal to keep blood in the vessel and foreign material out of the vessel until the cells of the blood vessel can repair the damage to the vessel wall.

The lymphatic tissue of these organs filters and cleans the lymph of any debris, abnormal cells, or pathogens. The lymphatic system also transports fatty acids from the to the circulatory system. Red bone marrow is a highly vascular tissue found in the spaces between . It is mostly found in the ends of long bones and in the flat bones of the body. is a hematopoietic tissue containing many stem cells that produce blood cells. All of the leukocytes, or white blood cells, of the immune system are produced by red bone marrow. Leukocytes can be further broken down into 2 groups based upon the type of stem cells that produces them: myeloid stem cells and lymphoid stem cells.   Myeloid stem cells produce monocytes and the granular leukocytes—eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils.   are agranular leukocytes that can form 2 types of cells: macrophages and dendritic cells. . Monocytes respond slowly to infection and once present at the site of infection, develop into macrophages. Macrophages are phagocytes able to consume pathogens, destroyed cells, and debris by phagocytosis. As such, they have a role in both preventing infection as well as cleaning up the aftermath of an infection. . Monocytes also develop into dendritic cells in healthy tissues of the skin and mucous membranes. Dendritic cells are responsible for the detection of pathogenic antigens which are used to activate T cells and B cells. . Eosinophils are granular leukocytes that reduce allergic inflammation and help the body fight off parasites. . Basophils are granular leukocytes that trigger inflammation by releasing the chemicals heparin and histamine. Basophils are active in producing inflammation during allergic reactions and parasitic infections. . Neutrophils are granular leukocytes that act as the first responders to the site of an infection. Neutrophils use chemotaxis to detect chemicals produced by infectious agents and quickly move to the site of infection. Once there, neutrophils ingest the pathogens via phagocytosis and release chemicals to trap and kill the pathogens. Lymphoid stem cells produce T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. . T lymphocytes, also commonly known as T cells, are cells involved in fighting specific pathogens in the body. T cells may act as helpers of other immune cells or attack pathogens directly. After an infection, memory T cells persist in the body to provide a faster reaction to subsequent infection by pathogens expressing the same antigen. . B lymphocytes, also commonly known as B cells, are also cells involved in fighting specific pathogens in the body. Once B cells have been activated by contact with a pathogen, they form plasma cells that produce antibodies. Antibodies then neutralize the pathogens until other immune cells can destroy them. After an infection, memory B cells persist in the body to quickly produce antibodies to subsequent infection by pathogens expressing the same antigen. . Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells, are lymphocytes that are able to respond to a wide range of pathogens and cancerous cells. NK cells travel within the blood and are found in the lymph nodes, spleen, and red bone marrow where they fight most types of infection. As blood passes through the tissues of the body, it enters thin-walled capillaries to facilitate diffusion of nutrients, gases, and wastes. Blood plasma also diffuses through the thin capillary walls and penetrates into the spaces between the cells of the tissues. Some of this plasma diffuses back into the blood of the capillaries, but a considerable portion becomes embedded in the tissues as interstitial fluid. To prevent the accumulation of excess fluids, small dead-end vessels called lymphatic capillaries extend into the tissues to absorb fluids and return them to circulation. The interstitial fluid picked up by lymphatic capillaries is known as lymph. Lymph very closely resembles the plasma found in the veins: it is a mixture of about 90% water and 10% solutes such as proteins, cellular waste products, dissolved gases, and hormones. Lymph may also contain bacterial cells that are picked up from diseased tissues and the white blood cells that fight these pathogens. In late-stage cancer patients, lymph often contains cancerous cells that have metastasized from tumors and may form new tumors within the lymphatic system. A special type of lymph, known as chyle, is produced in the as lymph absorbs triglycerides from the intestinal villi. Due to the presence of triglycerides, chyle has a milky white coloration to it. Lymphatic capillaries merge together into larger lymphatic vessels to carry lymph through the body. The structure of lymphatic vessels closely resembles that of veins: they both have thin walls and many check valves due to their shared function of carrying fluids under low pressure. Lymph is transported through lymphatic vessels by the skeletal muscle pump—contractions of skeletal muscles constrict the vessels to push the fluid forward. Check valves prevent the fluid from flowing back toward the lymphatic capillaries. Lymph nodes are small, kidney-shaped organs of the lymphatic system. There are several hundred lymph nodes found mostly throughout the of the body with the highest concentrations in the axillary (armpit) and inguinal (groin) regions. The outside of each lymph node is made of a dense fibrous connective tissue capsule. Inside the capsule, the lymph node is filled with reticular tissue containing many lymphocytes and macrophages. The lymph nodes function as filters of lymph that enters from several afferent lymph vessels. The reticular fibers of the lymph node act as a net to catch any debris or cells that are present in the lymph. Macrophages and lymphocytes attack and kill any microbes caught in the reticular fibers. Efferent lymph vessels then carry the filtered lymph out of the lymph node and towards the lymphatic ducts. All of the lymphatic vessels of the body carry lymph toward the 2 lymphatic ducts: the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic ducts. These ducts serve to return lymph back to the venous blood supply so that it can be circulated as plasma. . The connects the , abdomen, left arm, and the left side of the head, neck, and thorax to the . . The connects the and the right side of the head, neck, and thorax to the . Outside of the system of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes, there are masses of non-encapsulated lymphatic tissue known as lymphatic nodules. The lymphatic nodules are associated with the mucous membranes of the body, where they work to protect the body from pathogens entering the body through open body cavities. . There are 5 tonsils in the body—2 lingual, 2 palatine, and 1 pharyngeal. The lingual tonsils are located at the posterior root of the tongue near the pharynx. The are in the posterior region of the mouth near the pharynx. The pharyngeal pharynx, also known as the , is found in the at the posterior end of the nasal cavity. The tonsils contain many T and B cells to protect the body from inhaled or ingested substances. The tonsils often become inflamed in response to an infection. . are small masses of lymphatic tissue found in the ileum of the . Peyer’s patches contain T and B cells that monitor the contents of the intestinal lumen for pathogens. Once the antigens of a pathogen are detected, the T and B cells spread and prepare the body to fight a possible infection. . The is a flattened, oval-shaped organ located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen lateral to the stomach. The spleen is made up of a dense fibrous connective tissue capsule filled with regions known as red and white pulp. Red pulp, which makes up most of the spleen’s mass, is so named because it contains many sinuses that filter the blood. Red pulp contains reticular tissues whose fibers filter worn out or damaged red blood cells from the blood. Macrophages in the red pulp digest and recycle the hemoglobin of the captured red blood cells. The red pulp also stores many platelets to be released in response to blood loss. White pulp is found within the red pulp surrounding the arterioles of the spleen. It is made of lymphatic tissue and contains many T cells, B cells, and macrophages to fight off infections. . The is a small, triangular organ found just posterior to the sternum and anterior to the heart. The thymus is mostly made of glandular epithelium and hematopoietic connective tissues. The thymus produces and trains T cells during fetal development and childhood. T cells formed in the thymus and red bone marrow mature, develop, and reproduce in the thymus throughout childhood. The vast majority of T cells do not survive their training in the thymus and are destroyed by macrophages. The surviving T cells spread throughout the body to the other lymphatic tissues to fight infections. By the time a person reaches puberty, the immune system is mature and the role of the thymus is diminished. After puberty, the inactive thymus is slowly replaced by adipose tissue. One of the primary functions of the lymphatic system is the movement of interstitial fluid from the tissues to the circulatory system. Like the veins of the circulatory system, lymphatic capillaries and vessels move lymph with very little pressure to help with circulation. To help move lymph towards the lymphatic ducts, there is a series of many one-way check valves found throughout the lymphatic vessels. These check valves allow lymph to move toward the lymphatic ducts and close when lymph attempts to flow away from the ducts. In the limbs, skeletal muscle contraction squeezes the walls of lymphatic vessels to push lymph through the valves and towards the thorax. In the trunk, the diaphragm pushes down into the abdomen during inhalation. This increased abdominal pressure pushes lymph into the less pressurized thorax. The pressure gradient reverses during exhalation, but the check valves prevent lymph from being pushed backwards. Another major function of the lymphatic system is the transportation of fatty acids from the digestive system. The digestive system breaks large macromolecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids into smaller nutrients that can be absorbed through the villi of the intestinal wall. Most of these nutrients are absorbed directly into the bloodstream, but most fatty acids, the building blocks of fats, are absorbed through the lymphatic system. In the villi of the small intestine are lymphatic capillaries called lacteals. Lacteals are able to absorb fatty acids from the intestinal epithelium and transport them along with lymph. The fatty acids turn the lymph into a white, milky substance called chyle. Chyle is transported through lymphatic vessels to the thoracic duct where it enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver to be metabolized. The body employs many different types of immunity to protect itself from infection from a seemingly endless supply of pathogens. These defenses may be external and prevent pathogens from entering the body. Conversely, internal defenses fight pathogens that have already entered the body. Among the internal defenses, some are specific to only one pathogen or may be innate and defend against many pathogens. Some of these specific defenses can be acquired to preemptively prevent an infection before a pathogen enters the body. The body has many innate ways to defend itself against a broad spectrum of pathogens. These defenses may be external or internal defenses. The coverings and linings of the body constantly prevent infections before they begin by barring pathogens from entering the body. Epidermal cells are constantly growing, dying, and shedding to provide a renewed physical barrier to pathogens. Secretions like sebum, cerumen, mucus, tears, and saliva are used to trap, move, and sometimes even kill bacteria that settle on or in the body. Stomach acid acts as a chemical barrier to kill microbes found on food entering the body. Urine and acidic vaginal secretions also help to kill and remove pathogens that attempt to enter the body. The flora of naturally occurring beneficial bacteria that live on and in our bodies provide a layer of protection from harmful microbes that would seek to colonize our bodies for themselves. include fever, inflammation, natural killer cells, and phagocytes. Let’s explore internal defenses in greater detail. In response to an infection, the body may start a fever by raising its internal temperature out of its normal homeostatic range. Fevers help to speed up the body’s response system to an infection while at the same time slowing the reproduction of the pathogen. The body may also start an inflammation in a region of the body to stop the spread of the infection. Inflammations are the result of a localized vasodilation that allows extra blood to flow into the infected region. The extra blood flow speeds the arrival of leukocytes to fight the infection. The enlarged blood vessel allows fluid and cells to leak out of the blood vessel to cause swelling and the movement of leukocytes into the tissue to fight the infection. Natural killer (NK) cells are special lymphocytes that are able to recognize and kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells. NK cells check the surface markers on the surface of the body’s cells, looking for cells that are lacking the correct number of markers due to disease. The NK cells then kill these cells before they can spread infection or cancer. The term means “eating cell” and refers to a group of cell types including neutrophils and macrophages. A phagocyte engulfs pathogens with its cell membrane before using digestive enzymes to kill and dissolve the cell into its chemical parts. Phagocytes are able to recognize and consume many different types of cells, including dead or damaged body cells. When a pathogen infects the body, it often encounters macrophages and dendritic cells of the innate immune system. These cells can become antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by consuming and processing pathogenic antigens. The APCs travel into the lymphatic system carrying these antigens to be presented to the T cells and B cells of the specific immune system. Inactive T cells are found in lymphatic tissue awaiting infection by a pathogen. Certain T cells have antigen receptors that recognize the pathogen but do not reproduce until they are triggered by an APC. The activated T cell begins reproducing very quickly to form an army of active T cells that spread through the body and fight the pathogen. Cytotoxic T cells directly attach to and kill pathogens and virus-infected cells using powerful toxins. Helper T cells assist in the immune response by stimulating the response of B cells and macrophages. After an infection has been fought off, memory T cells remain in the lymphatic tissue waiting for a new infection by cells presenting the same antigen. The response by memory T cells to the antigen is much faster than that of the inactive T cells that fought the first infection. The increase in T cell reaction speed leads to immunity—the reintroduction of the same pathogen is fought off so quickly that there are few or no symptoms. This immunity may last for years or even an entire lifetime. During an infection, the APCs that travel to the lymphatic system to stimulate T cells also stimulate B cells. B cells are lymphocytes that are found in lymphatic tissues of the body that produce antibodies to fight pathogens (instead of traveling through the body themselves). Once a B cell has been contacted by an APC, it processes the antigen to produce an MHC-antigen complex. Helper T cells present in the lymphatic system bind to the MHC-antigen complex to stimulate the B cell to become active. The active B cell begins to reproduce and produce 2 types of cells: plasma cells and memory B cells. become antibody factories producing thousands of antibodies. reside in the lymphatic system where they help to provide immunity by preparing for later infection by the same antigen-presenting pathogen. Antibodies are proteins that are specific to and bind to a particular antigen on a cell or virus. Once antibodies have latched on to a cell or virus, they make it harder for their target to move, reproduce, and infect cells. Antibodies also make it easier and more appealing for phagocytes to consume the pathogen. Under most circumstances, immunity is developed throughout a lifetime by the accumulation of memory T and B cells after an infection. There are a few ways that immunity can be acquired without exposure to a pathogen. Immunization is the process of introducing antigens from a virus or bacterium to the body so that memory T and B cells are produced to prevent an actual infection. Most immunizations involve the injection of bacteria or viruses that have been inactivated or weakened. Newborn infants can also acquire some temporary immunity from infection thanks to antibodies that are passed on from their mother. Some antibodies are able to cross the placenta from the mother’s blood and enter the infant’s bloodstream. Other antibodies are passed through breast milk to protect the infant.

Biodiversity-Species Diversity (vs. Abundance)-Genetic Diversity-Ecosystem DiversityKeystone Species Species Diversity - Species diversity is the effective number of different species that are represented in a collection of individuals (a dataset). The effective number of species refers to the number of equally abundant species needed to obtain the same mean proportional species abundance as that observed in the data set of interest (where all species may not be equally abundant). Genetic Diversity - Genetic diversity, the level of biodiversity, refers to the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species. It is distinguished from genetic variability, which describes the tendency of genetic characteristics to vary. Ecosystem Diversity - Ecosystem diversity refers to the diversity of a place at the level of ecosystems. The term differs from biodiversity, which refers to variation in species rather than ecosystems. Ecosystem diversity can also refer to the variety of ecosystems present in a biosphere, the variety of species and ecological processes that occur in different physical settings. Keystone Species - A species whose presence and role within an ecosystem has a disproportionate effect on other organisms within the system. A keystone species is often a dominant predator whose removal allows a prey population to explode and often decreases overall diversity. Other kinds of keystone species are those, such as coral or beavers, that significantly alter the habitat around them and thus affect large numbers of other organisms. Feedback Loops-Positive (Labor/ethylene)-NegativeCell Communication Feedback loops - the path by which some of the output of a circuit, system, or device is returned to the input. Positive feedback loops - Positive feedback is a process in which the effects of a small disturbance on a system include an increase in the magnitude of the perturbation Negative feedback loops - Negative feedback occurs when the result of a process influences the operation of the process itself in such a way as to reduce changes. Negative feedback tends to make a system self-regulating; it can produce stability and reduce the effect of fluctuations. Negative feedback loops in which just the right amount of correction is applied in the most timely manner can be very stable, accurate, and responsive. Cell Communication - Cell signalling is part of a complex system of communication that governs basic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions. The ability of cells to perceive and correctly respond to their microenvironment is the basis of development, tissue repair, and immunity as well as normal tissue homeostasis. Errors in cellular information processing are responsible for diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes. By understanding cell signaling, diseases may be treated effectively and, theoretically, artificial tissues may be created Environmental Response-Behavioral Hibernation Migration-Physciological Sweating Shivering Behavioral - Behavior or behaviour is the range of actions and mannerisms made by organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary. Hibernation - to spend the winter in close quarters in a dormant condition, as bears and certain other animals. Migration - the process or act of migrating.

Territorial - characterized by territoriality; defending an area against intruders, especially of the same species. Learned - acquired by experience, study Innate - originating in or arising from the intellect or the constitution of the mind, rather than learned through experience Nervous SystemCentral Nervous SystemPeripheral Nervous System entral Nervous System - the part of the nervous system comprising the brain and spinal cord. Peripheral Nervous System - The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the part of the nervous system that consists of the nerves and ganglia outside of the brain and spinal cord. The main function of the PNS is to connect the central nervous system (CNS) to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a communication relay going back and forth between the brain and the extremities.Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the bone of spine and skull, or by the blood-brain barrier, leaving it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system; some textbooks also include sensory systems Axon - the appendage of the neuron that transmits impulses away from the cell body.

7770bb82-7874-497b-8523-9bbf9ff7d4e5,"Explore Health Testing Home Health The immune and lymphatic systems are two closely related organ systems that share several organs and physiological functions. The immune system is our body’s defense system against infectious pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi as well as parasitic animals and protists. The immune system works to keep these harmful agents out of the body and attacks those that manage to enter. The lymphatic system is a system of capillaries, vessels, nodes and other organs that transport a fluid called lymph from the tissues as it returns to the bloodstream. The lymphatic tissue of these organs filters and cleans the lymph of any debris, abnormal cells, or pathogens.

The lymphatic system also transports fatty acids from the to the circulatory system. Red bone marrow is a highly vascular tissue found in the spaces between . It is mostly found in the ends of long bones and in the flat bones of the body. is a hematopoietic tissue containing many stem cells that produce blood cells. All of the leukocytes, or white blood cells, of the immune system are produced by red bone marrow. Leukocytes can be further broken down into 2 groups based upon the type of stem cells that produces them: myeloid stem cells and lymphoid stem cells.   Myeloid stem cells produce monocytes and the granular leukocytes—eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils.   are agranular leukocytes that can form 2 types of cells: macrophages and dendritic cells. . Monocytes respond slowly to infection and once present at the site of infection, develop into macrophages. Macrophages are phagocytes able to consume pathogens, destroyed cells, and debris by phagocytosis. As such, they have a role in both preventing infection as well as cleaning up the aftermath of an infection. . Monocytes also develop into dendritic cells in healthy tissues of the skin and mucous membranes. Dendritic cells are responsible for the detection of pathogenic antigens which are used to activate T cells and B cells. . Eosinophils are granular leukocytes that reduce allergic inflammation and help the body fight off parasites. . Basophils are granular leukocytes that trigger inflammation by releasing the chemicals heparin and histamine. Basophils are active in producing inflammation during allergic reactions and parasitic infections. . Neutrophils are granular leukocytes that act as the first responders to the site of an infection. Neutrophils use chemotaxis to detect chemicals produced by infectious agents and quickly move to the site of infection. Once there, neutrophils ingest the pathogens via phagocytosis and release chemicals to trap and kill the pathogens. Lymphoid stem cells produce T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. . T lymphocytes, also commonly known as T cells, are cells involved in fighting specific pathogens in the body. T cells may act as helpers of other immune cells or attack pathogens directly. After an infection, memory T cells persist in the body to provide a faster reaction to subsequent infection by pathogens expressing the same antigen. . B lymphocytes, also commonly known as B cells, are also cells involved in fighting specific pathogens in the body. Once B cells have been activated by contact with a pathogen, they form plasma cells that produce antibodies. Antibodies then neutralize the pathogens until other immune cells can destroy them. After an infection, memory B cells persist in the body to quickly produce antibodies to subsequent infection by pathogens expressing the same antigen. . Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells, are lymphocytes that are able to respond to a wide range of pathogens and cancerous cells. NK cells travel within the blood and are found in the lymph nodes, spleen, and red bone marrow where they fight most types of infection. As blood passes through the tissues of the body, it enters thin-walled capillaries to facilitate diffusion of nutrients, gases, and wastes. Blood plasma also diffuses through the thin capillary walls and penetrates into the spaces between the cells of the tissues. Some of this plasma diffuses back into the blood of the capillaries, but a considerable portion becomes embedded in the tissues as interstitial fluid. To prevent the accumulation of excess fluids, small dead-end vessels called lymphatic capillaries extend into the tissues to absorb fluids and return them to circulation. The interstitial fluid picked up by lymphatic capillaries is known as lymph. Lymph very closely resembles the plasma found in the veins: it is a mixture of about 90% water and 10% solutes such as proteins, cellular waste products, dissolved gases, and hormones. Lymph may also contain bacterial cells that are picked up from diseased tissues and the white blood cells that fight these pathogens. In late-stage cancer patients, lymph often contains cancerous cells that have metastasized from tumors and may form new tumors within the lymphatic system. A special type of lymph, known as chyle, is produced in the as lymph absorbs triglycerides from the intestinal villi. Due to the presence of triglycerides, chyle has a milky white coloration to it. Lymphatic capillaries merge together into larger lymphatic vessels to carry lymph through the body. The structure of lymphatic vessels closely resembles that of veins: they both have thin walls and many check valves due to their shared function of carrying fluids under low pressure. Lymph is transported through lymphatic vessels by the skeletal muscle pump—contractions of skeletal muscles constrict the vessels to push the fluid forward. Check valves prevent the fluid from flowing back toward the lymphatic capillaries. Lymph nodes are small, kidney-shaped organs of the lymphatic system. There are several hundred lymph nodes found mostly throughout the of the body with the highest concentrations in the axillary (armpit) and inguinal (groin) regions. The outside of each lymph node is made of a dense fibrous connective tissue capsule. Inside the capsule, the lymph node is filled with reticular tissue containing many lymphocytes and macrophages. The lymph nodes function as filters of lymph that enters from several afferent lymph vessels. The reticular fibers of the lymph node act as a net to catch any debris or cells that are present in the lymph. Macrophages and lymphocytes attack and kill any microbes caught in the reticular fibers. Efferent lymph vessels then carry the filtered lymph out of the lymph node and towards the lymphatic ducts. All of the lymphatic vessels of the body carry lymph toward the 2 lymphatic ducts: the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic ducts. These ducts serve to return lymph back to the venous blood supply so that it can be circulated as plasma. . The connects the , abdomen, left arm, and the left side of the head, neck, and thorax to the . . The connects the and the right side of the head, neck, and thorax to the . Outside of the system of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes, there are masses of non-encapsulated lymphatic tissue known as lymphatic nodules. The lymphatic nodules are associated with the mucous membranes of the body, where they work to protect the body from pathogens entering the body through open body cavities. . There are 5 tonsils in the body—2 lingual, 2 palatine, and 1 pharyngeal. The lingual tonsils are located at the posterior root of the tongue near the pharynx. The are in the posterior region of the mouth near the pharynx. The pharyngeal pharynx, also known as the , is found in the at the posterior end of the nasal cavity. The tonsils contain many T and B cells to protect the body from inhaled or ingested substances. The tonsils often become inflamed in response to an infection. . are small masses of lymphatic tissue found in the ileum of the . Peyer’s patches contain T and B cells that monitor the contents of the intestinal lumen for pathogens. Once the antigens of a pathogen are detected, the T and B cells spread and prepare the body to fight a possible infection. . The is a flattened, oval-shaped organ located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen lateral to the stomach. The spleen is made up of a dense fibrous connective tissue capsule filled with regions known as red and white pulp. Red pulp, which makes up most of the spleen’s mass, is so named because it contains many sinuses that filter the blood. Red pulp contains reticular tissues whose fibers filter worn out or damaged red blood cells from the blood. Macrophages in the red pulp digest and recycle the hemoglobin of the captured red blood cells. The red pulp also stores many platelets to be released in response to blood loss. White pulp is found within the red pulp surrounding the arterioles of the spleen. It is made of lymphatic tissue and contains many T cells, B cells, and macrophages to fight off infections. . The is a small, triangular organ found just posterior to the sternum and anterior to the heart. The thymus is mostly made of glandular epithelium and hematopoietic connective tissues. The thymus produces and trains T cells during fetal development and childhood. T cells formed in the thymus and red bone marrow mature, develop, and reproduce in the thymus throughout childhood. The vast majority of T cells do not survive their training in the thymus and are destroyed by macrophages. The surviving T cells spread throughout the body to the other lymphatic tissues to fight infections. By the time a person reaches puberty, the immune system is mature and the role of the thymus is diminished. After puberty, the inactive thymus is slowly replaced by adipose tissue. One of the primary functions of the lymphatic system is the movement of interstitial fluid from the tissues to the circulatory system. Like the veins of the circulatory system, lymphatic capillaries and vessels move lymph with very little pressure to help with circulation. To help move lymph towards the lymphatic ducts, there is a series of many one-way check valves found throughout the lymphatic vessels. These check valves allow lymph to move toward the lymphatic ducts and close when lymph attempts to flow away from the ducts. In the limbs, skeletal muscle contraction squeezes the walls of lymphatic vessels to push lymph through the valves and towards the thorax. In the trunk, the diaphragm pushes down into the abdomen during inhalation. This increased abdominal pressure pushes lymph into the less pressurized thorax. The pressure gradient reverses during exhalation, but the check valves prevent lymph from being pushed backwards. Another major function of the lymphatic system is the transportation of fatty acids from the digestive system. The digestive system breaks large macromolecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids into smaller nutrients that can be absorbed through the villi of the intestinal wall. Most of these nutrients are absorbed directly into the bloodstream, but most fatty acids, the building blocks of fats, are absorbed through the lymphatic system. In the villi of the small intestine are lymphatic capillaries called lacteals. Lacteals are able to absorb fatty acids from the intestinal epithelium and transport them along with lymph. The fatty acids turn the lymph into a white, milky substance called chyle. Chyle is transported through lymphatic vessels to the thoracic duct where it enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver to be metabolized. The body employs many different types of immunity to protect itself from infection from a seemingly endless supply of pathogens. These defenses may be external and prevent pathogens from entering the body. Conversely, internal defenses fight pathogens that have already entered the body. Among the internal defenses, some are specific to only one pathogen or may be innate and defend against many pathogens. Some of these specific defenses can be acquired to preemptively prevent an infection before a pathogen enters the body. The body has many innate ways to defend itself against a broad spectrum of pathogens. These defenses may be external or internal defenses. The coverings and linings of the body constantly prevent infections before they begin by barring pathogens from entering the body. Epidermal cells are constantly growing, dying, and shedding to provide a renewed physical barrier to pathogens. Secretions like sebum, cerumen, mucus, tears, and saliva are used to trap, move, and sometimes even kill bacteria that settle on or in the body. Stomach acid acts as a chemical barrier to kill microbes found on food entering the body. Urine and acidic vaginal secretions also help to kill and remove pathogens that attempt to enter the body. The flora of naturally occurring beneficial bacteria that live on and in our bodies provide a layer of protection from harmful microbes that would seek to colonize our bodies for themselves. include fever, inflammation, natural killer cells, and phagocytes. Let’s explore internal defenses in greater detail. In response to an infection, the body may start a fever by raising its internal temperature out of its normal homeostatic range. Fevers help to speed up the body’s response system to an infection while at the same time slowing the reproduction of the pathogen. The body may also start an inflammation in a region of the body to stop the spread of the infection. Inflammations are the result of a localized vasodilation that allows extra blood to flow into the infected region. The extra blood flow speeds the arrival of leukocytes to fight the infection. The enlarged blood vessel allows fluid and cells to leak out of the blood vessel to cause swelling and the movement of leukocytes into the tissue to fight the infection. Natural killer (NK) cells are special lymphocytes that are able to recognize and kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells. NK cells check the surface markers on the surface of the body’s cells, looking for cells that are lacking the correct number of markers due to disease. The NK cells then kill these cells before they can spread infection or cancer. The term means “eating cell” and refers to a group of cell types including neutrophils and macrophages. A phagocyte engulfs pathogens with its cell membrane before using digestive enzymes to kill and dissolve the cell into its chemical parts. Phagocytes are able to recognize and consume many different types of cells, including dead or damaged body cells. When a pathogen infects the body, it often encounters macrophages and dendritic cells of the innate immune system. These cells can become antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by consuming and processing pathogenic antigens. The APCs travel into the lymphatic system carrying these antigens to be presented to the T cells and B cells of the specific immune system. Inactive T cells are found in lymphatic tissue awaiting infection by a pathogen. Certain T cells have antigen receptors that recognize the pathogen but do not reproduce until they are triggered by an APC. The activated T cell begins reproducing very quickly to form an army of active T cells that spread through the body and fight the pathogen. Cytotoxic T cells directly attach to and kill pathogens and virus-infected cells using powerful toxins. Helper T cells assist in the immune response by stimulating the response of B cells and macrophages. After an infection has been fought off, memory T cells remain in the lymphatic tissue waiting for a new infection by cells presenting the same antigen. The response by memory T cells to the antigen is much faster than that of the inactive T cells that fought the first infection. The increase in T cell reaction speed leads to immunity—the reintroduction of the same pathogen is fought off so quickly that there are few or no symptoms. This immunity may last for years or even an entire lifetime. During an infection, the APCs that travel to the lymphatic system to stimulate T cells also stimulate B cells. B cells are lymphocytes that are found in lymphatic tissues of the body that produce antibodies to fight pathogens (instead of traveling through the body themselves). Once a B cell has been contacted by an APC, it processes the antigen to produce an MHC-antigen complex. Helper T cells present in the lymphatic system bind to the MHC-antigen complex to stimulate the B cell to become active. The active B cell begins to reproduce and produce 2 types of cells: plasma cells and memory B cells. become antibody factories producing thousands of antibodies. reside in the lymphatic system where they help to provide immunity by preparing for later infection by the same antigen-presenting pathogen. Antibodies are proteins that are specific to and bind to a particular antigen on a cell or virus. Once antibodies have latched on to a cell or virus, they make it harder for their target to move, reproduce, and infect cells. Antibodies also make it easier and more appealing for phagocytes to consume the pathogen. Under most circumstances, immunity is developed throughout a lifetime by the accumulation of memory T and B cells after an infection. There are a few ways that immunity can be acquired without exposure to a pathogen. Immunization is the process of introducing antigens from a virus or bacterium to the body so that memory T and B cells are produced to prevent an actual infection. Most immunizations involve the injection of bacteria or viruses that have been inactivated or weakened. Newborn infants can also acquire some temporary immunity from infection thanks to antibodies that are passed on from their mother. Some antibodies are able to cross the placenta from the mother’s blood and enter the infant’s bloodstream. Other antibodies are passed through breast milk to protect the infant.

The basic parts of the human body are the head, neck, torso, arms and legs. Our bodies consist of a number of biological systems that carry out specific functions necessary for everyday living. The job of the is to move blood, nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hormones, around the body. It consists of the heart, blood, blood vessels,arteries and veins. The consists of a series of connected organs that together, allow the body to break down and absorb food, and remove waste. It includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. The liver and pancreas also play a role in the digestive system because they produce digestive juices. The consists of eight major glands that secrete hormones into the blood. These hormones, in turn, travel to different tissues and regulate various bodily functions, such as metabolism, growth and sexual function. The is the body's defense against bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that may be harmful. It includes lymph nodes, the spleen, bone marrow, lymphocytes (including B-cells and T-cells), the thymus and leukocytes, which are white blood cells. The includes lymph nodes, lymph ducts and lymph vessels, and also plays a role in the body's defenses. Its main job is to make is to make and move lymph, a clear fluid that contains white blood cells, which help the body fight infection. The lymphatic system also removes excess lymph fluid from bodily tissues, and returns it to the blood. The controls both voluntary action (like conscious movement) and involuntary actions (like breathing), and sends signals to different parts of the body. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of nerves that connect every other part of the body to the central nervous system. The body's consists of about 650 muscles that aid in movement, blood flow and other bodily functions. There are three types of muscle: skeletal muscle which is connected to bone and helps with voluntary movement, smooth muscle which is found inside organs and helps to move substances through organs, and cardiac muscle which is found in the heart and helps pump blood. The allows humans to reproduce. The male reproductive system includes the penis and the testes, which produce sperm. The female reproductive system consists of the vagina, the uterus and the ovaries, which produce eggs. During conception, a sperm cell fuses with an egg cell, which creates a fertilized egg that implants and grows in the uterus. [Related: Awkward Anatomy: 10 Odd Facts About the Female Body] Our bodies are supported by the , which consists of 206 bones that are connected by tendons, ligaments and cartilage. The skeleton not only helps us move, but it's also involved in the production of blood cells and the storage of calcium. The teeth are also part of the skeletal system, but they aren't considered bones. The allows us to take in vital oxygen and expel carbon dioxide in a process we call breathing. It consists mainly of the trachea, the diaphragm and the lungs. The helps eliminate a waste product called urea from the body, which is produced when certain foods are broken down. The whole system includes two kidneys, two ureters, the bladder, two sphincter muscles and the urethra. Urine produced by the kidneys travels down the ureters to the bladder, and exits the body through the urethra. The skin, or , is the body's largest organ. It protects us from the outside world, and is our first defense against bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. Our skin also helps regulate body temperature and eliminate waste through perspiration. In addition to skin, the integumentary system includes hair and nails. Humans have five vital organs that are essential for survival. These are the brain, heart, kidneys, liver and lungs. The is the body's control center, receiving and sending signals to other organs through the nervous system and through secreted hormones. It is responsible for our thoughts, feelings, memory storage and general perception of the world. The is a responsible for pumping blood throughout our body. The job of the is to remove waste and extra fluid from the blood. The kidneys take urea out of the blood and combine it with water and other substances to make urine. The has many functions, including detoxifying of harmful chemicals, breakdown of drugs, filtering of blood, secretion of bile and production of blood-clotting proteins. The are responsible for removing oxygen from the air we breathe and transferring it to our blood where it can be sent to our cells. The lungs also remove carbon dioxide, which we exhale. The human body contains nearly 100 trillion cells. There are at least 10 times as many in the human body as cells. The average adult takes over 20,000 breaths a day. Each day, the kidneys process about 200 quarts (50 gallons) of blood to filter out about 2 quarts of waste and water Adults excrete about a quarter and a half (1.42 liters) of urine each day. The human brain contains about 100 billion nerve cells Water makes up more than 50 percent of the average adult's body weight You use your eyes to see, your ears to hear and your muscles to do the heavy lifting. Well, sort of. In fact, most body parts are far more complicated than that, while some seem to have no business being inside there at all.  If you’d like more information on this topic, we recommend the following book (available on amazon.com): Reproductive System: Facts, Functions and Diseases Colon (Large Intestine): Facts, Function & Diseases Stay up to date on the coronavirus outbreak by signing up to our newsletter today.

The lymphatic tissue of these organs filters and cleans the lymph of any debris, abnormal cells, or pathogens. The lymphatic system also transports fatty acids from the to the circulatory system. Red bone marrow is a highly vascular tissue found in the spaces between . It is mostly found in the ends of long bones and in the flat bones of the body. is a hematopoietic tissue containing many stem cells that produce blood cells. All of the leukocytes, or white blood cells, of the immune system are produced by red bone marrow. Leukocytes can be further broken down into 2 groups based upon the type of stem cells that produces them: myeloid stem cells and lymphoid stem cells.   Myeloid stem cells produce monocytes and the granular leukocytes—eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils.   are agranular leukocytes that can form 2 types of cells: macrophages and dendritic cells. . Monocytes respond slowly to infection and once present at the site of infection, develop into macrophages. Macrophages are phagocytes able to consume pathogens, destroyed cells, and debris by phagocytosis. As such, they have a role in both preventing infection as well as cleaning up the aftermath of an infection. . Monocytes also develop into dendritic cells in healthy tissues of the skin and mucous membranes. Dendritic cells are responsible for the detection of pathogenic antigens which are used to activate T cells and B cells. . Eosinophils are granular leukocytes that reduce allergic inflammation and help the body fight off parasites. . Basophils are granular leukocytes that trigger inflammation by releasing the chemicals heparin and histamine. Basophils are active in producing inflammation during allergic reactions and parasitic infections. . Neutrophils are granular leukocytes that act as the first responders to the site of an infection. Neutrophils use chemotaxis to detect chemicals produced by infectious agents and quickly move to the site of infection. Once there, neutrophils ingest the pathogens via phagocytosis and release chemicals to trap and kill the pathogens. Lymphoid stem cells produce T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. . T lymphocytes, also commonly known as T cells, are cells involved in fighting specific pathogens in the body. T cells may act as helpers of other immune cells or attack pathogens directly. After an infection, memory T cells persist in the body to provide a faster reaction to subsequent infection by pathogens expressing the same antigen. . B lymphocytes, also commonly known as B cells, are also cells involved in fighting specific pathogens in the body. Once B cells have been activated by contact with a pathogen, they form plasma cells that produce antibodies. Antibodies then neutralize the pathogens until other immune cells can destroy them. After an infection, memory B cells persist in the body to quickly produce antibodies to subsequent infection by pathogens expressing the same antigen. . Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells, are lymphocytes that are able to respond to a wide range of pathogens and cancerous cells. NK cells travel within the blood and are found in the lymph nodes, spleen, and red bone marrow where they fight most types of infection. As blood passes through the tissues of the body, it enters thin-walled capillaries to facilitate diffusion of nutrients, gases, and wastes. Blood plasma also diffuses through the thin capillary walls and penetrates into the spaces between the cells of the tissues. Some of this plasma diffuses back into the blood of the capillaries, but a considerable portion becomes embedded in the tissues as interstitial fluid. To prevent the accumulation of excess fluids, small dead-end vessels called lymphatic capillaries extend into the tissues to absorb fluids and return them to circulation. The interstitial fluid picked up by lymphatic capillaries is known as lymph. Lymph very closely resembles the plasma found in the veins: it is a mixture of about 90% water and 10% solutes such as proteins, cellular waste products, dissolved gases, and hormones. Lymph may also contain bacterial cells that are picked up from diseased tissues and the white blood cells that fight these pathogens. In late-stage cancer patients, lymph often contains cancerous cells that have metastasized from tumors and may form new tumors within the lymphatic system. A special type of lymph, known as chyle, is produced in the as lymph absorbs triglycerides from the intestinal villi. Due to the presence of triglycerides, chyle has a milky white coloration to it. Lymphatic capillaries merge together into larger lymphatic vessels to carry lymph through the body. The structure of lymphatic vessels closely resembles that of veins: they both have thin walls and many check valves due to their shared function of carrying fluids under low pressure. Lymph is transported through lymphatic vessels by the skeletal muscle pump—contractions of skeletal muscles constrict the vessels to push the fluid forward. Check valves prevent the fluid from flowing back toward the lymphatic capillaries. Lymph nodes are small, kidney-shaped organs of the lymphatic system. There are several hundred lymph nodes found mostly throughout the of the body with the highest concentrations in the axillary (armpit) and inguinal (groin) regions. The outside of each lymph node is made of a dense fibrous connective tissue capsule. Inside the capsule, the lymph node is filled with reticular tissue containing many lymphocytes and macrophages. The lymph nodes function as filters of lymph that enters from several afferent lymph vessels. The reticular fibers of the lymph node act as a net to catch any debris or cells that are present in the lymph. Macrophages and lymphocytes attack and kill any microbes caught in the reticular fibers. Efferent lymph vessels then carry the filtered lymph out of the lymph node and towards the lymphatic ducts. All of the lymphatic vessels of the body carry lymph toward the 2 lymphatic ducts: the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic ducts. These ducts serve to return lymph back to the venous blood supply so that it can be circulated as plasma. . The connects the , abdomen, left arm, and the left side of the head, neck, and thorax to the . . The connects the and the right side of the head, neck, and thorax to the . Outside of the system of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes, there are masses of non-encapsulated lymphatic tissue known as lymphatic nodules. The lymphatic nodules are associated with the mucous membranes of the body, where they work to protect the body from pathogens entering the body through open body cavities. . There are 5 tonsils in the body—2 lingual, 2 palatine, and 1 pharyngeal. The lingual tonsils are located at the posterior root of the tongue near the pharynx. The are in the posterior region of the mouth near the pharynx. The pharyngeal pharynx, also known as the , is found in the at the posterior end of the nasal cavity. The tonsils contain many T and B cells to protect the body from inhaled or ingested substances. The tonsils often become inflamed in response to an infection. . are small masses of lymphatic tissue found in the ileum of the . Peyer’s patches contain T and B cells that monitor the contents of the intestinal lumen for pathogens. Once the antigens of a pathogen are detected, the T and B cells spread and prepare the body to fight a possible infection. . The is a flattened, oval-shaped organ located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen lateral to the stomach. The spleen is made up of a dense fibrous connective tissue capsule filled with regions known as red and white pulp. Red pulp, which makes up most of the spleen’s mass, is so named because it contains many sinuses that filter the blood. Red pulp contains reticular tissues whose fibers filter worn out or damaged red blood cells from the blood. Macrophages in the red pulp digest and recycle the hemoglobin of the captured red blood cells. The red pulp also stores many platelets to be released in response to blood loss. White pulp is found within the red pulp surrounding the arterioles of the spleen. It is made of lymphatic tissue and contains many T cells, B cells, and macrophages to fight off infections. . The is a small, triangular organ found just posterior to the sternum and anterior to the heart. The thymus is mostly made of glandular epithelium and hematopoietic connective tissues. The thymus produces and trains T cells during fetal development and childhood. T cells formed in the thymus and red bone marrow mature, develop, and reproduce in the thymus throughout childhood. The vast majority of T cells do not survive their training in the thymus and are destroyed by macrophages. The surviving T cells spread throughout the body to the other lymphatic tissues to fight infections. By the time a person reaches puberty, the immune system is mature and the role of the thymus is diminished. After puberty, the inactive thymus is slowly replaced by adipose tissue. One of the primary functions of the lymphatic system is the movement of interstitial fluid from the tissues to the circulatory system. Like the veins of the circulatory system, lymphatic capillaries and vessels move lymph with very little pressure to help with circulation. To help move lymph towards the lymphatic ducts, there is a series of many one-way check valves found throughout the lymphatic vessels. These check valves allow lymph to move toward the lymphatic ducts and close when lymph attempts to flow away from the ducts. In the limbs, skeletal muscle contraction squeezes the walls of lymphatic vessels to push lymph through the valves and towards the thorax. In the trunk, the diaphragm pushes down into the abdomen during inhalation. This increased abdominal pressure pushes lymph into the less pressurized thorax. The pressure gradient reverses during exhalation, but the check valves prevent lymph from being pushed backwards. Another major function of the lymphatic system is the transportation of fatty acids from the digestive system. The digestive system breaks large macromolecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids into smaller nutrients that can be absorbed through the villi of the intestinal wall. Most of these nutrients are absorbed directly into the bloodstream, but most fatty acids, the building blocks of fats, are absorbed through the lymphatic system. In the villi of the small intestine are lymphatic capillaries called lacteals. Lacteals are able to absorb fatty acids from the intestinal epithelium and transport them along with lymph. The fatty acids turn the lymph into a white, milky substance called chyle. Chyle is transported through lymphatic vessels to the thoracic duct where it enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver to be metabolized. The body employs many different types of immunity to protect itself from infection from a seemingly endless supply of pathogens. These defenses may be external and prevent pathogens from entering the body. Conversely, internal defenses fight pathogens that have already entered the body. Among the internal defenses, some are specific to only one pathogen or may be innate and defend against many pathogens. Some of these specific defenses can be acquired to preemptively prevent an infection before a pathogen enters the body. The body has many innate ways to defend itself against a broad spectrum of pathogens. These defenses may be external or internal defenses. The coverings and linings of the body constantly prevent infections before they begin by barring pathogens from entering the body. Epidermal cells are constantly growing, dying, and shedding to provide a renewed physical barrier to pathogens. Secretions like sebum, cerumen, mucus, tears, and saliva are used to trap, move, and sometimes even kill bacteria that settle on or in the body. Stomach acid acts as a chemical barrier to kill microbes found on food entering the body. Urine and acidic vaginal secretions also help to kill and remove pathogens that attempt to enter the body. The flora of naturally occurring beneficial bacteria that live on and in our bodies provide a layer of protection from harmful microbes that would seek to colonize our bodies for themselves. include fever, inflammation, natural killer cells, and phagocytes.

60ee4b9d-de90-4868-ae98-3ad51927d90b,"How is the lymphatic system connected with the circulatory system? The lymphatic system is composed of lymphatic vessels, which are tubes that assist the cardiovascular system in the removal of tissue fluid, also known as lymph, from the tissue spaces of the body. The vessels then return fluid to the blood within the circulatory system.The circulatory system is composed of arteries, veins, and capillaries. This system allows the lymph to travel to lymph nodes where it is filtered of bacteria and other foreign particles. in general, the cardiovascular system and lymphatic system make up the circulatory system. The lymphatic system should be considered as part of the circulatory system? Yes, it often is as the two are closely connected. Although lymph does circulate, the lymphatic system is separate from the circulatory system. How is the lymphatic system connected to the digestive system? The lymphatic system is not directly connected to the digestive system. The lymphatic system has to do with draining excess fluids in the extracellular space. Does the lymphatic system supplement the circulatory system? Yes one of the jobs of the lymphatic system is to gather up the fluid that leaks out of the circulatory system and reintroduce it back. @the lymphatic system is its own system but uses the circulatory pathways. Which body system acts as insurance for the circulatory system? The Lymphatic system acts as ""insurance"" for the circulatory system. What is different between the lymphatic circulatory system and the blood circulatory system? Lymphactic Circulatory System - immune system. Blood Circulatory System - provides nutrition to the body. The component of the circulatory system is at the tissue level? The lymphatic system is a component of the circulatory system at the tissue level. In what way is the lymphatic system useful to the circulatory system? The fluids of the lymph system are carried into the circulatory system because they contain plasma proteins. The vessels of the lymphatic system provide a way for interstitial fluid to move through the circulatory system. The lymphatic system works closely with the digestive system and the circulatory system. These systems cannot work without the help of the lymphatic system. How does the circulatory system interact with other organ systems in the body? The circulatory system comprises the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems. The cardiovascular system circulates blood, and the lymphatic system circulates lymph. How is the spleen important to the lymphatic system and to the the circulatory system? Lymphatic system: Helps remove infectionCirculatory system: Removes unwanted material, such as defective red blood cells (RBC's) They belong in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is often paired up with the cardiovascular system and then they are both referred to as the circulatory system. The circulatory system is comprised of the cardiovascular system and the lymphatic system. It is the lymphatic system and its network of lymphatic capillaries, lymph nodes, thymus gland. and the spleen that make up our immune system. It protects the body from pathogens; bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Differences between the lymphatic and cardiovascular systems? What is the difference between Circulatory System and Lymphatic System?&bull; The lymphatic system is essentially a part of the circulatory system. Hence, it shares with the circulatory system the function of carrying fluid and dissolved material from one plays to another.&bull; However, the lymphatic system lacks blood and the two types of vessels: veins and arteries, through which they are carried.&bull; The fluids of the circulatory system move through the heart, arteries, capillaries, veins and lungs, but lymph just flows through lymphatic vessels.&bull; The conductive mediums of the circulatory system consist of plasma erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets. But lymph only consists of lymphocytes, which help create the immune response.&bull; The conductive mediums of the circulatory system are responsible for the transport of respiratory gasses throughout the body. Since the respiratory pigments are missing form lymph, it cannot contribute to this.&bull; The circulatory system carries digested food material and wastes from cells to and from organs, but the lymphatic system only carry digested fats.&bull; The leukocytes in blood pose a defense against the invading foreign bodies and toxins, but it is the lymphocytes of the lymphatic system, which help, build immunity.&bull; The lymphatic system, hence, is not only well-connected part of the circulatory system, but also an essential part of it. How does the lymphatic system function with the circulatory system? It is easiest to think of the lymphatic system as being, in many ways, analogous to the circulatory system. Both are extensive networks of tubes that go virtually everywhere in the body. But where the circulatory system moves blood around the body, the lymphatic system moves a clear liquid known as lymphthroughout the body. No it is part of the lymphatic system which is intertwined with the circulatory system. The circulatory system only comprises the blood, vessels, arteries, capilaries, and heart What vessels return tissue fluids from interstitial spaces to the circulatory system? Lymphatic vessels return tissue fluid from interstitial spaces to the circulatory system. Lymphatic vessels are made of thin walls with valves and they carry lymph around the lymphatic system. What two organ systems do the immune system interact with? The Cardiovascular system and the lymphatic system . Which system reclaims and returns fluids and solutes that have exited the circulatory system? The lymphatic system reclaims and returns fluids and solutes that have exited the circulatory system.

d154232e-200c-4bfa-9151-b24ac5dd6840,"Explore Health Testing Home Health The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and the approximately 5 liters of blood that the blood vessels transport. Responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and cellular waste products throughout the body, the cardiovascular system is powered by the body’s hardest-working organ — the heart, which is only about the size of a closed fist. Even at rest, the average heart easily pumps over 5 liters of blood throughout the body every minute.

The is a muscular pumping organ located medial to the lungs along the body’s midline in the thoracic region. The bottom tip of the heart, known as its apex, is turned to the left, so that about 2/3 of the heart is located on the body’s left side with the other 1/3 on right. The top of the heart, known as the heart’s base, connects to the great blood vessels of the body: the , vena cava, pulmonary trunk, and pulmonary veins. There are 2 primary circulatory loops in the human body: the and the . Pulmonary circulation transports deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the , where the blood picks up oxygen and returns to the left side of the heart. The pumping chambers of the heart that support the pulmonary circulation loop are the right atrium and right ventricle. Systemic circulation carries highly oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to all of the tissues of the body (with the exception of the heart and lungs). Systemic circulation removes wastes from body tissues and returns deoxygenated blood to the right side of the heart. The left atrium and left ventricle of the heart are the pumping chambers for the systemic circulation loop. Blood vessels are the body’s highways that allow blood to flow quickly and efficiently from the heart to every region of the body and back again. The size of blood vessels corresponds with the amount of blood that passes through the vessel. All blood vessels contain a hollow area called the lumen through which blood is able to flow. Around the lumen is the wall of the vessel, which may be thin in the case of capillaries or very thick in the case of arteries. All are lined with a thin layer of simple squamous epithelium known as the endothelium that keeps blood cells inside of the blood vessels and prevents clots from forming. The endothelium lines the entire circulatory system, all the way to the interior of the heart, where it is called the endocardium. There are three major types of blood vessels: arteries, capillaries and veins. Blood vessels are often named after either the region of the body through which they carry blood or for nearby structures. For example, the carries blood into the brachial (arm) and cephalic (head) regions. One of its branches, the subclavian artery, runs under the clavicle; hence the name subclavian. The subclavian artery runs into the axillary region where it becomes known as the axillary artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. Blood carried by arteries is usually highly oxygenated, having just left the lungs on its way to the body’s tissues. The pulmonary trunk and arteries of the pulmonary circulation loop provide an exception to this rule — these arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated. Arteries face high levels of blood pressure as they carry blood being pushed from the heart under great force. To withstand this pressure, the walls of the arteries are thicker, more elastic, and more muscular than those of other vessels. The largest arteries of the body contain a high percentage of elastic tissue that allows them to stretch and accommodate the pressure of the heart. Smaller arteries are more muscular in the structure of their walls. The smooth muscles of the arterial walls of these smaller arteries contract or expand to regulate the flow of blood through their lumen. In this way, the body controls how much blood flows to different parts of the body under varying circumstances. The regulation of blood flow also affects blood pressure, as smaller arteries give blood less area to flow through and therefore increases the pressure of the blood on arterial walls. Arterioles are narrower arteries that branch off from the ends of arteries and carry blood to capillaries. They face much lower blood pressures than arteries due to their greater number, decreased blood volume, and distance from the direct pressure of the heart. Thus arteriole walls are much thinner than those of arteries. Arterioles, like arteries, are able to use smooth muscle to control their aperture and regulate blood flow and blood pressure. Capillaries are the smallest and thinnest of the blood vessels in the body and also the most common. They can be found running throughout almost every tissue of the body and border the edges of the body’s avascular tissues. connect to arterioles on one end and venules on the other. Capillaries carry blood very close to the cells of the tissues of the body in order to exchange gases, nutrients, and waste products. The walls of capillaries consist of only a thin layer of endothelium so that there is the minimum amount of structure possible between the blood and the tissues. The endothelium acts as a filter to keep blood cells inside of the vessels while allowing liquids, dissolved gases, and other chemicals to diffuse along their concentration gradients into or out of tissues. Precapillary sphincters are bands of smooth muscle found at the arteriole ends of capillaries. These sphincters regulate blood flow into the capillaries. Since there is a limited supply of blood, and not all tissues have the same energy and oxygen requirements, the precapillary sphincters reduce blood flow to inactive tissues and allow free flow into active tissues. Veins are the large return vessels of the body and act as the blood return counterparts of arteries. Because the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries absorb most of the force of the heart’s contractions, veins and venules are subjected to very low blood pressures. This lack of pressure allows the walls of veins to be much thinner, less elastic, and less muscular than the walls of arteries. Veins rely on gravity, inertia, and the force of skeletal muscle contractions to help push blood back to the heart. To facilitate the movement of blood, some veins contain many one-way valves that prevent blood from flowing away from the heart. As skeletal muscles in the body contract, they squeeze nearby veins and push blood through valves closer to the heart. When the muscle relaxes, the valve traps the blood until another contraction pushes the blood closer to the heart. Venules are similar to arterioles as they are small vessels that connect capillaries, but unlike arterioles, venules connect to veins instead of arteries. Venules pick up blood from many capillaries and deposit it into larger veins for transport back to the heart. The heart has its own set of blood vessels that provide the myocardium with the oxygen and nutrients necessary to pump blood throughout the body. The left and right coronary arteries branch off from the aorta and provide blood to the left and right sides of the heart. The coronary sinus is a vein on the posterior side of the heart that returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the vena cava. The veins of the stomach and intestines perform a unique function: instead of carrying blood directly back to the heart, they carry through the . Blood leaving the digestive organs is rich in nutrients and other chemicals absorbed from food. The removes toxins, stores sugars, and processes the products of digestion before they reach the other body tissues. Blood from the liver then returns to the heart through the inferior vena cava. The average human body contains about 4 to 5 liters of blood. As a liquid connective tissue, it transports many substances through the body and helps to maintain homeostasis of nutrients, wastes, and gases. Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and liquid plasma. Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, are by far the most common type of blood cell and make up about 45% of blood volume. Erythrocytes are produced inside of from stem cells at the astonishing rate of about 2 million cells every second. The shape of erythrocytes is biconcave—disks with a concave curve on both sides of the disk so that the center of an erythrocyte is its thinnest part. The unique shape of erythrocytes gives these cells a high surface area to volume ratio and allows them to fold to fit into thin capillaries. Immature erythrocytes have a nucleus that is ejected from the cell when it reaches maturity to provide it with its unique shape and flexibility. The lack of a nucleus means that red blood cells contain no DNA and are not able to repair themselves once damaged. Erythrocytes transport oxygen in the blood through the red pigment hemoglobin. Hemoglobin contains iron and proteins joined to greatly increase the oxygen carrying capacity of erythrocytes. The high surface area to volume ratio of erythrocytes allows oxygen to be easily transferred into the cell in the lungs and out of the cell in the capillaries of the systemic tissues. White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, make up a very small percentage of the total number of cells in the bloodstream, but have important functions in the body’s . There are two major classes of white blood cells: granular leukocytes and agranular leukocytes. Granular Leukocytes: The three types of granular leukocytes are neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Each type of granular leukocyte is classified by the presence of chemical-filled vesicles in their cytoplasm that give them their function. Neutrophils contain digestive enzymes that neutralize bacteria that invade the body. Eosinophils contain digestive enzymes specialized for digesting viruses that have been bound to by antibodies in the blood. Basophils release histamine to intensify allergic reactions and help protect the body from parasites. Agranular Leukocytes: The two major classes of agranular leukocytes are lymphocytes and monocytes. Lymphocytes include T cells and natural killer cells that fight off viral infections and B cells that produce antibodies against infections by pathogens. Monocytes develop into cells called macrophages that engulf and ingest pathogens and the dead cells from wounds or infections. Also known as thrombocytes, platelets are small cell fragments responsible for the clotting of blood and the formation of scabs. Platelets form in the red bone marrow from large megakaryocyte cells that periodically rupture and release thousands of pieces of membrane that become the platelets. Platelets do not contain a nucleus and only survive in the body for up to a week before macrophages capture and digest them. Plasma is the non-cellular or liquid portion of the blood that makes up about 55% of the blood’s volume. Plasma is a mixture of water, proteins, and dissolved substances. Around 90% of plasma is made of , although the exact percentage varies depending upon the hydration levels of the individual. The within plasma include antibodies and albumins. Antibodies are part of the immune system and bind to antigens on the surface of pathogens that infect the body. Albumins help maintain the body’s osmotic balance by providing an isotonic solution for the cells of the body. Many different substances can be found dissolved in the plasma, including glucose, oxygen, carbon dioxide, electrolytes, nutrients, and cellular waste products. The plasma functions as a transportation medium for these substances as they move throughout the body. The cardiovascular system has three major functions: transportation of materials, protection from pathogens, and regulation of the body’s homeostasis. : The cardiovascular system transports blood to almost all of the body’s tissues. The blood delivers essential nutrients and oxygen and removes wastes and carbon dioxide to be processed or removed from the body. Hormones are transported throughout the body via the blood’s liquid plasma. : The cardiovascular system protects the body through its white blood cells. White blood cells clean up cellular debris and fight pathogens that have entered the body. Platelets and red blood cells form scabs to seal wounds and prevent pathogens from entering the body and liquids from leaking out. Blood also carries antibodies that provide specific immunity to pathogens that the body has previously been exposed to or has been vaccinated against. : The cardiovascular system is instrumental in the body’s ability to maintain homeostatic control of several internal conditions. Blood vessels help maintain a stable body temperature by controlling the blood flow to the surface of the . Blood vessels near the skin’s surface open during times of overheating to allow hot blood to dump its heat into the body’s surroundings. In the case of hypothermia, these blood vessels constrict to keep blood flowing only to vital organs in the body’s core. Blood also helps balance the body’s pH due to the presence of bicarbonate ions, which act as a buffer solution. Finally, the albumins in blood plasma help to balance the osmotic concentration of the body’s cells by maintaining an isotonic environment. Many serious conditions and diseases can cause our cardiovascular system to stop working properly. Quite often, we don’t do enough about them proactively, resulting in emergencies.

Also, explore how can allow you to begin important conversations with your doctor about genetic risks for disorders involving clotting, hemophilia, hemochromatosis (a common hereditary disorder causing iron to accumulate in the heart) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (which affects about 1 in 10 African American men). The heart is a four-chambered “double pump,” where each side (left and right) operates as a separate pump. The left and right sides of the heart are separated by a muscular wall of tissue known as the septum of the heart. The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the systemic veins and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. The left side of the heart receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it through the systemic arteries to the tissues of the body. Each heartbeat results in the simultaneous pumping of both sides of the heart, making the heart a very efficient pump. Several functions of the cardiovascular system can control blood pressure. Certain hormones along with autonomic nerve signals from the brain affect the rate and strength of heart contractions. Greater contractile force and heart rate lead to an increase in blood pressure. Blood vessels can also affect blood pressure. Vasoconstriction decreases the diameter of an artery by contracting the smooth muscle in the arterial wall. The sympathetic (fight or flight) division of the autonomic nervous system causes vasoconstriction, which leads to increases in blood pressure and decreases in blood flow in the constricted region. Vasodilation is the expansion of an artery as the smooth muscle in the arterial wall relaxes after the fight-or-flight response wears off or under the effect of certain hormones or chemicals in the blood. The volume of blood in the body also affects blood pressure. A higher volume of blood in the body raises blood pressure by increasing the amount of blood pumped by each heartbeat. Thicker, more viscous blood from clotting disorders can also raise blood pressure. Hemostasis, or the clotting of blood and formation of scabs, is managed by the platelets of the blood. Platelets normally remain inactive in the blood until they reach damaged tissue or leak out of the blood vessels through a wound. Once active, platelets change into a spiny ball shape and become very sticky in order to latch on to damaged tissues. Platelets next release chemical clotting factors and begin to produce the protein fibrin to act as structure for the blood clot. Platelets also begin sticking together to form a platelet plug. The platelet plug will serve as a temporary seal to keep blood in the vessel and foreign material out of the vessel until the cells of the blood vessel can repair the damage to the vessel wall.

Does a brown bear have an open or closed circulatory system? the brown snake looks like a long, brown snake. and its a snake and its brown The circulatory system is its own system. There are not systems in the circulatory system. How are the circulatory system and the circulatory system related? What type of circulatory system does a monkey have? closed circulatory system (double circulatory system) The aptly named 'Brown Snake' from Australia is a venomous brown snake. How is the circulatory system of an earthworm different from the circulatory system of mammals? the circulatory system does not have a central pump mammals have closed circulatory system and further double circulatory system. A single circulatory system is a circulatory system that does not have blood going to both lungs and body. That would be a double circulatory system. What is a system that includes your circulatory system? What is different between the lymphatic circulatory system and the blood circulatory system? Lymphactic Circulatory System - immune system. Blood Circulatory System - provides nutrition to the body. Do amphibians have an open circulatory system or a closed circulatory system? How does the circulatory system interact with the circulatory system? Sorry, Typo. The real question is how does the Nervous System interact with the Circulatory system? The circulatory system found in a goat is the one known as the open circulatory system. This is the common type of circulatory system that you will find in most mammals. There are a number of systems that can help the circulatory system. The skeletal system can help the circulatory system for example. Circulatory system in which blood is contained in vessels? Closed circulatory systemThe cardiovascular system is a circulatory system in which blood is contained in vessels. How does the skeletal system interact with the circulatory system? How does the Skeletal System interact with the Circulatory System? Do plants have skeletal system and circulatory system? Plants do not have the skeletal system but they have the circulatory system.

Within their canoes they carried only the most critical item necessary for survival and for restarting their new lives in new lands. Among these items were seeds and cuttings for plants used for food, medicine and clothing  these were called canoe plants. Among these plants was one called Noni, considered extremely valuable as a medicinal plant. Heritage has developed a product with the highest quality of this plant, called Olakino Noni, designed for high impact results. The two principle health applications of Olakino Noni are to promote the immune system function and to support proper digestive function. From these two applications arise a large array of potential benefits. * Benefits of Heritage Olakino Noni include: *This product has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

This process of blood flowing around the body is called circulation. The main components of the circulatory system are the heart, arteries, capillaries and the veins. What is the most important part in the circulatory system? The most important part of the Circulatory Sytem is the capillaries. It is important to know how the systems in the body work. The circulatory system works by pumping blood to the parts of the body that need it. closed ciculatory system is the type of circulatory sytem with a contractile pumping organ and in which the blood remains confined to the blood vessels What are the two important components which the urinary sytem controls? it removes breakdown components of cell metabolism and promotes homeostatis. How your body sytem works with other sytems in the body? the skeletal and muscular the excretory and the reproductive the circulatory and the nervous The parts are 1.veins 2.arteries 3.capillaries 4.heart Main components are the heart and blood vessels (veins, capillaries, arteries). Lungs and various muscles are also components of the circulatory systems How does the circulatory system interact with the other systems? Because the Circulatory system helps carry the wastes to the rectum during the digestive sytem. So therfore those wastes can be removed. What is the 4 main components of the circulatory system? The four main components of the circulatory system is the following; 1. Heart 2. Veins 3. Artery 4. Vessels What is the body system that regulates the passage of oxygen and nutrients to the cells and takes waste from them? AnswerThe circulatory system. No iTz Respiratory Sytem Circulatory system, repiratory system, urinary system, nervous sytem. What is a organ sytem found in the circulatory system? The circultory system itself is an organ system. It contains the heart and blood vessels. What are the three components in the circulatory system? Describe the two main components of the circulatory system? What are all the components of the circulatory system? the circulatory sytem is used to circulate blood troughout your body. Your body brings oxygenated blood to areas in your body that need it and take deoxygenated blood back to the heart and lungs for reoxygenation. How do the muscle system digestive system and circulatory system work together? they all use the blood stream! also the digestive system provides nutrients that the circulatory sytem transports to the muscles so they can work and rebuild! The circulatory system is important to humans because the main components are the heart, the blood, and blood vessels. What are the five components of the circulatory system?

Although lymph does circulate, the lymphatic system is separate from the circulatory system. Does the lymphatic system supplement the circulatory system? Yes one of the jobs of the lymphatic system is to gather up the fluid that leaks out of the circulatory system and reintroduce it back. @the lymphatic system is its own system but uses the circulatory pathways. What are two ways the lymphatic system system is different than the circulatory system besides one carries blood and one carries lymph? They are different from circulatory system because they works preventing diseases Which body system acts as insurance for the circulatory system? The Lymphatic system acts as ""insurance"" for the circulatory system. The component of the circulatory system is at the tissue level? The lymphatic system is a component of the circulatory system at the tissue level. In what way is the lymphatic system useful to the circulatory system? The fluids of the lymph system are carried into the circulatory system because they contain plasma proteins. The vessels of the lymphatic system provide a way for interstitial fluid to move through the circulatory system. DID_YOU_KNOW_THAT?"">DID YOU KNOW THAT?THE_JOB_OF_THE_LYMPHATIC_SYSTEM_IS_TO_COLLECT_LYMPH_FROM_THE_BODY_TISSUES_AND_RETURN_IT_TO_THE_BLOOD"">THE JOB OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM IS TO COLLECT LYMPH FROM THE BODY TISSUES AND RETURN IT TO THE BLOODTHE LYMPATHIC IS ALSO A PART OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEM The lymphatic system works closely with the digestive system and the circulatory system. These systems cannot work without the help of the lymphatic system. How does the circulatory system interact with other organ systems in the body? The circulatory system comprises the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems. The cardiovascular system circulates blood, and the lymphatic system circulates lymph. How is the spleen important to the lymphatic system and to the the circulatory system? Lymphatic system: Helps remove infectionCirculatory system: Removes unwanted material, such as defective red blood cells (RBC's) They belong in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is often paired up with the cardiovascular system and then they are both referred to as the circulatory system. The circulatory system is comprised of the cardiovascular system and the lymphatic system. It is the lymphatic system and its network of lymphatic capillaries, lymph nodes, thymus gland. and the spleen that make up our immune system. It protects the body from pathogens; bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Differences between the lymphatic and cardiovascular systems? What is the difference between Circulatory System and Lymphatic System?&bull; The lymphatic system is essentially a part of the circulatory system. Hence, it shares with the circulatory system the function of carrying fluid and dissolved material from one plays to another.&bull; However, the lymphatic system lacks blood and the two types of vessels: veins and arteries, through which they are carried.&bull; The fluids of the circulatory system move through the heart, arteries, capillaries, veins and lungs, but lymph just flows through lymphatic vessels.&bull; The conductive mediums of the circulatory system consist of plasma erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets. But lymph only consists of lymphocytes, which help create the immune response.&bull; The conductive mediums of the circulatory system are responsible for the transport of respiratory gasses throughout the body. Since the respiratory pigments are missing form lymph, it cannot contribute to this.&bull; The circulatory system carries digested food material and wastes from cells to and from organs, but the lymphatic system only carry digested fats.&bull; The leukocytes in blood pose a defense against the invading foreign bodies and toxins, but it is the lymphocytes of the lymphatic system, which help, build immunity.&bull; The lymphatic system, hence, is not only well-connected part of the circulatory system, but also an essential part of it. How does the lymphatic system function with the circulatory system? It is easiest to think of the lymphatic system as being, in many ways, analogous to the circulatory system. Both are extensive networks of tubes that go virtually everywhere in the body. But where the circulatory system moves blood around the body, the lymphatic system moves a clear liquid known as lymphthroughout the body. How is the lymphatic system connected with the circulatory system? The lymphatic system is composed of lymphatic vessels, which are tubes that assist the cardiovascular system in the removal of tissue fluid, also known as lymph, from the tissue spaces of the body. The vessels then return fluid to the blood within the circulatory system.The circulatory system is composed of arteries, veins, and capillaries. This system allows the lymph to travel to lymph nodes where it is filtered of bacteria and other foreign particles. in general, the cardiovascular system and lymphatic system make up the circulatory system. No it is part of the lymphatic system which is intertwined with the circulatory system. The circulatory system only comprises the blood, vessels, arteries, capilaries, and heart What vessels return tissue fluids from interstitial spaces to the circulatory system? Lymphatic vessels return tissue fluid from interstitial spaces to the circulatory system. Lymphatic vessels are made of thin walls with valves and they carry lymph around the lymphatic system. What two organ systems do the immune system interact with? The Cardiovascular system and the lymphatic system . The lymphatic system is often referred to as a secondary circulatory system as it consists of a network ofvessels that assist the blood in returningfluid from the tissues back to the hert. In this way, the lymphatic system is a complementary system for the circulatory system. After draining the tissues of excess fluid, the lymphatic system returns this fluid to the cardiovascular system. This helps to maintain blood volume, blood pressure and prevent oedema.

Any scientific information contained within this essay should not be treated as fact, this content is to be used for educational purposes only and may contain factual inaccuracies or be out of date. 1805 words (7 pages) Essay 18th May 2020    As mentioned before, Homeostasis the ability of an organism to maintain internal body conditions despite the external condition surrounding it. The complex human body is actively maintaining homeostasis while performing other duties to help us live our every day lives. Homeostasis is seen as the body systems including the skeletal system, the muscular system, the nervous system, the endocrine system, the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system, the digestive system, the immune system, the respiratory system, and the urinary system. The Reproductive system will also be discussed and how it does not necessarily perform homeostasis. If you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help!  The first body system being covered is the Skeletal System. The Skeletal system is comprised of all the bones found in the human body. Its main purpose is to support the body and provide structure. At the same time, it protects the internal organs by surrounding them. The Skeletal System also encourages movement because it is the attachment point of the muscles. This system also produces blood cells and serves as a storage of minerals and fat. The Skeletal system’s role in homeostasis is maintaining the mineral levels. For example, the Skeletal system helps maintain the adequate levels of calcium and other minerals found in the blood to ensure normal functions. If the levels are too high, the bones will absorb some of those minerals and turn them into mineral salts. If mineral levels are too low, then the bones release more minerals into the bloodstream. Another body system that helps promote movement in the body is the Muscular System. The Muscular system is composed of muscle fibers and is found attached to bones, internal organs, and blood vessels. It helps actions humans do in everyday life such as walking, running, performing movements of the eye, maintaining posture, joint stability, heat production, and respiration. The Muscular System helps with Homeostasis by allowing specific body parts to move away from danger, hunt, capture food, or procreate. Homeostasis is also seen in the internal organs and their corresponding system.  The Cardiovascular system is the home to the heart and the circulatory system. The heart’s main purpose is to pump blood, which is full of oxygen and nutrients, into the other internal organs, tissues, and cells throughout the body. Within the Cardiovascular system are the Arteries which carries the oxygen-full blood away from the heart. In comparison, the Veins carry oxygen-poor blood towards the heart to continue this cycle. The Cardiovascular system maintains Homeostasis by maintaining continuous movement of the blood. It also helps create a constant environment around each body cell. Another Body System that is related to blood is the Lymphatic System. The Lymphatic system is a system of organs, lymph nodes, ducts, and vessels that allow lymph to move from tissues through the bloodstream. The Lymphatic System is mainly made up of white blood cells and intestine fluid. This system contributes to Homeostasis by maintaining constant levels of lymph in tissue spaces. Extra lymph will often lead to inflammation.  Moving on from the Cardiovascular System comes to the Digestive system. The Digestive system is a collection of the digestive tract and organs such as the Liver, Pancreas, and Gallbladder. The Digestive Tract is a long tube that runs from the mouth through the body to the anus where waste is released. Its main purpose is to break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates into amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol, and simple sugars; respectively. Similar to the Skeletal System and the Cardiovascular system, the Digestive system maintains homeostasis by regulating the amount of iron and calcium absorbed and transferring nutrients from external environments to the internal environment. Another Body system that maintains Homeostasis is the Respiratory system. It is made up of the noses, sinuses, and lungs. The Respiratory System is responsible for bringing in oxygen and expelling Carbon Dioxide. To maintain Homeostasis, the Respiratory System regulates the composition of blood gas. Like the Respiratory system, the Urinary system is also responsible for expelling waste by-products. Composed mainly by the kidneys and bladder, the Urinary System is responsible for filtering blood and releasing waste products after taking away the nutrients from food and converting it to energy. The Urinary System, in terms of Homeostasis, is similar to the Cardiovascular system, because the kidneys help regulate the amount and composition of blood while also maintaining the blood’s pH of 7.4  The next set of body systems contribute more with sending signals throughout the body. The first body system is the Nervous System. With an intimidating network of nerves, messages are carried to and from the brain to other parts of the body. The Nervous System is an important contributor to Homeostasis because it monitors and regulates all of the other systems within the Human Body. The Nervous system is also responsible for triggering a response if any change occurs. Similar to the Nervous System, the Endocrine System also sends signals throughout the body. The Endocrine System is responsible for producing hormones used in metabolism, reproduction, growth, and more. The Endocrine System contributes to Homeostasis sending positive and negative feedback loops from the brain to release certain and the right amount of hormone levels. The next body system is the Immune System. The Immune System is located throughout the body from the skin, bone marrow, bloodstream, thymus, and others. It is responsible for preventing or limiting infection and help differentiate healthy and unhealthy cells. The Immune System contributes to Homeostasis by helping the healing process and again fighting off infections. The final body system is the Reproductive System. As the parts vary depending on one’s gender, its main purpose is still to procreate offspring. Unlike the other body systems, the Reproductive System is the only system that does not necessarily contribute to Homeostasis. Our academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have. From simple essay plans, through to full dissertations, you can guarantee we have a service perfectly matched to your needs.  In conclusion, all of the Body Systems are crucial to a healthy life which is why it is our responsibility to ensure their health. The Skeletal, Muscular, Cardiovascular, Lymphatic, Digestive, Respiratory, Urinary, Nervous, Endocrine, and Immune Systems all help contribute to maintaining Homeostasis while performing their everyday tasks. While the Reproductive System, does not directly contribute to Homeostasis, it is still as important as the other Body Systems.

1a9c23aa-1b5c-4130-9ad9-871af0b3ba99,"How do you know that exercise affect our respiratory system? Because our respiratory system is part of our breathing and we all breath faster when we do exercise because the oxygen needs to get to the muscles quicker. Exercise also makes you fitter, so you will see an improvement on the respiratory system because your breathing will be more controlable... Therefore exercise defently effects the respiratory system :) How does lung cancer affect or interact with the respiratory system? Upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, pneumonia, flu and H1N1 all affect the respiratory system when infected.what are some of the respiratory system disease who ever know just tell now.pneumonia,lung cancer,asthma,emphysema so that they can breath. If you do not know the respiratory system is used for breathing How does the respiratory system deal with the digestive system? Good respiratory system imoroves digestive system. People who does pranayama will know the results NO!!!!!!!! respiratory system is for breathing. good question though, i would've asked that if i didnt know How does the respiratory system help the digestive system? the respiratory system provides O2 to cells in the digestive system which lets them liveI don't know, just google it! Which human system contains air sacs know as alveoli? What is bad for the health of your respiratory system? the worst thing for the respiratory system is smoking. Go the eHOW link and you will find all you need to know. i don't know but its part of the respiratory system Why is the circulatory system important to the respiratory system? Why is it important to know the function of the respiratory system? It is in order to have a proper understanding of how our body works. It is also to teach us how to value these organs which are part of our respiratory system. What is the the windpipe in the respiratory system? What are the common ailments of respiratory system by pollution? What is the affect of exercise on arteries veins and capillaries? Is the respiratory system more important then the circulatory system? Does severe exercise affect the function of the kidney? I think so, but I definitely know that too much exercise can harm the heart. Respiratory technician school will go by much faster if you know information about the lungs and the diseases that can affect the lungs. You should learn as much as you can about breathing treatments and ailments with the circulatory system in order to succeed in the class. It is also a good idea to learn about the different anatomical parts of the circulatory and respiratory system. How do the circulatory system and the respiratory system work together in the body? i dont know you tell me the respiratory system gets air in and separates oxygen with carbon dioxide and then the circulatory system takes the oxygen and circulates the oxygen around your body Step by step how does the respiratory system work? How do the nervous and respiratory systems work together? The brain gets oxygen from the respiratory system. The nervous system controls the respiratory system by using the Vagus nerve. There are also nerves in the vascular system which act as sensors and measure blood gases so the brain will know how to control the breathing and what hormones need released. I sincerely suggest that you should describe your question more specifically because diseases of many kinds could have developed in human respiratory system and I don't know what problem is bothering you. Why is it important for the circulatory and respiratory system to work so closely together? yes other wise they wouldn't be able to BREATH you know lungs the respiratory system is the system in the human body that helps u breathe. the function is that when u breathe in oxygen fills the lungs and when u breathe out u release carbon dioxide and it contract I AM A CHILD AND I KNOW THIS!YAY FOR ME!

There two main organs found in the respiratory system =] . Name two body systems that the respiratory system work with? What are the two branching tubes called in the respiratory system? The two branching tubes in the respiratory system are the bronchi. They are branches of the trachea. Two facts about the respiratory system include:it must work with both the nervous system and muscular systemillness, conditions, or injury to the muscles of respiration or the brain can interfere with the respiratory system's normal functioning What are two examples of system works together with the circulatory system? The respiratory system has two parts, the upper and the lower. Common conditions of the upper respiratory system include, hay fever and rhinitis. Lower respiratory ailments include asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema, and tuberculosis. Which two body systems are involved in respiration? The respiratory system and the circulatory system. How is the respiratory system connected to two other body systems? The respiratory system is connected to the circulatory system at the alveoli, where oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse across the thin membrane between the two systems. The physical connection between the respiratory system and the digestive system occurs at the oropharynx, which carries both air and food. What are two factors that contribute to the efficient function respiratory system? 1) An intact non-diseased respiratory system. 2) Not smoking. And many more than two factors, of course.

The three main organs are the heart, the lungs, and the blood vessels. Veins, capillaries, and arteries aren't organs, but they are an important part of the circulatory system. 3 examples of how the circulatory system works with other systems? The nervous system and the circulatory system work together in that the brain sends signals to the heart that cause it to pump. The circulatory system works with the excretory system because waste materials are transported by blood to the organs of the excretory system. The respiratory system is intertwined with the circulatory system, as the respiratory system provides oxygen for the red blood cells. The main organ would be the Heart. Other major organs are the veins and arteries. Lungs are also a part of the blood circulatory system. the three main organs of excretion are :- 1). lungs 2). urinary bladder 3). anus The three organs of the respiratory system are the nose, larynx, and lungs.

The tonsils, thymus gland, and the spleen are all accessory organs of the lymphatic system. Some ailments of the excretory system are: 1) Nephritis 2) Bladder Cancer 3) Kidney Failure 4) UTI( Urinary Tract Infection) 5) Kidney Cancer What are the main organs of the circulatory system? The main organs of the circulatory system are the heart and blood vessels. The lungs also play a part in the system but are not a specific part of the circulatory system.The main organs in the circulatory system in the human body are the heart and the blood vessels such as the veins and arteries.it is the heartThe heart. It circulates oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body and give oxygen to de-oxygenated blood by sending it to the lungs. The heart has four parts, the left atria, the right atria, the left ventricle, and the right ventricle. There are also a bunch of valves that open and close these chambers.its the heartIt is the Heart. the main organs of the circulatory system include the heart, veins and arteries. (: Bye.

The blood vessels have three layers, the tunica externa, the tunica media, and the tunica interna. Your heart is composed of the pericardium, which is a double-walled sac filled with serous fluid, and then there are the three layers of the heart; the epicardium, the myocardium, and the endocardium. The lymphatic system is also part of your circulatory system and it is composed of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, mucosal associated lymphatic tissue, and the spleen. All of them, muscular, connective, epithelial, and nervous.Kleenex with added Aloe Vera. What tissue types are found in the Circulatory System? The blood is one of the tissues that concern the circulatory system. What is the body system that carries nutrients to tissues and wastes away from tissues in the blood? Which system brings needed substance to the body tissues? The circulatory system brings the needed substances to the body tissues. Does the circulatory system transport hormones to body tissues? Yes, the circulatory system is responsible for transporting hormones to body tissues. It also carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste to where they need to be. The circulatory system is most dependent on which other organ? The circulatory system is dependent on the lungs. The lungs bring oxygen into the body, and the circulatory system transports that oxygen to body tissues. How is the circulatory system important to maintaining life? The circulatory system distributes oxygen to the body tissues, and helps gaseous wastes to be eliminated via the lungs. Without it, tissues could not function. The circulatory system imports oxygen and exports waste materials or carbon dioxide. The circulatory system distributes fresh oxygen to the tissues and organs of the body. What system is responsible for pumping blood to all organs tissues and cells? Which organs and tissues are included in the circulatory system? Which two systems work closely together to give your tissues oxygen? The respiratory and circulatory systems work closely to give your tissues oxygen. The respiratory system takes oxygen into the body, and the circulatory system delivers the oxygen to all body tissues. State two main fuction and organs of the circulatory system? Two many functions of the circulatory system are the movement of nutrients and oxygen to the tissues, and movement of wastes from the tissues to the excretory system. The main organs are the heart and blood vessels. The vessels in the circulatory system that allow molecules to diffuse across tissues? because they have a long tissues that the blood flows What is the difference of a open and closed circulatory system? In a closed circulatory system, the circulatory fluid remains within blood vessels at all points in the circulatory system. In an open circulatory system, the circulating fluid enters a sinus at least at one point in the circulating system and thus comes in direct contact with the tissues. What are the major tissues of the circulatory system? Muscle and the spleen and the heart and the lungs and the mouth What term refers to the system of organs and tissues that circulate the blood around your body? The system of organs and tissues that circulate the blood around your body is called the circulatory system or the cardiovascular system. Could the Digestive System function without the circulatory system? The digestive system could not function without the circulatory system. First, the circulatory system is required to distribute nutrients provided by the digestive system to the rest of the body. In addition, without the circulatory system, the tissues of the digestive system could not get oxygen and could not get rid of wastes. What Contain hemoglobin and transports oxygen to the body tissues and removes CO2 from the body tissues? Where in the circulatory cyctem does nutrients enter and wastes leave the tissues? The capillaries are the site in the circulatory system where nutrients enter and wastes leave the tissues. The thin walls of the capillaries facilitate this diffusion. What component of the circulatory system is at the tissue level-? The circulatory system can be considered as composed of two parts: The main components of the human circulatory system are the heart, the blood, by tissues undergoing high metabolism, as they require increased levels of oxygen. What does the main organ of the circulatory system do? The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, and it pumps blood to the cells of organs and tissues, giving them oxegyn and removing carbon dioxide. What describes the function of the circulatory system? To provide tissues in the body with nutrients via blood. How does the circulatory system help the human body survive? The circulatory system helps the body survive by transporting oxygen, nutrients, and wastes to and from body tissues. It allows for specialization of tissues by making sure specialized materials get to the places where they're needed. Which body system is responsible for transporting hormones from endocrine glands to various body tissues? The circulatory system is responsible for transporting hormones from endocrine glands to target tissues. What is the function of the Closed circulatory system? Closed circulatory system is to supply nutrients to body tissues and uptake waste products the tissues accumulate. The function is the same as an open circulatory system, the only difference is the way they work. Open systems are more difficult to understand, but instead of having blood contained in vessels in which nutrients diffuse across, they blood is pumped into body cavities and can diffuse directly into tissues. How does the digestive system and the circulatory system work in conjunction during digestion? =The digestive system breaks down food so that it can be absorbed into the circulatory system. It then carries the nutrients to the tissues to use and removes metabolic wastes.= What's the most outdated thing you still use today?

It can cause symptoms that come and go, including numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, vision problems and trouble walking or talking. In this protocol, learn about the causes of MS and what treatments are available. Discover how an imbalanced immune system contributes to the inflammation that drives the disease. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to modulate the immune response in MS and help improve symptoms, in some clinical trials. What is Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath—the coating that insulates and protects neurons. This demyelination causes disruptions in neural communication and potentially neuronal death, leading to disability. MS may follow several disease courses, the most common of which is relapsing remitting. Relapsing remitting MS is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks followed by periods of remission. Natural interventions such as vitamin D and essential fatty acids may help relieve inflammation and improve symptoms of MS. What are the Risk Factors for Multiple Sclerosis? Genetic predisposition Viral infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) Vitamin D deficiency Hormonal imbalance Exposure to organic solvents Food sensitivities Smoking What are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Note: Symptoms of MS vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms may include: Fatigue Numbness or tingling in limbs Impaired vision Muscle weakness, clumsiness Loss of balance, dizziness, potential nausea and vomiting Bladder dysfunction Changes in memory, reasoning, and spatial perception What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis? Note: There is currently no cure for MS. Treatments include therapies to calm acute attacks, slow or modify the disease course, and alleviate symptoms. Several experimental therapies are currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Therapies for acute attacks: Corticosteroids Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange to remove inflammatory factors and antibodies) Disease-modifying therapies: Beta interferons to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression Glatiramer acetate, an immunomodulator Immunosuppressant drugs (eg, mitoxantrone) Monoclonal antibodies (eg, natalizumab) Dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker, to increase the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses Symptom management may include: muscle relaxants medications to reduce fatigue antidepressants What are Additional Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis? Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech therapy Cognitive rehabilitation Vocational rehabilitation Swank low-fat diet Hormone therapy What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Multiple Sclerosis? Vitamin D. As vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS, supplementation may be helpful. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that MS patients taking vitamin D had fewer relapses and less inflammation. Essential fatty acids. Omega-3 (ie, DHA and EPA) and certain omega-6 (ie, GLA) fatty acids have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve some symptoms of MS. Antioxidants. Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, and MS patients tend to have low levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione peroxidase. Supplementing with selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, and/or N-acetylcysteine may boost glutathione peroxidase levels for potential benefits. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to inhibit the activity of ICAM-1, a protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Supplementation with lipoic acid reduced ICAM-1 levels and T-cell migration into the central nervous system in patients with MS. Vitamin B12. Patients with MS may be deficient in vitamin B12. Supplementation has been shown in several studies to improve symptoms and the clinical course of the disease in patients with MS. Biotin. Biotin (vitamin B7) has demonstrated positive effects in patients with MS. Studies showed high doses of biotin improved measures of MS-related disabilities in some patients. Other natural interventions that may benefit patients with MS include coenzyme Q10, ginkgo biloba, green tea, and curcumin. 2 Introduction Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of autoimmunity and inflammation characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath that insulates and protects neurons. When a patient experiences an ""attack,"" or episode of increased disease activity, the resultant impairment of neuronal communication can manifest as a broad spectrum of symptoms, affecting sensory processing, locomotion, and cognition. Scientific research suggests both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease. Current medical treatments for MS include potent immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce immune function, and anti-inflammatory medications as well as invasive procedures such as plasma exchange, which attempts to reduce inflammatory mediators in a patient's blood. Largely ignored and discounted by mainstream medicine, nutrients offer immune-modifying benefits that can help complement pharmacological and clinical interventions and improve quality of life for MS patients. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests vitamin D may be a missing link in virtually all autoimmune diseases, including MS. This single vitamin has the ability to modulate the immune system in ways that even pharmaceutical drugs cannot. A multitude of epidemiological studies have revealed that individuals with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are at considerably increased risk for developing MS; in fact, up to 90% of MS patients are deficient in vitamin D.1 3 Understanding Multiple Sclerosis Within the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) a vast network of neurons are constantly communicating amongst themselves, and with the peripheral nervous system (outside of the brain and spinal cord), to control every aspect of human function, from sight and hearing, to cognition and mobility. The efficiency and accuracy of communication between individual neurons form the basis for our ability to do things as diverse as complete simple daily tasks and comprehend complex philosophical or mathematical ideas. Neuronal communication is similar to the transmission of an electrical current through a series of wires. Droves of neurons work together to deliver messages to every corner of the body by transmitting signals along their long, cylindrical mid-sections called axons and passing it on to the next neuron. This is repeated until the message reaches its destination. Like electrical wires, neuronal axons require insulation to ensure that they are able to transmit a signal accurately, and at high speeds. Specialized cells called oligodendrocytes provide this insulation to neurons by wrapping the axons in an insulating material called myelin. Without this myelin sheath, neuronal communication becomes nearly impossible, and neurons become susceptible to damage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease which ultimately leads to the inability of neurons to communicate amongst themselves. Because multiple sclerosis is not selective for specific neurons, and can progress through the brain and spinal cord randomly, each patient's symptoms may vary considerably. During the initial stages of the disease, symptoms often emerge for a finite time before regressing for an extended period. 4 Pathology of Disease Progression Demyelination MS is an immuno-inflammatory disease in which immune cells enter the central nervous system (CNS) and destroy the myelin sheath. Immune cells, which become activated through complex mechanisms migrate into the CNS, and attack the myelin sheath. The resultant demyelination is thought to be carried out by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages, three primary classes of immune cells, which are routinely found in MS lesions.2 Loss of myelin followed by subsequent lack of neural communication and neuronal death is accepted as the primary cause of disability in MS patients.3 Axonal transection, or the severing of axons, occurs under conditions of both acute and chronic demyelination.4-6 Remyelination Remyelination is the process by which demyelinated axons are naturally re-wrapped with myelin, restoring nerve conduction and functionality.7 This phenomenon is the result of oligodendrocytes repairing the damage to the myelin sheath that occurs during an episode of increased disease activity. However, as the disease progresses over years (usually decades) the oligodendrocytes begin to lose their ability to repair the damage, and symptoms become progressively worse and episodes more frequent due to remyelination failure. In addition to developing therapies that slow MS disease progression, many laboratories are developing novel therapeutics that aim to promote remyelination and reverse existing CNS damage. Inflammation In addition to immune-mediated loss of myelin, another characteristic feature of MS is inflammation caused by a class of white blood cells called T cells.8,9 Some of the damage in the CNS is directly carried out by two subpopulations of T lymphocytes called T helper 1 and T helper 17 which produce pro-inflammatory factors.10 Recent studies have identified that chemical mediators, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), contribute to the autoimmune characteristics of these T cells. Data suggest absence of these pro-inflammatory signals was sufficient to prevent inflammation in the brain.11 This suggests that therapeutic strategies directed at blocking the production of inflammatory mediators could be effective for treating MS. Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Panacea? Mainstream medicine has failed to recognize the pivotal role of vitamin D in regulating the overactive immune system in MS patients. Greater than 30 years have passed since vitamin D was originally hypothesized to be an important environmental determinant of the prevalence of MS.12,13 During the three decades following the initial linking of vitamin D and MS, evidence has continued to mount. It is now known that MS occurs more frequently in individuals with lower blood levels of vitamin D. A study published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association found that, compared to those with the highest vitamin D blood levels, those with the lowest blood levels were 62% more likely to develop MS. MS attacks occur less frequently during seasons corresponding with the highest exposure to sunlight; since vitamin D synthesis depends upon exposure of the skin to sunlight, the summer months also bring the highest blood levels of vitamin D.14 A recent study has quantified the impact of vitamin D blood levels on risk for MS relapse—for each 4 ng/ml increase in 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the blood, the risk for MS relapse is reduced by 12%. The investigators who conducted this study concluded that ""Clinically, raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels by [20 ng/ml] could halve the hazard of a relapse.""15 Vitamin D mediates these disease-modifying effects through complex and powerful interactions with the immune system. Hostile immune cells, which attack the myelin sheath, are calmed upon exposure to vitamin D. In fact, when aggressive immune cells taken directly from MS patients are exposed to the active form of vitamin D, the cells divide and reproduce much more slowly, indicating that vitamin D has the ability to impede the aberrant autoimmunity that is a driving force in MS. However, vitamin D does more than just arrest damaging immune cells; it also supercharges protective immune cells. T-reg cells are specialized components of the immune system that help keep immunity balanced. If too few T-reg cells are present, the immune system becomes overactive, as in autoimmune diseases like MS. Vitamin D increases the number of protective T-reg cells, restoring equilibrium to an overactive immune system.16 In a randomized controlled trial, supplementation with doses of vitamin D ranging from 10,000 IU to 40,000 IU daily over the course of 52 weeks resulted in a reduction in relapses and a reduction in the number of aggressive immune cells in patients with MS.17 Despite robust findings across a range of studies on the link between vitamin D and MS, mainstream medicine and the federal government have only just recently begun to realize the need to initiate federally funded trials. Results of a large scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the effects of vitamin D in MS are currently pending.1 Life Extension customers should not be surprised if vitamin D emerges as a frontline treatment for MS in the coming years. However, instead of waiting for mainstream physicians to begin recommending vitamin D to MS patients, Life Extension suggests all individuals monitor their blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and maintain a blood level of 50–80 ng/mL. This is because low vitamin D levels are also an emerging risk factor for numerous other diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.18-22 The amount of supplementation required to achieve this blood level varies from person to person, but it appears many individuals require supplementation of 5,000‒8,000 IU vitamin D daily to reach these levels. More information about the role of vitamin D in health is available in the compelling Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""Startling Findings About Vitamin D Levels in Life Extension Members."" 5 Risk Factors for MS Genetics and Family History Studies have established a definitive role for genetics as contributing factor for developing MS. The most compelling data reveal that while unrelated adopted siblings have a 0‒2% disease risk, identical twins demonstrate a 25% disease risk.23 Several studies have identified susceptibility genes related to many aspects of immune function.24-28 While these genetic links are helpful in understanding MS population clusters, findings such as the 25% disease risk among identical twins and the geographic distribution of MS suggest that up to 75% of MS must be attributable to non-genetic or environmental factors. Infection Infection is one of the more widely suspected non-genetic risk factors for MS. Data suggest that, in genetically predisposed individuals, exposure to an infectious agent may lead to MS.29 One common theory, molecular mimicry, proposes that presentation of foreign antigens that are molecularly similar to self-antigens leads to an autoimmune response.30,31 In other words, viruses involved in the development of autoimmune diseases could possibly display very similar proteins to the proteins found on nerves making these nerves also a target for antibodies. Investigators have probed the involvement of several viruses including: herpes simplex virus (HSV), rubella, measles, mumps, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV).32 Currently, the strongest evidence for the involvement of an infectious agent implicates EBV. Virtually all patients who have MS are infected with the EBV.32 Further, levels of antibodies to EBV are strongly correlated with the risk of developing the disease.33 Low Vitamin D Levels Considering the regulatory role that vitamin D plays in immune system reactivity, it is not surprising that population-based studies have consistently found lower levels of vitamin D in the blood of patients with MS compared to healthy control subjects. Data from the Nurses' Health Study (more than 92,000 women followed from 1980 to 2000) and the Nurses' Health Study II (more than 95,000 women followed from 1991 to 2001), support the notion of a protective effect for vitamin D against the risk of developing MS. The incidence of MS was 33% lower in women that consumed the most vitamin D as compared to those that consumed the least. In addition, those that consumed at least 400 IU daily of vitamin D from supplements had an astounding 41% lower incidence of MS.18 In a recent study, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco discovered low 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels in African Americans with MS as compared to controls.34 The senior author, who is also the associate director of UCSF Multiple Sclerosis Center concluded, ""It seems relatively clear low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis."" Hormones Studies have shown that MS is more common in women than men, and that the disease course is affected by the fluctuation of steroid hormones during the female menstrual cycle.35 It is also widely reported that MS patients who become pregnant experience a significant decrease in relapses, enabling women who have MS to bear children safely.36 Animal models of multiple sclerosis have shown that the pregnancy hormone, estriol, can ameliorate disease and can cause an immune shift.36,37 Other studies note that pregnant women who have MS tend to experience a rebound of their disease within three months post-delivery.38 These findings suggest hormones can regulate the course of MS, and this theory is further supported by research demonstrating that steroid hormones (eg, estrogens, testosterone, progesterone, and, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) can modulate the immune system.39-41 The specific relationship of hormones to the disease process of MS is complex, with ratios between the individual hormones also playing a role. For example, during a human study that examined the presence of MS lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients with high estradiol and low progesterone levels had more lesions that those who had low levels of both hormones. Further, patients with a high estrogen to progesterone ratio had a significantly greater number of ""active,"" inflamed lesions than patients who had a low ratio.42 These studies suggest that maintaining youthful hormone balance may ease the symptoms of MS. A study from Italy provided further evidence that abnormal hormone levels may play a role in the development of MS. The investigators measured hormone levels in 35 women and 25 men with MS, and in 36 people without the disease. Women with low testosterone levels were found to have more brain tissue damage, as determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The women with MS had lower levels of testosterone throughout their monthly cycle compared to women who did not have the condition. Testosterone levels did not vary between men with MS and unaffected men. However, men with MS who had the highest levels of the female hormone estradiol were found to have the greatest degree of brain tissue damage.43 More information about optimizing and balancing hormone levels can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols. Organic Solvents In the mid-1990s, researchers in Sweden evaluated 13 studies investigating the connection between solvent exposure and autoimmune disease. Organic solvents include chemicals such as toluene, paint thinner, and acetone, the latter of which is commonly found in nail polish remover. Ten of those studies indicated a significant relationship between organic solvent exposure and MS. All of the analyses suggested exposure to solvents increases a person's relative risk of developing MS.44 In another study scientists analyzed the occupational health records of more than 57,000 workers in Norway, covering a 16-year period. They concluded that workers, such as painters, who are routinely exposed to organic solvents, had twice the risk of developing MS than those who were not occupationally exposed. These results were compatible with the hypothesis that organic solvents are a possible risk factor for MS.45 Individuals interested in protecting themselves from organic solvents and other environmental toxins should read Life Extension's ""Metabolic Detoxification"" protocol. Food Sensitivities Sensitivities to certain foods may also play a role in the development or exacerbation of MS. Antibodies to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, is more common in patients with MS.46,47 MS is also most prevalent in areas where consumption of wheat gluten and milk are also high.48 This relationship led scientists to explore a possible link between antibodies produced to bovine milk proteins and the ability of those antibodies to cross-react to the protective sheathes around nerves triggering an MS episode. Indeed, this immunologic cross-reactivity has been demonstrated in the laboratory in rodents that have MS.49,50 Further investigations have revealed that in MS patients, higher levels of these antibodies are produced within the central nervous system.51 Additional studies are still needed to understand how this cross-reactivity plays into the development and progression of MS. To help rule out food sensitivities, Life Extension suggests blood testing such as the Food Safe Allergy test and the Celiac Disease Antibody Screen. Call 800-226-2370 for more information on how to obtain this type of testing. Additional information about food allergies is available in the Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""What's Really Making You Sick?"" Smoking A recently published literature review, evaluating more than 3,000 MS cases and 450,000 controls, supports the emerging consensus that smoking increases the risk of developing MS by approximately 50%.52 It is unlikely that smoking alone accounts for the worldwide variation in MS prevalence, and thus, the interplay between genetic markers and smoking has also been investigated. One such study reported that smokers that have two known genetic markers for MS had two times the risk for developing MS than their non-smoking counterparts.53 Another study has also verified that smokers diagnosed with MS but in remission have 3.5 times the risk of reactivating and progression of their disease than their non-smoking counterparts.54,55 6 Symptoms and Diagnosis MS can affect people of all ages; however, the average age of disease onset is between 20 and 40 years.48 Fatigue, numbness in the limbs, impaired vision, muscle weakness, loss of balance, and bladder dysfunction are frequent symptoms. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers.48 Symptoms affecting mobility tend to appear early in the course of MS and they may include weakness, clumsiness, leg dragging, stiffness, and a tendency to drop objects. Common sensory symptoms include numbness, sensations of heaviness, tingling, and electrical sensations. Visual symptoms are also common, affecting more than one-third of all people who have MS. The classic visual disturbances, such as blurred or foggy vision and eyeball pain, usually appear early in the course of the disease. MS can also interfere with the nerves that supply the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which is where balance is perceived. This can result in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. In the later stages of the disease, involvement of the genitourinary tract may result in loss of bladder, sexual, and bowel function.56 Over 40% of MS patients suffer from changes in memory, reasoning, spatial perception, and verbal fluency.57 Symptoms of MS are often triggered or worsened by an increase in body temperature. MS is a tremendously variable and unpredictable disease. Different patients will experience different symptoms, rates of disease progression, and responses to treatment. Four Disease Courses Have Been Identified in MS Progressive relapsing (PR) MS, which is the least common disease course, shows progression of disability from onset but with clear acute relapses, with or without full recovery. Approximately 5% of people with MS appear to have PRMS at diagnosis. Secondary progressive (SP) MS begins with an initial relapsing-remitting disease course, followed by progression of disability. Typically, secondary-progressive disease is characterized by: less recovery following attacks, persistently worsening functioning during and between attacks, and accompanied by progressive disability. Many patients with RRMS do develop SPMS ultimately. Primary progressive (PP) MS is characterized by progression of disability from onset, without plateaus or remissions or with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements. A person with PPMS, by definition, does not experience acute attacks. Ten percent of diagnosed MS are PPMS. Relapsing remitting (RR) MS represents 85% of clinical diagnoses of the disease. It is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks with full recovery or with residual deficit upon recovery. Periods between disease relapses are characterized by a lack of disease progression. Diagnosis No single test gives a definitive diagnosis for MS, and variable symptoms and disease course make early diagnosis a challenge. Most presumptive diagnoses of MS are based on the clinical symptoms seen in an acute attack. These presumptions are then supported by a combination of diagnostic imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), antibody testing of the fluid found in the CNS, measurements to evaluate how efficiently nerves conduct impulses (since demyelination slows nerve conduction) and evaluation of how the symptoms progress through time.58 7 Conventional Therapies A cure for MS has yet to be discovered, and although recent efforts have brought advances in available treatments, substantial room for improvement remains. Presently, conventional medical treatment typically focuses on strategies to treat acute attacks, to slow the progression of the disease, and to treat symptoms. Conventional Medical Treatments to Treat Acute Disease Flares Corticosteroids. For acute MS flares, corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are commonly administered in high doses to suppress the immune system and decrease the production of proinflammatory factors. These drugs are often prescribed for short periods and can be effective at alleviating the symptoms of MS. Corticosteroids should not be used for long-term therapy, however, because of their many side effects, including increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cataracts, elevated blood sugar, mood swings and weight gain. Also, while corticosteroids may reduce the symptoms of the disease, they have no effect on its progression.59 Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). Plasmapheresis is a process in which whole blood is separated into blood cells and plasma, the liquid part of blood. In MS patients the plasma contains unusually high levels of antibodies and proinflammatory factors that exacerbate symptoms. Plasma exchange helps remove these factors quickly and is sometimes used to help combat severe symptoms of multiple sclerosis relapses in people who are not responding to intravenous steroids. Conventional Medical Treatment to Modify the Course of the Disease Beta interferons. Beta interferons (Avonex, Betaseron) reduce inflammation and slow progression of the disease, but like many medications used in conventional medical treatment of MS, the mechanism of action is poorly understood60,61 This specific treatment may be accompanied by adverse effects such as suicidal depression, liver damage, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions.62 Glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is an MS treatment that yields fewer adverse side effects than beta interferon while still remaining clinically effective. Glatiramer has a chemical structure similar to the protective myelin sheath around nerves and serves as a decoy for antibodies that would otherwise attack this sheath.63 Side effects may include flushing, rapid heartbeat, nausea, shortness of breath after injection, and injection site reactions.64 Mitoxantrone and fingolimod. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) and fingolimod (Gilenya) are immunosuppressants. Clinical data show these drugs can slow the rates at which disability progresses and the rate at which new lesions form in the brain and spinal cord. These therapies, however, are not used as a first-line treatment as they can cause severe side effects including heart disease, leukemia, decreased white blood cell counts, and increased rates of infection.65 Natalizumab. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is thought to block a protein that allows white blood cells to enter the brain and spinal cord and cause disease progression in MS. Due to an association with three cases of a potentially fatal infection of the CNS,66 this is a controversial drug that is only available for patients enrolled in the Tysabri Outreach Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH) program.67 This medication is reserved for people who do not see results from other types of treatments. Dalfampridine. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medication approved in 2010 that increases the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses.68 This drug represents a new class of therapies that is aimed at addressing neurologic deficits directly. Medications to Treat Symptoms Muscle relaxants. Multiple sclerosis patients may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in the legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may improve muscle spasticity. However, baclofen may increase weakness in the legs, and tizanidine may cause drowsiness or a dry mouth. Medications to reduce fatigue. Drugs such as amantadine (Symmetrel) may help reduce fatigue. Other medications. Medications may also be prescribed for depression, pain and bladder or bowel control problems that may be associated with multiple sclerosis. Medications on the Horizon There are approximately 20 experimental therapies that are on the pathway to approval by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA). Investigators are making progress toward developing treatments that may be capable of protecting the CNS as well as encouraging repair of brain and spinal cord lesions. Many of these drugs are potentially valuable as treatments for MS, but are months or years from traversing all phases of the FDA process. Laquinimod. Laquinimodhas been shown to decrease proinflammatory factors and increase factors that promote nerve protection without increasing risk of infection. Laquinimod was well tolerated by most patients, with only a few reports of adverse effects.69 Alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is an antibody specific for mature white blood cells that targets them for destruction by the immune system. This drug is approved for the treatment of certain types of lymphoma and leukemia. In one study, it was shown to be more effective than beta interferon in reducing disability progression and relapse rate, however, the trial was discontinued early due to serious side effects.70 Fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a substance that has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and shows promise in MS to decrease white blood cell infiltration into the spinal cord.71 Therapy and Rehabilitation to Improve Quality of Life In addition to one or more drug-based therapies, MS patients will often participate in rehabilitation programs intended to maintain or improve their ability to perform at home and at work. More specifically these programs focus on general fitness and aim to address problems related to mobility, speech and swallowing, and cognitive deficits. Common rehabilitation strategies include: Physical therapy. Practices that aide mobility and functionality through structured physical activity on a scheduled basis. Occupational therapy. Skills aimed at using work, self-care, and leisure activities to foster development and limit disability. Speech therapy. Work with speech therapists can help MS patients overcome speech and language difficulties and help with troublesome swallowing. Cognitive rehabilitation. Assistance in managing difficulties with memory, high order thinking, and perception. A variety cognitive rehabilitation options are available. For example, playing chess regularly is a great way to promote neuronal function and communication; computer-based ""brain training"" programs are also helpful. Vocational rehabilitation. Support in making career plans, gaining job skills, and approaches to remaining gainfully employed. 8 Multiple Sclerosis Nutritional Protocol Most patients that employ complementary treatments for MS do so as an accompaniment with conventional drug treatments and find both classes of therapy to provide clinical benefits.72 The following section outlines key details and evidence-based findings concerning the latest complementary approaches to treating MS. Vitamin D As previously mentioned, mainstream medicine has overlooked a critical missing link in MS management—vitamin D. This hormone-like vitamin is capable of safely interacting directly with the genome to modulate a variety of physiological functions, including aspects of immune function involved in autoimmune diseases like MS. Two human clinical trials demonstrated that individuals with MS using vitamin D tended to have fewer relapses and less inflammation.17,73,74 In a year-long Vitamin D study, recurrence rate of MS ""attacks"" was 27% lower compared to baseline.74 In another large-dose Vitamin D trial, MS patients given 28,000‒280,000 IU weekly were found to have fewer active lesions during the 28-week long study.75 In light of the accumulating epidemiological and clinical evidence of the importance of vitamin D in this disease, supplementing the diet with vitamin D appears to be a low cost means to address this risk. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are polyunsaturated FAs which cannot be synthesized in humans and therefore must be provided via dietary sources. Both plant and animal foods are potential sources of omega-3 FAs. For example, linolenic acid, found in flaxseed, flaxseed oil, and preferably, fish and fish oils have very high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A small study looking at the effects of omega-3 FAs on MS found that immune cells from treated patients and healthy controls produced significantly fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines after three months of treatment with 6 grams of fish oil per day.76 One double-blind placebo-controlled study exists to date looking at the effect of omega-3 FAs on MS disease progression. In this study 312 patients were given either fish oil or olive oil placebo for two years. The results of this trial exhibited a trend toward decreased disease severity in the omega-3 FA group when compared with control.77 More recent studies have shown that MS patients given 10 grams of fish oil per day for three months exhibited significantly reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a factor correlated with disease progression, and also had greater concentrations of omega-3 FAs in their red blood cell membranes.78 Other work has shown that MS patients, while on a low-fat diet with omega-3 FA supplementation, experienced significantly reduced fatigue and lower relapse rates.79 Based upon clinical data and patient accounts, omega-3 FAs appear to be well tolerated and safe with no reports of adverse events. Linoleic Acid and Omega-6 Fatty Acids Linoleic acid is converted to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a beneficial omega-6 FA, after it is taken orally. However, this conversion is occasionally impaired, especially during inflammatory disease states.48,80 GLA has been shown to quell inflammation and research involving an animal model of MS has demonstrated that GLA administration significantly improved clinical outcomes when compared with control treatment.81 Some studies have shown significantly reduced relapse rates and disease progression scores, while others have found no differences between treatment and control groups.81-83 A closer look at data from these trials revealed that patients with lower levels of disability at the beginning of the trial exhibited a smaller increase in disability over the study period than did controls. In addition, linoleic acid was found to reduce the severity and duration of MS episodes in patients at all levels of disease severity.84 Selenium and Vitamin E Patients who have MS tend to have abnormally low levels of glutathione peroxidase, a powerful endogenous antioxidant.85,86 Researchers in Denmark conducted a small study in which patients with MS were given an antioxidant mixture containing about 2,000 mcg selenium, 2 grams vitamin C, and 480 mg vitamin E once daily for five weeks. Although glutathione peroxidase levels were initially lower in patients with MS than in normal control subjects, after five weeks of antioxidant therapy, levels of this antioxidant enzyme increased five-fold and reported side effects were minimal.85 ""[O]xidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. This finding also suggests the importance of antioxidants in diet and therapy of MS patients.""87 N-Acetylcysteine An effective strategy for increasing the body's supply of the powerful antioxidant glutathione is taking the oral supplement N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant that serves as a precursor to glutathione.48,88 NAC's potential benefit in the context of MS has been noted by some researchers.48,89 In a rodent MS model, NAC was able to diminish clinical symptoms and pathological evidence of CNS injury, and attenuate inflammation.90 Lipoic Acid Lipoic acid (LA) is a dietary supplement with antioxidant properties and has been studied specifically in MS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated primarily by immune cells, are implicated as mediators of demyelination and nerve damage.91,92 Known to cross the blood-brain barrier, LA decreases the activity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. It is believed that ICAM-1 and other adhesion molecules are responsible for allowing certain pro-inflammatory immune cells, like T-lymphocytes, to enter the CNS, paving the way for induction or exacerbation of inflammation and tissue damage.93-95 In an animal MS model, LA produced a significant reduction of demyelination and infiltration of the CNS by T lymphocytes.96-98 Other researchers have followed up on these studies. In a pilot clinical trial, 37 patients with MS were randomly assigned to receive various doses of LA (up to 2,400 mg/day) or placebo. After two weeks, patients were assessed for levels of ICAM-1 and tolerability of high-dose LA. In addition to being well tolerated by patients, LA treatment was associated with reduced ICAM-1 levels and reduced T-cell migration into the CNS.99 Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is an essential part of healthy mitochondrial function and energy production with potential usefulness in treating MS. Decreased levels of CoQ10 are associated with many disease states, including heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.100,101 CoQ10 was low in patients with MS.102 Several clinical trials of CoQ10 have been performed in neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.103 CoQ10 is a powerful lipid-soluble antioxidant that is also capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E in the body. Based upon clinical evidence, CoQ10 appears to be well tolerated and safe with potential usefulness in the management of MS. Vitamin B12 Some data suggest patients with MS have abnormally low levels of vitamin B12 in their cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, or both.104 In fact, clinical vitamin B12 deficiency and MS share remarkably similar characteristics, occasionally rendering correct diagnosis difficult.105 Notably, vitamin B12 plays a key role in the generation of myelin and thus, for decades, integrative physicians have prescribed B12 injections for patients who have MS. Data suggest patients given vitamin B12 supplements have experienced clinical improvements in their symptoms.48 For example, in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the effects of six months of vitamin B12 (1 mg/week injection) on 138 patients with MS. The researchers concluded that the clinical course of patients with MS improved after beginning vitamin B12 treatment.106 Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo biloba extracts are primarily composed of flavonoids and terpenoids and have been reported to have properties that can influence neural activity and improve cognitive performance. While controlled trials of the effects of ginkgo biloba on cognitive function have generated inconsistent findings, more recent studies found encouraging results for patients with MS.107-109 In one study, patients received 120 mg of ginkgo biloba extract or placebo twice per day for 12 weeks. Those patients taking ginkgo biloba exhibited improved measures of attention and reported fewer difficulties with memory. Green Tea (Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate) Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of many active ingredients of green tea that have been reported to have beneficial effects on the nervous and immune systems. In an animal study of MS, ECGC was found to prevent severity of clinical signs by decreasing inflammation and protecting nerve cells.110 According to animal research, green tea has the ability to significantly increase regulatory T cells which are critical to providing balance to the immune system and suppressing autoimmunity.111 Curcumin Curcumin is an active component of turmeric, a popular Indian spice. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent anti-inflammatory effects.112 A research group carrying out animal studies has demonstrated exciting findings that curcumin treatment results in a significant reduction in disease severity and a reduction in duration of acute attacks.113 In a follow-up study, laboratory researchers found curcumin not only suppressed disease severity, but also was associated with reduction of levels of IL-17 a cytokine that has been directly implicated in the progression of MS.114 Biotin Biotin, a water-soluble B-complex vitamin, is sometimes referred to as vitamin B7. Biotin participates in biochemical reactions catalyzed by decarboxylase enzymes, supporting energy production and fatty acid and myelin synthesis.115,116 The Adequate Intake for biotin is 30 micrograms, and low-to-moderate amounts are common in multivitamin supplements.117,118 Biotin's role in neuron functioning is evidenced by its therapeutic effect in a rare genetic disease known as biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease.118 Children affected by this disease experience progressive neurological dysfunction, including speech and motor dysfunction, mental retardation, seizures, and possibly death. Early treatment with biotin and thiamine (vitamin B1) appears to prevent progression in most cases.119,120 More recently, researchers have been exploring biotin's potential benefits in patients with MS. In the first clinical trial to demonstrate the potential of high-dose biotin in MS therapy, 23 patients with progressive MS were treated with 100–300 mg biotin daily for an average of 9.2 months. While improvements were not seen for two to eight months after initiating biotin therapy—suggesting biotin may instigate a slow and progressive repair of MS-related nerve damage—vision improved in all four participants with MS-related optic nerve injury, and motor function and overall disability improved in 16 of 18 participants (89%) with prominent spinal cord involvement.116,118 In a randomized controlled trial, 154 patients with progressive MS received either 100 mg biotin three times daily or placebo for 12 months. Thirteen (12.6%) of the biotin-treated subjects versus none of the placebo subjects exhibited improvements in measures of MS-related disability after nine months that persisted through the end of the trial. In addition, only 4.2% of biotin-treated subjects compared with 13.6% of placebo subjects had progressively worsening disability scores at nine months. At the end of the 12 months, placebo subjects were switched to high-dose biotin, and overall stabilization of disability was seen in all subjects at a 24-month follow-up.121 Biotin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients have been observed to be lower than those of healthy people, leading to speculation that low biotin availability may contribute to the pathology of MS.122 Although the mechanism of biotin's ability to prevent or repair nerve damage is unknown, biotin may prevent progressive demyelination by improving mitochondrial function, increasing brain energy production, supporting myelin production by increasing lipid synthesis, and affecting gene expression.118,123 Biotin is excreted through the urinary system, and high doses appear to be well tolerated in trials to date.118,124 However, high doses of biotin may interfere with certain lab tests, including thyroid function tests, leading to misdiagnosis of thyrotoxicosis.117,125,126 In addition, the possibility of teratogenicity has been suggested by animal research124; therefore, the safety of high-dose biotin in pregnancy is not established. Swank Diet Dr. Roy Swank first proposed a connection between increased consumption of saturated animal fat and the incidence of MS in 1950.127 He conducted a study which enrolled 208 patients with MS in the early 1950s, all of whom had experienced at least two acute relapses, and followed their progress over 34 years.128 In this study, patients maintained the now termed Swank diet, which consists of: less than 15 grams/day of saturated animal fat, 10‒15 grams/day of vegetable oil, 5 grams/day of cod liver oil, and one multivitamin. Long-term follow-up results from this study indicate that the patients adhering to the Swank diet experienced reduced MS disease activity and progression of disability when compared to patients that did not follow the regimen. While these results are encouraging, this trial is criticized for its lack of a proper control group and un-blinded design. Nevertheless, the Swank diet remains one of the most popular complementary approaches to treating MS. Swank Low-Fat Diet: Detailed Guidelines Saturated fat should remain less than 15 grams per day Unsaturated fat should be approximately 20‒50 grams per day No red meat should be consumed during the first year After the first year, a maximum of 3 oz. of red meat per week Dairy products must have 1% butterfat or less Processed foods containing saturated fat should not be eaten A source of omega-3, a multivitamin, and a mineral supplement are recommended daily Wheat, gluten or dairy product quantities are not restricted, unless they are foods which cause allergies or reactions. 9 Hormone Therapy Because women often experience improvement of MS symptoms while pregnant, hormone therapy using estrogen has been studied as a treatment for the disease. In human studies, estriol treatment (8 mg/day) in nonpregnant women with MS was associated with reduced lesion numbers and lesion volumes and when treatment ceased, these values returned to levels observed before treatment.37 Patients given estriol also had enhanced cognitive function. With respect to immune studies, estriol was associated with reduced pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production and these changes correlated well with the reduced formation of lesions.39 Other studies have shown that male MS patients treated with 10 mg of testosterone exhibited improved cognitive performance and reduced brain atrophy, although MRI data showed no change in lesion formation.129 In another similar study, testosterone treatment in males was associated with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and increased production of neuroprotective factors.130 There is currently debate among researchers about the role of hormones with MS and how that relationship may be exploited as a means of therapy. Some studies argue for hormone replacement as a new therapeutic approach.131 More information can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols.

What are the organs that make up the excretory system? What systems work together to make up the excretory system? The urinary, respiratory, skin and digestive system all work together to make up the excretory system. This includes organs like the lungs, kidneys and large intestines. Uh your whole digestive system. Specifically your large intestine, where your feces are expelled. You can include your kidneys, for they dispose of urine. What are organs that make up the various systems of an earthworm? Reproductive System, Nervous System, Digestive System, Circulatory System Doesn't it also include the Excretory system, the Muscular System, and Endocrine system? simply cells make up tissue , tissue makes up organs , organs make the organ system so it basically has organs . A fact about organs is that you need cells and tissue to make up organs. because cells make up tissue and tissue makes up organs and organs make up organ system and an organ system makes up organism which are how humans are made up by. Organs work in conjunction to make up an organ system. If a complex biological system has to function properly, the organs that make it up have to work in a co-ordinated way in orger to obtain a common objective: energy generation and storage.Here are the systems at work in your body:Circulatory systemDigestive systemEndocrine systemExcretory systemIntegumentary systemLymphatic systemMuscular systemNervous systemReproductive systemReproductive systemRespiratory systemSkeletal systemFor more answers see the related link below.An organ system refers to a group of organs in the human body that work together to achieve a vital body-function.An organ system consists of a group of organs that work together to carry out bodily functions. The digestive system is one example of an organ system.Organisms the skeletal system, lymph system, circulatory system, the muscle system, digestive system, respiratory system, the excretory system, reproductive system, the nervous system, and the endocrine system are the nine Major organs that make up the human system. What are all the organs that make up the skeletal system? There are NO organs in the skeletal system. The skeletal system is made up of bones. The organs that make up the respiratory system are the mouth, nose, Trachea, Lungs and bronchial tubes. A system. :)A group of organs that work together make up a system. For example, you have a nervous system. Your brain, nerves, eyes and ears are some organs in your nervous system. This system controls your actions. What are the organs that make up the skeletal system? All tissues and organs of living organisms are made up of microscopic? cells make up tissue, tissue makes up organs, organs make up the organ system, the organ system makes up the organism. What are the differences between an organism and an organ system? Cells make up Tissues, Tissues make up organs, and organs make up body systems. (which i think you called an organ system) The major organs that make up the reproductive system is the penis in males and the vagina in females. The other organs are the gonads, more specifically the testicles and ovaries. Yes, they do. Cells are created up to make tissue which make organs which make an organ system. Organs work in conjunction to make up an organ system. Ifa complex biological system has to function properly, the organs that make it up have to work in a co-ordinated way in orger to obtain a common objective: energy generation and storage. What two body systems make up the urogenital system? Cell builds up the tissues and tissues make up organs and organs together make up a system so the only difference is that system lies in a bigger category. The skeletal system provides structural support and protection for the soft tissue found in the body. The bones are the major organs that make up the skeletal system.

Is the large intestine apart of the excretory system? No. The large intestine is part of the digestive system which consists of: the gullet, the stomach, the large and small intestine and the anus. The excretory system consists of: the kidney and the bladder Why is the cloaca listed with the digestive system excretory and reproductive systems? because cloaca is connected to oviduct which is a part of reproductive system, large intestine which is a part of digestive system and the mesonephric duct/ureter which is a part of excretory system :-) What are the parts of the body involved in the digestive system? The mouth, salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and then it goes to the excretory system. What is similar about the excretory system and the digestive system? Well, both the Digestive and Excretory system filter foods and (as my Science Teacher says: ""Materials). Also they both remove waste products. They are made up of your Esophagus, Stomach, Large Intestine, Small Intestine, Kidneys, and Bladder. Hope this helps! How do the digestive and excretory system working together? how does the excretory and the digestive system work together Does the digestive system work with excretory system? Yes. What isn't digested in the digestive system passes to the excretory system. How are the digestive system and excretory system interdependent? Well the excretory system is port of the digestive system.The excretory system pumps blood around the body and the digestive system pumps food down the body. What does the small intestine do in a digestive system? the small intestine is the part of the digestive system Is the digestive system a part of the excretory system? The digestive system has an excretory function. In particular, the digestive system stores and eliminates solid waste through the rectum and anus. Which body system is part of the excretory system? The digestive is part of the excretory system in terms of the substances having to get out of the system themselves The digestive is part of the excretory system in terms of the substances having to get out of the system themselves the digestive system is what digestie you food fool What organs are in the digestive system and the excretory system? The kidney bladder large intestine add me on moshi monsters: 333788 rate my room 5 stars How does the digestive system work with the excretory system? the excretory system uses water to clean blood, the contaminents make roughage, it is not part of the digestive system. How are the digestive system and excretory system related? The digestive system takes food and breaks it down, and the excretory takes whatever is left over. I believe that the digestive system works with the excretory system. How is the excretory and digestive system connected? The digestive system and excretory system work together to take in materials your body needs and gets rid of wastes. Uh your whole digestive system. Specifically your large intestine, where your feces are expelled. You can include your kidneys, for they dispose of urine. What is the Difference between the digestive system and the digestive tract? the difference is that the digestive tract envolves the large intestine and the digestive system envolves the small intestine What is the difference between the excretory system and the digestive system? The digestive system gets rid of solid waste, but your excretory system gets rid of liquids that your body doesn't need. Also, the digestive system transforms your food into nutrients that your body can use, but the excretory system just excretes. What do both the digestive and the excretory system have in common? The digestive and excretory system both help facilitate materials to their designated destination. The digestive system breaks down organic material to nutrients and unnecessary materials. The excretory system takes those unnecessary materials and remove them from the system. How do the circulatory system the digestive system and the excretory system work together? The Digestive system breaks down food and gets burned by your meatabolism, and the excretory system cleans out your blood by peeing.

What body system includes a transport system and a pump that keeps the transport system moving? What organ system includes the inferior vena cava? The answer is Cardiovascular system, which is a component of the Circulatory system How are the circulatory system and the circulatory system related? What type of circulatory system does a monkey have? closed circulatory system (double circulatory system) The cadiovascular system, sometimes called the circulatory system when it includes the lymphatic system. How is the circulatory system of an earthworm different from the circulatory system of mammals? the circulatory system does not have a central pump mammals have closed circulatory system and further double circulatory system. A single circulatory system is a circulatory system that does not have blood going to both lungs and body. That would be a double circulatory system.

Quality of life (QoL) has gained increasing importance in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess QoL and potentially associated factors such as depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism in patients starting glatiramer acetate (GA) in clinical practice. A prospective cohort study carried out in relapsing-remitting MS patients starting GA as first-line treatment. Patient information on QoL (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 [MSQoL-54]), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), sexual dysfunction (Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19) and work absenteeism was assessed from starting GA to week 96. Ninety-eight evaluable patients were enrolled in the study (mean age, 38.0 ± 8.4 years; female, 69.4%; mean MS duration, 42.6 ± 62.9 months; annual relapse rate since MS diagnosis, 0.4), and followed up at weeks 24 (n=96), 48 (n=94), 72 (n=89) and 96 (n=80). Patient QoL was preserved during the study, with improvements on the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health (p<0.05) and health distress (p<0.05). Depression, primary and secondary sexual dysfunction remained stable, but the number of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction decreased at week 96 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism also decreased over the study (p<0.01). Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism affected MSQoL-54 physical and mental health composites (p<0.05). QoL of our patients was preserved during the 96-week administration of GA. Though depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism impair patient QoL, they remained stable or even improved during the study. Absenteeism; Depression; Glatiramer acetate; Quality of life; Multiple sclerosis; Sexual dysfunction Quality of life assessment in patients with has gained increasing importance as it encompasses all aspects of patients lives that may be affected by the disease. Though patients quality of life worsens as multiple sclerosis progresses and physical function deteriorates, it depends not only on the disability caused by physical limitations but also on their emotional status, which may also affect the perception of wellbeing and quality of life [-]. In this scenario, depression has been shown to have a notable impact on quality of life, and is considered a significant and independent predictor of impaired quality of life [-]. Sexual dysfunction is another common and often underestimated clinical symptom of multiple sclerosis that, along with its emotional , has been shown to affect patients quality of life [,]. The information available on the impact of sexual dysfunction on quality of life, however, is still limited. The consequences of multiple sclerosis often negatively affect patients working life and may even lead to permanent unemployment []. This unemployment represents one of the factors that most modifies patients way of living as a result of its influence on their usual activities or interests and its impact on increasing emotional distress [], while sustaining employment has been shown to be associated with improved quality of life [,]. First-line disease-modifying drugs for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis including (INFb)-1a, INFb-1b and glatiramer acetate have been shown to improve the course of the disease. However, their effect on patients quality of life has not yet been fully clarified. Indeed, the information available on INFb's effect on quality of life is controversial, ranging from some benefit [] to absence of effect [-] or even to quality of life detriment []. The effect of glatiramer acetate treatment on quality of life has not been well assessed, and improvements in quality of life have been reported in treatment-naïve patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis six months after starting GA treatment that were sustained for another six months []. In light of the above, this study aimed to expand the information available on quality of life and potentially associated factors such as depression, and work absenteeism in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis starting glatiramer acetate as first-line treatment in clinical practice. This study was conducted in the Departments of at 37 Spanish hospitals in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, all its amendments and national regulations. The study was approved by the ethic committee of Hospital Donostia (San Sebastián, Spain) and all patients gave their written informed consent. Between November 2009 and November 2010, all patients meeting selection criteria who agreed to participate in the study were consecutively recruited into the study. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 to 60 years, with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, no previous treatment for multiple sclerosis and a score of 5.5 or less on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Patients were to start (Copaxone®, Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., London, United Kingdom) for multiple sclerosis treatment and must not have had any cognitive impairment that precluded understanding of the patients information sheet and informed consent form. This was a prospective cohort study conducted in patients with -remitting multiple sclerosis receiving glatiramer acetate treatment for multiple sclerosis and followed-up for two years according to clinical practice. All treatments were administered from commercial sources and according to routine clinical practice. No restrictions regarding patients treatment were specified in the study protocol. Patients information was retrieved from their medical charts at the start of glatiramer acetate treatment (baseline) and at weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96. The data retrieved at these visits included , medical history of multiple sclerosis, patients disability according to the EDSS [], quality of life measured according to scores on the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Live-54 (MSQoL-54) questionnaire [,], depression according to scores on the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [,], sexual disfunction according to the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19 (MSISQ-19), [,] and work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis according to the occurrence of work absenteeism, the number of working days missed and the causes of work absenteeism. EDSS scores, which range from 0 (normal neurological status) to 10 (death from multiple sclerosis), were obtained by the same researcher in a given patient. The MSQoL-54 questionnaire consists of 54 items distributed in 12 multiple-item scales and two single-item scales, including questions from the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey as a generic core measure and 18 additional items specific for multiple sclerosis that assess health , sexual function, overall quality of life, cognitive function and energy. Physical and mental health composite scores are calculated as a simplified two-dimension solution to MSQoL-54 questionnaire. The composites scores range from 0 (poor health) to 100 (optimal health). The BDI is composed of 21 categories of symptoms and attitudes which describe a specific behavioral manifestation of depression and consist of a graded series of four to five self-evaluative statements. Numerical values are assigned for each statement from 0 (neutral) to 3 (maximal severity) indicating the degree of severity of the manifestations of depression. Total scores range from 0 to 63, where higher scores indicate worse depressive states. Patients may also be categorized as having ups and downs considered normal if their BDI scores were 10 or less, as having mild mood disturbance if their BDI scores were between 11 and 16, as having borderline clinical depression if their BDI scores were between 17 and 20, as having moderate depression if their BDI scores were between 21 and 30, as having severe depression if their BDI scores were between 31 and 40 and as having extreme depression if their BDI scores were higher than 40. The cut-off value of at least 17 points was established as suggestive of the presence of depression. The MSISQ-19 consists of 19 items assessing the perceived influence of multiple sclerosis symptoms on sexual activity and satisfaction. Scores on the MSISQ-19 show the presence of primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction. Primary sexual dysfunction occurs as a result of neurologic changes related to multiple sclerosis that directly affect sexual feelings and/or sexual response, secondary sexual dysfunction refers to physical changes related to multiple sclerosis that affect the sexual response indirectly and tertiary sexual dysfunction refers to psychological, emotional, social and cultural aspects of multiple sclerosis that impact upon sexuality. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, measured according to scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire. Sample size was calculated to fulfill the primary objective of the study. At the time of study design, the only data available on the impact of multiple sclerosis therapy on quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire was reported by Simone et al., who found that multiple sclerosis patients followed up for two years experienced a decrease of six or more points in 80% of MSQoL-45 measurements (dimensions and summary composite scores), with an standard deviation of approximately 20 points []. Taking into account these data, an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a two-sided analysis, the number of evaluable patients needed to be enrolled into the study to detect a difference of six or more points in MSQoL-54 scores would be of 92 patients; considering a percentage of missing data of 20% or lower, e.g. due to non-evaluable patients, the total sample size would be of 110 patients. Analysis of the primary endpoint included the calculation of mean scores and standard deviations (SD) of both physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study. Comparison of these scores during the study was performed using the repeated measures general linear model. Comparison of scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline with those reported at week 24, 48, 72 and 96 were also performed using paired t-tests. The secondary endpoints included assessment of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism at baseline. Other secondary endpoints were the change in depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism during the study and their impact on patients quality of life. The distribution of patients according to the following categories of the BDI was calculated as the frequency and valid percentage in each study visit: ups and downs considered normal (BDI scores, =10), mild mood disturbance (BDI scores, 11-16), borderline clinical depression (BDI scores, 17-20), moderate depression (BDI scores, 21-30), severe depression (BDI scores, 31-40) and extreme depression (BDI scores, >40). The overall frequency of patients with depression, which was defined as a BDI score =17, was also calculated. Comparison of mean BDI scores and the proportion of patients within the above categories during the study was performed using paired t-tests and McNemars tests, respectively. The impact of depression on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire reported by patients with those without depression using t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. The frequencies and valid percentages of patients with primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores were calculated in each study visit. The overall frequency of sexual dysfunction in each study visit was also assessed according to patients with at least one of these categories (primary, secondary or tertiary sexual dysfunction). Changes during the study were assessed using McNemars tests. The impact of sexual dysfunction on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire between patients without sexual dysfunction and those with any kind of sexual dysfunction by using Mann-Whitney tests. Work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis was assessed according to the frequency and valid percentage of patients missing at least one day from work, the mean (SD) number of working days missed and the causes for work absenteeism. Changes in the frequency of patients absent from work and the number of working days missed during the study were assessed using McNemars tests and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. The impact of work absenteeism on patients quality of life was assessed by comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire in patients at least one day absent from work versus those with no day absent from work using Mann-Whitney tests. A correction method for multiple testing was not performed in the statistical analysis for the present study due to the controversy about its use in observational studies leading to potential risks and errors [,]. Further information on this subject is provided in Appendix 1. Missing data were not considered in the analyses and a significance level of 0.05 was used for statistical testing. The statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). A total of 101 patients agreed to participate in the study, three of whom were excluded from the analysis due to insufficient available data. Therefore, the evaluable population comprised a total of 98 patients, whose characteristics are described in Table 1. Patients disposition during the study is shown in Figure 1. When paired comparisons were performed to assess differences in EDSS scores from baseline, it was shown that the mean EDSS scores remained stable throughout the study period but with a slight tendency to improvement at week 96 (mean [SD], 1.1 [0.3] versus 1.0 [0.2], p=0.058). In addition, the proportion of patients with minimal disability slightly increased and the proportion of patients with moderate disability that did not need any technical aid slightly decreased, though not significantly, reaching 95.0% (n=76) and 5.0% (n=4) of patients, respectively, at week 96. Even though scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire improved slightly during the 96-week study period, the results obtained from the repeated measures general linear model showed that statistically significant differences were not attained in either the physical or mental health composites (Figure 3). Similarly, comparison of scores on the physical and mental health composites between baseline and weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 only showed statistically significant differences in the mental health composite at week 72, in which the scores were significantly higher than baseline (mean [SD], 70.6 [15.3] versus 73.9 [15.9], p<0.05; Figure 4). In addition, consistent statistically significant improvements from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 were observed in the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health and health distress (Figure 4). A total of 65 (66.3%) patients reported experiencing ups and downs considered normal according to the BDI at baseline, while 20 (20.4%) patients showed mild mood disturbance, 10 (10.2%) borderline clinical depression and 3 (3.1%) patients moderate depression. Therefore, a total of 13 (13.3%) patients showed overall depression (Table 2). No significant differences were found in either the mean BDI scores or the distribution of patients among the BDI categories throughout the study. The analysis of the impact of depression on patients quality of life showed that patients with depression reported worse scores on both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study period (Figure 5a). Multiple sclerosis intimacy and sexuality questionnaire-19 The overall frequency of patients with baseline sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores reached 43 (45.3%) patients, and remained stable throughout the 96-week study period. When the type of sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 was analyzed at baseline, primary sexual dysfunction was found in 31 (32.6%) patients, secondary sexual dysfunction in 21 (22.1%) patients and tertiary sexual dysfunction in 17 (17.9%) patients (Table 2). Distribution of patients with primary and secondary sexual dysfunction did not significantly change from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 or 96. However, the proportion of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction tended to decrease from baseline to week 72 (p=0.057), reaching statistically significance at week 96 (p<0.05). The presence of sexual dysfunction was shown to worsen patients quality of life, as patients with sexual dysfunction reported lower scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire during the whole study period (Figure 5b). *p<0.001; p<0.005; p<0.01; §p<0.05. D: depression; MHC: mental health composite; ND: no depression; NSD: no sexual dysfunction; NWA: no work absenteeism; PHC: physical health composite; SD: sexual dysfunction; WA: work absenteeism. At baseline, 46 (52.9%) patients reported having missed at least one day from work in the previous six months due to multiple sclerosis. The mean (SD) number of working days missed was 45.8 (56.5) days and the main reasons for work absenteeism were clinical signs of multiple sclerosis and disease relapses (Table 2). When work absenteeism was analyzed over the whole study, statistically significant decreases from baseline were observed in the proportion of patients missing at least one day from work at week 24 (p<0.01), week 48 (p<0.001), week 72 (p<0.01) and week 96 (p<0.01). Even though the number of working days missed from work decreased from baseline, statistically significant differences were only reached at week 48 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism was associated with patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, as patients absent from work reported worse scores on both the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline, week 24, week 48, week 72 and week 96 (Figure 5c). This prospective cohort study showed that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate under clinical practice conditions. Although glatiramer acetate treatment may have played a role in slowing down worsening of multiple sclerosis, this finding must be considered with caution since our patient population had intrinsically low disease activity in terms of EDSS scores and annual relapse rate. However, other studies also showed low disease activity in patients treated under clinical practice conditions [,], and another reported early gain in quality of life measured by the Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life scale in patients receiving glatiramer acetate in daily practice []. A protective effect on quality of life of other first-line treatments for multiple sclerosis such as IFNb has also been previously suggested in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis[], whose quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54, Short Form 36-Item Health Survey and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires remained stable for up to three years [-]. However, though some improvements in the physical health composite of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire have been reported after two years of treatment with IFNb [], detriments in patients quality of life have also been reported during the same duration of IFNb treatment, mainly as a result of worsening of the mental health composite []. In our study, disability, depression, primary sexual dysfunction and secondary sexual dysfunction were observed to remain stable during the study period, while tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis were significantly improved at week 96. Maintenance of disability even during 15 years of glatiramer acetate administration has been previously reported, showing a mean EDSS change of 0.6 points from the start of treatment []. However, since the EDSS is highly dependent on ambulation and does not provide information on parameters associated with patients wellbeing [], other parameters that might be potentially associated with patients wellbeing needed to be assessed. Indeed, our results support the influence of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism on the quality of life of patients with relapsing remitting-multiple sclerosis. These results are in line with previous studies reporting that multiple sclerosis patients with lifetime major depression show lower quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire, mainly in terms of energy, mental health, cognitive function, general quality of life, and emotional role limitations []. Depression measured according to the BDI or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression has been reported to be associated with both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [-], regardless of the disease-related physical disability and disease type []. Depression has been claimed to be a significant independent predictor of impaired patient quality of life measured using the MSQoL-54 and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires [-]. Patients with sexual dysfunction have also been shown to have poorer quality of life, with significantly lower scores on all scales of the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey [] and on all of scales of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire except for pain and cognitive function []. Similar detriments in quality of life were observed in unemployed versus unemployed patients, who had lower scores on most dimensions of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [,], suggesting the importance of sustained employment after the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis []. Though the low disease activity of our study patient population does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the effect of glatiramer acetate, decreased work absenteeism has previously been reported in patients receiving this agent [,]. In addition, there is no evidence that glatiramer acetate aggravates depression and it might even induce an antidepressant effect through its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activity []. Indeed, switching to glatiramer acetate has been recommended when a depressive episode is confirmed in patients receiving INFb []. Moreover, recently published data on patients switching from IFNb to glatiramer acetate [], and preliminary results from ongoing studies in patients switching to glatiramer acetate [,] showed patients quality of life remained stable or even improved. The authors acknowledge that although observational studies provide valuable information on treatments administered in clinical practice, their limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. The open-label study design, the absence of a comparator group and the potential regression to the mean effect should also be taken into account. In addition, data on other factors that might have influenced patients quality of life such as relapses, fatigue and treatment-related adverse events were not retrieved, and longer follow-up might have been needed for potential differences to become evident. The low disease activity of the study patient population precluded drawing conclusions about the effect of glatiramer acetate and may limit the representativeness of the study findings. Though caution is advisable when interpreting the study results, we consider that they still provide helpful information to physicians when treating multiple sclerosis in clinical practice. In conclusion, the study results show that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate in clinical practice conditions. Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis are factors that significantly impair patients quality of life. However, our study shows stable disability, depression and primary/secondary sexual dysfunction as well as improved tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism. The study findings should be interpreted with caution based on the low disease activity of the patient population. Further research is still needed to confirm the effect of glatiramer acetate, and to increase knowledge of other potentially associated factors, the long-term effect of multiple sclerosis therapies and the impact of the switch to glatiramer acetate on patients quality of life. There is currently no unanimity about the use of multiple test corrections (methods such as those of Bonferroni, Holm, Benjamini, etc.). In general, these methods reduce the probability of making type I errors, but they increase the probability of making type II errors. It seems cautious to prioritize minimizing the probability of type I errors over type II errors in studies where: several treatments are compared, probabilistic independence is expected between analysis groups and/or variables that would give rise to multiple tests, results have confirmatory implications for practical use. Methods of correcting for multiple testing provide solutions for these situations. However, if any of the above conditions are not a priority or are not applicable to the study, it would be cautious to minimize the probability of making a type II error rather than a type I error. Using multiple test corrections would minimize type I errors, but it would also increase the probability of type II errors, which would imply that differences that are really related to the phenomena under study would not be detected. In the present study, the effect of only one treatment was assessed during the study follow-up, and its use was supported by certain evidence of effectiveness. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume the overall absence of probabilistic independence in the measurements of variables of patients included in the study. Consequently, the authors decided to prioritize the avoidance of increasing the probability of committing type II errors. For readers who may be interested in the effect of multiple test corrections, Bonferroni correction would result in a p-value that was estimated to be of 0.0003 for the analyses carried out in this study. The authors would also like to explain that significant p-values of the study analyses were classified to be shown in the article as p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.005 or p<0.001. The data included in this appendix is intended to provide the reader interested in knowing more about multiple test corrections with some information to interpret the study results based on the multiple test correction approach used. Finally, the authors would like to advise the reader that the study conclusions should not be considered as definitive. As mentioned in the article, the study findings should be interpreted with caution and further research is still needed to confirm them.
