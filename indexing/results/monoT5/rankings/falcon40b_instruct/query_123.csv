329d04d0-a4b3-425d-9a76-e6fbc78f9399,"The thyroid gland produces 2 related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T3 and T4 are normally synthesized and released in response to a combined hypothalamic pituitary signal mediated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary and thyrotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. There is a negative feedback on TSH production from thyroid hormone concentration, primarily T3, causing total T4, total T3, free T4, and free T3 concentration to move in opposition to TSH. Thyroid gland dysfunctions can result in hyper- or hypoactivity of the thyroid. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is functionally inadequate. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may include brittle fingernails, coarsening and thinning of hair, puffy eyes, weakness, and constipation, as well as the cold intolerance and fatigue associated with the thyroid gland’s critical role in thermogenic and metabolic homeostasis. Symptoms expressing themselves later in the course of hypothyroidism are hoarseness; menstrual disorders; puffy hands, face, and feet; thickening of the skin; thinning of the eyebrows; increased cholesterol levels; muscle and/or joint aches and stiffness; slowed speech; and decreased hearing. Causes of hypothyroidism include autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, atrophic thyroiditis, and postpartum thyroiditis; iodine deficiency, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in underdeveloped areas; congenital defects; medications or treatments that can result in hypothyroidism; central hypothyroidism in which the thyroid is not stimulated by the pituitary or hypothalamus; and infiltrative processes that may damage the thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamus. These different causes of hypothyroidism are often interrelated. Usually, the exact cause of the hypothyroidism cannot be definitively determined. Both Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and atrophic thyroiditis, also known as primary myxedema, are autoimmune disorders. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the more common of the two. Atrophic thyroiditis may be viewed as the later stages of autoimmune hypothyroidism in which there is minimal residual thyroid tissue. In this stage, fibrosis of the thyroid gland is quite extensive. Myxedema is the result of increased dermal glycosaminoglycan content, which traps water resulting in skin thickening, pitting, and swelling. Often, there are no symptoms associated with atrophic hypothyroiditis for many years, and the condition remains undiagnosed until a small, palpably hard thyroid gland or abnormalities on routine thyroid function blood tests reveal the problem. If symptoms do develop, they are the usual ambiguous symptoms of hypothyroidism (i.e., fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, depression, and/or dry skin). Patients presenting in the latter stage of autoimmune thyroiditis may have: yellow tinged skin due to an accumulation of carotene Since atrophic thyroiditis manifests itself late in its progression, cardiac and neurological functions are often impaired. Carpel tunnel and other entrapment syndromes are common. However, these entrapment symptoms are not exclusive to atrophic thyroiditis, but rather can be seen with any autoimmune disorder. The trigger for the immune system attack on the thyroid is not known. Speculation about the trigger includes trauma; environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke; a genetic flaw; or virus or bacterium, although infection as a trigger is now thought of as less likely. Heredity, sex, and age are predisposing factors. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? TSH and free T4 are the usual laboratory diagnostic tools in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism due to atrophic thyroiditis, free T4 is decreased and TSH is increased. T3 is not generally reliable in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Measuring TSH, free T4, or other analytes will not identify the cause of the hypothyroidism as atrophic thyroiditis. (Table 1) increased (the more reliable test for hypothyroidism in stable thyroid status) decreased (the more reliable test for hypothyroidism in unstable thyroid status) In a patient with stable thyroid status, TSH is the more sensitive test in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, since the relationship between TSH and free T4 is log/linear. Intraindividual variation for free T4 is quite small, so any small deficiency of free T4 will be sensed by the anterior pituitary relative to the individual’s set point and cause an amplified, inverse response of TSH. In a patient with unstable thyroid status, free T4 is the more reliable indicator. Antithyroid antibodies are often useful in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism caused by an autoimmune disorder. There are 3 different antithyroid antibodies: thyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb), an antibody to a follicular enzyme involved in oxidation and organification of iodine; thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), an antibody to thyroglobulin, the protein to which the iodine is attached; and TSH receptor inhibiting immunoglobulin, which competes with TSH for receptor binding sites but does not activate them. If an antithyroid antibody is present, it is often indicative of a prior attack on thyroid tissue. Antithyroid antibodies are not present in all cases, and they sometimes can be found in patients without an autoimmune thyroid problem. Sixty percent of patients with atrophic thyroiditis have blocking thyroid stimulating receptor antibodies. TPOAb and TgAb are more frequently seen together in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? Interferences may obscure the diagnosis of atrophic thyroiditis or complicate the monitoring of the effectiveness of thyroid replacement therapy. Most thyroid testing is performed by either immunoassay in which labeled and unlabeled ligands compete for a limited number of antibody sites or immunometric assays in which an antibody is bound to a solid surface rather than an antibody. Cross reactivity of autoantibodies or heterophilic antibodies can affect diagnostic accuracy of both of these competitive binding based tests. The term heterophilic antibodies is often loosely applied to: Relatively weak antibodies with multiple activity sites known as autoantibodies seen in autoimmune disorders Broadly reactive antibodies induced by infections or exposure to therapy containing monoclonal mouse antibodies (HAMA) Human anti-animal immunoglobulins produced against well defined, specific antigens following exposure to therapeutic agents containing animal antigen or by coincidental immunization through exposure to animal antigens The latter, Human Anti-Animal Antibodies (HAAA), are strong reactors. HAMA and HAAA affect immunometric assays more than they affect simple competitive immunoassays. In immunometric assays, HAMA and HAAA can form a bridge between the capture and signal antibodies. Autoantibodies and heterophilic antibody interferences can sometimes be detected by simply using a different manufacturer’s method that employs a slightly different antibody. Tests in which dilutions are acceptable, such as total T4, total T3, or TSH, but not free T4 or free T3, may be checked for linearity of response to help identify heterophilic antibody interference. Most circulating thyroid hormones are bound to protein. Only that hormone which is free is biologically active. Variations in binding protein will cause variations in concentrations of total hormones. In general, serum TSH is less affected by binding issues than T3 and T4; and T4 is bound more tightly than T3. T3 and T4 circulate in the body bound to thyroid binding globulin (TBG); transthyretin, formally known as thyroxine binding prealbumin; and serum albumin. Physiologically, shifts toward greater total hormone binding will decrease available free hormone. Theoretically free T3 and free T4 are not affected analytically by binding. In reality all of the free methods are binding dependent to varying degrees. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, aspirin, and furosimide compete with thyroid hormone for protein binding sites and, thus, acutely increase free hormones and reduce total hormones. Eventually, a new equilibrium is reestablished in which free levels normalize at the expense of total levels. Heparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase, liberating free fatty acids, which inhibit total T4 protein binding and elevate free T4. Free fatty acids are known to affect some methods. Liver disease, androgens, and nephrotic syndrome decrease TBG, decreasing total thyroid hormones. Estrogens increase TBG, increasing total thyroid hormones. Indole acetic acid, which accumulates in uremia, may interfere with thyroid binding. Pregnancy is associated with lower albumin levels. Therefore, albumin dependent methods are not suitable for accessing thyroid status during pregnancy. TSH levels decline in the first trimester of pregnancy partly because of the increase in total T3 and T4 from increased TBG. But total T3 and T4 are also increased in the first trimester by increased Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG), which is structurally and, to some extent, functionally, similar to TSH. Glucocorticosteroids can lower T3 and inhibit TSH production. This interaction is of particular concern in sick, hospitalized patients in whom the elevated TSH in primary hypothyroidism may be obscured. Propanolol has an inhibitory effect on T4 to T3 conversion. Eighty percent of T3 is produced enzymatically in nonthyroid tissue by 5 monodeiodination of T4. Methods that use fluorescent tags may be affected by the presence of fluorophore related therapeutic or diagnostic agents. There is no confirmatory test for atrophic thyroiditis as a cause of hypothyroidism. It has been suggested that the best confirmation of hypothyroidism is an evaluation of response to a trial administration of thyroid supplement in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism. Lone TSH testing may not be predictive of autoimmune disorders in which TSH may be normal, elevated, or depressed. What Factors, If Any, Might Affect the Confirmatory Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? A combination of high free T4 and high TSH may be indicative of therapeutic noncompliance. Acute ingestion of missed levothyroxine (L-T4) just prior to a clinic visit will raise the free T4 but fail to normalize the TSH due to a “lag effect”. Free T4 is a short-term indicator, whereas TSH is a long term indicator. Since TSH is the long-term indicator, it is not influenced by time of L-T4 ingestion. When testing free T4, the daily dose of L-T4 should be withheld until after sampling, as free T4 is significantly increased above baseline for up to 9 hours after ingesting L-T4. Ideally, L-T4 should be taken prior to eating, at the same time of day each day and at least 4 hours apart from other medications. Many medications and even vitamins and minerals can influence L-T4 absorption. L-T4 should not be taken with iron supplements. Patients should not switch from brand to brand of L-T4, and prescriptions should not be written generically, as doing so will allow brand to brand switches. Although stated concentrations of L-T4 may be the same, slight variations exist between pharmaceutical manufacturers in terms of bioavailability. Also, medication storage recommendations should be scrupulously followed. Medication should be stored away from humidity, light, and increased temperatures. When ordering medication, it is best to avoid the summer for shipping. TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading during transition periods of unstable thyroid function. Often, these transition periods occur in the early phase of treatment for hyper- or hypothyroidism or after changing the dose of L-T4. It takes 6-12 weeks for pituitary TSH secretion to re-equilibrate to the new hormone status. Similar periods of unstable thyroid status may occur following an episode of thyroiditis. TSH or free T4 levels may also be diagnostically misleading in cases of abnormalities in hypothalamic or pituitary function where the usual negative feedback is not seen and TSH may remain within normal ranges. Free T4 and TSH have reduced specificity in hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness. Most hospitalized patients have low serum total T3 and free T3. These abnormalities are seen with both acute and chronic nonthyroid illness and are thought to be the result of a malfunction of central inhibition of hypothalamic releasing hormone. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry guidelines for testing of hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness recommendations are as follows: Acute or chronic nonthyroid illness has complex effects on thyroid function testing. Whenever possible, diagnostic testing should be deferred until the illness has resolved, except in cases in which there is a suggestion of presence of thyroid dysfunction. Physicians should be aware that some thyroid tests are inherently not interpretable in severely ill patients or patients receiving multiple medications. TSH in the absence of dopamine or glucocorticoid therapy is the more reliable test. TSH testing in the hospitalized patients should have a functional sensitivity of less than 0.02 mIU/L, otherwise sick, hyperthyroid patients with profoundly low TSH cannot be differentiated from patients with mild transient TSH suppression caused by nonthyroid illness. An abnormal free T4 in the presence of serious somatic disease is unreliable. In hospitalized patients, abnormal free T4 testing should reflex to total T4 testing. If both free T4 and total T4 are abnormal in the same direction, a thyroid condition may exist. Discordant free T4 and total T4 abnormalities are more likely the result of illness, medication, or a testing artifact. Total T4 abnormalities should be considered in conjunction with the severity of the patient’s illness. A low T4 in patients not in intensive care is suspicious of hypothyroidism, since low total T4 levels in hospitalized patients are most often seen in sepsis. If a low total T4 is not associated with an elevated TSH and the patient is not profoundly sick, hypothyroidism secondary to pituitary or hypothalamic deficiency should be considered. Reverse T3 formed by the loss of an iodine group from T4 in which the position of the iodine atoms on the aromatic ring is reversed is rarely helpful in the hospital setting, because paradoxically normal or low values can result from impaired renal function and low binding protein concentrations. Trimester specific reference ranges should be used in pregnancy. During pregnancy, estrogens increase TBG to 2 or 3 times prepregnancy levels. This shifts binding such that total T3 and total T4 are approximately 1.5 times nonpregnant levels at 16 weeks gestation. TSH is also altered during pregnancy. TSH is decreased in the first trimester because of the thyroid stimulating activity of HCG. The decline in TSH is associated with a modest increase in free T4 from the increased TBG. In approximately 2% of pregnancies, the increase in free T4 leads to a condition known as gestational transient thyrotoxicosis. This condition may be associated with hyperemesis. In the second and third trimester, free hormone levels decrease 20-40% below reference ranges. Pregnant patients receiving L-T4 replacement may require increased dose to maintain a normal TSH and free T4. TSH has a very short half-life of 60 minutes and is subject to circadian and diurnal variation peaking at night and reaching a nadir between 10 am and 4 pm. T4 has a much longer half-life of 7 days. It should be noted that there is a continuous decrease in the TSH/free T4 ratio from midgestation through completion of puberty. In adulthood, TSH increases in the elderly. Therefore, age related reference ranges, or at least ratio adjusted reference ranges, should be used for these analytes. For a change in value to have clinical significance, the difference should take into consideration analytical and biological variabilities. The magnitude of difference in thyroid testing values reflecting a clinical significance when monitoring a patient’s response to therapy are: Copyright © 2017, 2013 Decision Support in Medicine, LLC.

Can You Tell If You Have Hypothyroidism by Looking at Your Hands? Can You Tell If You Have Hypothyroidism by Looking at Your Hands? Topic Guide , or underactive thyroid, is a common endocrine disorder that occurs when a person does not produce enough . The thyroid gland, located in the neck, makes thyroid hormone that controls how the body uses and stores energy. When you lack adequate thyroid hormone, you feel tired. A form of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroid disease, called Hashimoto's disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. is a severe form of hypothyroidism. The opposite of hypothyroidism is , a condition that occurs when the body produces too much thyroid hormone. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may be subtle such as slowed mental or physical activity, and some people may have no symptoms. Common symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism may include the following: Numbness and tingling and syndromes Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism can show up in the hands and nails. Hypothyroidism can cause dermatologic findings such as nail infection, vertical white ridges on the nails, nail splitting, brittle nails, slow nail growth, and nails lifting up. Other signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may include the following: Decreased systolic (upper number) and increased diastolic blood pressure (lower number) Excess fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) Abdominal distention, fluid in the abdominal cavity () (uncommon) Below normal reflexes with delayed relaxation, loss of coordination, or both Symptoms that are more specific to include Symptoms of myxedema (severe hypothyroidism) include the following: Enlarged heart, fluid around the heart, cardiogenic , and ascites In the U.S. and other countries where iodine intake is adequate, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's disease). In addition to a history and physical examination, doctors need to perform blood tests to diagnose hypothyroidism. The main blood tests used to diagnose hypothyroidism include Thyroid hormone replacement therapy treats hypothyroidism. Doctors usually prescribe (LT4) (, , , Unithyroid). In some cases, doctors may give another form of thyroid hormone, (T3) (, Triostat), with T4. However, since T4 is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs, most studies have not shown an advantage of combining T3 and T4 over using T4 alone. Women may need higher doses of T4 during . Hypothyroidism in pregnancy can result in the following obstetric complications: () Hypothyroidism may cause complications in patients with certain mental illness: Psychosis may worsen in patients with severe psychiatric illness. If not treated promptly, hypothyroidism in infants can cause the following complications: In most cases, proper treatment with thyroid replacement therapy can reverse signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism and patients can live a normal life span.

8fc4a18c-5be3-48de-ba76-3cc7d967e516,"Thyroid disorders are common. In fact, about 12% of people will experience abnormal thyroid function at some point during their lives. Women are eight times more likely to develop a thyroid disorder than men. Also, thyroid problems increase with age and may affect adults differently than children. At the most basic level, thyroid hormone is responsible for coordinating energy, growth and metabolism in your body. Problems can occur when this hormone’s levels are too high or low. Hypothyroidism, or low levels of thyroid hormone, slows your metabolism and decreases growth or repair of many parts of the body. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that drapes across the front of your windpipe. If you place your fingers on the sides of your Adam’s apple and swallow, you’ll feel your thyroid gland sliding under your fingers. It releases thyroid hormone, which controls the growth and metabolism of essentially every part of your body. The pituitary, a tiny gland in the middle of your head, monitors your physiology and releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is the signal to the thyroid gland to release thyroid hormone (). Sometimes TSH levels increase, but the thyroid gland can’t release more thyroid hormone in response. This is known as primary hypothyroidism, as the problem begins at the level of the thyroid gland. Other times, TSH levels decrease, and the thyroid never receives the signal to increase thyroid hormone levels. This is called secondary hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism, or “low thyroid,” can cause a variety of signs and symptoms. This article will help you recognize and understand these effects. Here are 10 common signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. One of the most common symptoms of hypothyroidism is feeling worn out. Thyroid hormone controls energy balance and can influence whether you feel ready to go or ready to nap. As an extreme example, animals that hibernate experience low thyroid levels leading up to their long sleep (). Thyroid hormone receives signals from the brain and coordinates cells to change their functions, depending on what else is going on in your body. Those with high levels of thyroid hormone feel nervous and jittery. In contrast, people with low thyroid feel exhausted and sluggish. In one study, 138 adults with hypothyroidism experienced physical exhaustion and reduced activity. They also reported low motivation and feeling mentally tired (, ). Low-thyroid individuals feel unrested, even though they may be more. In another study, 50% of people with hypothyroidism felt constantly tired, while 42% of people with low thyroid hormone said they slept more than they used to (, ). Feeling sleepier than usual without a good explanation could be a sign of hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone is like a gas pedal for energy and metabolism. Low thyroid hormone levels leave you feeling drained. Unexpected weight gain is another common symptom of hypothyroidism (). Not only are low-thyroid individuals moving less — they’re also signaling their livers, muscles and fat tissue to hold on to calories. When thyroid levels are low, metabolism switches modes. Instead of burning calories for growth and activity, the amount of energy you use at rest, or your basal metabolic rate, decreases. As a result, your body tends to store more calories from the diet as fat. Because of this, low thyroid hormone levels can cause weight gain, even if the number of eaten remains constant. In fact, in one study, people with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism gained an average of 15–30 pounds (7–14 kg) in the year since their diagnoses (, ). If you’ve been experiencing weight gain, first consider whether might explain it. If you seem to be gaining weight in spite of a good diet and exercise plan, bring it up with your doctor. It might be a clue that something else is going on. Hypothyroidism signals the body to eat more, store calories and burn fewer calories. This combination leads to weight gain. For example, consider how hot you get when you workout. This is because you are burning calories. Even when you’re sitting, you’re burning a small amount of calories. However, in cases of hypothyroidism, your basal metabolic rate decreases, reducing the amount of heat you generate. In addition, thyroid hormone turns up the thermostat on brown fat, which is a specialized type of fat that generates heat. Brown fat is important in maintaining body heat in cold climates, but hypothyroidism prevents it from doing its job (). That’s why low levels of thyroid hormone cause you to feel colder than others around you. About 40% of low-thyroid individuals feel more sensitive to cold than usual (). If you’ve always wanted the room warmer than the people you live and work with, this may just be the way you are built. But if you’ve noticed yourself feeling colder than normal lately, it could be a sign of hypothyroidism. Low thyroid hormone slows down your body’s normal heat production, leaving you cold. Low thyroid hormone flips the metabolic switch toward catabolism, which is when the body breaks down body tissues like muscle for energy (). During catabolism, muscle strength decreases, potentially leading to feelings of weakness. The process of breaking down muscle tissue can also lead to aching (). Everyone feels weak once in a while. However, people with hypothyroidism are twice as likely to feel more weak than usual, compared to healthy people (). Additionally, 34% of low-thyroid individuals get muscle cramps in the absence of recent activity (). One study in 35 individuals with hypothyroidism showed that replacing low levels of thyroid hormone with a synthetic thyroid hormone called levothyroxine improved muscle strength and decreased aches and pains, compared to no treatment (). Another study showed a 25% improvement in the sense of physical well-being among patients receiving thyroid replacement (). Weakness and aches are normal following strenuous activity. However, new, and especially increasing, weakness or aching is a good reason to make an appointment with your physician. Low levels of thyroid hormone slow down your metabolism and can cause painful muscle breakdown. Like most cells, hair follicles are regulated by thyroid hormone. Because hair follicles have stem cells that have a short lifespan and rapid turnover, they are more sensitive to low thyroid levels than other tissues (). Low thyroid hormone causes hair follicles to stop regenerating, resulting in hair loss. This will typically improve when the thyroid issue is treated. In one study, about 25–30% of patients seeing a specialist for hair loss were found to have low thyroid hormone. This increased to 40% in individuals over 40 (). Furthermore, another study showed that hypothyroidism may cause coarsening of the hair in up to 10% of individuals with low thyroid hormone (). Consider hypothyroidism if you experience unexpected changes in the rate or pattern of your hair loss, particularly if your hair becomes patchy or coarser. Other hormone problems can also cause unexpected hair loss. Your doctor can help you sort out whether your hair loss is anything to worry about. Low thyroid hormone affects rapidly growing cells like hair follicles. This can cause hair loss and coarsening of the hair. Like hair follicles, skin cells are characterized by rapid turnover. Therefore, they are also sensitive to losing growth signals from the thyroid hormone. When the normal cycle of skin renewal is broken, skin may take longer to regrow. This means the outer layer of skin has been around longer, accumulating damage. It also means that dead skin may take longer to shed, leading to flaky, dry skin. One study showed 74% of low-thyroid individuals reported dry skin. However, 50% of patients with normal thyroid levels also reported dry skin from other causes, making it hard to know if thyroid problems were the cause (, ). Additionally, the study showed that 50% of people with hypothyroidism reported that their skin had gotten worse over the past year. Changes in skin that cannot be blamed on allergies like hay fever or new products can be a more practical sign of thyroid problems. Finally, hypothyroidism is sometimes caused by autoimmune disease. This can affect the skin, causing swelling and redness known as myxedema. Myxedema is more specific to thyroid problems than other causes of dry skin (). Hypothyroidism commonly causes dry skin. However, most people with dry skin do not have hypothyroidism. Myxedema is a red, swollen rash that is characteristic of thyroid problems. Hypothyroidism is linked to depression. The reasons for this are unclear, but it might be a mental symptom of an overall decrease in energy and health (). 64% of women and 57% of men with hypothyroidism report feelings of depression. About the same percentage of men and women also experience anxiety (). In one study, thyroid hormone replacement improved depression in patients with mild hypothyroidism, compared to a placebo (). Another study of young women with mild hypothyroidism showed increased feelings of depression, which were also connected to decreased satisfaction with their sex lives (). Furthermore, postpartum hormone fluctuations are a common cause of hypothyroidism, potentially contributing to postpartum depression (, , ). Feeling depressed is a good reason to talk to a physician or therapist. They may be able to help you cope, regardless of whether the depression is caused by thyroid problems or something else. Hypothyroidism can cause depression and anxiety. These conditions are shown to improve with thyroid hormone replacement. Many patients with hypothyroidism complain of mental “fogginess” and trouble concentrating. The way this mental fogginess presents itself varies by person. In one study, 22% of low-thyroid individuals described increased difficulty doing everyday math, 36% described thinking more slowly than usual and 39% reported having a poorer memory (). In another study of 14 men and women with untreated hypothyroidism, the participants showed difficulty remembering verbal cues (). The causes for this are not yet fully understood, but difficulties in memory improve with treatment of low thyroid hormone (, ). Difficulties in memory or concentration can happen to everyone, but if they are sudden or severe, they could be a signal of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can cause mental fogginess and difficulty concentrating. It may also impair certain kinds of memory. According to one study, constipation affects 17% of people with low thyroid hormone, compared to 10% of people with normal thyroid levels (). In this study, 20% of people with hypothyroidism said their constipation was getting worse, compared to only 6% of normal-thyroid individuals (). While constipation is a common complaint in patients with hypothyroidism, it’s uncommon for constipation to be the only or most severe symptom (). If you experience constipation but otherwise feel fine, try these before worrying about your thyroid. If they don’t work, your constipation worsens, you go several days without passing a stool or you begin having stomach pain or vomiting, seek medical advice. Most people with constipation don’t have hypothyroidism. However, if constipation is accompanied by other signs of hypothyroidism, your thyroid may be the cause. Both irregular and heavy menstrual bleeding are linked to hypothyroidism. One study showed that about 40% of women with low thyroid hormone experienced increasing menstrual irregularity or heavy bleeding in the last year, compared to 26% of women with normal thyroid levels (). In another study, 30% of women with hypothyroidism had irregular and heavy periods. These women had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism after other symptoms had caused them to get tested (). Thyroid hormone interacts with other hormones that control the menstrual cycle, and abnormal levels of it can disrupt their signals. Also, thyroid hormone directly affects the ovaries and uterus. There are several problems besides hypothyroidism that can cause heavy or irregular periods. If you have irregular or heavy periods that disrupt your lifestyle, consider talking with a gynecologist before worrying about your thyroid. Heavy periods or irregular cycles that are worse than usual could be caused by a medical condition, including hypothyroidism. It’s best to talk to a gynecologist about them. Hypothyroidism, or low thyroid, is a common disorder. It can cause a variety of symptoms, such as fatigue, weight gain and feeling cold. It can also result in problems with your hair, skin, muscles, memory or mood. Importantly, none of these problems are unique to hypothyroidism. Yet if you are having several of these symptoms or they are new, worsening or severe, see your doctor to decide if you need to be tested for hypothyroidism.

6c3a6d11-f9c7-4103-8541-d2f859dcc838,"Thyroiditis – Hashimoto's, Post Partum, Sub Acute and Atrophic The thyroid gland produces, secrets, and stores two related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which play a critical role in thermogenic and metabolic homeostasis. T4 and T3 are normally synthesized and released in response to a combined hypothalamic pituitary signal mediated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary and thyrotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. There is a negative feedback from thyroid hormone concentration, primarily T3, to TSH production causing total T4, total T3, free T4, and free T3 concentrations to move in opposition to TSH concentration. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is functionally inadequate. In hypothyroid thyroiditis the functional inadequacy is related to inflammation. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may include brittle fingernails, coarsening and thinning of hair, puffy eyes, weakness, and constipation, as well as the cold intolerance and fatigue associated with the thyroid gland’s critical role in thermogenic and metabolic homeostasis. Symptoms expressing themselves later in the course of hypothyroidism are hoarseness; menstrual disorders; puffy hands, face, and feet; thickening of the skin; thinning of the eyebrows; increased cholesterol levels; muscle and/or joint aches and stiffness; slowed speech; and decreased hearing. Hashimoto’s disease, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common thyroid disease in the United States. In Hashimoto’s disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, resulting in inflammation that can cause an under active thyroid gland. In response to the decreased thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland, the anterior pituitary gland increases its production of TSH. This can cause the thyroid to enlarge. Such an enlargement is known as a goiter. The trigger for the immune system attack on the thyroid in Hashimoto’s disease is not known. Speculation about the trigger includes trauma; environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke; or a genetic flaw. Hashimoto’s disease is most common in women between 40 and 60 years of age and there is a genetic predisposition. The incidence of the disease is high in the Japanese population, most likely as a result of genetic factors and a diet high in iodine. Often, there are no symptoms associated with Hashimoto’s disease for many years, and the condition remains undiagnosed until an enlarged thyroid gland or routine blood tests reveal a problem. If symptoms do develop, they are either related to the increased pressure in the neck caused by the goiter or the usual symptoms of hypothyroidism, which include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, depression, and dry skin. Post-Partum Thyroiditis (PPT) affects 4-10% of postpartum women. The exact cause of postpartum dysfunction is unknown. However, it is speculated to be the result of a modification to the immune system, required during pregnancy. PPT is associated with the development of antithyroid antibodies; antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) and antithyroglobulin (TgAb). Women with autoimmune disorders such as diabetes, positive antithyroid antibodies, history of previous thyroid dysfunction, history of previous PPT, or family history of thyroid dysfunction are more likely to develop PPT. Approximately 20% of women who have PPT develop the disease with subsequent pregnancies. PPT often occurs in stages, with thyrotoxicosis appearing first, followed by hypothyroidism. Not all women experience both stages of PPT. Approximately one-third of women with postpartum thyroid dysfunction exhibit both stages of the disease, whereas one-third of women have only either a thyrotoxic or a hypothyroid stage. The thyrotoxic stage of PPT usually occurs 1-4 months after delivery and lasts approximately 1-3 months. This stage of PPT is often missed, because symptoms so closely mimic post pregnancy symptoms (i.e., fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, palpitations, and irritability), making it difficult to diagnose. Women will often present with the hypothyroid stage, which usually occurs 4-8 months after delivery and lasts approximately 9-12 months. Symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, and depression. Most women regain normal thyroid function within 12-18 months of the onset of symptoms, but about 20% of women who experience the hypothyroid stage remain hypothyroid. PPT should be differentiated from lymphocytic hypophysitis. Lymphocytic hypophysitis can also occur postpartum and may cause TSH deficiency along with one or more pituitary hormones, including ACTH. It can be distinguished from PPT by blood tests. Lymphocytic hypophysitis will have normal TSH levels with low FT4 levels, whereas PPT will have increased TSH levels with low FT4. Atrophic Thyroiditis occurs when bacteria or viruses produce inflammation in the thyroid gland. In response, the gland releases a surge of T3 and T4, thus causing TSH to decrease and consequently T3 and T4 production to decrease. Eventually T3 and T4 stores are depleted. Often there are no symptoms associated with atrophic hypothyroiditis for many years, and the condition remains undiagnosed until a small, palpably hard thyroid gland or abnormalities on routine thyroid function blood tests reveal the problem. If symptoms do develop, they are the usual ambiguous symptoms of hypothyroidism (i.e., fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, depression, and/or dry skin). Patients presenting in the latter stage of atrophic thyroiditis have minimal residual thyroid tissue. In this stage, fibrosis of the thyroid gland is quite extensive. Myxedema is the result of increased dermal glycosaminoglycan content, which traps water resulting in skin thickening, pitting, and swelling. Other manifestations are: yellow tinged skin due to an accumulation of carotene Since atrophic thyroiditis manifests itself late in its progression, cardiac and neurological functions are often already impaired. Carpel tunnel and other entrapment syndromes are common. However, these entrapment symptoms are not exclusive to atrophic thyroiditis. They can be seen with any autoimmune disorder. Sub-Acute Thyroiditis is a painful inflammation of the thyroid that develops suddenly in a patient who has had a viral infection. Pain radiates throughout the neck, so much so that sub-acute thyroiditis can be mistaken for a bad sore throat. It may take several months for normal thyroid function to resume. Which Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? Antithyroid antibodies are often helpful in the diagnosis of an autoimmune thyroid disorder. There are three different antithyroid antibodies: thyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb), an antibody to a follicular enzyme involved in oxidation and organification of iodine; thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), an antibody to thyroglobulin, the protein made up of the essential amino acid tyrosine to which the iodine is attached; and TSH receptor inhibiting immunoglobulin, which competes with TSH for receptor binding sites but does not activate them. If an antithyroid antibody is present, it is often indicative of a prior attack on thyroid tissue. Presence of antithyroid antibodies is the single most specific test for Hashimoto’s disease. They are present in 95% of cases. However, anti-thyroid antibodies are also present in 65- 85 % of patients with PPT; and they can sometimes be found in patients without an autoimmune thyroid problem. Usually, a combination of TPOAb and TgAb testing is used to add more specificity. Up to 20% of patients with one of the autoimmune hypothyroid diseases have antibodies against TSH receptor, which prevent binding with TSH. TSH receptor blocking antibodies are difficult to analyze and generally not available. Normally, in a patient with stable thyroid status, TSH is the more sensitive test in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, since the relationship between TSH and free T4 is log/linear. Intraindividual variation for free T4 is quite small, so any small deficiency of free T4 will be sensed by the anterior pituitary relative to the individual’s set point and cause an amplified, inverse response in TSH. But TSH levels without a baseline are not helpful. Reference ranges are not as tightly set as individual set points, so TSH may be normal, elevated, or depressed. In a patient with unstable thyroid status of any type, free T4 is the more reliable indicator; however, it is possible for high TSH stimulation to keep T4 levels within normal limits for quite some time. (Table I) Atrophic Thyroiditis is really the end stage of destruction and shows a decrease in TSH T3 and T4. (Table II) TSH, free T4, or other analytes will not identify the cause of the hypothyroidism or the individual classification. Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? TSH levels decline in the first trimester of pregnancy, partly because of the increase in total T3 and T4 from increased TBG. Total T3 and T4 are also increased in the first trimester by increased Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG), which is structurally and, to some extent, functionally similar to TSH. Trimester specific reference ranges should be used in pregnancy. During pregnancy, estrogens increase TBG to 2-3 times prepregnancy levels. This shifts binding such that total T3 and total T4 are approximately 1.5 times nonpregnant levels at 16 weeks gestation. TSH is also itself altered during pregnancy. TSH is decreased in the first trimester due to the thyroid stimulating activity of HCG. The decline in TSH is associated with a modest increase in free T4 from the increased TBG. In approximately 2% of pregnancies the increase in free T4 leads to a condition known as gestational transient thyrotoxicosis. This condition may be associated with hyperemesis. In the second and third trimester, free hormone levels decrease 20-40% below reference ranges. Pregnant patients receiving L-T4 replacement may require increased dose to maintain a normal TSH and free T4. It should be noted that there is a continuous decrease in the TSH/free T4 ratio from mid-gestation through completion of puberty. In adulthood, TSH increases in the elderly. Age related reference ranges, or at least ratio adjusted reference ranges, should be used for these analytes. Pregnancy is associated with lower albumin levels. Therefore, albumin-dependent methods are not suitable for accessing thyroid status during pregnancy. Free T4 and TSH have reduced specificity in hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness. Most hospitalized patients have low serum total T3 and free T3. These abnormalities are seen with both acute and chronic nonthyroid illness and are thought to be the malfunction of central inhibition of hypothalamic releasing hormone. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry has published guidelines for testing of hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness. TSH has a very short half-life of 60 minutes and is subject to circadian and diurnal variation peaking at night and reaching a nadir between 10 AM and 4 PM. T4 has a much longer half-life of 7 days, so understanding the effect of timing is crucial For a change in analyte value to have clinical significance, the difference should take into consideration analytical and biological variabilities. The magnitude of difference in thyroid testing values reflecting clinical significance when monitoring a patient’s response to therapy are: During the hyperthyroid stage of PPT, a radioactive iodine uptake test may be performed if the mother is not breast feeding to distinguish PPT from Grave’s disease. Radioactive iodine uptake is decreased in women with PPT. If there is a question about the cause of a goiter associated with hypothyroidism, a fine needle aspiration examined cytologically can confirm the presence of autoimmune thyroiditis. It is important that Hashimoto’s disease be treated appropriately. If replacement therapy is inadequate, the thyroid gland will continue to enlarge and cholesterol levels may increase. Such hypercholesterolemia is generally seen as an increase in low density lipoprotein, which places the patient at greater risk of atherosclerosis. Hypothyroidism can also lead to an enlarged heart and, in rare cases, heart failure. Hashimoto’s disease is also associated with an increased rate of birth defects, if inadequately treated. If replacement therapy is too strong, symptoms of hyperthyroidism can develop, placing excessive strain on the heart and increasing the risk of osteoporosis. Patients with hypothyroidism caused by a disorder of the immune system have a statistically increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, such as insulin dependent diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, pernicious anemia, Addison’s disease, early menopause, vitiligo, thrombocytopenic purpura, or lupus erythematosis. Interferences may obscure the diagnosis of hypothyroidism or complicate the monitoring of the effectiveness of thyroid replacement therapy. Most thyroid testing is performed by either immunoassay, in which labeled and unlabeled ligands compete for a limited number of antibody sites, or immunometric assays, in which an antibody is bound to a solid surface rather than an antibody. Cross reactivity of auto-antibodies or heterophilic antibodies can affect diagnostic accuracy of competitive binding-based tests. The term heterophilic antibodies is often loosely applied to relatively weak antibodies with multiple activity sites, known as auto-antibodies, seen in auto immune disorders; broadly reactive antibodies induced by infections or exposure to therapy containing monoclonal mouse antibodies (HAMA); or human anti-animal immunoglobulins produced against well defined, specific antigens following exposure to therapeutic agents containing animal antigen or by coincidental immunization through exposure to animal antigens. The latter, Human Anti-Animal Antibodies (HAAA), are strong reactors. HAMA and HAAA affect immunometric assays more than they affect simple competitive immunoassays. In immunometric assays HAMA and HAAA can form a bridge between the capture and signal antibodies. Auto-antibodies and heterophilic antibody interferences can sometimes be detected by simply using a different manufacturer’s method that employs a slightly different antibody. Tests in which dilutions are acceptable, such as total T4, total T3, or TSH, but not free T4 or free T3, may be checked for linearity of response to help identify heterophilic antibody interference. Most circulating thyroid hormones are bound to protein. Only that hormone that is free is biologically active. Variations in binding protein will cause variations in concentrations of total hormones. In general, serum TSH is less affected by binding issues than T3 and T4, and T4 is bound more tightly than T3. T3 and T4 circulate in the body bound to thyroid binding globulin (TBG); transthyretin, formally known as thyroxine binding prealbumin; and serum albumin. Physiological shifts toward greater total hormone binding will decrease available free hormone. Theoretically, free T3 and free T4 are not affected analytically by binding, but in reality, all of the free methods are binding dependent to varying degrees. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, aspirin, and furosemide compete with thyroid hormone for protein binding sites and, thus, acutely increase free hormones and reduce total hormones. Eventually, a normal equilibrium is reestablished where free levels normalize at the expense of total levels. Heparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase, liberating free fatty acids, which inhibit total T4 protein binding and elevate free T4. Free fatty acids are known to affect some methods. Estrogens increase TBG, increasing total thyroid hormones. Liver disease, androgens, and nephrotic syndrome decrease TBG, decreasing total thyroid hormones. Indole acetic acid, which accumulates in uremia, may interfere with thyroid binding. Glucocorticosteroids can lower T3 and inhibit TSH production. This interaction is of particular concern in sick, hospitalized patients in whom the elevated TSH in primary hypothyroidism may be obscured. Propanolol has an inhibitory effect on T4 to T3 conversion. Eighty percent of T3 is produced enzymatically in nonthyroid tissue by 5 monodeiodination of T4. Methods that use fluorescent tags may be affected by the presence of fluorophore-related therapeutic or diagnostic agents. A combination of high free T4 and high TSH may be an indication of therapeutic noncompliance. Acute ingestion of missed levothyroxine (L-T4) just prior to a clinic visit will raise the free T4 but fail to normalize the TSH because of a “lag effect”. Free T4 is the short-term indicator, whereas TSH is a long-term indicator. Since TSH is the long-term indicator, it is not influenced by time of L-T4 ingestion. When testing free T4, the daily dose of L-T4 should be withheld until after sampling, as free T4 is significantly increased above baseline for up to 9 hours after ingesting L-T4. Ideally, L-T4 should be taken prior to eating, at the same time each day, and at least 4 hours apart from other medications. Many medications and even vitamins and minerals can influence L-T4 absorption. L-T4 should not be taken with iron supplements. Patients should not switch from brand to brand of L-T4 and prescriptions should not be written generically, as doing so will allow brand to brand switches. Although stated concentrations of L-T4 may be the same, slight variations exist between pharmaceutical manufacturers in terms of bioavailability. Also, medication storage recommendations should be scrupulously followed. Medication should be stored away from humidity, light, and increased temperatures. When ordering medication it is best to avoid the summer for shipping. TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading in cases of abnormalities in hypothalamic or pituitary function in which the usual negative feedback is not seen and TSH may remain within normal ranges. TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading during transition periods of unstable thyroid function. Often these transition periods occur in the early phase of treating hyper- or hypothyroidism or changing the L-T4 dose. It takes 6-12 weeks for pituitary TSH secretion to re-equilibrate to the new thyroid hormone status. Similar periods of unstable thyroid status may occur following an episode of thyroiditis.

Hypothyroidism means your thyroid gland cannot produce the normal amount of thyroid hormone. Your thyroid gland is under active. The thyroid gland is located in the lower, front of the neck. Thyroid hormones regulate the body's energy. When levels of thyroid hormones are abnormally low, the body burns energy more slowly, and vital functions, such as heartbeat and temperature regulation, slow down. Causes of hypothyroidism include: Thyroid surgery or radioiodine ablation treatments to treat thyroid cancer or hyperthyroidism (abnormally high levels of thyroid hormones) An autoimmune disorder, in which the body's own immune system attacks the thyroid Short-term hypothyroidism can be caused by certain types of thyroid inflammation or thyroid infections with a virus. In less than 5% of cases, hypothyroidism is caused by a problem with the hypothalamus or a pituitary gland rather than the thyroid gland. The hypothalamus is a brain structure that normally signals the pituitary gland to make thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which causes the thyroid to make thyroid hormones. Some medical problems can affect either the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, and interrupt the chain of signals from the brain to the thyroid. If this happens, the thyroid gland doesn't get the message to make thyroid hormones, even though it is able to function perfectly. This is called secondary hypothyroidism, which usually occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged by a tumor, infection, sarcoidosis, or cancer that has spread from somewhere else in the body. Less often, hypothyroidism is the result of an injury to the hypothalamus. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men. Babies can be born with hypothyroidism. In adults, hypothyroidism can cause the following symptoms: Abnormal sensitivity to cold temperatures, which can develop gradually If severe hypothyroidism is not treated, a cluster of symptoms called myxedema may appear. These symptoms include an expressionless face, thin hair, puffiness around the eyes, enlarged tongue, and thick skin that feels cool and doughy. In babies born with hypothyroidism, there may be a hoarse cry, slow growth, unusual sleepiness, constipation and feeding problems. If hypothyroidism is not treated, the child may be unusually short and have dry skin, thin hair, an unusual facial appearance, a protruding abdomen, delayed eruption of teeth and problems with mental development. When hypothyroidism occurs in an older child, it may delay puberty and cause other symptoms similar to those seen in adults. Your doctor will examine you and will inspect your thyroid gland, which may be enlarged. Your doctor also will check for characteristic signs of hypothyroidism, such as looking for dry skin, thinning hair, and a slow heart rate. Your doctor will check your knee and ankle reflexes to see if they respond more slowly than expected. Your doctor will diagnose hypothyroidism based on the results of blood tests for levels of thyroid hormones and serum TSH. The TSH test is the most sensitive test for hypothyroidism caused by problem with the thyroid gland. Your doctor also may order blood tests for cholesterol and other blood components, which are often abnormal in people with hypothyroidism. In people with short-term hypothyroidism caused by certain types of thyroid inflammation or viral thyroid infections, levels of thyroid hormones often return to normal after several months. In other people with hypothyroidism, the disorder is a lifelong problem. The thyroid needs iodine (in tiny amounts) to make thyroid hormone. Today, so many foods contain iodine that hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency has become extremely rare. However, ingesting extra iodine does not prevent hypothyroidism. So in reality, there is no way to prevent hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is treated with replacement doses of thyroid hormones. Synthetic forms of these hormones are used, including levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl and other brand names), liothyronine (Cytomel) or liotrix (Thyrolar). Anyone taking thyroid medication has to have a blood test periodically to make sure the dose he or she is taking is maintaining the right levels of thyroid hormones in the body. It is especially important for people with hypothyroidism to be monitored during pregnancy, because the need for thyroid hormone may go up. Also some foods and medications can lower the amount of active thyroid hormone available to the body's cells. For example, iron can interfere with the absorption of thyroid medication inside the intestine, and oral estrogen tends to make more circulating thyroid bind to proteins in the blood, so less free thyroid hormone is available to the body's cells. Call your doctor if you have the symptoms of hypothyroidism, especially if you constantly feel tired, notice that you are losing hair, and develop an abnormal sensitivity to cold. If your infant or child has symptoms of hypothyroidism, call your pediatrician immediately. In adults, treatment with thyroid hormones usually relieves symptoms of hypothyroidism within weeks, although it can take months. However, in some elderly patients, dosages may need to be increased very slowly over six to eight weeks to prevent strain on the heart. In infants and children with hypothyroidism, immediate and consistent treatment with thyroid hormones usually can prevent problems with growth or intellectual development. 6066 Leesburg PikeSuite 650Falls Church, VA 22041Phone: 703-998-8890Fax: 703-998-8893 Medical content reviewed by the Faculty of the Harvard Medical School.

Symptoms are varied but can include fatigue, weight gain, heavy periods or sensitivity to the cold. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in Australia is the autoimmune disease, Hashimoto's disease. Hypothyroidism is often treated with a synthetic version of the hormone thyroxine. Hypothyroidism is a medical condition where the does not make enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland is located in the neck, near the base of the throat. It makes hormones that help control some of your body’s metabolic processes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight. Hypothyroidism can develop over many years without showing any symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they may be quite varied and can include: Some people can have symptoms of hypothyroidism without any abnormality in their hormone levels. At other times, these symptoms may have different causes. If you are concerned about any of these symptoms, see your doctor. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in Australia is , or thyroiditis.

To diagnose hypothyroidism, they will do a to measure the level of your thyroid hormones. If you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, you will most likely be treated with a medicine to replace the thyroid hormones. This medicine is a synthetic version of the hormone thyroxine, and in most cases you will need to take it for the rest of your life. Once treatment has begun, it may take some time to get the dose right for you. Further adjustments may be needed as time goes by, so your hormone levels will need to be checked regularly. , , Learn more here about the development and quality assurance of healthdirect content.

Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease. Accurate thyroid function tests are available to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is usually simple, safe and effective once you and your doctor find the right dose for you. Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Your thyroid gland is located at the base of your neck, just below the Adam's apple. The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism vary, depending on the severity of the hormone deficiency. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over a number of years. At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may simply attribute them to getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. Heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods Although hypothyroidism most often affects middle-aged and older women, anyone can develop the condition, including infants. Initially, babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work properly may have few signs and symptoms. When newborns do have problems with hypothyroidism, the problems may include: Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). In most cases, this occurs when a baby's liver can't metabolize a substance called bilirubin, which normally forms when the body recycles old or damaged red blood cells. As the disease progresses, infants are likely to have trouble feeding and may fail to grow and develop normally. They may also have: When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental retardation. In general, children and teens who develop hypothyroidism have the same signs and symptoms as adults do, but they may also experience: See your doctor if you're feeling tired for no reason or have any of the other signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as dry skin, a pale, puffy face, constipation or a hoarse voice. If you're receiving hormone therapy for hypothyroidism, schedule follow-up visits as often as your doctor recommends. Initially, it's important to make sure you're receiving the correct dose of medicine. And over time, the dose you need may change. When your thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones, the balance of chemical reactions in your body can be upset. There can be a number of causes, including autoimmune disease, hyperthyroidism treatments, radiation therapy, thyroid surgery and certain medications. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland situated at the base of the front of your neck, just below your Adam's apple. Hormones produced by the thyroid gland — triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) — have an enormous impact on your health, affecting all aspects of your metabolism. These hormones also influence the control of vital functions, such as body temperature and heart rate. Hypothyroidism results when the thyroid gland fails to produce enough hormones. Hypothyroidism may be due to a number of factors, including: The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disorder known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Autoimmune disorders occur when your immune system produces antibodies that attack your own tissues. Sometimes this process involves your thyroid gland. Scientists aren't sure why this happens, but it's likely a combination of factors, such as your genes and an environmental trigger. However it happens, these antibodies affect the thyroid's ability to produce hormones. People who produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) are often treated with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications. The goal of these treatments is to get thyroid function back to normal. But sometimes, correcting hyperthyroidism can end up lowering thyroid hormone production too much, resulting in permanent hypothyroidism. Removing all or a large portion of your thyroid gland can diminish or halt hormone production. In that case, you'll need to take thyroid hormone for life. Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect your thyroid gland and may lead to hypothyroidism. A number of medications can contribute to hypothyroidism. One such medication is lithium, which is used to treat certain psychiatric disorders. If you're taking medication, ask your doctor about its effect on your thyroid gland. Less often, hypothyroidism may result from one of the following: Some babies are born with a defective thyroid gland or no thyroid gland. In most cases, the thyroid gland didn't develop normally for unknown reasons, but some children have an inherited form of the disorder. Often, infants with congenital hypothyroidism appear normal at birth. That's one reason why most states now require newborn thyroid screening. A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to produce enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) — usually because of a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. Some women develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy (postpartum hypothyroidism), often because they produce antibodies to their own thyroid gland. Left untreated, hypothyroidism increases the risk of miscarriage, premature delivery and preeclampsia — a condition that causes a significant rise in a woman's blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. It can also seriously affect the developing fetus. The trace mineral iodine — found primarily in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt — is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism, and too much iodine can worsen hypothyroidism in people who already have the condition. In some parts of the world, iodine deficiency is common, but the addition of iodine to table salt has virtually eliminated this problem in the United States. Although anyone can develop hypothyroidism, you're at an increased risk if you: Have an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes or celiac disease Have been treated with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications Have been pregnant or delivered a baby within the past six months Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to a number of health problems: Constant stimulation of your thyroid to release more hormones may cause the gland to become larger — a condition known as a goiter. Although generally not uncomfortable, a large goiter can affect your appearance and may interfere with swallowing or breathing. Hypothyroidism may also be associated with an increased risk of heart disease and heart failure, primarily because high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the ""bad"" cholesterol — can occur in people with an underactive thyroid. Depression may occur early in hypothyroidism and may become more severe over time. Hypothyroidism can also cause slowed mental functioning. Long-term uncontrolled hypothyroidism can cause damage to your peripheral nerves. These are the nerves that carry information from your brain and spinal cord to the rest of your body — for example, your arms and legs. Peripheral neuropathy may cause pain, numbness and tingling in affected areas. This rare, life-threatening condition is the result of long-term, undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Its signs and symptoms include intense cold intolerance and drowsiness followed by profound lethargy and unconsciousness. A myxedema coma may be triggered by sedatives, infection or other stress on your body. If you have signs or symptoms of myxedema, you need immediate emergency medical treatment. Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which impairs fertility. In addition, some of the causes of hypothyroidism — such as autoimmune disorder — can also impair fertility. Babies born to women with untreated thyroid disease may have a higher risk of birth defects compared to babies born to healthy mothers. These children are also more prone to serious intellectual and developmental problems. Infants with untreated hypothyroidism present at birth are at risk of serious problems with both physical and mental development. But if this condition is diagnosed within the first few months of life, the chances of normal development are excellent. Hypothyroidism symptoms: Can hypothyroidism cause eye problems? AskMayoExpert.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones. Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease. Accurate thyroid function tests are available to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is usually simple, safe and effective once you and your doctor find the right dose for you. Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Your thyroid gland is located at the base of your neck, just below the Adam's apple. The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism vary, depending on the severity of the hormone deficiency. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over a number of years. At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may simply attribute them to getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. Heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods Although hypothyroidism most often affects middle-aged and older women, anyone can develop the condition, including infants. Initially, babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work properly may have few signs and symptoms. When newborns do have problems with hypothyroidism, the problems may include: Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). In most cases, this occurs when a baby's liver can't metabolize a substance called bilirubin, which normally forms when the body recycles old or damaged red blood cells. As the disease progresses, infants are likely to have trouble feeding and may fail to grow and develop normally. They may also have: When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental retardation. In general, children and teens who develop hypothyroidism have the same signs and symptoms as adults do, but they may also experience: See your doctor if you're feeling tired for no reason or have any of the other signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as dry skin, a pale, puffy face, constipation or a hoarse voice. If you're receiving hormone therapy for hypothyroidism, schedule follow-up visits as often as your doctor recommends. Initially, it's important to make sure you're receiving the correct dose of medicine. And over time, the dose you need may change. When your thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones, the balance of chemical reactions in your body can be upset. There can be a number of causes, including autoimmune disease, hyperthyroidism treatments, radiation therapy, thyroid surgery and certain medications. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland situated at the base of the front of your neck, just below your Adam's apple. Hormones produced by the thyroid gland — triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) — have an enormous impact on your health, affecting all aspects of your metabolism. These hormones also influence the control of vital functions, such as body temperature and heart rate. Hypothyroidism results when the thyroid gland fails to produce enough hormones. Hypothyroidism may be due to a number of factors, including: The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disorder known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Autoimmune disorders occur when your immune system produces antibodies that attack your own tissues. Sometimes this process involves your thyroid gland. Scientists aren't sure why this happens, but it's likely a combination of factors, such as your genes and an environmental trigger. However it happens, these antibodies affect the thyroid's ability to produce hormones. People who produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) are often treated with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications. The goal of these treatments is to get thyroid function back to normal. But sometimes, correcting hyperthyroidism can end up lowering thyroid hormone production too much, resulting in permanent hypothyroidism. Removing all or a large portion of your thyroid gland can diminish or halt hormone production. In that case, you'll need to take thyroid hormone for life. Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect your thyroid gland and may lead to hypothyroidism. A number of medications can contribute to hypothyroidism. One such medication is lithium, which is used to treat certain psychiatric disorders. If you're taking medication, ask your doctor about its effect on your thyroid gland. Less often, hypothyroidism may result from one of the following: Some babies are born with a defective thyroid gland or no thyroid gland. In most cases, the thyroid gland didn't develop normally for unknown reasons, but some children have an inherited form of the disorder. Often, infants with congenital hypothyroidism appear normal at birth. That's one reason why most states now require newborn thyroid screening. A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to produce enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) — usually because of a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. Some women develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy (postpartum hypothyroidism), often because they produce antibodies to their own thyroid gland. Left untreated, hypothyroidism increases the risk of miscarriage, premature delivery and preeclampsia — a condition that causes a significant rise in a woman's blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. It can also seriously affect the developing fetus. The trace mineral iodine — found primarily in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt — is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism, and too much iodine can worsen hypothyroidism in people who already have the condition. In some parts of the world, iodine deficiency is common, but the addition of iodine to table salt has virtually eliminated this problem in the United States.

My doctor thinks I may have hypothyroidism. How will he make the diagnosis? Hypothyroidism is the medical term for an underactive thyroid. Some conditions are hard to diagnose, but fortunately hypothyroidism is not one of them. Your thyroid is a small gland in your neck that makes the thyroid hormones, called T3 and T4. These hormones leave the gland and travel in the blood to every cell in your body. Thyroid hormones influence the rate at which every cell, tissue and organ in your body functions. Hypothyroidism occurs when your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. Your body slows down, creating symptoms such as fatigue, depression, weight gain, feeling cold for no good reason, constipation and dry skin. Your thyroid gland is controlled by another gland: the pituitary gland, which is in the brain. It sends a chemical message to your thyroid, telling it how much hormone to make. The chemical message is called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Your brain is constantly sensing whether there is an adequate level of thyroid hormones circulating in your blood. If not, the pituitary makes more TSH. Higher levels of TSH prompt the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones. Low TSH levels signal the thyroid to slow down production. To diagnose hypothyroidism, your doctor will perform a physical examination and some blood tests: Your doctor will assess the size of your thyroid by feeling around your neck. He or she will check for physical signs of hypothyroidism, such as coarse hair or hair loss, dry or yellowish skin, and pale or puffy appearance. Your weight, cholesterol levels and blood pressure will also be checked. This test is the best way to determine if you have thyroid disease. (I’ve put a table showing the normal, low and high values for the TSH and other thyroid blood tests below.) If your TSH level is high, you are hypothyroid. If TSH levels are below normal, you are hyperthyroid: Your thyroid gland is making too much thyroid hormone. (There are exceptions to this, but they are infrequent.) . Once secreted by the thyroid, only a small amount of T4 is “free” and available for immediate use. In hypothyroidism, there’s not enough free T4 in the blood. There’s also not enough T3 in the blood. Together, the TSH, free T4 and T3 tests can establish a diagnosis. They can also indicate how severe your problem is. The ranges below apply to people who are not yet taking thyroid medications. Central (also known as secondary) hypothyroidism, indicating a pituitary disorder Central (also known as secondary) hyperthyroidism, indicating a rare pituitary abnormality producing TSH *An abnormal TSH level can indicate a range of problems depending on whether the pituitary gland is functioning normally.**The normal ranges in the bloodstream vary from lab to lab.Sources: Third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Survey; Subclinical Thyroid Disease: Scientific Review and Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management, 2004 (Consensus Panel Recommendation). Fortunately, treating hypothyroidism is easy. You take thyroid hormone in pill form, to replace the hormone your thyroid gland is not making enough of. The same thyroid blood tests used to diagnose hypothyroidism also are used to determine if you’re taking the right dose of thyroid medicines. These tests are repeated regularly, since a person’s dose can change over time. Diagnosing hypothyroidism has become much simpler and more precise since I went to medical school.

7b88880b-1e20-49b9-bcf1-f5f50cdf8103,"— — Hypothyroidism occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that sits at the front of your neck. It releases hormones to help your body regulate and use energy. Your is responsible for providing energy to nearly every organ in your body. It controls functions such as and . Without the right amount of thyroid hormones, your body’s natural functions begin to slow down. Also called underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism affects women more frequently than men. It commonly affects people over the age of 60 years old, but it can begin at any age. It may be discovered through a routine blood test or after symptoms begin. is the name given to an early, mild form of the condition. If you’ve recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, it’s important to know that treatment is considered simple, safe, and effective. Most treatments rely on supplementing your low hormone levels with artificial hormones. These hormones will replace what your body isn’t producing on its own and help return your body’s functions to normal. Hypothyroidism is a fairly common condition. of Americans ages 12 years old and up have hypothyroidism. Overall, in the United States live with the condition. The disease gets more common with age. People over 60 years old experience it more frequently. Women are more likely to have an underactive thyroid. In fact, will develop hypothyroidism. What are the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism? The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism vary from person to person. The severity of the condition also affects which signs and symptoms appear and when. The symptoms are also sometimes difficult to identify. Early symptoms can include and . Both become more common as you age, regardless of your thyroid’s health. You may not realize that these changes are related to your thyroid until more symptoms appear. The most common signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include: For most people, symptoms of the condition progress gradually over many years. As the thyroid slows more and more, the symptoms may become more easily identified. Of course, many of these symptoms also become more common with age in general. If you suspect your symptoms are the result of a thyroid problem, talk with your doctor. They can order a blood test to determine if you have hypothyroidism. Learn more about the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. Common causes of hypothyroidism are described below. Your immune system is designed to protect your body’s cells against invading . When unknown bacteria or viruses enter your body, your immune system responds by sending out fighter cells to destroy the foreign cells. Sometimes, your body confuses normal, healthy cells for invading cells. This is called an autoimmune response. If the autoimmune response isn’t regulated or treated, your immune system can attack healthy tissues. This can cause , including conditions such as hypothyroidism. is an autoimmune condition and the most common cause of an underactive thyroid in the United States. This disease attacks your thyroid gland and causes chronic thyroid inflammation. The inflammation can reduce thyroid function. It affects middle-aged women most commonly, but it can occur in men and children. This condition also runs in families. If a family member has been diagnosed with the disease, then your risk for having it is higher. If your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, you have a condition known as . Treatment for this condition aims to reduce and normalize thyroid hormone production. Sometimes, treatment can cause the levels of your thyroid hormone to remain low permanently. This often occurs after treatment with . If as a result of thyroid problems, you’ll develop hypothyroidism. Using thyroid medication for the rest of your life is the primary treatment. If only a portion of the gland is removed, your thyroid may still be able to produce enough hormones on its own. Blood tests will help determine how much thyroid medication you’ll need. If you’ve been diagnosed with cancer of the head or neck, , or , you may have undergone . Radiation used for the treatment of these conditions may slow or halt the production of thyroid hormone. This will almost always lead to hypothyroidism. Several medicines may lower thyroid hormone production, leading to hypothyroidism. These include ones used to treat psychological conditions, cancer, or heart disease, such as: Factors that can increase your risk of developing hypothyroidism include: having certain autoimmune conditions, such as and Two primary tools are used to determine if you have hypothyroidism, a medical evaluation and blood tests. Your doctor will complete a thorough and medical history. They’ll check for physical signs of hypothyroidism, including: In addition, your doctor will ask you to report any symptoms you’ve been experiencing, such as fatigue, depression, constipation, or constantly feeling cold. If you have a known family history of thyroid conditions, tell your doctor during this exam. Blood tests are the only way to reliably confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. A measures how much TSH your is creating: If your thyroid isn’t producing enough hormones, the pituitary gland will boost TSH to increase thyroid hormone production. If you have hypothyroidism, your TSH levels will be high, as your body is trying to stimulate more thyroid hormone activity. If you have hyperthyroidism, your TSH levels will be low, as your body is trying to stop excessive thyroid hormone production. A is also useful in diagnosing hypothyroidism. T4 is one of the hormones directly produced by your thyroid. Used together, T4 and TSH tests help evaluate thyroid function. Typically, if you have a low level of T4 along with a high level of TSH, you have hypothyroidism. However, there’s a . Other thyroid function tests may be necessary to properly diagnose your condition. Which medications are available to treat hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism is a lifelong condition. For many people, medication reduces or alleviates symptoms. Hypothyroidism is best treated by using (Levoxyl, Synthroid). This synthetic version of the T4 hormone copies the action of the thyroid hormone your body would normally produce. The medication is designed to return adequate levels of thyroid hormone to your blood. Once hormone levels are restored, symptoms of the condition are likely to disappear or at least become much more manageable. Once you start treatment, it takes several weeks before you begin feeling relief. You’ll require follow-up blood tests to monitor your progress. You and your doctor will work together to find a dose and a treatment plan that best addresses your symptoms. This can take some time. In most cases, people with hypothyroidism must remain on this medication their entire lives. However, it’s unlikely you’ll continue to take the same dose, especially if you have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. To make sure your medication is still working properly, your doctor should test your TSH levels yearly. If blood levels indicate the medicine isn’t working as well as it should, your doctor will adjust the dose until a balance is achieved. Discover other treatment options for hypothyroidism. What alternative treatments may help hypothyroidism? are available. These extracts come from the thyroid glands of pigs. They contain both T4 and . If you take levothyroxine, you’re only receiving T4. However, that’s all you need because your body is capable of producing T3 from the synthetic T4. These alternative animal extracts often contain inconsistent amounts of each hormone, and haven’t shown them to be better than levothyroxine. For these reasons, they aren’t routinely recommended. You can also purchase glandular extracts in some health food stores. These products aren’t monitored or regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because of this, their potency, legitimacy, and purity aren’t guaranteed. Use either of these products at your own risk. However, do tell your doctor if you decide to try these products so they can adjust your treatment accordingly. , such as selenium and vitamin B. reduced kidney function, in cases of severe disease Hypothyroidism can also result in infertility or pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia. Find out more about the complications of hypothyroidism. Are there special dietary recommendations for people with hypothyroidism? As a general rule, people with hypothyroidism don’t have a specific diet they should follow. However, here are some recommendations to keep in mind. Your thyroid needs adequate amounts of iodine in order to fully function, but you don’t need to take an iodine supplement for that to happen. A balanced diet of , , , and colorful and should provide enough iodine. may hinder the absorption of thyroid hormones. If you drink or eat too many soy products, you may not be able to properly absorb your medication. It’s especially important that caregivers monitor the soy intake of infants who need hypothyroidism treatment and also drink soy formula. You need steady doses of the medication to achieve even levels of thyroid hormone in your blood. Avoid eating or drinking soy-based foods for at least 4 hours before and after you take your medication. Like soy, may interfere with hormone absorption. Too much dietary fiber may prevent your body from getting the hormones it needs. Fiber is vital, so don’t avoid it entirely. Instead, avoid taking your medicine within several hours of eating . Don’t take thyroid medication with other supplements If you take supplements or medications in addition to thyroid medications, try to take them at different times. Other medications can absorption, so it’s best to take your thyroid medication on an empty stomach and without other medications or foods. Being diagnosed with hypothyroidism doesn’t mean you’ll have to follow a strict diet, although a few adjustments may be necessary. Create a hypothyroidism diet plan with these tips. What are some tips for coping with hypothyroidism? Even if you’re undergoing treatment, you may deal with long-lasting issues or complications because of the condition. However, there are ways to lessen the effect of hypothyroidism on your quality of life. There’s a link between other autoimmune diseases and hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism often goes along with other conditions, such as: Despite taking medication, you may still experience fatigue from time to time. To help you combat low energy levels, it’s important that you: consider the use of stress-relieving mechanisms, such as and Having a chronic medical condition can be difficult, especially if it’s accompanied by other health concerns. Find people you can openly express your feelings and experiences to. This can be a therapist, close friend, family member, or a support group of other people living with this condition. Many hospitals sponsor meetings for people with conditions such as hypothyroidism. Ask for a recommendation from your hospital’s education office, and attend a meeting. You may be able to connect with people who understand exactly what you’re experiencing and can offer a guiding hand. Learn more about how hypothyroidism can affect your relationships. What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and depression? When levels of thyroid hormones are low, your body’s natural functions slow down and lag. This causes a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, and even . A found that 60 percent of people with hypothyroidism exhibited some symptoms of depression. Some people with hypothyroidism may only experience mood difficulties. This can make diagnosing hypothyroidism difficult. Instead of only treating the brain, doctors should also consider testing for and treating an underactive thyroid. Depression and hypothyroidism share several symptoms. These include: The two conditions also have symptoms that may distinguish them from one another. For hypothyroidism, problems such as dry skin, constipation, high cholesterol, and hair loss are common. For depression alone, these conditions wouldn’t be expected. Depression is often a diagnosis made based on symptoms and medical history. Low thyroid function is diagnosed with a physical exam and blood tests. To see if there’s a link between your depression and your thyroid function, your doctor can order these tests for a definitive diagnosis. If your depression is caused only by hypothyroidism, correcting the hypothyroidism should treat the depression. If it doesn’t, your doctor may prescribe medications for both conditions. They’ll slowly adjust your doses until your depression and hypothyroidism come under control. Explore the link between thyroid conditions and depression here. What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and anxiety? While hypothyroidism has long been associated with depression, a indicates it may be associated with too. Researchers evaluated 100 people between the ages of 18 and 45 years old who have a known history of hypothyroidism. Using an anxiety questionnaire, they found that around 63 percent of them met the criteria for some form of anxiety. Research to date has consisted of . Larger and more focused studies on anxiety may help determine if a true connection exists between hypothyroidism and anxiety. It’s important for you and your doctor to discuss all your symptoms when being evaluated for thyroid conditions. Women who have hypothyroidism and wish to become pregnant face a particular set of challenges. Low thyroid function or uncontrolled hypothyroidism during pregnancy can cause: If you have hypothyroidism and are pregnant, it’s important to take the following steps during the time you’re expecting: Women can develop hypothyroidism while they’re pregnant. Some doctors routinely check thyroid levels during pregnancy to monitor for low thyroid hormone levels. If your levels are lower than they should be, your doctor may suggest treatment. Some women who never had thyroid problems before they were pregnant may develop them after having a baby. This is called . For many women, the condition resolves within , and medication is no longer required. Approximately 20 percent of women with postpartum thyroiditis will go on to require long-term therapy. Continue to take your medication as prescribed. It’s common to have frequent testing so your doctor can make any necessary adjustments to your thyroid medication as your pregnancy progresses. This ensures that the baby is getting enough thyroid hormone for organ development. Your body needs more nutrients, vitamins, and minerals while you’re pregnant. Eating a and taking while pregnant can help you maintain a healthy pregnancy. Women with thyroid problems can and very often do have healthy pregnancies. Find out more about the effect of hypothyroidism on fertility and pregnancy. What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and weight gain? Your thyroid is responsible for many of your body’s daily functions, including metabolism, organ function, and . When your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormone, all of these functions can slow down. If your thyroid gland doesn’t function properly, your may be low.

Underactive thyroid or otherwise known as hypothyroidism is a type of health condition that affects a lot of people nowadays. Hypothyroidism is considered a thyroid problem that is caused by the low activity of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is the one that produces the thyroid hormones that are very essential in the functioning of the body. Unfortunately, a lot of people are unaware that they are already suffering from this kind of problem since the symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary and can be difficult to define. Most of these symptoms also mimic the symptoms of other types of conditions. However, there are a number of things that we can use in order to treat hypothyroidism. Below are some of the effective and proven natural remedies for underactive thyroid. The thyroid is a small gland that is located in the middle of the lower portion of the neck. In other words, it is located below the larynx or under the Adam’s apple of males. Just like what is mentioned above, this gland manufactures the thyroid hormones that allow the body to perform various functions, which are considered very essential for our day to day survival. It also works in cooperation with the pituitary gland in order to produce the thyroid stimulating hormone or the TSH. Curing or treating underactive thyroid is not an easy thing to do. Nevertheless, with the help of lifestyle changes and other treatments or remedies, the symptoms of this condition can be significantly reduced. Some of the most common symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, brittleness of the nails and hair and as well as weight gain. Identifying the Natural Remedies/Methods to Combat Hypothyroidism There are actually several steps or ways that we can do at home in order to manage the hypothyroidism condition of our body. Some of these ways include the following: Always make sure that we are surrounded with good support system. This includes our family, our friends and our love ones. Having these significant people around can aid us in combating the effects of underactive thyroid and give us more confidence in facing the condition. It is also important to educate ourselves with this particular condition. Knowing all the important details regarding this health problem can help us deal with the situation a lot better. We should also include our doctors, naturopaths, therapists, homeopaths and other people that can be of assistance in order to treat underactive thyroids properly. Maintaining a positive attitude in facing hypothyroidism is also necessary since it gives us more drive and determination in fighting the side effects of the health condition. Just like in most other types of health diseases, it is vital to always include a healthy and well balanced diet. This is one way of keeping our body fit, despite the contradicting effects of hypothyroidism. The thyroid gland also requires a wide array of nutrients in order for it to function optimally. Adding essential fatty acids to the diet is also useful, which can be seen in many cold water fish like salmon and cod. Walnuts, flaxseeds and almonds are also considered great sources of fatty acids. In case our diet cannot compensate with the required amount of nutrients for the body, we can always try taking fish oil supplements. This too also contains high in fatty acids and other nutrients. The consumption of seaweed, chlorella and algae is also advisable. These foods are useful in maintaining the thyroid function balance. Including iodine rich foods in the diet is also very ideal. Iodine is necessary for the healthy and proper functioning of the thyroid. Some of the most common foods that are high in this mineral are the salt water fish, shell fish and sea weeds. Including cruciferous vegetables in the diet is NOT advisable like broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale and cabbage. These vegetables contain natural thyroid blocking properties that can aggravate the low activity of the thyroid gland. Aside from eating healthy foods, doing regular physical activity and exercise is also required in order to keep the body in good shape. Weight gain is considered to be a primary effect of hypothyroidism, which is why doing regular workouts, can help in maintain a good body physique. Religiously take all the medications prescribed by the doctor that can help in combating the situation. These medications can help reduce the symptoms and as well as improve the condition of the thyroid gland. Monitoring the hormone levels is also required on a regular basis in so as to check for any type of abnormalities and also to serve as a basis whether or not our condition is improving. Carrying our daily thyroid self massages can also be helpful since it can stimulate the activity of the said gland. This can be done by simply massaging the gland with the use of gentle upward strokes and down the sides of the trachea (windpipe). These are just some of the natural remedies or methods that we can use or do in order to treat or combat hypothyroidism per se and as well as the negative side effects it can bring to our the body.

Subclinical Hypothyroidism Symptoms (Plus, 3 Natural Remedies) Subclinical hypothyroidism — which affects between an estimated 3 to 8 percent of the population, especially women and older adults — can be the cause of symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety and poor memory. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is considered a type of “,” and in some cases is an early form of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism describes a condition in which the body doesn’t produce enough , which include thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). The main concern with SCH is that it may progress to clinical hypothyroidism and can possibly cause complications like cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment and mood-related problems. When it comes to , there’s ongoing debate about the best approach. In fact, it’s controversial as to what even qualifies as thyroid disease and what levels of hormones fall outside of the “normal” range. Will someone with subclinical hypothyroidism benefit from the same type of  that are recommended to those with a more advanced form of thyroid disease? In most cases, yes — although treating thyroid issues can be complicated and often takes patience and a personalized plan. In order to be diagnosed with SCH, which is sometimes referred to as subclinical thyroid disease, a blood test must show that someone has peripheral thyroid hormone levels that are within the normal range, but thyroid-stimulating hormone (or TSH) levels that are mildly elevated. What does it mean if someone’s TSH level is elevated? Thyroid stimulating hormone is produced in the pituitary gland, which is stimulated by the hypothalamus in the brain. TSH has the job of telling the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones when levels drop too low. This means that elevated TSH is a sign the body is trying to make more thyroid hormones. T3 and T4 are released into the bloodstream and then travel throughout the body, controlling metabolism and the body’s use of energy. This means that people with subclinical hypothyroidism and clinical hypothyroidism will usually experience symptoms that are associated with a slow metabolism. Some people with subclinical hypothyroidism will have no symptoms at all, or only very mild symptoms. When they do occur, subclinical hypothyroidism symptoms and complications can include: Heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods Higher risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism. found that this occurs in about 28 percent of people with SCH who are over 55 years old. Possible decrease in quality of life, may be due to anxiety, low libido, low energy and sleep-related issues. Possibility of higher risk for cardiovascular conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and congestive heart failure, particularly in people younger than 70 years (studies show those aged 70 and 80 years have no additional risk). In case you’re wondering, the difference between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism is this: hypothyroidism describes an underactive thyroid, while hyperthyroidism describes an overactive thyroid. These two thyroid disorders often cause opposite symptoms. Can you have normal TSH levels but still be hypothyroid? Yes, it’s possible. Having a low level of T4 (lower than 5 to 13.5 micrograms per deciliter) but a normal TSH level may indicate that you have hypothyroidism. On the other hand, subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as  combined with elevated TSH. The are the same as those of hypothyroidism. The most common cause of elevated TSH is , also known as Hashimoto’s disease. Studies show that antithyroid antibodies associated with Hashimoto’s can be detected in about 80 percent of patients with SCH. Other causes of SCH can include: radioiodine therapy, radiation therapy, thyroid surgery, granulomatous thyroiditis, lack of iodine and pregnancy or being postpartum. , sleep deprivation, and nutrient deficiencies can also be contributing factors. Doctors diagnose subclinical hypothyroidism using results from a blood test showing elevated TSH hormone. Because thyroid disorders can be complex, it’s recommended that patients have a full hormone panel done (a more detailed test showing levels of all thyroid hormones) in order to determine the best type of treatment for the patient’s condition. Once diagnosed, can subclinical hypothyroidism be cured? There is no “cure” for a hypothyroidism diagnosis, but there may be ways to naturally increase thyroid hormone production. Clinical hypothyroidism is usually manageable using a combination of lifestyle changes and medication; however, it’s debatable whether subclinical hypothyroidism should be treated the same way. Clinicians have different opinions regarding the best approach when it comes to subclinical hypothyroidism treatment because not all patients deal with symptoms that impact their quality of life. The exact upper limit of “normal” for serum TSH levels remains a subject of debate. Currently, the standard treatment approach for hypothyroidism is to treat people with a persistent serum TSH level of more than 10.0 mIU/L. In this case, it’s routine to use medications including levothyroxine in order to bring thyroid hormone levels within the normal range. For people with TSH levels of less than 10.0 mIU/L, “individualized therapy” is recommended based on the patient’s symptoms, medical history, risk for progressing to hypothyroidism, age and other factors. Research shows that about 80 percent of patients with SCH have a serum TSH of less than 10 mIU/L. Some experts believe that the upper limit of normal for the serum TSH level should be between 3.0 and 5.0 mIU/L, or possibly even as low as 2.5 mIU/L. Medication is often not be the best treatment approach for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. A 2007 meta-analysis of 14 randomized clinical trials found evidence that levothyroxine replacement therapy for SCH does not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity and — such as by — compared to those not being treated. While there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to treating subclinical hypothyroidism that will work for everyone, many people can benefit from making changes to their diet and lifestyle, including how they manage stress, sleep and exercise. Studies are yet to find a dietary approach that will help naturally treat all cases of hypothyroidism/subclinical hypothyroidism. That being said, many people with SCH are dealing with an autoimmune endocrine disorder due to their thyroid gland being inflamed (Hashimoto’s), which is tied to issues including poor gut health, allergies, sensitives and chronic low-grade inflammation. The first step in dealing with thyroid problems is to eliminate the causes of thyroid dysfunction, such as a poor diet, overuse of medications, nutrient deficiencies, chronic stress and exhaustion that leads to hormonal changes. Many people with hypothyroidism find eliminating foods that contribute to inflammation and immune reactions will help manage their symptoms. These can include foods that contain gluten, dairy, refined oils, added sugar, refined grains and synthetic additives. Instead, it’s helpful to focus on foods that help heal the GI tract, balance hormones and reduce inflammation, such as: Foods high in iodine, since a diet low in  and  (which are trace minerals crucial for thyroid function) increases the risk for hypothyroid disorders. Iodine and selenium are found in foods like seaweed, eggs, fish and seafood, liver, oats, real sea salt, yogurt, lima beans, turkey, raw milk and cheeses, brazil nuts, spinach and bananas. Wild-caught fish that provide the omega-3 fatty acids Seaweeds, which are the best natural sources of iodine and help prevent deficiencies that disturb thyroid function Probiotic-rich foods, like kefir (a fermented dairy product), organic goat’s milk yogurt, kimchi, kombucha, natto, sauerkraut and other fermented veggies High-fiber foods, include fresh vegetables, berries, beans, lentils and seeds Bone broth, which can help repair the digestive lining and provide numerous important minerals that prevent deficiencies 2. Getting Rest, Managing Stress and Exercising Appropriately Over-exertion and chronic stress, including from sleep deprivation, too much exercise and a packed schedule, can raise levels of the stress hormone, , and adrenaline, which can contribute to hormonal imbalances and thyroid disease. While exercise has many benefits, such as helping with  and managing a healthy weight, can place too much stress on the body; therefore, gentler, more restorative types of exercises are better suited for some people with low thyroid function. Certain supplements can be helpful for managing hypothyroid symptoms, such as fatigue or brain-fog, including: Subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy can affect some women who ordinarily do not deal with thyroid-related issues when not pregnant. This condition is known as . The symptoms often disappear within 12—18 months after giving birth but can also lead to permanent hypothyroidism in some cases. A woman may be diagnosed with  or postpartum if her blood TSH level is found to be elevated above 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester or 3.0 mIU/L in the second and third trimesters. Certain studies have found that newborns born to mothers who have SCH during pregnancy may be at risk for certain health problems, including . There’s also some evidence showing that SCH may also increase the risk for miscarriage. While there’s debate over when treatment is necessary, screening of pregnant women for SCH — plus use of medication in women with SCH who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant — is recommended. A number of studies have found that treatment is associated with a reduced risk of pregnancy loss in women with a TSH level between 4.1 to 10, but not for a TSH level between 2.5 to 4. What is subclinical hypothyroidism? Subclinical hypothyroidism (or SCH) is a mild form of hypothyroidism, a condition in which the body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. Should you treat subclinical hypothyroidism? This is an ongoing topic of debate, since it’s controversial what even qualifies as thyroid disease. Currently, subclinical hypothyroidism treatment guidelines tell us that all patients with a TSH greater than 10 mIU/L should be treated with levothyroxine replacement therapy. Treatment of patients with a serum TSH level between 5 and 10 mIU/L remains up for debate. Subclinical hypothyroidism symptoms do not affect every person with this condition; many have no noticeable symptoms at all and do not experience an improvement in quality of life with medication use. While medication may not be a good option for many people with SCH, diet and lifestyle changes can often help to reduce symptoms and prevent the condition from progressing.

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia   : A handout on this topic is available at https://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism.html. Abstract Abstract Hypothyroidism is a clinical disorder commonly encountered by the primary care physician. Untreated hypothyroidism can contribute to hypertension, dyslipidemia, infertility, cognitive impairment, and neuromuscular dysfunction. Data derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey suggest that about one in 300 persons in the United States has hypothyroidism. The prevalence increases with age, and is higher in females than in males. Hypothyroidism may occur as a result of primary gland failure or insufficient thyroid gland stimulation by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common etiology of hypothyroidism in the United States. Clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism are nonspecific and may be subtle, especially in older persons. The best laboratory assessment of thyroid function is a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone test. There is no evidence that screening asymptomatic adults improves outcomes. In the majority of patients, alleviation of symptoms can be accomplished through oral administration of synthetic levothyroxine, and most patients will require lifelong therapy. Combination triiodothyronine/thyroxine therapy has no advantages over thyroxine monotherapy and is not recommended. Among patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, those at greater risk of progressing to clinical disease, and who may be considered for therapy, include patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels greater than 10 mIU per L and those who have elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers. Hypothyroidism is defined as failure of the thyroid gland to produce sufficient thyroid hormone to meet the metabolic demands of the body. Untreated hypothyroidism can contribute to hypertension, dyslipidemia, infertility, cognitive impairment, and neuromuscular dysfunction. Data derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) suggest that about one in 300 persons in the United States has hypothyroidism. The prevalence increases with age, and is higher in females than in males. It is estimated that nearly 13 million Americans have undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism may occur as a result of primary gland failure or insufficient thyroid gland stimulation by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Primary gland failure can result from congenital abnormalities, autoimmune destruction (Hashimoto disease), iodine deficiency, and infiltrative diseases. Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common etiology of hypothyroidism in the United States. Iatrogenic forms of hypothyroidism occur after thyroid surgery, radioiodine therapy, and neck irradiation. Disorders generally associated with transient hypothyroidism include postpartum thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, and thyroiditis associated with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor-blocking antibodies. Central causes of hypothyroidism typically present with other manifestations of hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction, and are characterized by inappropriately normal or low levels of TSH relative to insufficient thyroid hormone. Drugs classically associated with thyroid dysfunction include lithium, amiodarone, interferon alfa, interleukin-2, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Enlarge     Print Thyroid-stimulating hormone testing should be used to diagnose primary hypothyroidism. Older patients and patients with known or suspected ischemic heart disease should be started on 25 to 50 mcg of levothyroxine daily, rather than the full replacement dosage, because of the potential risk of tachyarrhythmia or acute coronary syndrome.

Consequently, hypothyroidism may result in a myriad of clinical signs and symptoms. The severity of these manifestations generally reflects the degree of thyroid dysfunction and the time course of development of hypothyroidism. Symptoms commonly associated with hypothyroidism are often nonspecific . These include weight gain, fatigue, poor concentration, depression, diffuse muscle pain, and menstrual irregularities. Symptoms with high specificity for hypothyroidism include constipation, cold intolerance, dry skin, proximal muscle weakness, and hair thinning or loss.  Enlarge     Print Symptoms of hypothyroidism may vary with age and sex. Infants and children may present more often with lethargy and failure to thrive. Women who have hypothyroidism may present with menstrual irregularities and infertility. In older patients, cognitive decline may be the sole manifestation. Examination findings associated with hypothyroidism include but are not limited to goiter, delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes, thin or brittle hair, dry skin, and peripheral edema . Common electrocardiography findings include bradycardia, flattened T waves, and low voltage. Patients with severe hypothyroidism may present with pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, megacolon, hemodynamic instability, and coma. The clinical presentation is often confused with septic shock. Myxedema coma, which represents severe physiologic decompensation resulting from hypothyroidism, occurs rarely, with an annual incidence of 0.22 per million. Laboratory findings in hypothyroidism may include hyponatremia, hypercapnia, hypoxia, normocytic anemia, elevated creatine kinase, hyperprolactinemia, and hyperlipidemia.  Enlarge     Print Abstract Family physicians should evaluate for thyroid dysfunction in all patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism. The American Academy of Family Physicians does not recommend screening for hypothyroidism in asymptomatic adults, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence for routine screening in this population. Screening of asymptomatic patients may be considered in those with risk factors for hypothyroidism, such as a history of autoimmune disease, history of head or neck irradiation, previous radioactive iodine therapy, presence of a goiter, family history of thyroid disease, or treatment with drugs known to influence thyroid function. The best laboratory assessment of thyroid function, and the preferred test for diagnosing primary hypothyroidism, is a serum TSH test. If the serum TSH level is elevated, testing should be repeated with a serum free thyroxine (T) measurement . Overt primary hypothyroidism is indicated with an elevated serum TSH level and a low serum free T level. An elevated serum TSH level with a normal range serum free T level is consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism. A low serum free T level with a low, or inappropriately normal, serum TSH level is consistent with secondary hypothyroidism and will usually be associated with further evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary insufficiency.       Algorithm for evaluating suspected hypothyroidism.

It is important to interpret these measurements within the context of the laboratory-specific normative range for each test. Diurnal variations exist in TSH secretion such that the lowest level will generally be obtained with a morning laboratory draw. Free T is usually measured by automated analog immunoassays. In most instances, this assay will yield accurate results. However, abnormal types or quantities of binding proteins may be present in some patients and may interfere with the accurate measurement of free T by analog immunoassays. These problems can be overcome by measuring free T via equilibrium dialysis. Family physicians will most commonly encounter patients with primary hypothyroidism. Secondary hypothyroidism is present in only 5 percent of cases. Abstract Most patients with hypothyroidism will require lifelong thyroid hormone therapy . The normal thyroid gland makes two thyroid hormones: T and triiodothyronine (T). Although T is produced in greater amounts, T is the biologically active form. Approximately 80 percent of T is derived from the peripheral conversion of T by deiodinase enzymes. However, because T preparations have short biologic half-lives, hypothyroidism is treated almost exclusively with once-daily synthetic thyroxine preparations. Once absorbed, synthetic thyroxine, like endogenous thyroxine, undergoes deiodination to the more biologically active T.       Algorithm for the treatment of primary hypothyroidism. (TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.) Information from references , and through . Algorithm for the treatment of primary hypothyroidism. (TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.) Information from references , and through . Synthetic thyroxine preparations are available as brand-name and generic products. In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the substitution of generic levothyroxine for brand-name levothyroxine. However, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the Endocrine Society, and the American Thyroid Association disagreed with the FDA's conclusion that generic preparations were bioequivalent to brand-name levothyroxine. They concluded that potentially flawed pharmacokinetic methods, combined with the lack of TSH measurements to establish bioequivalence, could lead to significant under- and overestimations of generic equivalency compared with brand-name levothyroxine products. Therefore, they recommend that patients be started and maintained on either brand-name or generic levothyroxine preparations, and not switched back and forth between the two. Patients who do switch products should undergo repeat TSH and free T testing in six weeks to ensure normal range levels. The starting dosage of levothyroxine in young, healthy adults for complete replacement is 1.6 mcg per kg per day . Thyroid hormone is generally taken in the Thyroid hormone is generally taken in the morning, 30 minutes before eating. Calcium and iron supplements should not be taken within four hours of taking levothyroxine, because these supplements may decrease thyroid hormone absorption. Poor adherence to levothyroxine therapy is the most common cause of persistently elevated TSH levels in patients on adequate doses of thyroid hormone. Levothyroxine dosing for infants and children is also weight-based and varies by age. Dosing guidelines for hypothyroidism in children are available at . Dosage should be adjusted based on clinical response and laboratory parameters.  Enlarge     Print Levothyroxine Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Adults Older patients; patients with known or suspected cardiac disease 25 or 50 mcg daily starting dosage; increase by 25 mcg every three to four weeks until full replacement dosage reached Increase to nine doses weekly (one extra dose on two days of the week) at earliest knowledge of pregnancy; refer to endocrinologist TSH < 10 mIU per L: 50 mcg daily, increase by 25 mcg daily every six weeks until TSH = 0.35 to 5.5 mIU per L Information from references through , and . Levothyroxine Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Adults Older patients; patients with known or suspected cardiac disease 25 or 50 mcg daily starting dosage; increase by 25 mcg every three to four weeks until full replacement dosage reached Increase to nine doses weekly (one extra dose on two days of the week) at earliest knowledge of pregnancy; refer to endocrinologist TSH < 10 mIU per L: 50 mcg daily, increase by 25 mcg daily every six weeks until TSH = 0.35 to 5.5 mIU per L Information from references through , and . Patients who have difficulty with morning levothyroxine dosing may find bedtime dosing an effective alternative. In a well-designed study conducted in the Netherlands, bedtime dosing of levothyroxine resulted in lower TSH and higher free T levels, but no difference in quality of life. Alternatively, patients with marked difficulty in adhering to a once-daily levothyroxine regimen can safely take their entire week's dosage of levothyroxine once weekly. Abstract Six populations deserve special consideration: (1) older patients; (2) patients with known or suspected ischemic heart disease; (3) pregnant women; (4) patients with persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism despite taking adequate doses of levothyroxine; (5) patients with subclinical hypothyroidism; and (6) patients suspected of having myxedema coma. OLDER PATIENTS AND PATIENTS WITH ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE In older patients and in patients with coronary artery disease, the initial dosage is generally 25 mcg or 50 mcg daily, with the dosage increased by 25 mcg every three to four weeks until the estimated full replacement dose is reached. Thyroid hormone increases heart rate and contractility, and therefore increases myocardial oxygen demand. Consequently, starting at higher doses may precipitate acute coronary syndrome or an arrhythmia. However, there are no high-quality studies that show that lower starting doses and slow titration result in fewer adverse effects than full-dose levothyroxine replacement in older patients and patients with ischemic heart disease. Thyroid hormone requirements increase during pregnancy. In one prospective study, 85 percent of pregnant patients required a median increase of 47 percent in their thyroid hormone requirements. These increases in levothyroxine dosing were required as early as the fifth week of pregnancy in some patients, which is before the first scheduled prenatal care visit. It is recommended that women on fixed doses of levothyroxine take nine doses each week (one extra dose on two days of the week), instead of the usual seven, as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Repeat thyroid function tests should be obtained five weeks after the increase in dosage. The increase in thyroid hormone requirement lasts throughout pregnancy. A small number of patients with hypothyroidism, mostly women, treated with an adequate dose of levothyroxine will report persistent symptoms such as fatigue, depressed mood, and weight gain despite having a TSH level in the lower half of the normal range. Some patients may have an alternative cause for their symptoms; in these patients, a limited laboratory and clinical investigation is reasonable . Combination T/T therapy, in the form of desiccated thyroid hormone preparations (e.g., thyroid USP, Armour thyroid) or levothyroxine plus liothyronine (Cytomel), is sometimes prescribed for patients with persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Enlarge     Print Alternative Causes of Persistent Symptoms in Patients with Normal-Range Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Levels Depression, anxiety disorder, and/or somatoform disorders Viral infection (e.g., mononucleosis, Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS) Alternative Causes of Persistent Symptoms in Patients with Normal-Range Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Levels Depression, anxiety disorder, and/or somatoform disorders Viral infection (e.g., mononucleosis, Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS) Desiccated thyroid hormone preparations are not recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the treatment of hypothyroidism, and a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials of combination T/T therapy versus T monotherapy showed no improvements in bodily pain, depression, or quality of life. A subsequent study showed that a small subset of patients who have a specific type 2 deiodinase polymorphism may benefit from combination therapy. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of combination T/T therapy in the treatment of primary hypothyroidism. Furthermore, genetic testing for a type 2 deiodinase polymorphism is not practical. Numerous medications can affect thyroid hormone levels in patients taking levothyroxine . Patients on a stable dose of levothyroxine who are then started on a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in particular sertraline (Zoloft), may show a rise in their TSH level and require an increase in their thyroid hormone dose.  Enlarge     Print Common Reasons for Abnormal TSH Levels on a Previously Stable Dosage of Thyroid Hormone Patient nonadherent to thyroid hormone regimen (missing doses) Patient takes thyroid hormone within four hours of calcium, iron, soy products, or aluminum-containing antacids Patient is prescribed medication that decreases absorption of thyroid hormone, such as cholestyramine (Questran), colestipol (Colestid), orlistat (Xenical), or sucralfate (Carafate) Patient is now pregnant or recently started or stopped estrogen-containing oral contraceptive or hormone therapy Generic substitution for brand name or vice versa, or substitution of one generic formulation for another Patient started on sertraline (Zoloft), another selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or a tricyclic antidepressant Patient started on carbamazepine (Tegretol) or phenytoin (Dilantin) : Reasons are sorted by the clinically most important cause.

Subclinical hypothyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis defined by a normal-range free T level and an elevated TSH level. Patients may or may not have symptoms attributable to hypothyroidism. On repeat testing, TSH levels may spontaneously normalize in many patients. However, in a prospective study of 107 patients older than 55 years, an initial TSH level greater than 10 to 15 mIU per L was the variable most strongly associated with progression to overt hypothyroidism. Elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers also increase the risk of progressing to frank thyroid gland failure, even when the TSH level is less than 10 mIU per L. Treatment with levothyroxine should be considered for patients with initial TSH levels greater than 10 mIU per L, patients with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, patients with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism and TSH levels between 5 and 10 mIU per L, and for patients who are pregnant or are attempting to conceive. Myxedema coma is a rare but extremely severe manifestation of hypothyroidism that most commonly occurs in older women who have a history of primary hypothyroidism. Mental status changes including lethargy, cognitive dysfunction, and even psychosis, and hypothermia are the hallmark features of myxedema coma. Hyponatremia, hypoventilation, and bradycardia can also occur. Because myxedema coma is a medical emergency with a high mortality rate, even with appropriate treatment, patients should be managed in the intensive care unit where proper ventilatory, electrolyte, and hemodynamic support can be given. Corticosteroids may also be needed. A search for precipitating causes such as infection, cardiac disease, metabolic disturbances, or drug use is critical.

d898298e-7188-443d-82f3-4757ec0f9595,"Hypothyroidism: A Woman’s Guide to Fertility and Pregnancy — A 2012 study in the found that 2 to 4 percent of childbearing age women have low thyroid hormone levels. This means there are a lot of women who are affected by the fertility issues caused by hypothyroidism. Keep reading to find out how having low thyroid hormone levels can lead to risks before, during, and after childbirth. Hypothyroidism and low thyroid hormone levels can affect many different aspects of menstruation and ovulation. Having low levels of thyroxine, or T4, or elevated thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) leads to high prolactin levels. This can cause either no egg to release during ovulation or an irregular egg release and difficulty conceiving. Hypothyroidism can also cause a shortened second half of the menstrual cycle. This may not allow a fertilized egg enough time to attach to the womb. It can also cause low basal body temperature, high thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, and ovarian cysts, which can lead to pregnancy loss or an inability to become pregnant. You should have your and levels monitored prior to becoming pregnant. This is especially true if you have low thyroid hormones already or have had a miscarriage. High risk factors include a family history of thyroid problems or any other autoimmune disease. Tackling your hypothyroid symptoms early in the pregnancy planning stages allows for early treatment. This can lead to a more successful outcome. The symptoms of hypothyroidism are similar to early pregnancy symptoms. Hypothyroid symptoms in early pregnancy include: The treatment of hypothyroidism in pregnancy is generally the same as prior to conception. However, it’s important to inform your doctor as soon as you become pregnant so you can receive the proper treatment and it can be adjusted if necessary. Your doctor will check your TSH lab values every four to six weeks to ensure your hormones are in the appropriate range. Your thyroid hormone requirements rise during pregnancy to support the baby and yourself. It’s also important to note that your prenatal vitamin contains iron and calcium, which can block how the body uses thyroid hormone replacement therapy. You can avoid this problem by taking your thyroid replacement medicine and prenatal vitamin four to five hours apart. Your doctor will need to use special care to treat your hypothyroidism during your pregnancy. If not properly controlled, it can cause: Uncontrolled symptoms can also impact your baby’s growth and brain development. After giving birth, postpartum thyroiditis is common. Women with autoimmune thyroid disease develop this complication more often. Postpartum thyroiditis commonly begins in the first three to six months after giving birth. This condition lasts several weeks to months. Some of the symptoms can be hard to distinguish from the struggles associated with becoming a new parent. The symptoms of postpartum thyroiditis may occur in two stages: In the first stage, your symptoms might look like hyperthyroidism. For example, you may be nervous, cranky, have a pounding heartbeat, sudden weight loss, trouble with heat, fatigue, or difficulty sleeping. In the second stage, hypothyroid symptoms return. You may have no energy, trouble with cold temperatures, constipation, dry skin, aches and pains, and problems thinking clearly. No two women are alike in how postpartum thyroiditis affects them. A higher risk for postpartum thyroiditis occurs in women with high-TPO antibodies in early pregnancy. This is due to a weakened immune system. Hypothyroidism can also affect your milk production but with proper hormone replacement therapy, this problem often resolves. You should talk to your doctor if you’re trying to get pregnant and have underlying thyroid or autoimmune disease or prior pregnancy complications. Your doctor can order the appropriate tests and develop a healthy pregnancy plan. The earlier you can prepare, the better your chances are for a successful outcome.

801900a3-7143-430e-a016-97332c32a00f,"The thyroid gland is located in the front of the neck below the voice box. It is just about the same size and shape – and is in the same location – as a small bow tie. The thyroid secretes two hormones that are crucial for regulating metabolism: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). The numbers refer to the numbers of iodine atoms each molecule of hormone contains. T4 is the major player, because it affects virtually every cell in the body. Hypothyroidism refers to a low level of thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism is a common problem, affecting perhaps one out of five women and a smaller percentage of men. If your thyroid activity is reduced, your body may not respond as well as it should to nutritional or supplemental strategies. For that reason, a crucial step in attaining or maintaining good health is to make sure your thyroid is working properly. Since thyroid hormones affect every cell of the body, a deficiency or hypothyroidism will usually result in a large number of signs and symptoms including low body temperature, intolerance to cold, weight gain or an inability to lose weight, depression, lack of concentration, hair loss, and fatigue. Hypothyroidism is an extremely common condition that is estimated to affect nearly 20% of all women and 10% of all men in the United States. Your doctor can conduct blood tests that measure thyroid hormone levels. The test assesses the quantity of T4 and T3 hormones and determines how well the body’s cells respond to the hormones by measuring the level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), a chemical released by the pituitary gland. High levels of TSH indicate that the cells of the body are not receiving adequate thyroid hormone. As a result, the pituitary is in overdrive, frantically trying to signal the thyroid to step up its hormone output. Although a low level of thyroid hormone or an elevated TSH clearly indicate low thyroid function, in milder cases of thyroid hormone insufficiency, the blood tests may show that hormone levels are within “normal” ranges, even if the person is experiencing symptoms. In these individuals, I recommend that they try to boost thyroid hormone activity by taking Thyroid Health Formula from Natural Factors. This recommendation is especially useful in people that have a TSH value is greater than 2.0 IU/ml (International Units per milliliter), but less than the 5.5 IU/ml level indicative of hypothyroidism. Before rushing off to your doctor for a blood test, however, I suggest that you first determine your basal body temperature. Your body temperature reflects your metabolic rate, a rate that in turn is largely determined by thyroid hormone activity. When your thyroid is out of whack, your temperature often falls. Many experts agree that the basal body temperature is the most sensitive functional test of thyroid function. The test is simple: all you need is a thermometer. Many health experts believe that determining your basal body temperature – the temperature of your body at rest – is the most sensitive test of thyroid function. The test is simple: all you need is a thermometer. Plan to take the test first thing in the morning after you wake up, because it’s important to measure temperature after you have had adequate rest. Before going to sleep, if you are not using a digital thermometer shake down a regular thermometer to below the 95-degree mark and place it by your bed. Immediately upon waking, place the thermometer in your armpit (if using a regular thermometer keep it there for a full 10). Hold your elbow close to your side to keep the thermometer in place. Repeat the test for least three mornings (preferably at the same time of day). A reading between 97.6 and 98.2 degrees F is normal. Readings below 97.6 may indicate hypothyroidism. Note: Menstruating women must perform the test on the second, third, and fourth days of menstruation. Men and postmenopausal women can perform the test at any time. What dietary factors are important in Hypothyroidism? An important dietary recommendation is to avoid goitrogens. Some foods, especially when eaten raw, contain substances that interfere with your body’s ability to absorb and use iodine. Because these foods can contribute to the risk of goiter, they are classified as goitrogens. Examples include turnips, cabbage, mustard, cassava root, soybean, peanuts, pine nuts, and millet. Because these foods contain many other valuable nutrients, I recommend that you avoid them only if low thyroid hormone levels are a problem for you. Cooking usually inactivates goitrogens, so don’t be concerned about these items in your diet if you serve them cooked. Also, the BIG concern over soy isoflavones inhibiting thyroid function appears to be overstated as recent studies have shown no adverse effect on thyroid function. What nutritional supplements should I take for Hypothyroidism? Severe hypothyroidism requires the use of supplemental thyroid hormone – available only by prescription. Mild or subclinical hypothyroidism may respond to nutritional and herbal support. High potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula; Vitamin D3 2,000-5,000 IU/day; Fish oil, EPA+DHA 1,000 to 3,000 mg/day. from Natural Factors provides additional key nutrients required for proper thyroid function as well as L-tyrosine the amino acid precursor to thyroid hormones and two herbs long used in Ayurvedic medicine – Withania somnifera (ashwaganda) and Commiphora mukul (myrrh) – that have shown an ability to boost thyroid function in experimental studies in animals. The two plants appear to exert synergistic effects. Specifically, withania extract appears to produce a significant increase in the level of thyroid hormone (T4) while commiphora extract enhances the conversion of T4 to the more potent T3 form. Both of the plants appear to boost thyroid function without influencing the release of the pituitary hormone TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) indicating the herbs work directly on the thyroid gland and other body tissues to exert their effects. This action is quite important as 95% of all cases of hypothyroidism are not due to a problem with pituitary. The problem is with the thyroid gland itself and an impaired conversion of T4 into the more potent T3 in tissues outside the thyroid gland. The recommended dosages for Thyroid Health is two capsules one to two times daily. Improvement in symptoms associated with subclinical hypothyroidism is an indication that the program is providing benefit. From Dr. Murray: Since the Thyroid Health formula has been available I have been continually been amazed at some of the feedback from users – really life changing experiences. Perhaps the best story is that of one health food store worker – Jane. A 38 year old woman, Jane had battled with her weight ever since high school. In the 20 years after high school she had gained 45 pounds. I was amazed when I saw her recently as she finally was able to shed the excess weight. She cried with joy when she thanked me for providing the answer to her health challenges. She said that the only thing that she had done differently over the past six months was add the Thyroid Health formula to her routine. She credited the formula with producing the changes in her life. It seems that Jane had always suffered from a mild insufficiency of thyroid hormone. By providing the nutritional and herbal support, the Thyroid Health formula reset her fat burning thermostat and she was able to lose the weight that had plagued her for 20 years. The thyroid gland is located in the front of the neck below the voice box. It is just about the same size and shape – and is in the same location – as a small bow tie. The thyroid secretes two hormones that are crucial for regulating metabolism: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). The numbers refer to the numbers of iodine atoms each molecule of hormone contains. T4 is the major player, because it affects virtually every cell in the body. Hypothyroidism refers to a low level of thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism is a common problem, affecting perhaps one out of five women and a smaller percentage of men. If your thyroid activity is reduced, your body may not respond as well as it should to nutritional or supplemental strategies. For that reason, a crucial step in attaining or maintaining good health is to make sure your thyroid is working properly. Since thyroid hormones affect every cell of the body, a deficiency or hypothyroidism will usually result in a large number of signs and symptoms including low body temperature, intolerance to cold, weight gain or an inability to lose weight, depression, lack of concentration, hair loss, and fatigue. Hypothyroidism is an extremely common condition that is estimated to affect nearly 20% of all women and 10% of all men in the United States. Your doctor can conduct blood tests that measure thyroid hormone levels. The test assesses the quantity of T4 and T3 hormones and determines how well the body’s cells respond to the hormones by measuring the level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), a chemical released by the pituitary gland. High levels of TSH indicate that the cells of the body are not receiving adequate thyroid hormone. As a result, the pituitary is in overdrive, frantically trying to signal the thyroid to step up its hormone output. Although a low level of thyroid hormone or an elevated TSH clearly indicate low thyroid function, in milder cases of thyroid hormone insufficiency, the blood tests may show that hormone levels are within “normal” ranges, even if the person is experiencing symptoms. In these individuals, I recommend that they try to boost thyroid hormone activity by taking Thyroid Health Formula from Natural Factors. This recommendation is especially useful in people that have a TSH value is greater than 2.0 IU/ml (International Units per milliliter), but less than the 5.5 IU/ml level indicative of hypothyroidism.

What nutritional supplements should I take for Hypothyroidism? Severe hypothyroidism requires the use of supplemental thyroid hormone – available only by prescription. Mild or subclinical hypothyroidism may respond to nutritional and herbal support. There are three products from Natural Factors that I think are critical in supporting good health: (age and gender specific multiple vitamin and mineral formulas). Follow label instructions. – a great tasting “greens drink” containing highly concentrated “greens” like chlorella, spirulina, wheat grass juice, barley grass juice, etc., and herbal extracts. Take one serving (one tablespoon) in 8 ounces of water daily. – A true pharmaceutical grade fish oil supplement. Take two capsules daily. from Natural Factors provides additional key nutrients required for proper thyroid function as well as L-tyrosine the amino acid precursor to thyroid hormones and two herbs long used in Ayurvedic medicine – Withania somnifera (ashwaganda) and Commiphora mukul (myrrh) – that have shown an ability to boost thyroid function in experimental studies in animals.

On the show I discussed the failure of conventional medicine to address the underlying issues in many health conditions offering little more than drugs as biochemical “band aids.” Glaucoma most often refers to the vision loss caused by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) as a result of greater production than outflow of the fluid of the eye (the aqueous humor). The normal intraocular pressure is about 10 to 21 mm Hg. In chronic glaucoma, the intraocular pressure is usually mildly to moderately elevated (22 to 40 mm Hg). In acute glaucoma, the intraocular pressure is greater than 40 mm Hg. Acute glaucoma is a medical emergency, fortunately it is the rarest form of glaucoma. Chronic open-angle type glaucoma is by far the most common form. It accounts for about 70-75% of the approximately 3 million people in the United States who have glaucoma. In some cases glaucoma develops in people with normal IOP. Referred to as low-tension glaucoma or normotensive glaucoma (NTG), this form accounts for approximately 25 to 30 percent of all glaucoma cases in the United States. NTG is more common in women than in men and affects adults averaging 60 years old. A common risk factor for NTG is low blood pressure. Since many patients with glaucoma have no symptoms, it is important that regular eye exams be included in their annual checkup after the age of sixty. Glaucoma is a serious condition that requires strict attention. Since patients with the early stages of chronic glaucoma rarely have symptoms, it is important that regular eye exams be included in their annual checkup after the age of sixty. Chronic glaucoma can result in the gradual loss of peripheral vision resulting in tunnel vision. Typical signs and symptoms of acute glaucoma include extreme pain, blurring of vision, reddened eyes, and a fixed and dilated pupil. Acute glaucoma is a medical emergency. If you are showing any signs of glaucoma, consult an ophthalmologist immediately. Unless adequately treated within twelve to forty-eight hours, an individual with acute glaucoma will become permanently blind within two to five days. The cause of glaucoma appears to be an abnormality in the composition of the supportive structures of the eye. Specifically, structural changes reflecting poor collagen integrity and function are the hallmark features of glaucoma. These changes lead to blockage in the flow of the aqueous humor and result in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) readings. For chronic glaucoma, a generally healthful diet is recommended, with a focus on foods high in vitamin C and flavonoids, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. In addition, regular consumption of cold-water fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, herring, and halibut) is also encouraged due to their high content of omega-3 fatty acids. Animal studies have shown that an increased consumption of omega-3 fatty acids can lower IOP. Chronic glaucoma has been successfully treated by eliminating allergies. In one study, of the 113 patients exposed to a food or environmental allergen demonstrated an immediate rise in IOP of up to 20 mm, in addition to other typical allergic symptoms. To treat glaucoma by eliminating food allergens, follow the guidelines given in FOOD ALLERGIES. What nutritional supplements should I take for GLAUCOMA? High potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula; Vitamin D3 2,000-5,000 IU/day; Fish oil, EPA+DHA 1,000 to 3,000 mg/day. is necessary for proper collagen integrity. Vitamin C supplementation has been shown to lower IOP levels of glaucoma patients in many clinical studies. Although some people respond to as little as 2 grams per day, others may respond only to extremely high doses (35 grams per day). Abdominal discomfort is common when using high doses, but usually tapers off after three to four days. The ability of vitamin C to reduce the IOP lasts only as long as supplementation is continued. contains flavonoids that enhance the effects of vitamin C and stabilize the collagen matrix. The citrus bioflavonoid rutin has also been demonstrated to lower IOP when used as an adjunct in patients who are unresponsive to glaucoma medications alone. Grapeseed extract is a better choice. supplementation lowers IOP in a fashion similar to that of popular drugs used in the treatment of glaucoma. Magnesium works just like the drugs by blocking the entry of calcium to produce relaxation of the arteries. In fact, magnesium has been referred to as “nature’s calcium-channel blocker.” Magnesium supplementation improves the peripheral circulation and seems to have a beneficial effect on the visual field in patients with glaucoma. shows promise in the treatment of glaucoma. In one study of patients with severe chronic glaucoma, although the improvements in IOP were mild, given the poor prognosis for these patients the results were deemed relevant. The recommended dosage of ginkgo extract (24% ginkgo flavonglycosides) is 160 to 240 mg daily. Periodic re-examination by your physician to measure intraocular pressure is important. If the recommendations above are working there should be a gradual improvement in visual function and a normalization of IOP.   For more information, please see the completely revised and updated 3 edition of PQQ may be the perfect answer to preventing or reversing age-related mental decline. kiwiPQQ (short for pyrroloquinoline quinone) is a vitamin-like compound found in plant foods that shows a wide range of benefits for brain function and energy production. Learn more about PQQ with the following Q&A. What Exactly Does PQQ Do? PQQ is an extremely potent antioxidant that is able to carry out the role of an antioxidant in the body more than 20,000 times—which is a rare thing. For example, other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, are only able to accomplish this “cycling” process about four times. Are There Any Food Sources of PQQ? PQQ has been found in all plant foods analyzed to date. Particularly PPQ-rich foods include parsley, green peppers, kiwi, papaya, and tofu. These foods contain 2–3 mcg of PQQ per 100 grams. Green tea provides about the same amount per 4-oz. serving. While these amounts appear to be sufficient in helping our cells carry out their basic functions, research indicates that boosting PQQ through supplementation can produce some amazing effects.

Does your brain feel like it's in a fog? You may be one of the millions of Americans suffering a chronic, undiagnosed health condition. Going up a couple of pant sizes could be caused by any of these , but it's also one of the top symptoms of . Also called an underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism is a condition in which your metabolism-running thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. Hypothyroidism is more common than you would believe; the metabolic disease affects  of the U.S. population and millions of people are currently hypothyroid and don't know it. There are over a dozen common symptoms of hypothyroidism, and weight gain is one of the most prevalent. ""Patients with hypothyroidism will have a generalized slowing of their metabolism and reduction in their basal metabolic rate (or BMR),"" explains , assistant professor of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Diseases at Mount Sinai. ""This can lead to changes in the way their body expends energy. With a lower metabolic rate, people may gain excess weight eating a similar diet. Some of this may be excess fat, but there may also be fluid retention."" So, even if you're diligently dieting and working out, you may still gain weight if you have hypothyroidism. Because early symptoms of the disease are diverse and mimic the symptoms of everyday life, millions of cases of thyroid disease remain undiagnosed or are mistaken for other disorders. If you've recently gained weight, it may be worth checking to see if you also have any of the following symptoms so you know it's time to see your doctor to get tested. See if you can relate to any of the below items and you might also want to check out these ! Your thyroid gland is the butterfly-shaped gland at the base of your neck. It secretes two all-important hormones that control major bodily functions (including how you use energy, regulate body temperature, and digest food) and organs (including the heart, brain, liver, kidneys and skin). But with hypothyroidism, your body can have normal to low thyroxine hormone levels and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. These high TSH levels are a result of an overworked pituitary gland that is trying to elevate the hormone levels in an inadequately responsive thyroid. Many things can put you at risk for hypothyroidism, from genetic predispositions to an autoimmune disorder called Hashimoto's thyroiditis (a condition that occurs in 80 percent of those with hypothyroidism in which the immune system attacks the thyroid). Fortunately, thyroid screening is a simple blood test, and thyroid trouble can often be fixed with the right prescription. Keep reading for some of the common symptoms you may experience if an underactive thyroid is behind your weight gain. Having trouble staying awake even after a full night's sleep? Tiredness, constant fatigue, sleepiness, and lack of energy are issues associated with many conditions, but they're strongly linked with hypothyroidism. When it comes down to it, too little thyroid hormone flowing through your blood means your cells aren't getting that ""get going"" signal, leading you to feel sluggish. Your hypothyroidism may have tricked you into thinking you don't have enough energy for exercise, but actually, by increasing your physical activity, you can help counter fatigue and improve energy levels. You can also try adding these to your diet. We know exercise is a crucial component in reaching your body goals, but it shouldn't be leaving you constantly seeking out a warm bath. If your muscles don't seem to be recovering even on your days off, this might be explained by a thyroid problem. Your thyroid gland secretes hormones that control your metabolism—the body's way of converting the food you eat into fuel. Fewer metabolism-controlling hormones mean a slower metabolism and a disruption in how your body burns energy, which can affect how your muscles feel. To counteract these symptoms, choose low-impact exercises like elliptical-stepping or swimming and increase the consumption of fish in your diet. Fish like are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to decrease the inflammation that might be contributing to your muscle and joint pain. You know you had something to do today, but you just can't remember what it is. Sure, there's sleep deprivation, stress, and aging to blame, but your overall cognitive functioning takes a hit when your thyroid is out of whack. Too little thyroid hormone may cause forgetfulness and poor memory. Because the hormone deficiency slows everything down, neurological functions will also take a toll after some time. Do you know what else hurts your brain functioning? These . Looking for more helpful tips? Sign up for our newsletter to get daily recipes and food news in your inbox! Even though your doctor doesn't typically look for thyroid problems during your check-ups, he or she will often measure your cholesterol levels. High blood cholesterol levels can put you at risk of getting heart disease, but they also might be indicative of a thyroid problem. According to Dr. Srinath, ""Hypothyroidism causes reduced clearance of cholesterol particles, so LDL and triglycerides may be elevated in a hypothyroid patient."" Looking to lower LDL levels? Try eating . The fiber called beta-glucan in this cereal grain has been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels by 5 to 10 percent. See your doctor to get checked for high cholesterol levels, and when you're looking to change your diet to lower these levels, consider these . Having little or no desire to get it on is a side effect of a thyroid disorder. Because of the connection between thyroid function and adrenal glands—the organs that control your ""fight or flight"" response as well as sexual hormones like testosterone—via the shared hypothalamus and pituitary gland regulators, low levels of thyroid hormone also result in low levels of sex hormones. ""Libido is a reflection of testosterone status,"" explains Dr. Srinath, ""too little thyroid hormone can stimulate a pituitary hormone called prolactin, which then suppresses testosterone levels."" While too little thyroid hormone could be a contributor to a low libido, the cumulative impact of other hypothyroidism symptoms, such as weight gain, depression, low energy, and body aches, certainly may also play a part. So if you've been avoiding these and still don't feel like romping around in the sack, there might be this health condition to blame. While it might not be a primary symptom, feeling particularly down in the dumps can be a debilitating side effect of hypothyroidism. Dr. Srinath explains that ""Depression can be related to other symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, muscle weakness, lethargy, difficulty with focus and concentration."" With an underactive thyroid turning many body functions down to low, it's not surprising that your mood might sink too. You've bought the face creams, the masks, and the moisturizing lotions, but nothing seems to work. It turns out, dry and itchy skin can be a symptom of hypothyroidism. The change in skin texture and appearance is due to reduced circulation as a result of low thyroid function. A reduction in circulation can cause skin cells to receive one-fourth to one-fifth the normal blood supply, leaving them wrinkled and cracked. Also, a slowed metabolism (caused by too little thyroid hormone production), can reduce sweating. Without the moisture from sweating, skin can quickly become dry and flaky. If just your skin is dry, you could have eczema, but if it is compounded with brittle nails, poor wound healing, and hair loss, you should be checked by your doctor. We know constipation is an embarrassing topic that no one likes to discuss, but if you can't boot your bowel issues, it might be time to call up your doctor. Without enough of the metabolism-controlling thyroid hormone, many of your body's functions slow down. One of these functions is the action of the digestive tract, which will start to slow down. Hypothyroidism can weaken the contraction of the muscles that line your digestive tract, causing stool to move too slowly through the intestine. If your sluggish digestive tract isn't due to hypothyroidism, consider eating a . The super fruit is rich in fiber to help increase stool weight, potassium to help you avoid bloating and cramping, and prebiotics to help feed good gut bacteria and improve digestion. If you're still wearing your winter coat when it's 60 degrees and sunny, you might be suffering from hypothyroidism. It might be easy to adjust the temperature in your house or car, but patients who have hypothyroidism struggle to regulate the temperature in their bodies. Because the thyroid gland controls your body temperature, when hypothyroidism patients' bodies make too little thyroid hormone, body temperature tends to decrease because less energy is being burned by downstream cell targets. Less energy compounded with slow metabolism equals less heat. One part of your hypothyroidism treatment may be changing your diet. If so, you'll want to look at these 25 Best Foods to Eat for Your Thyroid and Metabolism. Olivia Tarantino is a senior editor of , specializing in nutrition, health, and food product coverage.

e1d22e91-f8fd-411c-9582-845f90d0ff32,"— — Hypothyroidism, or having an underactive thyroid, can cause many symptoms like fatigue, joint pain, heart palpitations, and depression. The condition also reduces overall metabolism, making those with hypothyroidism more prone to weight gain. Exercise can relieve many of the symptoms associated with hypothyroidism and can improve cardiovascular health and muscle mass. If left untreated, having low levels of thyroid hormones can reduce cardiac fitness. Those with hypothyroidism are also at a greater risk of ventricular arrhythmias, or a rapid heart beat. In addition to medications, exercise also plays a key role in strengthening the cardiovascular system. Regularly participating in activities like running, walking at a brisk pace, or playing a sport can improve cardiac health. The related mood-boosting benefits can also relieve other hypothyroidism symptoms including depression and fatigue. Those with hypothyroidism frequently experience muscle and joint pain. Low-impact activities that minimize stress on joints such as the knee, hip, or back may be easier to do as opposed to more strenuous activities. Some options include yoga, Pilates, walking, swimming, and biking. Because hypothyroidism lowers your body’s resting metabolic rate, people with this condition are more liable to gain weight and suffer secondary problems caused by obesity. Building muscle through strength training can counteract these effects. Some research shows that obesity can reduce a person’s response to exercise. These individuals may find it harder to develop skeletal muscle proteins in response to exercise. The reasons for this are unclear, but it’s possible that underlying hormonal deficiencies, including hypothyroidism, may be to blame. Having hypothyroidism doesn’t mean you can’t participate in competitive sports or train for a race or marathon. But, a recent of highly-trained male athletes found that it may be more difficult to do any kind of high-intensity exercises. Athletes may need to adapt their training plans to let their bodies recover from this effect. Exercise isn’t a substitute for hormone therapy to treat hypothyroidism. Some studies even suggest that in spite of prescribed medication, those with hypothyroidism may experience greater discomfort during exercise. Still, when practiced safely, many forms of exercise offer specific benefits to individuals with hypothyroidism. Always discuss your exercise plan and goals with your doctor before starting a new routine or regimen. — — Standard treatment for hypothyroidism includes oral medication, but there are natural therapies too.

If your thyroid becomes overactive (hyperthyroidism), underactive (hypothyroidism), or cancerous, you could experience a range of health problems. Once diagnosed, however, thyroid problems can usually be treated effectively. The thyroid is a gland in the neck, near the base of the throat. The thyroid gland makes hormones that help control many of the body’s metabolic processes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight. — is when the thyroid is overactive and makes too much thyroid hormone. The most common symptoms of hyperthyroidism are feeling or nervous, being unable to tolerate heat, having , feeling tired and losing weight, even if you’re eating the same amount of food. Hyperthyroidism is sometimes called thyrotoxicosis. — this is when the thyroid is underactive and does not make enough thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism can go on for years without showing any signs. When symptoms do appear, they can be quite varied and can include fatigue, being unable to tolerate the cold, constipation, dry skin, weight gain, poor memory and depression. — this is when some of the thyroid cells become cancerous. Thyroid cancer is more common in women than in men and is usually diagnosed in people’s fifties. It can usually be treated successfully. Other thyroid problems include nodules that grow in the thyroid, an inflamed thyroid, and an enlarged thyroid (goitre). These conditions may lead to either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Because the thyroid gland plays an important role in controlling many of the body’s functions, serious health problems can result when it is not functioning as it should. If you think you may have a thyroid problem, it’s important to see your doctor. , (Evaluating and managing patients with thyrotoxicosis), , , Learn more here about the development and quality assurance of healthdirect content.

Thyroid diseases include hyper-and hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, thyroiditis, goitre and solitary thyroid nodule. Hypothyroidism is a lifelong condition where your thyroid gland doesn’t make enough thyroid hormones. Your thyroid gland makes hormones that control your metabolism. An overactive or underactive thyroid can cause symptoms. Hyperthyroidism can be diagnosed with a simple blood test that measures thyroid hormone levels.

081de8ac-c7b3-4864-942e-194c4ed7c110,"Best Diet for Hypothyroidism: Foods to Eat, Foods to Avoid — Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the body doesn’t make enough thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones help control growth, cell repair, and metabolism. As a result, people with hypothyroidism may experience tiredness, hair loss, weight gain, feeling cold, and feeling down, among many other symptoms (). Hypothyroidism affects 1–2% of people worldwide and is ten times more likely to affect women than men (). Foods alone won’t cure hypothyroidism. However, a combination of the right nutrients and medication can help restore thyroid function and minimize your symptoms. This article outlines the best diet for hypothyroidism, including which foods to eat and which to avoid — all based on research. The is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that sits near the base of your neck. It makes and stores thyroid hormones that affect nearly every cell in your body (). When the thyroid gland receives a signal called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), it releases thyroid hormones into the bloodstream. This signal is sent from the pituitary gland, a small gland found at the base of your brain, when thyroid hormone levels are low (). Occasionally, the thyroid gland doesn’t release thyroid hormones, even when there is plenty of TSH. This is called primary hypothyroidism and the most common type of hypothyroidism. Approximately 90% of primary is caused by Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease in which your immune system mistakenly attacks your thyroid gland (). Other causes of primary hypothyroidism are iodine deficiency, a genetic disorder, taking certain medications, and surgery that removes part of the thyroid (). Other times, the thyroid gland does not receive enough TSH. This happens when the pituitary gland is not working properly and is called secondary hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormones are very important. They help control growth, cell repair, and metabolism — the process by which your body converts what you eat into energy. Your metabolism affects your body temperature and at what rate you burn calories. That’s why people with hypothyroidism often feel cold and fatigued and may gain weight easily (). You can learn more about the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism . Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. As the thyroid hormone is important for growth, repair, and metabolism, people with hypothyroidism may often feel cold and fatigued and may gain weight easily. The thyroid hormone helps control the speed of your metabolism. The faster your metabolism, the more calories your body burns at rest. People with hypothyroidism make less thyroid hormone. This means they have a slower metabolism and burn fewer calories at rest. Having a slow metabolism comes with several health risks. It may leave you tired, , and make it harder for you to lose weight (). If you find it difficult to maintain your weight with hypothyroidism, try doing moderate or high intensity cardio. This includes exercises like fast-paced walking, running, hiking, and rowing. Research shows that moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise may help boost your thyroid hormone levels. In turn, this may help (, ). People with hypothyroidism might also benefit from increasing their protein intake. Research shows that higher protein diets help increase the rate of your metabolism (). People with hypothyroidism usually have a slower metabolism. Research shows that aerobic exercise can help boost your thyroid hormone levels. Additionally, eating more protein may help boost your metabolism. Several nutrients are important for optimal thyroid health. is an essential mineral that’s needed to make thyroid hormones. Thus, people with iodine deficiency might be at risk of hypothyroidism (). Iodine deficiency is very common and affects nearly one-third of the world’s population. However, it’s less common in people from developed countries like the United States, where iodized salt and iodine-rich seafood is widely available (). If you have an iodine deficiency, consider adding iodized table salt to your meals or eating more like seaweed, fish, dairy, and eggs. Iodine supplements are unnecessary, as you can get plenty of iodine from your diet. Some studies have also shown that getting too much of this mineral may damage the thyroid gland (). helps “activate” thyroid hormones so they can be used by the body (). This essential mineral also has antioxidant benefits, which means it may protect the thyroid gland from damage by molecules called free radicals (). Adding to your diet is a great way to boost your selenium levels. This includes Brazil nuts, tuna, sardines, eggs, and legumes. However, avoid taking a selenium supplement unless advised by your healthcare provider. Supplements provide large doses, and selenium may be toxic in large amounts (, ). Like selenium, zinc helps the body “activate” thyroid hormones (). Studies also show that zinc may help the body regulate TSH, the hormone that tells the thyroid gland to release thyroid hormones (). are rare in developed countries, as zinc is abundant in the food supply. Nonetheless, if you have hypothyroidism, you should aim to eat more like oysters and other shellfish, beef, and chicken. Research shows that iodine, selenium, and zinc are especially beneficial for those with hypothyroidism. However, it’s best to avoid iodine and selenium supplements unless your healthcare provider advises you to take them. Several nutrients may harm the health of those with hypothyroidism. are compounds that may interfere with the normal function of the thyroid gland. They get their name from the term goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid gland that may occur with hypothyroidism (). Surprisingly, many common foods contain goitrogens, including (): cabbage, broccoli, kale, cauliflower, spinach, etc. sweet potatoes, cassava, peaches, strawberries, etc. In theory, people with hypothyroidism should avoid goitrogens. However, this only seems to be an issue for people who have an iodine deficiency or eat large amounts of goitrogens (, , , ). Also, cooking foods with goitrogens may inactivate these compounds (). One exception to the above foods is pearl millet. Some studies have found that pearl millet might interfere with thyroid function, even if you don’t have an iodine deficiency (). Dietary substances that may affect thyroid function include goitrogens. Fortunately, you don’t have to avoid many foods if you have hypothyroidism. However, foods that contain goitrogens should be eaten in moderation and ideally cooked. You should also avoid eating highly processed foods, as they usually contain a lot of calories. This can be a problem if you have hypothyroidism, as you may gain weight easily. Here is a list of foods and supplements you should avoid: hot dogs, cakes, cookies, etc. Adequate intakes of selenium and iodine are essential for thyroid health, but getting too much of either may cause harm. Only supplement with selenium and iodine if your healthcare provider has instructed you to do so. Here is a list of foods you can eat in moderation. These foods contain goitrogens or are known irritants if consumed in large amounts. tofu, tempeh, edamame beans, soy milk, etc. broccoli, kale, spinach, cabbage, etc. coffee, green tea, and alcohol — these beverages may irritate your thyroid gland (, , ) People with hypothyroidism should avoid millet, processed foods, and supplements like selenium and zinc (unless a healthcare provider has advised you to take them). Foods that contain goitrogens are fine in moderate amounts unless they cause discomfort. There are plenty of food options for people with hypothyroidism, including: are best, as much of their iodine and selenium are found in the yolk, while the whites are full of protein all meats, including lamb, beef, chicken, etc. all seafood, including salmon, tuna, halibut, shrimp, etc. all vegetables — cruciferous vegetables are fine to eat in moderate amounts, especially when cooked all other fruits, including berries, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, etc. rice, buckwheat, quinoa, chia seeds, and flax seeds all dairy products, including milk, cheese, yogurt, etc. water and other non-caffeinated beverages People with hypothyroidism should eat a diet based around vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. They are and very filling, which may help prevent weight gain. People with hypothyroidism have plenty of healthy food options, including eggs, meat, fish, most fruits and vegetables, gluten-free grains and seeds, all dairy products, and non-caffeinated beverages. Here is a 7-day meal plan for those with hypothyroidism. It provides a healthy amount of , has a low to moderate amount of carbs, and should help you maintain a healthy weight. Make sure you take your thyroid medication at least 1–2 hours before your first meal, or as your healthcare provider has advised.

It provides plenty of options for a delicious and healthy menu. It’s very easy to gain weight with hypothyroidism due to a slow metabolism. Here are a few tips to help you maintain a healthy weight. Aim to get 7–8 hours of every night. Sleeping less than this is linked to fat gain, especially around the belly area (). , which involves paying attention to what you’re eating, why you’re eating, and how fast you’re eating can help you develop a better relationship with food. Studies also show that it can help you lose weight (, ). Yoga and can help you de-stress and improve your overall health. Research also shows that they help you maintain a healthy weight (). Eating a low to moderate amount of carbs is very effective for maintaining a healthy weight. However, avoid trying a ketogenic diet, as eating too few carbs may lower your thyroid hormone levels (, ). While it’s easy to gain weight when you have hypothyroidism, plenty of strategies can help you maintain a healthy weight. For example, you can try getting plenty of rest, eating a good amount of protein, and practicing mindful eating. Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, is a health problem that affects 1–2% of people worldwide. It can cause symptoms like tiredness, weight gain, and feeling cold, among many others.

It means your thyroid gland is not active enough. This tiny gland is found in the front of your neck. Its job is to make thyroid hormone. If the gland is underactive, it may not make enough thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones control how your body uses energy. They affect almost every organ in your body. When your thyroid doesn’t make enough of these hormones, parts of your body slow down.   The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disorder. This means your immune system starts to attack itself. It makes antibodies against the thyroid gland. The normal thyroid cells are overrun by white blood cells and scar tissue. Another cause may be treatment for an overactive thyroid gland. That may include radioactive iodine therapy or surgery. Hypothyroidism may also develop shortly after pregnancy. A condition called secondary hypothyroidism can also sometimes happen. It’s when your pituitary gland stops working. The pituitary gland then no longer tells the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormones. Newborns are tested at birth for hypothyroidism. This condition is called congenital hypothyroidism. It must be treated right away. It can affect a baby’s brain and nervous system. You may be more likely to have hypothyroidism if you: Have had thyroid problems or thyroid surgery in the past Have certain conditions, such as type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis Have Turner syndrome, a genetic condition that affects women Are pregnant or have had a baby within the last 6 months Have an iodine deficiency. Your body needs iodine to make thyroid hormone. Symptoms are different for each person. They are usually hard to notice and start slowly. They may be mistaken for symptoms of depression. Here are the most common symptoms and signs: These symptoms may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Your healthcare provider will ask about your past health. You will also need a physical exam. Blood tests can also help diagnose hypothyroidism. They can measure the amount of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormones in your blood. Treatment will depend on your symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. The goal of treatment is to return your level of thyroid hormone back to normal. You may need to take medicine that gives you a dose of thyroid hormones. This dose may need to be changed over time. You will likely need to take this medicine for the rest of your life. You will need follow-up blood tests to make sure you are taking the correct dose of thyroid hormone replacement. What are possible complications of hypothyroidism? If your hypothyroidism is not treated, these complications may happen: Tell your healthcare provider if your symptoms get worse or you have new symptoms. If you are a woman of childbearing age and want to become pregnant, talk with your healthcare provider first. Hypothyroidism means your thyroid gland is underactive. It isn’t making enough thyroid hormone. The most common cause is when your immune system starts to attack itself. Symptoms include dull facial expressions, tiredness, and weight gain. Blood tests can help diagnose this condition. They can measure the amount of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone in your blood. The goal of treatment is to return your levels of thyroid hormone back to normal. Untreated hypothyroidism may lead to anemia, low body temperature, and heart failure. Treatment may include medicine that replaces lost thyroid hormones. You often will need to take thyroid hormones for the rest of your life.

Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. The condition is more common in adults. But it’s the most common thyroid disorder in children. Not enough thyroid hormone leads to signs such as slow growth, lack of activity, and poor performance in school. In children it’s often referred to as acquired hypothyroidism. The most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism is an autoimmune reaction. This is when the body's immune system slowly destroys the thyroid gland.

b5aa9328-77d1-49f0-886d-f20a9a2f8fde,"Hypothyroidism – Underactive Thyroid Natural Treatment Posted by The thyroid gland is located at the base of the neck just below the Adam’s apple. The thyroid produces two main hormones called T3 and T4 which are transported in the blood to all parts of the body. These hormones control the rate of many activities in your body including how fast calories are burned and how fast or slow a person’s heart rate is. Combined, these activities are often referred to as the metabolism. When thyroid disease occurs and the thyroid gland is compromised it may produce too few hormones and this can result in the metabolism slowing down. This condition is often referred to as an underactive thyroid function or hypothyroidism. When it functions as it should, the thyroid will produce T3 and T4 at a 20% – 80% ratio. An under-production of these hormones will slow down the body’s metabolism, causing hypothyroidism. Common symptoms of this condition are: In addition to these symptoms, people with hypothyroidism may have high blood levels of LDL cholesterol, the so-called “bad” cholesterol. Autoimmune thyroiditis, where the body’s own immune system attacks the thyroid gland. Iodine deficiency since iodine is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones. Deficiency of protein, magnesium and zinc, since these are all essential for the thyroid to function properly. Heavy metal poisoning or an over-abundance of chemicals and pesticides in the body. Root canal teeth can leak toxins into the body and enter the thyroid gland, producing thyroid disease. The majority of people who have an underactive thyroid such as Hashimoto’s disease, have an autoimmune disease whereby the immune system attacks thyroid tissue. So, in order to find an underactive thyroid natural treatment it is important to address the autoimmune issue. Just taking prescription medication for low thyroid function will simply just mask the symptoms. Making dietary changes can be the first step in embracing natural thyroid treatment. Underactive thyroid treatment can begin with cutting out, and adding to, the diet in the following ways: Foods that are rich in Vitamin A such as carrots and eggs. Seafood such as arame, dulce, kelp and nori that contain high levels of iodine. Foods that are rich in zinc such as beef, chicken, nuts and spinach. Increasing protein intake can help improve low thyroid function. Proteins include nuts and nut butters; quinoa; hormone- and antibiotic-free animal products (organic, grass-fed meats, eggs, and sustainably-farmed fish); and legumes. Insufficient intake of fat can exacerbate hormonal imbalance, which includes thyroid hormones. Natural, healthful fats include olive oil; ghee; avocados; flax seeds; fish; nuts and nut butters; hormone- and antibiotic-free full fat cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese and coconut milk products. Certain fruits and vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, peaches and pears can diminish the thyroid’s production of thyroxin. Greatly reduce or eliminate caffeine and sugar, which people with low thyroid function naturally reach for in order to boost their flagging energy. Gluten has an almost identical molecular composition to thyroid tissue and consuming gluten can increase an autoimmune attack on your thyroid. The Role of Nutrients in Natural Hypothyroid Treatment It is doubtful that nutritional deficiencies are the sole cause of an underactive thyroid, but not having enough of these micronutrients and minerals can aggravate symptoms of low thyroid function. Increasing the intake of; vitamin D, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, zinc, copper, vitamin A, the B vitamins, and iodine can help in natural hypothyroid treatment. Vitamin D levels can be checked by a simple blood test. Optimal levels are between 50-80 ng/mL; anything below 32 contributes to hormone pathway disruption. Omega-3s, found in fish, grass fed animal products, flaxseeds, and walnuts, are the building blocks for hormones that control immune function and cell growth, are critical to thyroid function, and improve the ability to respond to thyroid hormones. Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant which can help in underactive thyroid treatment. It can boost the immune system, reduce autoimmune flare-ups, and protect and heal thyroid tissue. The thyroid gland affects all the other hormones in the body and its proper regulation is essential to good hormonal balance and health.  With the disturbing increase in thyroid disease, an annual screening of thyroid gland is recommended. This should include blood tests that check on thyroid gland hormone levels and body iodine levels. When a patient is suspected to have a thyroid disorder a comprehensive thyroid profile is ordered, in the form of a blood test. The test results will give precise measurements of Free T3 and T4 and their ratios to each other. If the results indicate that for example, the patient’s T3 level is too low then the patient will be checked for deficiencies in essential nutrients which are required for hormone production. Many times this will correct the thyroid without the need for prescription hormones. However, it is frequently discovered that the thyroid is making enough of the T4 hormone but it is not converting to the metabolic active hormone, T3. This conversion problem can easily be found when the appropriate thyroid evaluation tests are performed. Another problem of conversion involves too much of the T4 converting into another thyroid hormone called Reverse T3. Reverse T3 is not metabolizing active and can contribute to symptoms of underactive thyroid. Again, proper testing of the thyroid will uncover this issue. Correct thyroid treatment requires the correct evaluation and that is what is performed at LifeWorks Wellness Center. Bio-energy testing often uncovers undetected thyroid issues that standard labs miss! LifeWorks Wellness Center is long recognized as one of the foremost natural health clinics in the US.

72a984ed-f265-440b-98e1-d84bb848f2fb,"Hypothyroidism – Underactive Thyroid Natural Treatment Posted by The thyroid gland is located at the base of the neck just below the Adam’s apple. The thyroid produces two main hormones called T3 and T4 which are transported in the blood to all parts of the body. These hormones control the rate of many activities in your body including how fast calories are burned and how fast or slow a person’s heart rate is. Combined, these activities are often referred to as the metabolism. When thyroid disease occurs and the thyroid gland is compromised it may produce too few hormones and this can result in the metabolism slowing down. This condition is often referred to as an underactive thyroid function or hypothyroidism. When it functions as it should, the thyroid will produce T3 and T4 at a 20% – 80% ratio. An under-production of these hormones will slow down the body’s metabolism, causing hypothyroidism. Common symptoms of this condition are: In addition to these symptoms, people with hypothyroidism may have high blood levels of LDL cholesterol, the so-called “bad” cholesterol. Autoimmune thyroiditis, where the body’s own immune system attacks the thyroid gland. Iodine deficiency since iodine is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones. Deficiency of protein, magnesium and zinc, since these are all essential for the thyroid to function properly. Heavy metal poisoning or an over-abundance of chemicals and pesticides in the body. Root canal teeth can leak toxins into the body and enter the thyroid gland, producing thyroid disease. The majority of people who have an underactive thyroid such as Hashimoto’s disease, have an autoimmune disease whereby the immune system attacks thyroid tissue. So, in order to find an underactive thyroid natural treatment it is important to address the autoimmune issue. Just taking prescription medication for low thyroid function will simply just mask the symptoms. Making dietary changes can be the first step in embracing natural thyroid treatment. Underactive thyroid treatment can begin with cutting out, and adding to, the diet in the following ways: Foods that are rich in Vitamin A such as carrots and eggs. Seafood such as arame, dulce, kelp and nori that contain high levels of iodine. Foods that are rich in zinc such as beef, chicken, nuts and spinach. Increasing protein intake can help improve low thyroid function. Proteins include nuts and nut butters; quinoa; hormone- and antibiotic-free animal products (organic, grass-fed meats, eggs, and sustainably-farmed fish); and legumes. Insufficient intake of fat can exacerbate hormonal imbalance, which includes thyroid hormones. Natural, healthful fats include olive oil; ghee; avocados; flax seeds; fish; nuts and nut butters; hormone- and antibiotic-free full fat cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese and coconut milk products. Certain fruits and vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, peaches and pears can diminish the thyroid’s production of thyroxin. Greatly reduce or eliminate caffeine and sugar, which people with low thyroid function naturally reach for in order to boost their flagging energy. Gluten has an almost identical molecular composition to thyroid tissue and consuming gluten can increase an autoimmune attack on your thyroid. The Role of Nutrients in Natural Hypothyroid Treatment It is doubtful that nutritional deficiencies are the sole cause of an underactive thyroid, but not having enough of these micronutrients and minerals can aggravate symptoms of low thyroid function. Increasing the intake of; vitamin D, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, zinc, copper, vitamin A, the B vitamins, and iodine can help in natural hypothyroid treatment. Vitamin D levels can be checked by a simple blood test. Optimal levels are between 50-80 ng/mL; anything below 32 contributes to hormone pathway disruption.

This condition affects the thyroid gland. People with this condition produce a low amount of thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism and menopause share some symptoms. Hypothyroidism is also most common in middle-aged women. It’s at this time that women are going through menopause. Read on to learn more about the connection between menopause and your thyroid, and how symptoms and complications of menopause may be affected by hypothyroidism. Estrogen levels significantly decrease during menopause. This causes many of the symptoms associated with menopause. Estrogen levels may also affect thyroid function. In a from 2011, researchers examined the role that estrogen levels have on thyroid receptors. Thyroid receptors are the molecules that allow thyroid hormones to enter cells. Researchers found that estrogen levels might affect thyroid function and lead to thyroid disorders. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between these two hormones. Hypothyroidism can increase or worsen symptoms of menopause. A from 2007 showed that women with a thyroid disorder and severe menopause experienced improved symptoms after getting treated for the thyroid disorder. This suggests that treating thyroid disorders can help manage menopause symptoms. Hypothyroidism and menopause also have many overlapping symptoms. Having both conditions may increase the risk and severity of these overlapping symptoms. On average, menopause occurs at the age of 51 for women. Hypothyroidism can occur at any time. The following symptoms are commonly seen in menopause and hypothyroidism: irregularities in the lower urinary tract, such as frequent urination or excessive urination at nighthigher levels of blood lipids, such as triglycerides and cholesterol changes in body weight, such as a sudden increase in weight Can hypothyroidism lead to increased risk for complications in menopause? Thyroid disorders may also increase your risk for long-term complications of menopause. One of the most common complications of menopause is , or loss of bone density. indicates that hypothyroidism can also reduce bone density. Caucasian women with low body fat are the highest risk group for osteoporosis. Another common complication of menopause is increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Low levels of thyroid hormones also of heart disorders. Talk to your doctor if you suspect thyroid issues or if you’re experiencing menopause symptoms. Your primary care doctor may refer you to an endocrinologist. You may also benefit from seeing a gynecologist. When seeing your doctor, come prepared with the following information: symptoms, especially fatigue, hot flashes, weight changes, and mood swings severity and duration your symptoms and whether they have been worsening a history of endocrine disorders in your family, especially related to thyroid disorders A few different blood tests can be used to check your thyroid function: Your doctor uses this test to look for the concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in your blood. Your body produces more TSH when the thyroid is less active. It also produces less T3 and T4 hormones. A below-normal level of TSH indicates hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid. A high level indicates hypothyroidism. Learn more: Hypothyroidism vs. hyperthyroidism: What’s the difference? » This test will look for the levels of T4 hormone in the blood. This hormone is either inactive and bound to proteins, or active and unbound. A high level indicates a possibility for hyperthyroidism. T3 is another hormone produced by the thyroid. Doctors use this test to confirm hyperthyroidism. Levels of T3 don’t decrease substantially until the condition is severe. Therefore, doctors and lab technicians will use another test to determine hypothyroidism. This test is used to identify the presence of an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, which is present in people with . Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects thyroid function. This test is most often used on pregnant women or people who may have Graves’ disease. Hypothyroidism and menopause share some symptoms. Research also indicates levels of estrogen may impact levels of thyroid hormones. Other research suggests that hypothyroidism can increase symptoms and complications of menopause. You may experience symptoms such as fatigue and weight changes. If these symptoms are persistent, talk to your doctor and provide them with detailed information about your symptoms and menstrual cycle.

Hypothyroidism means your thyroid is not making enough thyroid hormone. If you are looking for information about when the thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone, see the topic . Hypothyroidism means your thyroid is not making enough . The thyroid is a in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way your body uses energy. Having a low level of thyroid hormone affects your whole body. It can make you feel tired and weak. If hypothyroidism is not treated, it can raise your cholesterol levels. During pregnancy, untreated hypothyroidism can harm your baby. But hypothyroidism can be treated with medicine that can help you feel like yourself again. People of any age can get hypothyroidism, but older adults are more likely to get it. Women age 60 and older have the highest risk. You are more likely to get the disease if it runs in your family. In the United States, the most common cause is . It causes the body's to attack thyroid tissue. As a result, the gland can't make enough thyroid hormone. Other things that can lead to low levels of thyroid hormone include surgery to remove the thyroid gland and radiation therapy for cancer. Less common causes include viral infections and some drugs, such as amiodarone and lithium. Hypothyroidism can cause many different symptoms, such as: Memory problems or having trouble thinking clearly. Symptoms occur slowly over time. At first you might not notice them, or you might mistake them for normal aging. See your doctor if you have symptoms like these that get worse or won't go away. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms. You will also have a physical exam. If your doctor thinks you have hypothyroidism, a simple blood test can show if your thyroid hormone level is too low. Doctors usually prescribe pills to treat hypothyroidism. Most people start to feel better in a week or two. Your symptoms will probably go away within a few months. But you will likely need to keep taking the pills from now on. It's important to take your medicine just the way your doctor tells you to. You will also need to see your doctor for follow-up visits to make sure you have the right dose. Getting too much or too little thyroid hormone can cause problems. If you have mild hypothyroidism, you may not need treatment now. But you'll want to watch for signs that it is getting worse. If you are diagnosed with severe hypothyroidism, you will need to be treated right away in the hospital. Severe hypothyroidism can lead to a rare but dangerous disease called . In the United States, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is . This is a condition that causes the body's natural defenses—the immune system—to produce that over time destroy thyroid tissue. As a result, the thyroid gland cannot make enough . Worldwide, iodine deficiency is the number one cause of hypothyroidism. But iodine added to salt, food, and water has nearly eliminated this problem in the U.S. and other Western countries. Thyroid surgery. Part or all of the thyroid gland may be removed to treat disorders such as having too much thyroid hormone (), an enlarged thyroid gland () that makes swallowing difficult, thyroid cancer, or that may be overactive or cancerous. Hypothyroidism results when the thyroid gland is removed or when remaining thyroid tissue does not function properly. Radioactive iodine therapy, which is often used to treat hyperthyroidism. Radioactive iodine therapy can destroy the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism. External beam radiation, which is used to treat some cancers, such as . This radiation treatment can destroy the thyroid gland. Infections. Viral and bacterial infections can temporarily damage the thyroid gland. This causes a short-term form of the condition. Hypothyroidism caused by infection usually does not result in permanent hypothyroidism. Medicines. Some medicines can interfere with normal production of thyroid hormone. Lithium is one of the most common medicines that causes hypothyroidism. Others include amiodarone and interferon alfa (such as Intron A or Roferon A). In rare cases, disorders of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus (secondary and tertiary forms of hypothyroidism). The pituitary gland and hypothalamus produce hormones that control the thyroid and, as a result, affect its ability to produce thyroid hormone. Excessive iodine, which, in food or medicines, can reduce the function of the thyroid gland. This is usually temporary. Congenital hypothyroidism. In rare cases, an infant is born without a properly functioning thyroid gland. All children born in a hospital in the U.S. are tested at birth for hypothyroidism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism usually appear slowly over months or years. Symptoms and signs may include: Memory problems, depression, or problems concentrating. Heavy or irregular menstrual periods that may last longer than 5 to 7 days. Swelling of the arms, hands, legs, and feet, and facial puffiness, particularly around the eyes. In general, how bad your symptoms are depends on your age, how long you have had hypothyroidism, and the seriousness of the condition. The symptoms may be so mild and happen so slowly that they go unnoticed for years. often causes no symptoms or vague symptoms that may be attributed to aging, such as memory problems, dry skin, and fatigue. Symptoms of hypothyroidism during and after pregnancy include fatigue, weight loss, dizziness, depression, and memory and concentration problems. Because of the range of symptoms, hypothyroidism can be mistaken for depression, especially during and after pregnancy. In older people, it may be confused with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and other conditions that cause memory problems. Symptoms of hypothyroidism in infants, children, and teens Although rare, hypothyroidism can occur in infants, children, and teens. In infants, symptoms of a goiter include a poor appetite and choking on food. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may include dry, scaly skin. In children and teens, symptoms include behavior problems and changes in school performance. Children and teens may gain weight and yet have a slowed growth rate. Teens may have delayed puberty and look much younger than their age. Untreated hypothyroidism may get better or worse over time, depending on its cause and your age. Although rare, hypothyroidism can occur in infants and children. If hypothyroidism is treated within the first month of life, a child will grow and develop normally. Untreated hypothyroidism in infants can cause brain damage, leading to and . In the United States, all children are tested for hypothyroidism at birth. Intellectual disability usually does not occur if hypothyroidism develops after age 3. But untreated childhood hypothyroidism typically delays physical growth and sexual development, including the onset of . Children may gain weight yet have a slowed growth rate. Hypothyroidism caused by sometimes will disappear on its own. More often, the disorder causes a gradual loss of thyroid function. Your symptoms may develop slowly and be so mild that you do not notice them for years. But symptoms usually grow worse. And health problems may develop as the disease continues. Myxedema, a condition that causes swelling of tissues, increased fluid around the heart and lungs, slowed muscle reflexes, and a slowed ability to think. , a rare, life-threatening condition. This can occur if you have had hypothyroidism for many years that becomes markedly worse. It usually occurs when older adults who have severe hypothyroidism become ill with another condition, suffer from cold exposure, or take painkillers or sleeping pills. Symptoms include mental deterioration, such as apathy, confusion, and . You may lose consciousness (coma) and may have an extremely low body temperature (hypothermia), slow heartbeat (fewer than 60 beats per minute), , and trouble breathing. Complications, such as: Increased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (increasing the risk of coronary artery disease and stroke). , which causes you to stop breathing for 10 seconds or longer while sleeping. People with have only slightly abnormal thyroid blood test results and often do not have obvious symptoms or health problems. Some people who have mild hypothyroidism regain normal thyroid function. If your thyroid gland has been removed during surgery, hypothyroidism will occur within a few weeks. If you have been treated with radioactive iodine therapy, hypothyroidism may develop within a year. In these cases, thyroid function typically does not return, and you will need to take thyroid hormone medicine from now on. Women who have hypothyroidism or mild hypothyroidism before they become pregnant may have more severe hypothyroidism during their pregnancy. If not treated, pregnant women who have hypothyroidism can develop and have a premature delivery. Children born to women who have untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy are at risk for having hypothyroidism at birth and low birth weight and may score lower on intelligence tests than children of healthy mothers. After delivery, women may have a thyroid disorder called postpartum thyroiditis. This condition occurs in about 5% of women who do not have a history of thyroid disease. It is often mistaken for depression. Women who have postpartum thyroiditis often develop hypothyroidism 3 to 6 months after delivery. The hypothyroidism may last up to several months. It sometimes occurs after an initial episode of postpartum thyroiditis that causes symptoms from too much thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism may become permanent in women with postpartum thyroiditis. Even if thyroid gland function returns to normal, postpartum thyroiditis usually comes back during later pregnancies. Many things may increase your risk for hypothyroidism. These include: Older adults are more likely to develop hypothyroidism than younger people. And women are more likely than men to develop thyroid disease. . Hypothyroidism tends to run in families. Thyroid disease, an enlarged thyroid (goiter), and surgery or radiation therapy to treat thyroid problems increase the likelihood of having hypothyroidism in the future. Type 1 diabetes, vitiligo (an autoimmune disease that causes patches of light skin), , and leukotrichia (premature gray hair) are seen more often in people who have hypothyroidism. This is rare in the United States but common in areas where iodine is not added to salt, food, and water. Some medicines can interfere with normal thyroid function, particularly lithium, amiodarone, and interferon alfa (such as Intron A or Roferon A). if you or a person you know has hypothyroidism and has signs of , such as: Mental deterioration, such as apathy, confusion, or . Extreme weakness and fatigue that progress to loss of consciousness (coma). Severe breathing difficulties, slow heart rate (less than 60 beats per minute), or low body temperature [ or below]. See your doctor if you have any symptoms that don't go away, including: Memory problems, depression, or difficulty concentrating. Dry skin, brittle nails, or a yellowish tint to the skin. Heavy or irregular menstrual periods that may last longer than 5 to 7 days. If you have one or two of the above symptoms that have not changed or have changed very little over a long period of time, it is less likely that the symptoms are caused by hypothyroidism. Consult your doctor. Talk to a doctor if you are pregnant and have some of the above symptoms. Also talk to a doctor if you have hypothyroidism and are pregnant or are trying to become pregnant. Your dose of thyroid hormone medicine may need to be changed. Watchful waiting—a period of time during which you and your doctor observe your symptoms or condition without using medical treatment—is not appropriate for hypothyroidism that is causing symptoms. Treatment should begin as soon as the condition is diagnosed. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain adults with mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism whose blood tests show only modest changes. Talk to your doctor about treatment, its cost and possible risks and benefits. Watch for any signs that your hypothyroidism is getting worse. Doctors often want people to have yearly thyroid function blood tests to check to see if is normal. or other primary care doctor. Hypothyroidism also may be diagnosed by a specialist, such as a , , or , depending on the symptoms you have and who you see to evaluate the symptoms. Complicated or unusual cases of hypothyroidism may require consultation with an . A thorough medical history and physical exam are the first steps in diagnosing hypothyroidism or mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism. If the results lead your doctor to suspect you have hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism, you will have tests to confirm the diagnosis. Blood tests are always used to confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism or mild hypothyroidism. The tests used most often are: If the above tests are not normal, antithyroid antibody tests may determine whether you have the autoimmune disease , in which the body's defense system attacks the thyroid gland. In rare cases, a may be used to evaluate a thyroid gland that during a physical exam seems to be abnormal. A or of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland may be done to look for any changes in these areas of the brain. Because of the possibility of in infants with hypothyroidism, every state in the United States tests newborns for hypothyroidism. If your baby was not born in a hospital, or if you believe your baby may not have been tested, talk to your doctor. Screening tests for hypothyroidism are not always accurate. Even if test results show no problem, watch your child for symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as poor appetite, not gaining weight, and dry skin. Experts do not agree on whether adults who don't have symptoms should have a thyroid test. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend that testing be considered for those older than age 60. The makes no recommendation for or against screening for people who do not have symptoms of thyroid problems. The USPSTF states that there is not enough evidence to support screening. Talk to your doctor about whether testing is right for you. Hypothyroidism can be easily treated using thyroid hormone medicine. The most effective and reliable thyroid replacement hormone is man-made (synthetic). After starting treatment, you will have regular visits with your doctor to make sure you have the right dose of medicine. In most cases, symptoms of hypothyroidism start to improve within the first week after you start treatment. All symptoms usually disappear within a few months. Infants and children with hypothyroidism should always be treated. Older adults and people who are in poor health may take longer to respond to the medicine. If you have had radiation therapy and have hypothyroidism, or if your thyroid gland has been removed, you will most likely need treatment from now on. If your hypothyroidism is caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis, you might also need treatment from now on. Sometimes, thyroid gland function returns on its own in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. If a serious illness or infection triggered your hypothyroidism, your thyroid function most likely will return to normal when you recover. Some medicines may cause hypothyroidism. Your thyroid function may return to normal when you stop the medicines. If you have mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism, you may not need treatment but should be watched for signs of hypothyroidism getting worse. You and your doctor will talk about the pros and cons of taking medicine to treat your mild hypothyroidism. The dose of thyroid medicine must be watched carefully in people who also have heart disease, because too much medicine increases the risk of chest pain (angina) and irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation). Your doctor will treat your hypothyroidism with the thyroid medicine levothyroxine (for example, Levothroid, Levoxyl, or Synthroid). Take your medicine as directed. You will have another blood test 6 to 8 weeks later to make sure the dose is right for you. If you take too little medicine, you may have symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as constipation, feeling cold or sluggish, and gaining weight. Too much medicine can cause nervousness, problems sleeping, and shaking (tremors). If you have heart disease, too much medicine can cause irregular heartbeats and chest pain. People who also have heart disease often start on a low dose of levothyroxine, which is increased gradually. If you have severe hypothyroidism by the time you are diagnosed, you will need immediate treatment. Severe, untreated hypothyroidism can cause , a rare, life-threatening condition. Treatment during pregnancy is especially important, because hypothyroidism can harm the developing fetus. If you develop hypothyroidism during pregnancy, treatment should be started immediately. If you have hypothyroidism before you become pregnant, your thyroid hormone levels need to be checked to make sure that you have the right dose of thyroid medicine. During pregnancy, your dose of medicine may need to be increased by 25% to 50%. If you develop hypothyroidism after pregnancy (postpartum hypothyroidism), you also may need treatment. You will be retested for hypothyroidism if you become pregnant again. In some cases hypothyroidism will go away on its own. In other cases it is permanent and requires lifelong treatment. You are likely to need treatment for hypothyroidism from now on. As a result, you need to take your medicine as directed. For some people, hypothyroidism gets worse as they age and the dosage of thyroid medicine may have to be increased gradually as the thyroid continues to slow down. Most people treated with thyroid hormone develop symptoms again if their medicine is stopped. If this occurs, medicine needs to be restarted. If a serious illness or infection triggers your hypothyroidism, your thyroid function most likely will return to normal when you recover. To check whether thyroid function has returned to normal, thyroid hormone medicine may be stopped for a short time. In most people, a brief period of hypothyroidism occurs after thyroid medicine is stopped. There is often a delay in the body's signals that tell the thyroid to start working again. If the thyroid can produce enough hormone on its own, treatment is no longer needed. But if hormone levels remain too low, you need to restart thyroid medicine. While taking thyroid hormone medicine, you need to see your doctor once a year for checkups. You will have a blood test () to make sure you have a normal hormone level. Sometimes symptoms of hypothyroidism continue, such as sluggishness, constipation, confusion, and feeling cold. This may occur if you are not taking enough thyroid hormone or if your medicine is not absorbed from your gastrointestinal tract. Having a bowel disease or taking certain other medicines may block thyroid hormone. If needed, your doctor will increase your dose. Your doctor may suggest you try the combination therapy of medicine if T4 medicine is not controlling your symptoms. If your dose of thyroid hormone is too high, you may develop complications such as irregular heartbeats and, over time, . If you have heart disease, too much medicine can cause pain (angina) and irregular heartbeats. Your doctor will watch your thyroid levels using a . If needed, your doctor will lower your dose. Most cases of hypothyroidism in the United States are caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which cannot be prevented. Although you can't prevent hypothyroidism, you can watch for signs of the disease so it can be treated promptly. Some people who are at high risk for having hypothyroidism but do not have symptoms can be tested to see whether they have mild, or subclinical, hypothyroidism. Expert groups differ in their recommendations for screening. For example: The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend that testing be considered for those older than age 60. The makes no recommendation for or against screening for people who do not have symptoms of thyroid problems. The USPSTF states that there is not enough evidence to support screening. Talk to your doctor about whether testing is right for you. If you have hypothyroidism, see your doctor once a year so your condition can be closely checked and your treatment adjusted, if needed. Be sure to take thyroid hormone medicine correctly. Talk with your doctor if you don't understand the reason for taking medicine regularly or if you think you have any side effects from the medicine. You usually need to have regular blood tests to find out whether you are receiving the correct amount of thyroid hormone. Children who have hypothyroidism also need to see a doctor regularly, because the amount of thyroid hormone medicine they need changes as they grow. Untreated hypothyroidism in infants and very young children can have severe consequences. As soon as you think your child is able to understand (usually around age 9 or 10), teach him or her about hypothyroidism, the importance of taking medicine correctly, and why regular health checkups are important. Some health food stores in the United States sell ""natural"" forms of thyroid hormone. The quality and effectiveness of these natural agents are unregulated. Some may not work at all. Others may have an active ingredient that does work but that may be dangerous to certain people. is the only effective way to treat hypothyroidism. In most cases, thyroid hormone medicine: Reduces or eliminates symptoms of hypothyroidism. Symptoms usually improve within the first week after you begin therapy. All symptoms usually disappear within a few months. May reduce the risk of slowed physical growth, , and behavioral problems in infants and children. Thyroid hormone medicine does not cause side effects if you take the correct dose. People who have hypothyroidism need treatment with thyroid hormone medicine. Depending on the cause of their hypothyroidism, they may need treatment for the rest of their lives. Taking certain supplements, such as calcium or iron (or both), at the same time as thyroid hormone medicine may reduce the amount of thyroid hormone medicine absorbed by the body. Take calcium supplements at least 4 hours before or after taking thyroid hormone medicine. Also avoid taking iron supplements at the same time as thyroid medicine. Talk to your doctor about whether you need to change your dose of thyroid medicine if you also take birth control pills or other hormones. You may need to take more thyroid hormone medicine than you would if you were not taking these hormones. Follow-up visits with your doctor are important to make sure that you are taking the correct dose of medicine. Most people have blood tests 6 to 8 weeks after starting treatment. After thyroid hormone levels return to normal, thyroid function tests are typically rechecked once a year. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2002, reaffirmed 2010).

c1b0a6aa-469a-4448-abb5-7fabed10da54,"Newbie: Hi, I'm new to writing on health forums... - Thyroid UK Hi, I'm new to writing on health forums so please bear with me. I am 20 years old, female, and have been unwell for as long as I can remember. I had glandular fever when I was a child and there were more than one occasions where I was unwell with vomiting and diarrhoea. I had a thyroid blood test done in January 2017 which showed a TSH above range 6.2 (0.2 - 4.2) and FT4 13.7 (12 - 22) and FT3 4.0 (3.1 - 6.8) no treatment was given and I was told the levels meant I was hyperthyroid. However I have been getting many hypothyroid symptoms and I have taken the ones from the Thyroid UK symptoms list: excessive tiredness, slow movements, slow speech, pins and needles, breathlessness, palpitations, anaemia, insomnia, loss of libido, repeated urinary tract infections, heavy eyelids, hoarse voice, muscle cramps and stiffness, goitre, cold intolerance, diminished sweating, vertigo, balance problems, dizziness, puffy eyes and face, choking fits, dry mouth, sore throats, difficulty swallowing numbness and hands and feet and legs, memory loss, poor concentration, lack of confidence, tinnitus, deafness, heavy periods, low fertility, slow pulse, headaches, dry skin, eczema, carpal tunnel syndrome, brittle and flaky nails, body hair loss and head hair loss, brittle hair, eyebrow loss and eyelash loss. I also have low B12, low folate, low vitamin D and low ferritin and low calcium. Only thing is I haven't gained weight so the GP has considered this a red herring and he thinks I have coeliac disease. I had infantile eczema when I was child, as well and this has continued mildly into my early years as a young adult. I was sent for an ultrasound scan on my thyroid which showed a damaged and hypoechoic gland. Any advice about what to do next would be appreciated, thank you. What immediately springs to mind is sack your GP and sue him/her for not being able to adequately diagnose you and causing you further health problems. Grrrrrr... Yes, sorry, that's very 'reactionary' of me and probably impracticable ~ but your treatment, or considerable lack of it, is in my limited but personal opinion, absolutely dreadful. For more informed advice, I hope that SeasideSusie and greygoose will help to advise you how to be as well as you can be ~ and how to deal with your (non) treatment. Thanks I tried to complain but I didn't get anywhere; they countered by saying I was more at fault than they were! For full evaluation you ideally need TSH, FT4, FT3, TT4, TPO and TG antibodies, plus vitamin D, folate, ferritin and B12 tested See if you can get full thyroid and vitamin testing from GP Medichecks Thyroid plus ultra vitamin or Blue Horizon Thyroid plus eleven are the most popular choice. DIY finger prick test or option to pay extra for private blood draw. Both companies often have money off offers. All thyroid tests should be done as early as possible in morning and fasting. This gives highest TSH and most consistent results Highly likely with low vitamin levels that you have Hashimoto's also called autoimmune thyroid disease If antibodies are high this is Hashimoto's, (also known by medics here in UK more commonly as autoimmune thyroid disease). About 90% of all hypothyroidism in Uk is due to Hashimoto's With Hashimoto's, our gut can be badly affected. Low stomach acid can lead to poor absorption of vitamins. Low vitamin levels stop thyroid hormones working. Poor gut function can lead leaky gut (literally holes in gut wall) this can cause food intolerances. Most common by far is gluten According to Izabella Wentz the Thyroid Pharmacist approx 5% with Hashimoto's are coeliac, but over 80% find gluten free diet helps significantly. Either due to direct gluten intolerance (no test available) or due to leaky gut and gluten causing molecular mimicry (see Amy Myers link) But don't be surprised that GP or endo never mention gut, gluten or low vitamins. Hashimoto's is very poorly understood Changing to a strictly gluten free diet may help reduce symptoms, help gut heal and slowly lower TPO antibodies Print this list of symptoms off, tick all that apply and take to GP It's probably a good job you weren't given any treatment, if your doctor thinks those results mean hyper! You are, of course, hypo. Was this the first time you've been tested? If so, wait a couple of months, and go back and ask to be tested again. A one-off high TSH could be due to an infection of some sort. Your doctor should have told you that. But, if I were you, I'd see another doctor! When you go back, print out the ThyroidUK list of hypo symptoms, and tick off all those you have. And, ask for antibodies to be tested, as well. You could, of course, have Coeliac, but that wouldn't affect your TSH. Is your doctor going to test you for that, in any way? The fact that you haven't put on weight means nothing. Not all hypos put on weight - although the vast majority do - but many don't, and some even lose weight, so that's not essential. There are over 300 known symptoms of hypo, you'd hardly be likely to have them all! For your nutrients, you'll get better help if you post the actual numbers - results and ranges. But, if they're low, they will certainly be causing some of your symptoms. Thanks I tried to complain but they responded by saying I was more at fault than the GP! No I had TSH high before. In what way were you to blame for anything? There's no way you can willfully raise your TSH! I complained about them when my TSH was high and I was told I had hyperthyroidism. They wrote back saying ""there were only two times where your TSH did not look healthy. You booked an appointment with us to discuss ongoing symptoms and to request further bloods. You were 10 minutes late for the appointment and we do not test TPO antibodies unless there is a clinical suspicion of hypothyroidism."" Oh dear! And a TSH of 6.2 doesn't suggest hypothyroidism in their book? I think you need to change practices - if you can, of course - this lot know nothing! The GP that said you were hypERthyroid needs retraining or, better still, find another job, he's of little use to patients. What are the actual results for your low nutrient levels and what are you taking for them? Follow SlowDragon's excellent advice, come back with your results and take the first steps towards improving your health. I complained about them when my TSH was high and I was told I had hyperthyroidism. They wrote back saying ""there were only two times where your TSH did not look healthy. You booked an appointment with us to discuss ongoing symptoms and to request further bloods. You were 10 minutes late for the appointment and we do not test TPO antibodies unless there is a clinical suspicion of hypothyroidism."" Well, being late for an appointment isn't going to help, whatever the circumstances they don't like it even if you can't help it. A courtesy phone call to say why you would be late would have given you at least one Brownie point! Well they were very unreasonable to put that in the letter then. I agree you need to follow up with tests etc. My levothyroxine has been reduced by quite a lot. Told to have bloods again in 3 months. If I don't ask for them then you would be missed. I am getting signs like tiredness loss of appetite etc signs that tell me I'm not on enough levothyroxine. I was managed on 175mcg daily and was reduced to 125 might in August which I felt was a big drop. I've now have a blood form for check now so let's see what it is now. periods which have been heavy since 2001, pins and needles, dry skin (I had eczema when I was a... cravings, sweats, dry skin, anxiety, depression, low memory and concentration, losing hair, heavy... some problems which I can't put down to just my low thyroid.

Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine-deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in 0.3–0.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.3–8.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than in men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected. Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism, as are cats and horses, albeit more rarely.

Hypothyroidism is caused by inadequate function of the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of from the brain's (tertiary hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism is about a thousandfold more common than central hypothyroidism. is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism and worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter.

High levels of type 3 deiodinase generally occur as the result of a . The condition is very rare. Diagram of the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis. The hypothalamus secretes TRH (green), which stimulates the production of TSH (red) by the pituitary gland. This, in turn, stimulates the production of thyroxine by the thyroid (blue). Thyroxine levels decrease TRH and TSH production by a negative feedback process. Thyroid hormone is required for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In healthy individuals, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T), which is converted into (T) in other organs by the -dependent enzyme . Triiodothyronine binds to the in the of cells, where it stimulates the of particular and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to on the , thereby stimulating the and processes such as and . In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as ; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active. Overexpression of deiodinase can thus lead to consumptive hypothyroidism. The thyroid gland is the only source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process requires and the . Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into molecules. The process is controlled by the (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the . Not enough iodine, or not enough TSH, can result in decreased production of thyroid hormones. The plays a key role in maintaining thyroid hormone levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to not enough TSH and thereby to not enough thyroid hormone production. Pregnancy leads to marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology. The gland is increased in size by 10%, thyroxine production is increased by 50%, and iodine requirements are increased. Many women have normal thyroid function but have immunological evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine deficient, and develop evidence of hypothyroidism before or after giving birth. Laboratory testing of thyroid stimulating hormone levels in the blood is considered the best initial test for hypothyroidism; a second TSH level is often obtained several weeks later for confirmation. Levels may be abnormal in the context of other illnesses, and TSH testing in hospitalized people is discouraged unless thyroid dysfunction is strongly suspected. An elevated TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone, and free T4 levels are then often obtained. Measuring T is discouraged by the in the assessment for hypothyroidism. There are a number of symptom rating scales for hypothyroidism; they provide a degree of objectivity but have limited use for diagnosis. Many cases of hypothyroidism are associated with mild elevations in and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically return to normal when hypothyroidism has been fully treated. Levels of , and can be elevated; the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined. Very severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma are characteristically associated with together with elevations in , as well as due to a number of causes. In most causes, however, it is unclear if the relationship is causal. A diagnosis of hypothyroidism without any within the thyroid gland does not require thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against (TPO) makes it more likely that thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a may be required. If the TSH level is normal or low and serum free T levels are low, this is suggestive of central hypothyroidism (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There may be other features of , such as abnormalities and . There might also be symptoms of a such as and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause. In overt primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are high and T and T levels are low. Overt hypothyroidism may also be diagnosed in those who have a TSH on multiple occasions of greater than 5mIU/L, appropriate symptoms, and only a borderline low T. It may also be diagnosed in those with a TSH of greater than 10mIU/L. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by . In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with those who do not have antibodies. During pregnancy, the thyroid gland must produce 50% more thyroid hormone to provide enough thyroid hormone for the developing fetus and the expectant mother. In pregnancy, free thyroxine levels may be lower than anticipated due to increased binding to and decreased binding to . They should either be corrected for the stage of pregnancy, or total thyroxine levels should be used instead for diagnosis. TSH values may also be lower than normal (particularly in the ) and the normal range should be adjusted for the stage of pregnancy. In pregnancy, subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a TSH between 2.5 and 10 mIU/l with a normal thyroxine level, while those with TSH above 10 mIU/l are considered to be overtly hypothyroid even if the thyroxine level is normal. Antibodies against TPO may be important in making decisions about treatment, and should, therefore, be determined in women with abnormal thyroid function tests. Determination of TPO antibodies may be considered as part of the assessment of , as subtle thyroid dysfunction can be associated with pregnancy loss, but this recommendation is not universal, and presence of thyroid antibodies may not predict future outcome. A 3-month-old infant with untreated showing myxedematous facies, a big tongue, and skin mottling Hypothyroidism may be in a population by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate have implemented universal (USI). Encouraged by the , 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries as a result of attempts to reduce salt intake. Pregnant and breastfeeding women, who require 66% more daily iodine requirement than non-pregnant women, may still not be getting enough iodine. The recommends a daily intake of 250 µg for pregnant and breastfeeding women. As many women will not achieve this from dietary sources alone, the recommends a 150 µg daily supplement by mouth. for hypothyroidism is performed in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This has led to the early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other , early identification of these cases may prevent complications. In adults, widespread screening of the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the ) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the ) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in all sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other , a strong of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking or , and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with , as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease. Most people with hypothyroidism symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency are treated with a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as (-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose. Blood free thyroxine and TSH levels are monitored to help determine whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks after the start of treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. Normalization of TSH does not mean that other abnormalities associated with hypothyroidism improve entirely, such as elevated levels. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland. Adding liothyronine (synthetic T) to levothyroxine has been suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but this has not been confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T and T therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy due to a lack of evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often. People with hypothyroidism who do not feel well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered with regards to the chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use. is an animal-based thyroid gland extract, most commonly from . It is a combination therapy, containing forms of T and T. It also contains (a hormone produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T and T; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use. Since 2008, consensus American and British opinion has been that in general people with TSH under 10 to 20 mIU/l do not require treatment. American guidelines recommend that treatment should be considered in people with symptoms of hypothyroidism, detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, a history of heart disease or are at an increased risk for heart disease, if the TSH is elevated but below 10 mIU/l. There is no evidence of a benefit from treating subclinical hypothyroidism in those who are not pregnant, and there are potential risks of . Untreated subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with a modest increase in the risk of when the TSH is over 10 mIU/l. A 2007 review found no benefit of thyroid hormone replacement except for ""some parameters of lipid profiles and left ventricular function"". There is no association between subclinical hypothyroidism and an increased risk of , nor is there a link with cognitive decline. or severe hypothyroidism usually requires admission to the , close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. may be required, as well as , , careful rewarming, and (for possible which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with or . For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered , particularly if the level of consciousness is too low to be able to safely swallow medication. While administration through a is possible, this may be unsafe and is discouraged. In women with known , it is recommended that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5 mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0 mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the . Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels. Women with anti-TPO antibodies who are trying to become pregnant (naturally or by means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10 mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, in the sense that the TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases. The effectiveness and safety of using Chinese herbal medicines to treat hypothyroidism is not known. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In large population-based studies in Western countries with sufficient dietary iodine, 0.3–0.4% of the population have overt hypothyroidism. A larger proportion, 4.3–8.5%, have subclinical hypothyroidism. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, 80% have a TSH level below the 10 mIU/l mark regarded as the threshold for treatment. Children with subclinical hypothyroidism often return to normal thyroid function, and a small proportion develops overt hypothyroidism (as predicted by evolving antibody and TSH levels, the presence of celiac disease, and the presence of a goiter). Women are more likely to develop hypothyroidism than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times more likely than men to have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in . There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with and . Very severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma are rare, with it estimated to occur in 0.22 per million people a year. The majority of cases occur in women over 60 years of age, although it may happen in all age groups. Most hypothyroidism is primary in nature. Central/secondary hypothyroidism affects 1:20,000 to 1:80,000 of the population, or about one out of every thousand people with hypothyroidism. In 1811, discovered iodine was present in , and iodine intake was linked with goiter size in 1820 by . proposed in 1852 that endemic goiter was the result of not enough iodine intake, and demonstrated iodine in thyroid tissue in 1896. The first cases of myxedema were recognized in the mid-19th century (the 1870s), but its connection to the thyroid was not discovered until the 1880s when myxedema was observed in people following the removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy). The link was further confirmed in the late 19th century when people and animals who had had their thyroid removed showed improvement in symptoms with transplantation of animal thyroid tissue. The severity of myxedema, and its associated risk of mortality and complications, created interest in discovering effective treatments for hypothyroidism. Transplantation of thyroid tissue demonstrated some efficacy, but recurrences of hypothyroidism was relatively common, and sometimes required multiple repeat transplantations of thyroid tissue. In 1891, the English physician introduced subcutaneously injected sheep thyroid extract, followed shortly after by an oral formulation. Purified thyroxine was introduced in 1914 and in the 1930s synthetic thyroxine became available, although desiccated animal thyroid extract remained widely used. Liothyronine was identified in 1952. Early attempts at titrating therapy for hypothyroidism proved difficult. After hypothyroidism was found to cause a lower , this was used as a marker to guide adjustments in therapy in the early 20th century (around 1915). However, a low basal metabolic rate was known to be non-specific, also present in malnutrition. The first laboratory test to be helpful in assessing thyroid status was the serum protein-bound iodine, which came into use around the 1950s. In 1971, the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) radioimmunoassay was developed, which was the most specific marker for assessing thyroid status in patients. Many people who were being treated based on basal metabolic rate, minimizing hypothyroid symptoms, or based on serum protein-bound iodine, were found to have excessive thyroid hormone. The following year, in 1972, a T3 radioimmunoassay was developed, and in 1974, a T4 radioimmunoassay was developed. Characteristic changes in the facial skin of a with hypothyroidism In veterinary practice, dogs are the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The majority of cases occur as a result of primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, as well as a number of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable , although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement. Other species that are less commonly affected include cats and horses, as well as other large domestic animals. In cats, hypothyroidism is usually the result of other medical treatment such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, congenital hypothyroidism has been reported predominantly in and has been linked with the mother's diet. . . .

7266727a-8b22-45fc-98a0-69c54348343a,"Overview Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Living With Hypothyroidism is a condition where there isn’t enough thyroid hormone in your bloodstream and your metabolism slows down. Hypothyroidism happens when your thyroid doesn’t create and release enough thyroid hormone into your body. This makes your metabolism slow down, affecting you entire body. Also known as underactive thyroid disease, hypothyroidism is fairly common. When your thyroid levels are extremely low, this is called myxedema. A very serious condition, myxedema can cause serious symptoms, including: This severe type of hypothyroidism is life-threatening. In general, hypothyroidism is a very treatable condition. It can be controlled with regular medications and follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped organ located in the front of your neck just under the voice box (larynx). Picture the middle of the butterfly’s body centered on your neck, with the wings hugging around your windpipe (trachea). The main job of the thyroid is to control your metabolism. Metabolism is the process that your body uses to transform food to energy your body uses to function. The thyroid creates the hormones T4 and T3 to control your metabolism. These hormones work throughout the body to tell the body’s cells how much energy to use. They control your body temperature and heart rate. When your thyroid works correctly, it’s constantly making hormones, releasing them and then making new hormones to replace what’s been used. This keeps your metabolism functioning and all of your body’s systems in check. The amount of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream is controlled by the pituitary gland, which is located in the center of the skull below the brain. When the pituitary gland senses either a lack of thyroid hormone or too much, it adjusts its own hormone (thyroid stimulating hormone, or TSH) and sends it to the thyroid to balance out the amounts. If the amount of thyroid hormones is too high () or too low (hypothyroidism), the entire body is impacted. Hypothyroidism can affect people of all ages, genders and ethnicities. It’s a common condition, particularly among women over age 60. Women are generally more likely to develop hypothyroidism after than earlier in life. What’s the difference between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism? In hypothyroidism, the thyroid doesn’t make enough thyroid hormone. The difference between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism is quantity. In hypothyroidism, the thyroid makes very little thyroid hormone. On the flip side, someone with hyperthyroidism has a thyroid that makes too much thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism involves higher levels of thyroid hormones, which makes your metabolism speed up. If you have hypothyroidism, your metabolism slows down. Many things are the opposite between these two conditions. If you have hypothyroidism, you may have a difficult time dealing with the cold. If you have hyperthyroidism, you may not handle the heat. They are opposite extremes of thyroid function. Ideally, you should be in the middle. Treatments for both of these conditions work to get your thyroid function as close to that middle ground as possible. Hypothyroidism can have a primary cause or a secondary cause. A primary cause is a condition that directly impacts the thyroid and causes it to create low levels of thyroid hormones. A secondary cause is something that causes the pituitary gland to fail, which means it can’t send thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to the thyroid to balance out the thyroid hormones. Primary causes of hypothyroidism are much more common. The most common of these primary causes is an autoimmune condition called Hashimoto’s disease. Also called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, this condition is hereditary (passed down through a family). In Hashimoto’s disease, the body’s immune system attacks and damages the thyroid. This prevents the thyroid from making and releasing enough thyroid hormone. The other primary causes of hypothyroidism can include: Treatment of (radiation and surgical removal of the thyroid). Iodine deficiency (not having enough iodine — a mineral your thyroid uses to make hormones – in your body). Hereditary conditions (a medical condition passed down through your family). In some cases, thyroiditis can happen after a pregnancy () or a viral illness. In most cases, women with hypothyroidism during pregnancy have . This autoimmune disease causes the body’s immune system to attack and damage the thyroid. When that happens, the thyroid can’t produce and release high enough levels of thyroid hormones, impacting the entire body. Pregnant women with hypothyroidism may feel very tired, have a hard time dealing with cold temperatures and experience muscles cramps. Thyroid hormones are important to your baby’s development while in the womb. These hormones help develop the brain and nervous system. If you have hypothyroidism, it’s important to control your thyroid levels during pregnancy. If your baby doesn’t get enough thyroid hormone during development, the brain may not develop correctly and there could be issues later. Untreated or insufficiently treated hypothyroidism during pregnancy may lead to complications like miscarriage or preterm labor. When you’re on , the estrogen and progesterone inside of the pills can affect your thyroid-binding proteins. This increases your levels. If you have hypothyroidism, the dose of your medications will need to be increased while you’re using birth control pills. Once you stop using birth control pills, the dosage will need to be lowered. In some cases, there can be a connection between untreated hypothyroidism and . When your hypothyroidism is caused by an issue with the pituitary gland, you can also have low testosterone levels.

Your healthcare provider may also order blood tests for conditions like Hashimoto’s disease. If the thyroid is enlarged, your provider may be able to feel it during a physical exam during an appointment. In most cases, hypothyroidism is treated by replacing the amount of hormone that your thyroid is no longer making. This is typically done with a medication. One medication that is commonly used is called levothyroxine. Taken orally, this medication increases the amount of thyroid hormone your body produces, evening out your levels.

Are there any foods I can eat to help my hypothyroidism? Most foods in western diets contain iodine, so you do not have to worry about your diet. Iodine is a mineral that helps your thyroid produce hormones. One idea is that if you have low levels of thyroid hormone, eating foods rich in iodine could help increase your hormone levels. The most reliable way to increase your hormone levels is with a prescription medication from your healthcare provider. Do not try any new diets without talking to your provider first. It’s important to always have a conversation before starting a new diet, especially if you have a medical condition like hypothyroidism. Work with your healthcare provider or a nutritionist (a healthcare provider who specializes in food) to craft a meal plan. Your food is your fuel. Making sure you are eating foods that will help your body, along with taking your medications as instructed by your healthcare provider, can keep you healthy over time. People with thyroid condition should not consume large amounts of iodine because the effect may be paradoxical (self-contradictory).

For those with particularly low levels of thyroid hormones, hypothyroidism is a life-long condition that will need to be controlled with medication on a regular schedule. It can be controlled very well and you can live a normal life with hypothyroidism. US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. .

Hypothyroidism can also lead to an enlarged heart and heart failure. It may lead to the slowness of the mental activity. Depression may occur early in hypothyroidism and may become more severe over time. This is a rare, life-threatening condition, which results due to prolonged, severe, untreated hypothyroidism.

I'm a 35 year old male 6"" tall and 72 kg (skinny). I have been hypothyroid (with some hashimoto's antibodies detected years ago) for more than a decade that I know of, and most likely for most of my life. What has been particularly bothering me for the last 3 years is on and off heart attack type of feelings. This is where I feel tight or pain in my chest together with dizziness as if I don't have enough blood supply to my brain. Sometimes I go to bed feeling fine but wake up in the morning with these feelings. I can still operate, but it's definitely scary. I never had this before 3 years ago, when this suddenly happened at the gym in the middle of an intense workout. I have been doing research and tests and so far have been characterising this as anxiety attacks. I've had a brain MRI, heart ECG, heart echocardiogram. All these were fine albeit ECG showed slow heart rate. However, lately someone at work had a heart attack and a quadruple bypass found by a test called heart angiogram. So I have started to wonder if I need that or similar to evaluate my heart artery state. Could it be that I have a partial blockage now? I know I have elevated cholesterol due to hypothyroidism (and I do know there can be a connection). Any advice on this? Has anyone had similar experiences? Has anyone got angiogram or similar? Hypothyroidism: The cardiac connection. Hypothyroidism can affect the heart and circulatory system in a number of ways. Insufficient thyroid hormone slows your heart rate. ... Elevated cholesterol levels, which contribute to narrowed, hardened arteries, are another possible consequence of low thyroid levels."" I have also read that on your ecg there would possibly be a lag in the r wave and enlarged left ventricle. This is why we urge each other to be optimally in range and work on the root cause which could be gluten or as you said a viral infection. I personally felt the effects when I could not get my levels up. It was usually when lying down. Have you taken your temperature? Leave the thermometer in for ten minutes unless you use an electronic one and see how close to normal you are. Yes, I realise that there is a connection. However, it's unlikely as there is no family history of heart related diseases at all. Basically I'm wondering if these other heart tests are necessary or it's pretty much 100% anxiety related. I posted some research about T3 and it's effect on the heart in the past. It is more related to heart failure than heart disease. There may be pubmed articles about it. Have you ever had your iron and ferritin levels checked? People with hypothyroidism often have trouble absorbing nutrients from their food. Also you may be under-medicated. Have you had a thyroid blood test recently> Do you have the results? If you have autoimmune thyroid disease (which it sounds as though your have, because you have had raised levels of antibodies in the past) then you should have had a blood test at least once a year, with probably an increased dose of Thyroxine prescribed as the antibodies gradually degrade your thyroid. If you haven't been having blood tests or dose increases then it's quite likely that over the years you have become under-medicated. Yes, I'm having some regular testing and yes I'm struggling to get my mineral and thyroid levels optimal. This post is about the particular symptoms and outcomes. I know that ultimately I need to reach optimal levels and feel better and all will be well. However, given that I haven't been able to do it in a decade I'm trying to prevent some potentially fatal symptoms e.g. artery block/heart attack. Did you find the cause for those heart attack type feelings? I'm hyper and experience these so called ""anxiety"" attacks. If you are hyper, then the cause is likely something different from me as I've been hypO for many years. I've decided that my symptoms were really adrenaline rushes, where adrenal glands were trying to compensate for the lack thyroid function. I've now got onto higher levels of NDT and the heart attack symptoms at least have gone away almost entirely. I might finally have to get an RAI and become hypothyroid. No triggers, that was the perplexing thing. Some patterns, but there were a lot of them. I think many years being hypo had finally caught up with me.

2936d2c3-11cf-4d59-8b6b-66350d711d8a,"Hypothyroidism symptoms : I have been having... - Thyroid UK I have been having weird symptoms since beginning of this year,muscle aches,leg pains,internal shakiness,anxiety,nervousness etc I went for several test but it all came out fine but then I decided to check my thyroid since the symptoms I saw online was what I had..I checked my tyroid and my TSH was 5.6 but the doctor said it wasn’t that high so I wasn’t given any treatment I’m still having severe symptoms,it’s making me go crazy ,meanwhile I’m just 19 Plss help me out ,is TSH of 5.6 not high enough for thyroid issues??? It’s just affecting my whole body ,I don’t know if it was what affect my sinuses because I also have facial pain and blocked nose and as of last 2 months I got a cold ,since then I have been having reocurrent sore tongue,throat and mouth ulcers I don’t know what else to do because I’m tired of going to hospital and they keep giving me drugs of what isn’t happening to me ,some would end up saying is just anxiety..everyone is tired about my case ,my parents are tired of wasting money on what isn’t yielding anything I dont deserve this health issue at this my age ,I’m just suffering this alone so pls here is a copy of my test I know how you feel. You HAVE to get a new doctor. It's been hell for me. Your TSH is too high but what you really really really need checked is your Free T3, Free T4, and RT3. The TSH is your brain SCREAMING for T3. I know what it feels like; it's like your insides are trembling and the panic is horrific! Order the book Stop the Thyroid Madness off of Amazon. It'll teach you everything your doctor doesn't know. You HAVE to get on thyroid medication that has T3 in it. Do NOT allow them to give you T4 only because it's clear your body cannot covert the T4 into what it needs to stay alive which is T3. Please get that book, it'll save your life like it did mine. So many doctors are not educated in the Thyroid. Please take care of yourself and fight for your health. You haven’t seen the above persons labs. You are advising someone to take hormone replacement in which they may or may not need. Ask for labs. Then advise. You should read that book too. It provides all the science on TSH I’ve visited STTMs website, it’s a load of garbage. Agreed, that site is a bunch of hogwash and can be dangerous. Hormones are nothing to play with. At the same time, the OP does need to find a new doctor that will listen and work with them. Don't worry, T4 is usually satisfactory for most people. It's not the end of the world if u do eventually have to take T3. Have the doc do a full thyroid panel to see a full picture of your situation. Hang in there, it does get better. Before I get yelled at some more, what are your labs? My labs are irrelevant to this and the above poster. The above poster can just be undermedicated on levo. Without labs, you do not know. I can respect that. No worries. Didn’t ask for your labs. Asked the person you were yelling at me about If you post your labs, then someone with more experience can advise you a bit better Oof you must feel terrible with a tsh that high and frees that low. I’m not qualified well enough to advise, but lots of members on here will report back to you now that your labs have been posted. Good luck! And hopefully you feel better soon If you go onto the Thyroid uk website, this is the charity who support this forum : You will find a good explanation of the symptoms associated with both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism - sadly some cross over, but generally you will be able to identify yourself as with hypothyroidism and start ticking off those symptoms that apply to you and list them down so you are better prepared at your next doctor appointment. Generally speaking when a TSH rises above 3 - one is said to be hypothyroid and a few years ago in the uk the NHS started treatment when a TSH rose above 5 : and this was generally in line with most other countries. However the NHS guidelines for treatment for hypothyroidism now do not register you until your TSH rises above 10 : You might like to try a different doctor who maybe more sympathetic especially if you list all your symptoms and explain how your life is now compromised as you can't continue with your work / study requirements. I have been having weird symptoms since beginning of this year,muscle aches,leg pains,internal shakiness,anxiety,nervousness etc In a country where the treatment of hypothyroidism has some compassion in it, you would be treated with a TSH of 5. But unfortunately thyroid treatment is very poor indeed in the UK. [Edit - 24 hours after posting : I've just realised you are living in Nigeria, not the UK, sorry. So most of my reply is not relevant to you.] Something to be aware of is that nutrient deficiencies are extremely common in people with thyroid disease. Many of us on this forum discover we have low nutrients and we buy our own supplements. First things first... You need to ask for access to your medical records and blood tests online. If your surgery doesn't have this facility then you need to ask for copies of your blood test results. Keeping records from now on is essential if you want to have any hope of regaining your health. Don't ask doctors for access to your results or for printouts of them - ask the receptionists. You are legally entitled to get access or copies. They aren't supposed to ask why you want the information, but it is easier just to say that you ""want a copy for your records so you can monitor your health"". Some of your symptoms suggest the following possibilities to me : - could be low vitamin D, low magnesium, low vitamin B12, low folate. - could be low vitamin B12, low folate, low ferritin (iron stores) or low serum iron. Could also be poor adrenal function (which is often associated with thyroid disease). None of the things I've mentioned above will fix your thyroid - for that you need thyroid hormones to be prescribed. But since your doctor has said no, in the meantime you will improve how you feel by optimising your nutrient levels. If you can get your doctor to test your levels of vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate, ferritin, and (with a lot of luck) an iron panel, then get hold of the results and reference ranges, post them in a new post and ask for feedback we can interpret them and tell you which supplements you might need to take and at what dose. It would also help if you had zinc and copper tested as well, but many of us never get that done. There is no point in testing magnesium by the way. Most of your magnesium is found in your body's cells, not your bloodstream. There is just a tiny amount of magnesium in your blood. When the amount needed in your blood drops too low it gets ""stolen"" from the cells. So the blood very rarely looks low in magnesium, while your cells could be crying out for it. The only prerequisite for supplementing magnesium is that you have functioning kidneys. If you supplemented too much magnesium your kidneys would expel the excess in urine if your kidneys worked. If your doctor won't test any of the things I've suggested then we can tell you how to get them done privately with a finger-prick test. (Summary - Buy a kit online, prick fingers to drip blood in a little vial, send the vial back to the lab through the post, get results via email or via the testing site website.) Good day I have the copy of the tyroid function test I did Meanwhile I’ve gone to different labs to request for vitamin deficiency test but they would always tell me they don’t perform it I'm guessing you are not in the Uk as the Thyroid uk website gives details of companies where you can acquire one blood test for everything as detailed above. If you care to share your blood test result and ranges with us you will be talked through what it all means. I’ve shared the copy of the blood test on my post already I'm sorry but I can't find a T3 and T4 result with the ranges in the above : OK I've just refreshed the page my end and see a photo has been inserted. Ok then - this so goes to show how the reliance on just a TSH is a worthless test especially when you have a guideline suggesting you can't treat before the TSH rises above 10 - as currently in the UK : So your T3 isn't even in range and below the recommended base level : Your T4 is barely in range at just 8 points into a range of 81 so at about 10% : Did you show the doctor this results and if so what was said ? He saw the test but he said the test is not that bad therefore I wasn’t given medications Is there an option of taking a "" responsible "" adult along with you to appointments ? Other doctors keep saying I’m too small to have tyroid issue that it isn’t it but then I went back to the place I had this test this week He considered I should start taking Levothyroxine to see if there would be differences Well, some doctors say a load of rubbish as you clearly need medication so go back to the doctor who suggested starting treatment with Levothyroxine and start getting to feel better. Take the tablet with a glass of water, on an empty stomach, and wait about an hour before you eat or drink anything. Many people take it in the morning : Others take it at bedtime : Some, when waking up to use the bathroom in the early hours : It doesn't matter as Levothyroxine is a storage hormone and needs to be converted by your body into T3 the active hormone that the body runs on. After 6-8 weeks on this first dose you will need another blood test and probably another dose increase which should be by just 25 mcg a day - it can be a slow process but you will start to feel better once you are on a decent dose and you will see your TSH come down to around 1 : your T3 come in and go up the range and your T4 increase in the range - most people preferring their T3 / T4 in the top half/quarter of the ranges. It is also important to check your antibodies as there are could be thyroid auto immune disease causing you further health issues. Your body needs to be able to utilise the medication as well as possible and this needs your core strength vitamins and minerals to be at good levels in their ranges. It will be useful to test your levels of ferritin, folate, B12 and vitamin D as these all need to be optimal for Levothyroxine to work well in the body and convert to T3 which is what gives you the debilitating symptoms you are currently suffering with. Hopefully the next time I would go to hospital I will request for the tests Please can I also ask After I got a cold i started having sore throat ,painful tongues and mouth ulcers including thrush It could well be - go into the Thyroid UK website - there is a page dedicated to symptoms of hypothyroidism. You are very run down and am guessing that your ferritin, B12, folate and vitamin D will also be low and suggest you get these checked out sooner rather than later. Can this doctor who offered you a trial of Levothyroxine run these for you as well as the antibodies ? I don’t really know if he would do it I won’t be going there for now till I’m able to gather some amount of money myself since everyone has given up on my case And I think the more you want to check ,the higher the amount So I think I would just get the Levothyroxine and be taking for now Well, we will not stop trying to help you - do you have anyone you can talk all this through with and where are you ? Well I have my mum but my health issues really affected her because of different tests we went for including CT scan of head It really costed her much so at a time she gave up on going to hospital and praying that I will be fine because must doctors told her is anxiety which I was very sure I’m not having and my mum basically believed the doctors at some point since there was no diagnosis So at this point I will have to carry my cross alone I really appreciate the fact that I was able to come across this forum 🤲 Thanks for trying to reach out to my messages ,I appreciate Ok - but talk through this all through with your Mum, show her the blood test as this proves you have hypothyroidism and that you need medication - Levothyroxine. We all trust doctors until we know differently : please start reading up as the more you learn the more you will be able to look after yourself and not have to pay doctors talking rubbish. Please read up on the Thyroid uk website as this is the charity who support this forum, and come back with any questions you may have. Take good care, and share this all with Mum as you need to reduce your own anxiety : Yes - I found this out reading through other posts : Golly it's all got very upsetting reading through these other dialogues : I just hope the original poster will not be discouraged to come back on if need be : Yes, but we need free T3 and free T4 and that is what has been tested. Well like I said, you need T3! Your labs are showing your Pituitary gland (TSH) screaming at your thyroid to wake up. Your T3 is low. It needs to be in the mid to upper 3s. The principle is that if you take T4 (levothyroxine) it will get converted in your body to T3 - as needed. Many find this is not a smooth and bump-free road, and some definitely need T3 (liothyronine) at some point. But as your Free T4 is low in range at present, it seems entirely appropriate to try levothyroxine and see what happens. That could be all you need. Or it could provide 90% (or whatever) of the answer even if, eventually, you add T3 (liothyronine). Why does she need T3? That’s a last resort if Levothyroxine at an appropriate dose fails to raise the FT3 via conversion? This response is not accurate. She will only need to have T3 if Levo fails Thank you so much 😔😔I appreciate No doctor ever mentioned this to me Most members on here would advise to get your tsh down to 1 and FT4 upper range to evaluate conversion and the need for T3. This is what I was advised on here by other members and by my endo to evaluate the need for T3 meds. Taking Synthroid and lowering tsh will kill people? If you have a medical degree, I hope I never get sick wherever u practice medicine. I’m not trolling, but advising someone to take T3 when they may not need it can be haphazard and dangerous. Not only are you advising someone to take T3 when they’re clearly not optimally medicated on levo, you’re also advising dosages! Telling them to take 30 then 60 and stabilize after 2-4 weeks and go up to 90. Even if the above poster were to switch to ndt, what makes you think you know how much they need? You’re also advising someone to make treatment decisions based on the STTM website. That website is utter garbage and sometimes downright dangerous. It constantly advises being thyrotoxic, that MORE hormone is better. More hormone isn’t always better and it’s definitely not safe The huge advantage of that is if someone makes a mistake in providing advice, others can comment and (hopefully) put it right.

When the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone it's called hypothyroidism. Congenital hypothyroidism is when the disorder is present in a baby at birth. If not treated, it can lead to serious health problems. The thyroid is a gland. It’s located in the neck, just below the voice box. The thyroid gland makes thyroid hormones. These hormones help control the metabolism. This is the rate at which every part of the body functions. Thyroid hormones keep the metabolism at a healthy pace. This helps the brain, heart, muscles, and other organs work well. A normal metabolism also helps ensure a healthy temperature, heart rate, energy level, and growth rate. If a baby doesn't make enough thyroid hormones, it can cause serious problems such as mental disability, growth delays, or loss of hearing. The condition needs to be treated as soon as possible to lower the chance of these problems long term. SPAN: The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is failure of the thyroid gland to grow before birth. Sometimes the gland is present but doesn't make the thyroid hormones. Other times the thyroid gland is located in an abnormal place in the neck. This makes it work less well. Or it can be caused by treatment of a thyroid problem while you are pregnant. If your diet is low in iodine, your child will also have low thyroid hormone levels at birth. Which children are at risk for congenital hypothyroidism? A child is at risk for congenital hypothyroidism if he or she has any of these: A chromosomal disorder such as Down syndrome, Williams syndrome, or Turner syndrome An autoimmune disorder such as type 1 diabetes or celiac disease. This is disease involving several hormone deficiencies such as pseudohypoparathyroidism. What are the symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism? A newborn baby may have no symptoms at first. Symptoms can include: Bellybutton that sticks out too far (umbilical hernia) By law, all newborns are screened in the first few days of life for serious diseases. The testing is done with a few drops of blood taken from the baby’s heel. One of the tests is for thyroid function. The blood is tested for amounts of hormones from the thyroid. It's also tested for amounts of hormones that tell the thyroid to make more hormones. Your baby’s healthcare provider may also advise an imaging test of the thyroid gland. Congenital hypothyroidism is most often treated by giving a child synthetic thyroid hormones every day. Your child will likely need to take these for life. In some cases, the thyroid gland may start working again. This may happen by age 3. The thyroid gland will be tested over time with blood tests. This can show if the thyroid starts working on its own. Your child’s growth and development will also be tracked over time.                                                             What are possible complications of congenital hypothyroidism? Congenital hypothyroidism can affect a child's normal growth and development. This includes sexual development. If untreated, the condition can also lead to: How can I help my child live with congenital hypothyroidism? Congenital hypothyroidism can affect a child's normal growth and development. It’s important for a child to continue treatment until after puberty. This will help make sure a child reaches his or her normal adult height. Some children don't need to continue treatment into adulthood. Work with your child's healthcare providers to create an ongoing plan to manage your child’s condition. When should I call my child's healthcare provider? Call your child's healthcare provider if you’re concerned about your child's growth, or if he or she has any signs of congenital hypothyroidism. Congenital hypothyroidism is when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones. It’s the most common thyroid disorder in children. Not enough thyroid hormone leads to signs such as slow growth, lack of activity, and poor performance in school. The most common cause is failure of the thyroid gland to grow during pregnancy or it's located in an abnormal position in the neck. Treatment may include taking thyroid hormones to increase the level of hormones in the body. Some children will need to take hormones for life. Other children may outgrow the disorder. Congenital hypothyroidism can impair a child's normal growth and development. It’s important for a child to continue treatment until after puberty. This will help ensure a child reaches his or her normal adult height. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s healthcare provider: Know the reason for the visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you for your child. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help your child. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your child’s condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if your child does not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice.",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-3.4864776134490967,39

0d400f16-eedb-4e5c-9f3e-c6d9094cc9f5,"The thyroid gland produces two related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which play a critical role in thermogenic and metabolic homeostasis. T4 and T3 are normally synthesized and released in response to a combined hypothalamic pituitary signal mediated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary and thyrotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. There is a negative feedback from thyroid hormone concentration, primarily T3, to TSH production causing total T4, total T3, free T4, and free T3 concentrations to move in opposition to TSH concentration. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is functionally inadequate. Causes of hypothyroidism include autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto’s disease (also known as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), atrophic thyroiditis, and postpartum thyroiditis; iodine deficiency, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in underdeveloped areas; congenital defects; medications or treatments that can result in hypothyroidism; central hypothyroidism in which the thyroid is not stimulated by the pituitary or hypothalamus; and infiltrative processes that may damage the thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamus. These different causes of hypothyroidism are often interrelated. Usually, the exact cause of the hypothyroidism cannot be definitively determined. Hashimoto’s disease, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common thyroid disease in the United States. In Hashimoto’s disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, resulting in inflammation that can cause an under active thyroid gland. In response to the decreased thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland, the anterior pituitary gland increases its production of TSH. This can cause the thyroid to enlarge. Such an enlargement is known as a goiter. The trigger for the immune system attack on the thyroid is not known. Speculation about the trigger includes trauma; environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke; a genetic flaw; or virus or bacterium, although infection as a trigger is now thought of as less likely. Hashimoto’s disease is most common in women between 40 and 60 years of age and there is a genetic predisposition. The incidence of the disease is high in the Japanese population, most likely as a result of genetic factors and a diet high in iodine. Often, there are no symptoms associated with Hashimoto’s disease for many years, and the condition remains undiagnosed until an enlarged thyroid gland or routine blood tests reveal a problem. If symptoms do develop, they are either related to the increased pressure in the neck caused by the goiter or the usual symptoms of hypothyroidism, which include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, depression, and dry skin. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? Antithyroid antibodies are often helpful in the diagnosis of an autoimmune thyroid disorder. There are three different antithyroid antibodies: thyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb), an antibody to a follicular enzyme involved in oxidation and organification of iodine; thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), an antibody to thyroglobulin, the protein made up of the essential amino acid tyrosine to which the iodine is attached; and TSH receptor inhibiting immunoglobulin, which competes with TSH for receptor binding sites but does not activate them. If an antithyroid antibody is present, it is often indicative of a prior attack on thyroid tissue. Antithyroid antibodies are the most specific test for Hashimoto’s disease, but they are not present in all cases and they can sometimes be found in patients without an autoimmune thyroid problem. Usually, a combination of TPOAb and TgAb testing is used to add more specificity. TSH and free T4 are the usual laboratory diagnostic tools in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto’s disease, free T4 is decreased and TSH is increased in an effort to provide the body with adequate free T4. T3 is not generally reliable in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Measuring TSH, free T4, or other analytes will not identify the cause of the hypothyroidism as Hashimoto’s disease. In a patient with stable thyroid status, TSH is the more sensitive test in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, since the relationship between TSH and free T4 is log/linear. Intraindividual variation for free T4 is quite small, so any small deficiency of free T4 will be sensed by the anterior pituitary relative to the individual’s set point and cause an amplified, inverse response in TSH. In a patient with unstable thyroid status, free T4 is the more reliable indicator; however, it is possible for high TSH stimulation to keep T4 levels within normal limits for quite some time.(Table 1) Increased, in combination with decreased free T4diagnostic of primary hypothyroidism Decreased, in combination with increased TSH diagnostic of primary hypothyroidism Present, indicative of autoimmune thyroid disease but not always present; TPOAb and TgAb are often used in combination Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? Interferences may obscure the diagnosis of Hashimoto’s disease or complicate the monitoring of the effectiveness of thyroid replacement therapy. Most thyroid testing is performed by either immunoassay, in which labeled and unlabeled ligands compete for a limited number of antibody sites, or immunometric assays, in which an antibody is bound to a solid surface rather than an antibody. Cross reactivity of auto-antibodies or heterophilic antibodies can affect diagnostic accuracy of competitive binding-based tests. The term heterophilic antibodies is often loosely applied to relatively weak antibodies with multiple activity sites, known as auto-antibodies, seen in auto immune disorders; broadly reactive antibodies induced by infections or exposure to therapy containing monoclonal mouse antibodies (HAMA); or human anti-animal immunoglobulins produced against well defined, specific antigens following exposure to therapeutic agents containing animal antigen or by coincidental immunization through exposure to animal antigens. The latter, Human Anti-Animal Antibodies (HAAA), are strong reactors. HAMA and HAAA affect immunometric assays more than they affect simple competitive immunoassays. In immunometric assays HAMA and HAAA can form a bridge between the capture and signal antibodies. Auto-antibodies and heterophilic antibody interferences can sometimes be detected by simply using a different manufacturer’s method that employs a slightly different antibody. Tests in which dilutions are acceptable, such as total T4, total T3, or TSH, but not free T4 or free T3, may be checked for linearity of response to help identify heterophilic antibody interference. Most circulating thyroid hormones are bound to protein. Only that hormone that is free is biologically active. Variations in binding protein will cause variations in concentrations of total hormones. In general, serum TSH is less affected by binding issues than T3 and T4, and T4 is bound more tightly than T3. T3 and T4 circulate in the body bound to thyroid binding globulin (TBG); transthyretin, formally known as thyroxine binding prealbumin; and serum albumin. Physiological shifts toward greater total hormone binding will decrease available free hormone. Theoretically, free T3 and free T4 are not affected analytically by binding, but in reality, all of the free methods are binding dependent to varying degrees. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, aspirin, and furosemide compete with thyroid hormone for protein binding sites and, thus, acutely increase free hormones and reduce total hormones. Eventually, a normal equilibrium is reestablished where free levels normalize at the expense of total levels. Heparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase, liberating free fatty acids, which inhibit total T4 protein binding and elevate free T4. Free fatty acids are known to affect some methods. Estrogens increase TBG, increasing total thyroid hormones. Liver disease, androgens, and nephrotic syndrome decrease TBG, decreasing total thyroid hormones. Indole acetic acid, which accumulates in uremia, may interfere with thyroid binding. Pregnancy is associated with lower albumin levels. Therefore, albumin-dependent methods are not suitable for accessing thyroid status during pregnancy. TSH levels decline in the first trimester of pregnancy partly because of the increase in total T3 and T4 from increased TBG. Total T3 and T4 are also increased in the first trimester by increased Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG), which is structurally and, to some extent, functionally similar to TSH. Glucocorticosteroids can lower T3 and inhibit TSH production. This interaction is of particular concern in sick, hospitalized patients in whom the elevated TSH in primary hypothyroidism may be obscured. Propanolol has an inhibitory effect on T4 to T3 conversion. Eighty percent of T3 is produced enzymatically in nonthyroid tissue by 5 monodeiodination of T4. Methods that use fluorescent tags may be affected by the presence of fluorophore-related therapeutic or diagnostic agents. If there is a question about the cause of a goiter associated with hypothyroidism, a fine needle aspiration examined cytologically can confirm the presence of autoimmune thyroiditis. It has been suggested that the best confirmation of hypothyroidism, in general, is an evaluation of response to a trial administration of thyroid supplementation in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism. Lone TSH testing may not be predictive of autoimmune disorders in which TSH may be normal, elevated, or depressed. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? Up to 20% of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism have antibodies against TSH receptor, which prevent binding with TSH. TSH receptor blocking antibodies are difficult to analyze. Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? It is important that Hashimoto’s disease be treated appropriately. If replacement therapy is inadequate, the thyroid gland will continue to enlarge and cholesterol levels may increase. Such hypercholesterolemia is generally seen as an increase in low density lipoprotein, which places the patient at greater risk of atherosclerosis. Hypothyroidism can also lead to an enlarged heart and, in rare cases, heart failure. Hashimoto’s disease is also associated with an increased rate of birth defects, if inadequately treated. If replacement therapy is too strong, symptoms of hyperthyroidism can develop, placing excessive strain on the heart and increasing the risk of osteoporosis. Since Hashimoto’s disease is a disorder of the immune system, patients with the disorder have a statistically increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, such as insulin dependent diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, pernicious anemia, Addison’s disease, early menopause, vitiligo, thrombocytopenic purpura, or lupus erythematosus. A combination of high free T4 and high TSH may be an indication of therapeutic noncompliance. Acute ingestion of missed levothyroxine (L-T4) just prior to a clinic visit will raise the free T4 but fail to normalize the TSH because of a “lag effect”. Free T4 is the short-term indicator, whereas TSH is a long-term indicator. Since TSH is the long-term indicator, it is not influenced by time of L-T4 ingestion. When testing free T4, the daily dose of L-T4 should be withheld until after sampling, as free T4 is significantly increased above baseline for up to 9 hours after ingesting L-T4. Ideally, L-T4 should be taken prior to eating, at the same time each day, and at least 4 hours apart from other medications. Many medications and even vitamins and minerals can influence L-T4 absorption. L-T4 should not be taken with iron supplements. Patients should not switch from brand to brand of L-T4 and prescriptions should not be written generically, as doing so will allow brand to brand switches. Although stated concentrations of L-T4 may be the same, slight variations exist between pharmaceutical manufacturers in terms of bioavailability. Also, medication storage recommendations should be scrupulously followed. Medication should be stored away from humidity, light, and increased temperatures. When ordering medication it is best to avoid the summer for shipping. TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading during transition periods of unstable thyroid function. Often these transition periods occur in the early phase of treating hyper- or hypothyroidism or changing the L-T4 dose. It takes 6-12 weeks for pituitary TSH secretion to re-equilibrate to the new thyroid hormone status. Similar periods of unstable thyroid status may occur following an episode of thyroiditis. TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading in cases of abnormalities in hypothalamic or pituitary function in which the usual negative feedback is not seen and TSH may remain within normal ranges. Free T4 and TSH have reduced specificity in hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness. Most hospitalized patients have low serum total T3 and free T3. These abnormalities are seen with both acute and chronic nonthyroid illness and are thought to be the malfunction of central inhibition of hypothalamic releasing hormone. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry guidelines for testing of hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness include: Acute or chronic nonthyroid illness has complex effects on thyroid function testing. Whenever possible, diagnostic testing should be deferred until the illness has resolved, except in cases in which there is a suggestion of presence of thyroid dysfunction. Physicians should be aware that some thyroid tests are inherently not interpretable in severely ill patients or patients receiving multiple medications. TSH in the absence of dopamine or glucocorticoid therapy is the more reliable test. TSH testing in the hospitalized patient should have a functional sensitivity of less than 0.02 mIU/L. Otherwise, sick, hyperthyroid patients with profoundly low TSH cannot be differentiated from patients with mild transient TSH suppression caused by nonthyroid illness. An abnormal free T4 in the presence of serious somatic disease is unreliable. In hospitalized patients, abnormal free T4 testing should reflex to total T4. If both free T4 and total T4 are abnormal in the same direction, a thyroid condition may exist. Discordant free T4 and total T4 abnormalities are more likely the result of illness, medication, or a testing artifact. Total T4 abnormalities should be considered in conjunction with the severity of the patient illness. A low T4 in patients not in intensive care is suspicious of hypothyroidism, since low total T4 levels in nonthyroid illness in hospitalized patients are most often seen in sepsis. If a low total T4 is not associated with an elevated TSH and the patient is not profoundly sick, hypothyroidism secondary to pituitary or hypothalamic deficiency should be considered. Reverse T3 formed by the loss of an iodine group from T4 where the position of the iodine atoms on the aromatic ring is reversed is rarely helpful in the hospital setting, because paradoxically normal or low values can result from impaired renal function and low binding protein concentrations. Trimester specific reference ranges should be used in pregnancy. During pregnancy, estrogens increase TBG to 2-3 times prepregnancy levels. This shifts binding such that total T3 and total T4 are approximately 1.5 times nonpregnant levels at 16 weeks gestation. TSH is also altered during pregnancy. TSH is decreased in the first trimester due to the thyroid stimulating activity of HCG. The decline in TSH is associated with a modest increase in free T4 from the increased TBG. In approximately 2% of pregnancies the increase in free T4 leads to a condition known as gestational transient thyrotoxicosis. This condition may be associated with hyperemesis. In the second and third trimester, free hormone levels decrease 20-40% below reference ranges. Pregnant patients receiving L-T4 replacement may require increased dose to maintain a normal TSH and free T4. TSH has a very short half-life of 60 minutes and is subject to circadian and diurnal variation peaking at night and reaching a nadir between 10 AM and 4 PM. T4 has a much longer half-life of 7 days. It should be noted that there is a continuous decrease in the TSH/free T4 ratio from mid-gestation through completion of puberty. In adulthood, TSH increases in the elderly. Age related reference ranges, or at least ratio adjusted reference ranges, should be used for these analytes. For a change in analyte value to have clinical significance, the difference should take into consideration analytical and biological variabilities. The magnitude of difference in thyroid testing values reflecting clinical significance when monitoring a patient’s response to therapy are: Copyright © 2017, 2013 Decision Support in Medicine, LLC.

d508e770-9562-4a59-818a-d2162777665c,"— Ashwagandha is a powerful herb also known as Indian ginseng or winter cherry (). Extracts of its root are most commonly used and sold in tablet, liquid, or powder form. Ashwagandha is considered an adaptogen, meaning it’s believed to help your body manage stress. It’s also used to combat aging, strengthen and build muscle, aid neurological disorders, and relieve rheumatoid arthritis (, , , , , , ). Used for centuries in traditional medicine, it has gained recent popularity as an alternative treatment for thyroid issues. This article explains whether you should take ashwagandha to support thyroid health. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped organ located at the base of your neck. It plays a key role in , bone health, and growth and development (, , ). The three main hormones important for thyroid health are (): TSH is controlled by the pituitary gland, a small peanut-sized gland located near the base of your brain. When T3 and T4 levels are too low, TSH is released to produce more of these hormones. An imbalance between them may indicate thyroid issues (). There are two main types of thyroid disorders — hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurs when your thyroid doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormone. It’s usually associated with particular medications, , or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder in which your body attacks healthy thyroid tissue (). Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain, fatigue, constipation, goiters, and dry skin (). In contrast, hyperthyroidism is characterized by the overproduction of thyroid hormone. People with this condition usually experience shortness of breath, an irregular heartbeat, fatigue, hair loss, and unintentional weight loss (). In Western countries, 1–2% and 0.2–1.3% of the population have hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, respectively (). Both conditions are typically treated with synthetic medication. However, some may seek natural alternatives, such as ashwagandha. Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder characterized by low levels of thyroid hormone, whereas hyperthyroidism is linked to high levels. Some people use ashwagandha to treat these conditions instead of synthetic medication. While ashwagandha has , you may wonder if it’s worth taking for thyroid health. In general, insufficient research exists on ashwagandha supplements and thyroid health. However, recent studies indicate promising results regarding . An 8-week study in 50 people with hypothyroidism found that taking 600 mg of ashwagandha root extract daily led to significant improvements in thyroid levels, compared to taking a placebo (). Those in the ashwagandha group showed significant increases in triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels of 41.5% and 19.6%, respectively. Furthermore, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels decreased by 17.5% (). Ashwagandha’s cortisol-lowering effects may be responsible. increases cortisol levels, leading to lower levels of T3 and T4. Ashwagandha appears to stimulate your endocrine system, boosting thyroid hormone levels by reducing cortisol (). In another eight-week study, adults with bipolar disorder were given ashwagandha. While three participants experienced increases in T4 levels, this study was limited (). More studies are needed to better understand the long-term effects of ashwagandha on hypothyroidism. No human studies have examined ashwagandha supplements and hyperthyroidism. That said, ashwagandha may exacerbate hyperthyroidism symptoms by boosting T3 and T4 levels, potentially leading to a serious form of hyperthyroidism called thyrotoxicosis (, ). Thyrotoxicosis occurs when your body has extremely high levels of circulating thyroid hormones but low levels of TSH (, ). Untreated, this condition can lead to heart failure, weight loss, extreme thirst, and (, ). Therefore, it is important to speak with your healthcare practitioner before taking ashwagandha, especially if you have hyperthyroidism. By boosting T3 and T4 thyroid hormone levels, ashwagandha may play a role in managing hypothyroidism but worsen symptoms of hyperthyroidism. For most healthy people, ashwagandha is considered safe (, ). However, women who are or breastfeeding should avoid it, in addition to people with hyperthyroidism (). Furthermore, this herb may interact with sedatives, as well as medications for the following conditions (, ): What’s more, ashwagandha may stimulate your immune system, potentially exacerbating autoimmune diseases, such as , multiple sclerosis, and lupus (, ). Therefore, it’s best to consult your healthcare practitioner before using ashwagandha. While largely considered safe, ashwagandha should not be taken by those who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or hyperthyroid. As this herb can also interfere with several medications, it’s recommended to consult your healthcare provider before taking it. Ashwagandha is usually taken in supplement form. Most supplements come in 300-mg tablets ingested twice per day after eating. It also comes as a powder and is usually added to water, milk, juices, or smoothies. Some people mix it into dishes or sprinkle it on top of . As all current research uses the tablet form, it’s not yet known if powders and have the same effects. Because there’s no human data on ashwagandha toxicity, it’s generally considered safe for use. Follow the manufacturer’s recommended dose unless otherwise instructed by your healthcare practitioner (, ). Ashwagandha is usually taken as a supplement in 300-mg doses twice per day. It is also available as a powder or tea. has been used for centuries in alternative medicine. Preliminary research shows that it may improve thyroid levels in those with hypothyroidism. However, it may worsen the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

These different causes of hypothyroidism are often interrelated. Usually, the exact cause of the hypothyroidism cannot be definitively differentiated. When low thyroid hormone levels are the result of a failure of the hypothalamus to secrete TRH, which, in turn, stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce TSH, the resulting hypothyroidism is hypothalamic hypothyroidism, also known as tertiary hypothyroidism. Hypothalamic hypothyroidism belongs to the group of hypothyroidisms collectively known as central hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism cause by diminished TSH from the anterior pituitary is another central hypothyroidism. Hypothalamic hypothyroidism can be idiopathic or result from demonstrable hypothalamic disease. The lack of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland as a consequence of failure of the hypothalamus to initiate TSH production in the anterior pituitary presents with the same signs and symptoms as are seen with other hypothyroid conditions (i.e., fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, depression, and dry skin). Treatment involves replacement of thyroid hormones and, in some cases, surgical removal of a precipitating tumor. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? TSH and free T4 are the usual laboratory diagnostic tools in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism due to a hypothalamic disorder, free T4 is decreased. T3 is not generally reliable in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Measuring free T4 or other analytes will not identify the cause of the hypothyroidism as hypothalamic. Normally, TSH is the more sensitive test in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, since the relationship between TSH and free T4 is log/linear. Intraindividual variation for free T4 is quite small. Therefore, any small deficiency of free T4 would be sensed by the pituitary relative to the individual’s set point and cause an amplified, inverse response in TSH. In patients with a failure of the hypothalamus, this negative feedback is not seen. Since TSH cannot demonstrate the normal negative feedback, used alone, TSH is not diagnostic for central hypothyroidisms. A combined TSH and free T4 are thought to be a better approach. Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? Interferences may obscure the diagnosis of hypothalamic hypothyroidism or complicate the monitoring of the effectiveness of thyroid replacement therapy. Most thyroid testing is performed by either immunoassay in which labeled and unlabeled ligands compete for a limited number of antibody sites or immunometric assays in which an antibody is bound to a solid surface rather than an antibody. Cross reactivity of autoantibodies or heterophilic antibodies can affect diagnostic accuracy of competitive binding-based tests. The term heterophilic antibodies is often loosely applied to relatively weak antibodies with multiple activity sites, known as autoantibodies, seen in auto immune disorders; broadly reactive antibodies induced by infections or exposure to therapy containing monoclonal mouse antibodies (HAMA); or human anti-animal immunoglobulins produced against well defined, specific antigens following exposure to therapeutic agents containing animal antigen or by coincidental immunization through exposure to animal antigens. The latter, Human Anti-Animal Antibodies (HAAA), are strong reactors. HAMA and HAAA affect immunometric assays more than they affect simple competitive immunoassays. In immunometric assays, HAMA and HAAA can form a bridge between the capture and signal antibodies. Autoantibodies and heterophilic antibody interferences can sometimes be detected simply by using a different manufacturer’s method that employs a slightly different antibody. Tests in which dilutions are acceptable, such as total T4, total T3, or TSH, but not free T4 or free T3, may be checked for linearity of response to help identify heterophilic antibody interference. Most circulating thyroid hormones are bound to protein. Only that hormone that is free is biologically active. Variations in binding protein cause variations in concentrations of total thyroid hormones. In general, serum TSH is less affected by binding issues than T3 and T4, and T4 is bound more tightly than T3. T3 and T4 circulate in the body bound to thyroid binding globulin (TBG); transthyretin, formally known as thyroxine binding prealbumin; and serum albumin. Physiological shifts toward greater total hormone binding decrease available free hormone. Theoretically, free T3 and free T4 are not affected analytically by binding. In reality, all of the free methods are binding dependent to varying degrees. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, aspirin, and furosemide compete with thyroid hormone for protein binding sites and, thus, acutely increase free hormone and reduce total hormones. Eventually, a normal equilibrium is reestablished where free levels normalize at the expense of total levels. Heparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase, liberating free fatty acids, which inhibit total T4 protein binding and elevate free T4. Free fatty acids are known to affect some methods. Estrogens increase TBG, increasing total thyroid hormones. Liver disease, androgens, and nephrotic syndrome decrease TBG, decreasing total thyroid hormones. Indole acetic acid, which accumulates in uremia, may interfere with thyroid binding. Pregnancy is associated with lower albumin levels. Therefore, albumin dependent methods are not suitable for accessing thyroid status during pregnancy. Glucocorticosteroids can lower T3 and inhibit TSH production. This interaction is of particular concern in sick, hospitalized patients in whom the elevated TSH in primary hypothyroidism may be obscured. Propranolol has an inhibitory effect on T4 to T3 conversion. Eighty percent of T3 is produced enzymatically in nonthyroid tissue by 5 monodeiodination of T4. Methods that use fluorescent tags may be affected by the presence of fluorophore-related therapeutic or diagnostic agents. TRH stimulation test is no longer thought of as a confirmatory test for hypothalamic hypothyroidism, as a sufficiently sensitive TSH can detect a low basal TSH, providing the same information. Otherwise, it has been suggested that the best confirmation of hypothyroidism is an evaluation of response to a trial administration of thyroxine supplement in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? TRH level analysis is not generally available but may be viewed indirectly through a TRH stimulation test. In the past, TRH stimulation testing was used to diagnose hypothalamic hypothyroid disease. If TSH is low or normal in the presence of symptoms of hypothyroidism, a TRH test can be performed. In the TRH test, synthetic TRH is given. Normal patients respond with a doubling of their TSH about 30 minutes after injection. A patient with hypothalamic hypothyroidism shows a normal response, but the peak is delayed to 45-60 minutes after injection. Patients with pituitary hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism will not respond with an increase in TSH. Patients with primary hypothyroidism will show an exaggerated TSH response. Newer, more sensitive TSH methods have rendered the TRH stimulation test obsolete, as the failure to rise after an intravenous TRH injection has the same implication as a suppressed basal TSH. Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading in cases of abnormalities in hypothalamic or pituitary function in which the usual negative feedback is not seen and TSH may remain within normal ranges. A combination of high free T4 and high TSH may be indicative of therapeutic noncompliance. Acute ingestion of missed levothyroxine (L-T4) just prior to a clinic visit raises the free T4 but fails to normalize the TSH because of a “lag effect.” Free T4 is a short-term indicator, whereas TSH is a long-term indicator. Since TSH is the long-term indicator, it is not influenced by time of L-T4 ingestion. When testing free T4, the daily dose of L-T4 should be withheld until after sampling, as free T4 is significantly increased above baseline up to 9 hours after ingesting L-T4. Ideally, L-T4 should be taken prior to eating, at the same time each day, and at least 4 hours from other medications. Many medications and even vitamins and minerals can influence L-T4 absorption. L-T4 should not be taken with iron supplements. Patients should not switch from brand to brand of L-T4, and prescriptions should not be written generically, as doing so will allow brand to brand switches. Although stated concentrations of L-T4 may be the same, slight variations exist between pharmaceutical manufacturers in terms of bioavailability. Also, medication storage recommendations should be scrupulously followed. Medication should be stored away from humidity, light, and increased temperatures. When ordering medication, it is best to avoid the summer for shipping. TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading during transition periods of unstable thyroid function. Often, these transition periods occur in the early phase of treating hyper or hypothyroidism or changing the L-T4 dose. It takes 6-12 weeks for pituitary TSH secretion to reequilibrate to the new hormone status. Similar periods of unstable thyroid status may occur following an episode of thyroiditis. Free T4 and TSH have reduced specificity in hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness. Most hospitalized patients have low serum total T3 and free T3. These abnormalities are seen with both acute and chronic nonthyroid illness and are thought to be the result of a malfunction of central inhibition of hypothalamic releasing hormone. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry guidelines for testing of hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness recommendations include the following: Acute or chronic nonthyroid illness has complex effects on thyroid function testing. Whenever possible, diagnostic testing should be deferred until the illness has resolved, except in cases in which a suggestion of presence of thyroid dysfunction exists. Physicians should be aware that some thyroid tests are inherently not interpretable in severely ill patients or patients receiving multiple medications. TSH in the absence of dopamine or glucocorticoid therapy is the more reliable test. TSH testing in hospitalized patients should have a functional sensitivity less than 0.02 mIU/L; otherwise, sick, hyperthyroid patients with profoundly low TSH cannot be differentiated from patients with mild transient TSH suppression caused by nonthyroid illness. An abnormal free T4 in the presence of serious somatic disease is unreliable. In hospitalized patients, abnormal free T4 testing should reflex to total T4. If both free T4 and total T4 are abnormal in the same direction, a thyroid condition may exist. Discordant free T4 and total T4 abnormalities are more likely the result of illness, medication, or a testing artifact. Total T4 abnormalities should be considered in conjunction with the severity of the patient illness. A low T4 in patients not in intensive care is suspicious of hypothyroidism, since low total T4 levels in hospitalized patients are most often seen in sepsis. If a low total T4 is not associated with an elevated TSH and the patient is not profoundly sick, hypothyroidism secondary to pituitary or hypothalamic deficiency should be considered. Reverse T3 formed by the loss of an iodine group from T4 in which the position of the iodine atoms on the aromatic ring is reversed is rarely helpful in the hospital setting, because paradoxically normal or low values can result from impaired renal function and low binding protein concentrations. Trimester specific reference ranges should be used in pregnancy. During pregnancy, estrogens increase TBG to 2-3 times prepregnancy levels. This shifts binding such that total T3 and total T4 are approximately 1.5 times nonpregnant levels at 16 weeks gestation. TSH is also altered during pregnancy. TSH is decreased in the first trimester because of the thyroid stimulating activity of HCG. The decline in TSH is associated with a modest increase in free T4 from the increased TBG. In approximately 2% of pregnancies, the increase in free T4 leads to a condition known as gestational transient thyrotoxicosis. This condition may be associated with hyperemesis. In the second and third trimester, free hormone levels decrease 20-40% below reference ranges. Pregnant patients receiving L-T4 replacement may require increased dose to maintain a normal TSH and free T4. TSH has a very short half-life of 60 minutes and is subject to circadian and diurnal variation peaking at night and reaching a nadir between 10 AM and 4 PM. T4 has a much longer half-life of 7 days. It should be noted that there is a continuous decrease in the TSH/free T4 ratio from midgestation through completion of puberty. In adulthood, TSH increases in the elderly. Age-related reference ranges, or at least ratio adjusted reference ranges, should be used for these analytes. For a change in analyte value to have clinical significance, the difference should take into consideration analytical and biological variabilities. The magnitude of difference in thyroid testing values reflecting a clinical significance when monitoring a patient’s response to therapy is: Copyright © 2017, 2013 Decision Support in Medicine, LLC.

Most infants with congenital hypothyroidism are asymptomatic during the neonatal period or display subtle and nonspecific symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency. The lack of symptoms initially may result, in part, from an ectopic thyroid gland with clinically significant reserve function, partial defects in thyroid hormone synthesis, or to the moderate amount of maternal T4 that crosses the placenta and is able to boost fetal levels within 25-50% of normal levels observed at birth. Detection of congenital hypothyroidism based on signs and symptoms alone may be delayed until age 6-12 weeks or older because of the protean clinical presentation and requires a high index of suspicion by the health care provider. Only about 5% of infants with hypothyroidism are detected by clinical criteria before the biochemical screen alerts the clinician to confirm the diagnosis. The following are among the earliest signs of hypothyroidism: The clinical features of acquired hypothyroidism are typically insidious in onset. Goiter: Patients with CLT (ie, Hashimoto thyroiditis) most commonly present with an asymptomatic goiter. Parents may report that their child's neck looks ""full"" or ""swollen."" Children may complain of local symptoms of dysphagia, hoarseness, or of a pressure sensation in their neck and/or throat. A patient with other causes of hypothyroidism may have an enlarged thyroid gland. Slow growth, delayed osseous maturation, and increased weight: Mild weight gain despite decreased appetite is characteristic of the child who has a hypothyroid condition. Moderate-to-severe in children is not typical for hypothyroidism. Furthermore, children with hypothyroidism manifest a decreased growth rate, a more constant finding than weight gain. In contrast, children with exogenous obesity typically have an increased growth velocity. Sleep disturbance, typically Heat intolerance, weight loss, and tremors: These are typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. However, approximately 5-10% of children with CLT initially present with symptoms of toxic thyroiditis. This clinical picture may suggest a diagnosis of Graves disease. The thyrotoxic phase of CLT can be differentiated from Graves disease in that CLT is transient, is not associated with exophthalmos, and is usually associated with a decreased and nonuniform uptake of radioactive iodine. This hashitoxicosis phase is usually followed by the more characteristic hypothyroid phase. Parents may bring their child in for evaluation secondary to concern about testicular enlargement in boys or early breast development or onset of vaginal bleeding in girls. The exact mechanism of sexual pseudoprecocity is not fully understood; however, TRH-induced TSH excess is thought to be the common stimulator of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor. Serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels are elevated into the pubertal range. Mounting evidence suggests that increased serum levels of prolactin produce resistance to LH stimulation of the gonads, perhaps leading to hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) production and stimulation of pituitary LH and FSH release. The and delayed bone age observed in children with hypothyroidism help distinguish sexual pseudoprecocity from true . Sexual pseudoprecocity reverses with adequate thyroid replacement. Galactorrhea: This condition develops in primary hypothyroidism secondary to TRH secretion from the hypothalamus. TRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to release TSH and prolactin. Galactorrhea resolves as prolactin concentrations fall with thyroid replacement. If the newborn with congenital hypothyroidism is not identified by newborn screening and receives no replacement therapy, clinical manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism evolve during the first weeks after birth. Note that although the signs listed below are classic for congenital hypothyroidism, they may be subtle or absent. Recognition of this disorder has been enhanced by systematic newborn screening for the past 30 years. Physical signs of congenital hypothyroidism include the following: Rare cry or hoarse cry (hoarse cry is secondary to myxedema of the vocal cords) Large protruding tongue (secondary to accumulation of myxedema in the tongue) Delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes (The Achilles tendon reflex appears to be most sensitive to effects of hypothyroidism.) Enlarged cardiac silhouette, usually because of pericardial effusion Prolonged conduction time and low voltage on electrocardiogram (ECG) The signs of acquired hypothyroidism can include many physical findings observed with congenital hypothyroidism, such as the following: Mild obesity (5-15 lb over 6 mo) or morbid obesity (>20 lb overweight), which is seldom caused by hypothyroidism alone (The evaluation of obesity often includes assessment of serum TSH and free T4 levels.) This may occur secondary to the effects of TSH receptor–stimulating antibodies, inflammatory lymphocytic infiltration, or compensatory hyperplasia because of decreased serum T4 and increased TSH concentrations. Typically, the thyroid gland is enlarged diffusely, although it may not be enlarged symmetrically. Upon palpation, the thyroid gland may initially be soft but then takes on a firm feeling with rubbery consistency and a seedlike surface secondary to hyperplasia of the normal lobular architecture Approximately 75% of infants with congenital hypothyroidism have defects in thyroid gland development, 10% have hereditary defects in thyroid hormone synthesis or uptake, 5% have secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamus) hypothyroidism, and 10% have transient hypothyroidism. Thyroid dysgenesis: Defective thyroid gland development accounts for most instances of congenital hypothyroidism. Thyroid dysgenesis occurs sporadically in most cases but is occasionally familial because of mutations or deletions of genes (, , , , and ) that are involved in fetal thyroid formation. Thyroid dysgenesis ranges in severity from thyroid aplasia or hypoplasia to functional ectopic thyroid tissue. Approximately 40-60% of infants with thyroid gland dysgenesis have some functioning tissue. Laboratory and imaging studies facilitate the determination of the degree of dysgenesis. Thyroid agenesis is suggested by a low serum T4 level with an elevated serum TSH level and undetectable serum thyroglobulin. Newborns with ectopic or hypoplastic thyroid glands manifest low serum T4, elevated serum TSH, and measurable levels of circulating thyroglobulin. Imaging aids in confirming the diagnosis of aplastic, hypoplastic, or ectopic thyroid. Familial thyroid dyshormonogenesis: Rare autosomal recessive inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis, secretion, or uptake also cause congenital hypothyroidism. The following 8 inborn errors have been identified: Failure to respond to TSH secondary to defective activation of the thyroid receptor and related cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal transduction pathway Defect in trapping of iodide secondary to sodium-iodide symporter failure Defective oxidation of iodide to iodine secondary to thyroid peroxidase deficiency Partial peripheral resistance to thyroid hormones (autosomal dominant defect): Patients relate a family history of goiter with euthyroidism or hypothyroidism in the face of elevated serum levels of T4 or T3 but nonsuppressed serum TSH concentrations. Transplacental passage of maternal TSH-binding inhibitory antibodies: This can cause transient neonatal hypothyroidism. In mothers with autoimmune thyroiditis, immunoglobulin G (IgG) antithyroid antibodies can be transmitted across the placenta. These antibodies block binding of TSH to its receptor on the fetal thyroid. The half-life of these antibodies is approximately 1 week, and this form of congenital hypothyroidism usually resolves within 2-3 months of life. Although these infants are asymptomatic, they require thyroid hormone replacement until the pituitary-thyroid axis recovers. Monitoring the infant's serum titer of maternal antibodies is unnecessary, although monitoring serum TSH values is essential for guiding therapy. Maternal exposure to radioiodine: The fetal thyroid is able to trap iodide by 70-75 days' gestation. Hypothyroidism can develop if the mother is exposed to radioiodine to treat Graves disease or thyroid carcinoma. Goitrogens: These include iodides found in certain asthma medications, amiodarone, neonatal exposure to iodine-containing antiseptics, propylthiouracil, or methimazole. CLT (ie, autoimmune thyroiditis, Hashimoto thyroiditis) is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism and goiter in children living in iodine-sufficient areas. An increased frequency of CLT occurs in children with trisomy 21 syndrome, Ulrich-Turner syndrome, , or other autoimmune diseases, including . CLT appears to require both an environmental trigger and a genetically determined defect in immune surveillance. Evidence suggests that the disease develops secondary to a defect in cell-mediated immunity whereby suppressor T lymphocytes fail to destroy forbidden clones of thyroid-directed T lymphocytes, which form as part of random immunologic differentiation. The attack on the thyroid involves natural killer cells and the complement cascade. Various thyroid autoantibodies (antithyroglobulin antibody, antithyroid peroxidase antibody) are demonstrable in the serum but are not believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of CLT. Clinical manifestations of CLT vary depending on the type and predominance of thyroid antibodies produced. Most children present with an asymptomatic goiter and may be biochemically euthyroid, although compensated hypothyroidism and symptomatic hypothyroidism are more common presentations. Rarely, the child with CLT may be symptomatic with a small atrophied gland. A small percentage of children with CLT initially present with transient symptoms of hyperthyroidism. This short-lived thyrotoxic phase may be secondary to autonomous release of stored T4 and T3 (with progressive inflammatory lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid) or secondary to an initial predominance of TSH-receptor stimulating immunoglobulins (termed hashitoxicosis). Subacute thyroiditis is a rare disorder in children. Typically, a painful thyroid gland is accompanied by signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, with elevated serum T4 and suppressed serum TSH. Patients with this condition may present later manifesting a hypothyroid phase with goiter. The clinical hallmarks are painful swelling of the thyroid, usually after a viral infection, with lymphocytosis and elevated sedimentation rate. The inflammation results in autonomous release of thyroid hormone and a thyrotoxic phase, followed by a euthyroid phase and then a hypothyroid phase. Each phase lasts at least 1 week and is commonly followed by a return to an euthyroid state, depending on the degree of tissue damage. Treatment of the thyroid disorder is usually unnecessary. Drug-induced hypothyroidism can result from use of thioamides, lithium, amiodarone, and excess dietary iodine. Exposure to these substances most often results in biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism in the absence of clinical symptoms. Endemic goiter results from nutritional iodine deficiency with or without environmental goitrogen exposure. Endemic regions include high mountain plateaus and other areas that do not have ready access to salt water or seafood. T4 is converted in peripheral tissues to bioactive T3 by thyroxine-5'-deiodinase enzyme. This enzyme is also responsible for clearing small amounts of reverse T3 (rT3), which are the by-products of T4 metabolism. Many nonthyroidal illnesses are associated with inhibition of 5'-deiodinase activity in peripheral tissues, resulting in a decrease of circulating bioactive T3 and an increase in reverse T3 (rT3). Examples include acute or chronic severe illness, surgery, trauma, fasting, malnutrition, and use of certain drugs. TSH secretion is also decreased and does not appropriately respond to falling serum levels of T4. The classic findings include low or normal TSH, low T4 and free T4, low T3 and free T3, and elevated rT3 levels in serum. Thyroid hormone replacement is not needed because the disorder resolves with improvement of the underlying disease. Childhood onset of congenital hypothyroidism secondary to hypoplastic or ectopic gland, which becomes unable to meet the demands of the growing child. Radioiodine uptake imaging assists in making the diagnosis. Irradiation of the thyroid gland may be a cause. For example, the Chernobyl disaster of 1987 released massive quantities of radioactive iodine and cesium into the environment, leading to an increase in the subsequent incidence of both hypothyroidism and thyroid malignancy. Infiltrative and storage disorders of the thyroid gland, including histiocytosis X and cystinosis, may be associated with hypothyroidism. In these instances, the primary disease is usually evident prior to the development of hypothyroidism. Surgical excision may be associated with hypothyroidism.

Your Thyroid: Common Thyroid Problems and Diseases Explained Reviewed By: It's hard to tell if you have thyroid disease. You might feel run down and tired, or have what is known as ""brain fog."" You may be gaining weight, pregnant, or experiencing hair loss. Others may feel ""hyper,"" anxious, or sweat a lot more than usual. All of these are common symptoms of thyroid disorders. The thyroid gland regulates many body processes. Women are particularly likely to have disorders that affect the function of this essential hormone-producing gland. Recognizing and treating these conditions can help preserve your health and prevent long-term health problems. The thyroid gland is located in front of your neck. It has right and left lobes that resemble a butterfly. This gland produces hormones that help control your metabolism, which is how your body uses energy. Disorders that affect thyroid function can either speed up or slow down metabolic processes, which can lead to a wide range of symptoms. Changes in weight can signal an abnormal function of the thyroid gland. Low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism) can cause weight gain, while unexpected weight loss can signal that too much thyroid hormone is being produced (hyperthyroidism). Hypothyroidism is much more common than hyperthyroidism. A swollen neck can indicate thyroid disease. Sometimes a swollen neck is caused by a goiter. A goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland, which is a butterfly-shaped gland that sits in front of your throat. As shown here, an enlarged thyroid can be seen as a swelling in the front of the neck. Different thyroid diseases can cause goiters. Goiters can sometimes also result from tumors or nodules that develop within the thyroid. The hormones made in the thyroid gland affect almost every organ in the body, including the heart. Hypothyroidism can cause the heart to beat more slowly, while hyperthyroidism causes a fast heartbeat. Elevated levels of thyroid hormones also can lead to increases in blood pressure and the sense that your heart is pounding (palpitations). Thyroid disorders can affect emotions, energy, and mood. Hypothyroidism can cause symptoms like depression, tiredness, and feeling sluggish. Hyperthyroidism is associated with sleep disturbances, irritability, anxiety, and restlessness. Hair loss is a common sign of a thyroid problem. Both too high and too low levels of thyroid hormones can lead to hair loss. The hair typically grows back once the condition is treated. The thyroid affects regulation of body temperature, so those with hypothyroidism often report feeling cold. In contrast, people with hyperthyroidism tend to have excessive sweating and an aversion to heat. Other symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism include: Thyroid disorders can cause symptoms that are mistaken for those of a woman approaching menopause. Both menstrual cycle changes and mood changes can result from the menopausal transition or from thyroid conditions. Blood tests can determine which of these conditions is responsible for your symptoms. It's also possible to have a combination of the two causes. Your doctor may recommend tests if you have symptoms or risk factors for thyroid disease. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are most common in women over 60 years of age. A family history of thyroid disease increases your risk of developing thyroid conditions. Examining your neck in the area of the Adam's apple while you swallow can sometimes detect if your thyroid is enlarged. Swallow while tipping the head back, and examine your neck and the area above the collarbones. If you see any lumps or bulges, see a doctor. Blood tests can diagnose many thyroid conditions. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a hormone that controls activity of the thyroid gland. If your TSH is high, this typically signals that your thyroid function is low (hypothyroidism). In contrast, low levels of TSH suggest hyperthyroidism. Your doctor may also order tests to determine the levels of other thyroid hormones. Imaging studies and tissue biopsies are other tests that are sometimes used to evaluate thyroid problems. Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune condition, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In Hashimoto's disease the immune system mistakenly targets and damages the thyroid gland, so not enough hormones are produced. Hashimoto's disease tends to run in families. Thyroid disease may begin in the pituitary gland. The pituitary is located at the base of your brain. It controls the functions of many other glands in the body, including the thyroid. This gland produces TSH, which signals the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormones. If there is a problem with your pituitary and not enough TSH is produced, thyroid problems can result. Inflammation of the thyroid (“thyroiditis”) and taking certain medications can also cause low thyroid hormone levels. Graves' disease is the most common thyroid disease to cause elevated thyroid hormone levels. This is another autoimmune condition in which the immune system targets the thyroid. In Grave's Disease, the immune system attack triggers the release of high levels of thyroid hormones. A swelling behind the eyes is one of the characteristic signs of Graves' disease, as shown in this photo. A mother’s thyroid may become underactive or overactive in the period following childbirth. This is known as postpartum thyroiditis. An average of 7.5% of women experience postpartum thyroiditis, and most return to normal thyroid function within a year. Thyroid nodules are lumps that are found inside the thyroid gland. These lumps can begin producing high levels of thyroid hormones, leading to thyroid diseases like hyperthyroidism. Large lumps may be obvious, while smaller nodules can be visualized with an ultrasound examination of the thyroid. Untreated thyroid diseases can, in rare cases, become serious health emergencies. Having too much thyroid hormone in your blood may cause a thyroid storm. Symptoms include: On the other hand, severe thyroid underactivity can cause myxedema, another health emergency. Symptoms of myxedema include: Both conditions are considered life-threatening medical emergencies that require immediate medical care. Treatment for hypothyroidism usually involves taking thyroid hormones in pill form. Common thyroid disease medicines include methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU), and carbimazole. Symptoms usually improve within a few weeks of beginning therapy. Most of those affected will have to take the thyroid hormones throughout their life. Over time, treatment can result in weight loss, increased energy, and lowering of cholesterol levels. There are several treatments available to fight hyperthyroidism. The best approach can be determined by a doctor, who will likely consider how severe the hyperthyroidism is, as well as a patient's medical history. Antithyroid medication, which attempts to lower the amount of thyroid hormone produced, is the most common treatment for hyperthyroidism. Many people need to take this medication long-term. You may need other kinds of medication to treat certain symptoms, like tremors or fast heart rate. Radioactive iodine is a treatment option that destroys the thyroid gland over a period of weeks. This is an oral medication. Beta blockers don't actually treat thyroid level disorders, but they do improve the symptoms of high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and heart palpitations. Hyperthyroidism Treatment: Surgery (Thyroidectomy) Surgery to remove the thyroid gland is recommended for hyperthyroidism when antithyroid drugs do not work, or if there is severe enlargement of the gland. Surgery can also be used to treat thyroid nodules or tumors. After surgical removal of the gland, most people need to take thyroid hormones in pill form. Thyroid cancer is not common, and it is among the least deadly types of cancer. A lump or swelling in the thyroid gland is the most common sign, and only about 5% of thyroid nodules are malignant (cancerous). Some thyroid cancer, but not all, is treated by surgery followed by radioactive iodine therapy or radiation therapy. Thyroid cancer is almost never treated with external radiation.

62fc78c5-08d1-4db9-8553-5be5c753fdba,"Central Hypothyroidism – Hypopituitary, Hypothalamic, and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Deficiency Patients with central hypothyroidism have either a failure of the anterior pituitary to secrete TSH (also known as secondary hypothyroidism), failure of the hypothalamus to secrete thyroid releasing hormone (TRH) known as tertiary hypothyroidism, or, in some rare cases, a TSH deficiency with no other findings of pituitary or hypothalamus abnormality. The most common cause of central hypothyroidism is pituitary mass lesions. Treatment, such as surgery or radiation therapy for these lesions, can also lead to central hypothyroidism. Although rare, mutations in gene coding for the TSH-beta subunit can cause an isolated congenital TSH deficiency. These patients have a single base substitution in the amino acid sequence regulating the TSH-beta subunit. Patients with congenital isolated TSH deficiency shows signs of cretinism, such as mental and growth retardation (see chapter on congenital hypothyroidism). Another very rare cause of isolated TSH deficiency is drug-induced TSH deficiency and is seen in patients treated with a retinoid X receptor ligand (bexarotene), which selectively inhibits TSH secretion. Although cases of isolated TSH deficiency, congenital isolated TSH deficiency, and drug-induced isolated TSH deficiency have occurred, by far the majority of patients with TSH deficiency hypothyroidism have coexisting deficiencies in other pituitary hormones. Patients with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency often present with symptoms similar to the more common primary hypothyroidism, including fatigue, lethargy, cold intolerance, and weight gain. Other symptoms of hypothyroidism seen in TSH deficiency include the usual myriad of symptoms seen in hypothyroidism in general: brittle fingernails; coarsening and thinning hair; puffy eyes; pale, dry skin; weakness; and constipation. Hoarseness; menstrual disorders; puffy hands, face and feet; thickening of the skin; thinning of eyebrows; increased cholesterol levels; muscle and/or joint aches and stiffness; slowed speech; and decreased hearing are symptoms usually expressed later in the course of the disease. There are no symptoms that differentiate TSH deficiency from other types of hypothyroidism. TSH deficiency is, however, more difficult to diagnose than primary hypothyroidism because in the case of TSH deficiency TSH levels cannot be used as a guide (Table I). Transient forms of central hypothyroidism also exist. This condition can occur in three clinical situations: Serum TSH levels can remain low for a period of time after treatment of hyperthyroidism with an antithyroid drug, radioiodine, or surgery. Serum free T4 (FT4) can also be affected and fall below normal during this time. Serum TSH concentrations may also be low after the discontinuation of T4 therapy. Lastly, patients with severe nonthyroidal illness can have transient central hypothyroidism. When low thyroid hormone levels are the result of a failure of the anterior pituitary to secret TSH, the resulting hypothyroidism is pituitary hypothyroidism, also known as secondary hypothyroidism. Causes of pituitary hypothyroidism include head trauma; infiltrates into the pituitary; brain tumors, Sheehan’s syndrome (post-partum pituitary necrosis); and post radiation of the pituitary, nasopharyngeal, or para nasal sinus tumors. Symptoms of hypopituitary hypothyroidism are the same as all causes of hypothyroidism. Treatment involves replacement of thyroid hormones with levothyroxine (L-T4). When low thyroid hormone levels trace back to a failure of the hypothalamus to secrete Thyroid Releasing Hormone (TRH), which in turn stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce TSH, the resulting hypothyroidism is hypothalamic hypothyroidism, also known as tertiary hypothyroidism. Hypothalamic hypothyroidism can be idiopathic or result from demonstrable hypothalamic disease. Again signs and symptoms are the same as those for other types of hypothyroidism. Treatment involves replacement of thyroid hormones and, in some cases, surgical removal of a precipitating tumor. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? The use of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation in the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism has decreased substantially, due to the greater sensitivity of the TSH analysis. The use of TRH stimulations is still recommended in the diagnosis of congenital central hypothyroidism in neonates, so that appropriate therapeutic intervention can be undertaken quickly. When TRH stimulation is used, normal patients respond with a doubling of their TSH in about 30 minutes after injection of synthetic TRH. A patient with hypothalamic hypothyroidism will show a normal response, but the peak is delayed to 45- 60 minutes after injection. Patients with pituitary hypothyroidism will not respond with an increase in TSH. Patients with primary hypothyroidism will show an exaggerated TSH response. A normal increase in prolactin is seen after TRH stimulation in isolated TSH deficiency and can be used to differentiate TSH deficiency hypothyroidism from hypopituitary or hypothalamic hypothyroidism (Table I). MRI of the pituitary and/or hypothalamus regions should be performed in patients with evidence of central hypothyroidism, not known to be TSH deficiency. To diagnose central hypothyroidism, FT4 and TSH tests are performed. Normally TSH is the more sensitive test due to the relationship between TSH and fT4 being log/linear. Intraindividual variation in free T4 is quite small. But any small deficiency in fT4 would be sensed by the pituitary relative to the individual’s set point and cause an amplified inverse response in TSH. In patients with a failure of the pituitary or hypothalamus, this negative feedback is not seen. Since TSH cannot demonstrate the normal negative feedback, used alone, TSH is not diagnostic of central hypothyroidism. A combined TSH and fT4 are a better approach. Serum fT4 levels will be low, and serum TSH levels may be low, normal, or possibly even slightly elevated (up to 10 mU/L). Patients with central hypothyroidism often lack a nocturnal TSH surge. Since TSH is often normal in pituitary hypothyroidism, TSH cannot be used for confirmation of a pituitary problem. It is believed that bio-inactive TSH accounts for this phenomenon. The anterior pituitary produces several hormones that, in turn stimulate other glands (i.e., growth hormone, the gonadotropins, TSH, prolactin, and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)). It was previously thought that the anterior pituitary hormones drop off in a predictable manner, growth hormone being the first to decline, followed by luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone. Those decreases would be followed by TSH. ACTH would be the last pituitary hormone to be lost. However, there is no one analyte to test for pituitary function, and selective deficiencies of pituitary hormone are possible. Prolactin is often used as an indicator of pituitary function, since some pituitary tumors secret prolactin. When pituitary failure is suspected, each of the functions of the anterior pituitary should be evaluated. (Table II). It has been suggested that the best confirmation of hypothyroidism from any cause is an evaluation of response to a trial dose of thyroxine supplement. For a change in analytical value to have clinical significance, the difference should take into account analytical and biological variations. The magnitude of difference in thyroid test values reflecting a clinical significance when monitoring a patient’s response to therapy is: Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading in cases of abnormalities in hypothalamus or pituitary function, in which the usual negative feedback is not seen and TSH may remain within normal limits. Misinterpretation due to the inclusion of biologically inactive TSH isoforms in TSH assays can lead to a missed diagnosis of central hypothyroidism. TSH assays include biologically inactive TSH isoforms, which are secreted when the pituitary is damaged or when hypothalamic TRH stimulation is deficient. Most thyroid testing is performed by either immunoassay, in which labeled and unlabeled ligands compete for a limited number of antibody sites, or immunometric assays, in which an antibody is bound to a solid surface rather than an antibody. Cross reactivity of auto-antibodies or heterophilic antibodies can affect diagnostic accuracy of competitive binding-based tests. The term heterophilic antibodies is often loosely applied to relatively weak antibodies with multiple activity sites, known as auto-antibodies, seen in auto immune disorders; broadly reactive antibodies induced by infections or exposure to therapy containing monoclonal mouse antibodies (HAMA); or human anti-animal immunoglobulins produced against well defined, specific antigens following exposure to therapeutic agents containing animal antigen or by coincidental immunization through exposure to animal antigens. The latter, Human Anti-Animal Antibodies (HAAA), are strong reactors. HAMA and HAAA affect immunometric assays more than they affect simple competitive immunoassays. In immunometric assays HAMA and HAAA can form a bridge between the capture and signal antibodies. Auto-antibodies and heterophilic antibody interferences can sometimes be detected by simply using a different manufacturer’s method that employs a slightly different antibody. Tests in which dilutions are acceptable, such as total T4, total T3, or TSH, but not free T4 or free T3, may be checked for linearity of response to help identify heterophilic antibody interference. Most circulating thyroid hormones are bound to protein. Only that hormone that is free is biologically active. Variations in binding protein will cause variations in concentrations of total hormones. In general, serum TSH is less affected by binding issues than T3 and T4, and T4 is bound more tightly than T3. T3 and T4 circulate in the body bound to thyroid binding globulin (TBG); transthyretin, formally known as thyroxine binding prealbumin; and serum albumin. Physiological shifts toward greater total hormone binding will decrease available free hormone. Theoretically, free T3 and free T4 are not affected analytically by binding, but in reality, all of the free methods are binding dependent to varying degrees. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, aspirin, and furosemide compete with thyroid hormone for protein binding sites and, thus, acutely increase free hormones and reduce total hormones. Eventually, a normal equilibrium is reestablished where free levels normalize at the expense of total levels. Heparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase, liberating free fatty acids, which inhibit total T4 protein binding and elevate free T4. Free fatty acids are known to affect some methods. Estrogens increase TBG, increasing total thyroid hormones. Liver disease, androgens, and nephrotic syndrome decrease TBG, decreasing total thyroid hormones. Indole acetic acid, which accumulates in uremia, may interfere with thyroid binding. Pregnancy is associated with lower albumin levels. Therefore, albumin-dependent methods are not suitable for accessing thyroid status during pregnancy. TSH levels decline in the first trimester of pregnancy partly because of the increase in total T3 and T4 from increased TBG. Total T3 and T4 are also increased in the first trimester by increased Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG), which is structurally and, to some extent, functionally similar to TSH. There is a continuous decrease in the TSH/T4 ratio from mid-gestation through completion of puberty. In adulthood, TSH increased in the elderly. Age related reference ranges, or at least ratio adjusted reference ranges should be used. Glucocorticosteroids can lower T3 and inhibit TSH production. This interaction is of particular concern in sick, hospitalized patients in whom the elevated TSH in primary hypothyroidism may be obscured. Propanolol has an inhibitory effect on T4 to T3 conversion. Eighty percent of T3 is produced enzymatically in nonthyroid tissue by 5 monodeiodination of T4. Methods that use fluorescent tags may be affected by the presence of fluorophore-related therapeutic or diagnostic agents. A combination of high free T4 and high TSH may be an indication of therapeutic noncompliance. Acute ingestion of missed levothyroxine (L-T4) just prior to a clinic visit will raise the free T4 but fail to normalize the TSH because of a “lag effect”. Free T4 is the short-term indicator, whereas TSH is a long-term indicator. Since TSH is the long-term indicator, it is not influenced by time of L-T4 ingestion. When testing free T4, the daily dose of L-T4 should be withheld until after sampling, as free T4 is significantly increased above baseline for up to 9 hours after ingesting L-T4. Ideally, L-T4 should be taken prior to eating, at the same time each day, and at least 4 hours apart from other medications. Many medications and even vitamins and minerals can influence L-T4 absorption. L-T4 should not be taken with iron supplements. Patients should not switch from brand to brand of L-T4 and prescriptions should not be written generically, as doing so will allow brand to brand switches. Although stated concentrations of L-T4 may be the same, slight variations exist between pharmaceutical manufacturers in terms of bioavailability. Also, medication storage recommendations should be scrupulously followed. Medication should be stored away from humidity, light, and increased temperatures. When ordering medication it is best to avoid the summer for shipping. TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading during transition periods of unstable thyroid function. Often these transition periods occur in the early phase of treating hyper- or hypothyroidism or changing the L-T4 dose. It takes 6-12 weeks for pituitary TSH secretion to re-equilibrate to the new thyroid hormone status. Similar periods of unstable thyroid status may occur following an episode of thyroiditis. Patients with central hypothyroidism may need higher doses of T4 than those with primary hypothyroidism. Hyperprolactinemia may be present in both central and primary hypothyroidism Of note is the fact that pituitary-adrenal function should be evaluated before a patient with central hypothyroidism starts T4 therapy. T4 may accelerate cortisol metabolism. If a patient who also has adrenal insufficiency receives T4 before adrenal hormone replacement, an adrenal crisis could occur. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? Patients with either central or primary hypothyroidism can exhibit low FT4 levels and slightly high TSH levels; therefore, it is important to differentiate between the two diagnoses. Serum antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody concentration is one test that can be used to differentiate between central and primary hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism, TPO levels are increased, whereas the absence of anti-TPO antibodies in conjunction with other pituitary hormone abnormalities suggests central hypothyroidism.

This makes your metabolism slow down. Also called underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism can make you feel tired, gain weight and be unable to tolerate cold temperatures. The main treatment for hypothyroidism is hormone replacement therapy. Hypothyroidism is a condition where there isn’t enough thyroid hormone in your bloodstream and your metabolism slows down. Hypothyroidism happens when your thyroid doesn’t create and release enough thyroid hormone into your body. This makes your metabolism slow down, affecting you entire body. Also known as underactive thyroid disease, hypothyroidism is fairly common. When your thyroid levels are extremely low, this is called myxedema. A very serious condition, myxedema can cause serious symptoms, including: This severe type of hypothyroidism is life-threatening. In general, hypothyroidism is a very treatable condition. It can be controlled with regular medications and follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped organ located in the front of your neck just under the voice box (larynx). Picture the middle of the butterfly’s body centered on your neck, with the wings hugging around your windpipe (trachea). The main job of the thyroid is to control your metabolism. Metabolism is the process that your body uses to transform food to energy your body uses to function. The thyroid creates the hormones T4 and T3 to control your metabolism. These hormones work throughout the body to tell the body’s cells how much energy to use. They control your body temperature and heart rate. When your thyroid works correctly, it’s constantly making hormones, releasing them and then making new hormones to replace what’s been used. This keeps your metabolism functioning and all of your body’s systems in check. The amount of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream is controlled by the pituitary gland, which is located in the center of the skull below the brain. When the pituitary gland senses either a lack of thyroid hormone or too much, it adjusts its own hormone (thyroid stimulating hormone, or TSH) and sends it to the thyroid to balance out the amounts. If the amount of thyroid hormones is too high () or too low (hypothyroidism), the entire body is impacted. Hypothyroidism can affect people of all ages, genders and ethnicities. It’s a common condition, particularly among women over age 60. Women are generally more likely to develop hypothyroidism after than earlier in life. What’s the difference between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism? In hypothyroidism, the thyroid doesn’t make enough thyroid hormone. The difference between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism is quantity. In hypothyroidism, the thyroid makes very little thyroid hormone. On the flip side, someone with hyperthyroidism has a thyroid that makes too much thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism involves higher levels of thyroid hormones, which makes your metabolism speed up. If you have hypothyroidism, your metabolism slows down. Many things are the opposite between these two conditions. If you have hypothyroidism, you may have a difficult time dealing with the cold. If you have hyperthyroidism, you may not handle the heat. They are opposite extremes of thyroid function. Ideally, you should be in the middle. Treatments for both of these conditions work to get your thyroid function as close to that middle ground as possible. Hypothyroidism can have a primary cause or a secondary cause. A primary cause is a condition that directly impacts the thyroid and causes it to create low levels of thyroid hormones. A secondary cause is something that causes the pituitary gland to fail, which means it can’t send thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to the thyroid to balance out the thyroid hormones. Primary causes of hypothyroidism are much more common. The most common of these primary causes is an autoimmune condition called Hashimoto’s disease. Also called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, this condition is hereditary (passed down through a family). In Hashimoto’s disease, the body’s immune system attacks and damages the thyroid. This prevents the thyroid from making and releasing enough thyroid hormone. The other primary causes of hypothyroidism can include: Treatment of (radiation and surgical removal of the thyroid). Iodine deficiency (not having enough iodine — a mineral your thyroid uses to make hormones – in your body). Hereditary conditions (a medical condition passed down through your family). In some cases, thyroiditis can happen after a pregnancy () or a viral illness. In most cases, women with hypothyroidism during pregnancy have . This autoimmune disease causes the body’s immune system to attack and damage the thyroid. When that happens, the thyroid can’t produce and release high enough levels of thyroid hormones, impacting the entire body. Pregnant women with hypothyroidism may feel very tired, have a hard time dealing with cold temperatures and experience muscles cramps. Thyroid hormones are important to your baby’s development while in the womb. These hormones help develop the brain and nervous system. If you have hypothyroidism, it’s important to control your thyroid levels during pregnancy. If your baby doesn’t get enough thyroid hormone during development, the brain may not develop correctly and there could be issues later. Untreated or insufficiently treated hypothyroidism during pregnancy may lead to complications like miscarriage or preterm labor. When you’re on , the estrogen and progesterone inside of the pills can affect your thyroid-binding proteins. This increases your levels. If you have hypothyroidism, the dose of your medications will need to be increased while you’re using birth control pills. Once you stop using birth control pills, the dosage will need to be lowered. In some cases, there can be a connection between untreated hypothyroidism and . When your hypothyroidism is caused by an issue with the pituitary gland, you can also have low testosterone levels. Treating hypothyroidism can often help with erectile dysfunction if it was directly caused by the hormone imbalance. The symptoms of hypothyroidism usually develop slowly over time – sometimes years. They can include: Experiencing soreness throughout your body (can include muscle weakness). Having higher than normal blood cholesterol levels. Seeing physical changes in your face (including , as well as puffiness in the eyes and face). If your hypothyroidism is not treated, you could gain weight. Once you are treating the condition, the weight should start to lower. However, you will still need to watch your calories and .

36ea4365-0b90-42bd-98fe-2655e3aa2e5f,"— — Myxedema is another term for severely advanced hypothyroidism. This is a condition that occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid is a small gland that sits right at the front of your neck. It releases hormones that help your body regulate energy and control a wide variety of functions. Myxedema is the result of having undiagnosed or untreated severe hypothyroidism. The term “myxedema” can be used to mean severely . But it’s also used to describe skin changes in someone with severely advanced hypothyroidism. The classic skin changes are: swelling of your face, which can include your lips, eyelids, and tongue swelling and thickening of skin anywhere on your body, especially in your lower legs Severely advanced hypothyroidism can lead to what is called a myxedema crisis, a medical emergency. While the term “myxedema coma” used to describe this life-threatening situation, “myxedema crisis” has replaced it, as a comatose state is no longer required to diagnose the condition. In addition to skin changes, other signs and symptoms of severe hypothyroidism can include: Myxedema crisis occurs when your body can no longer tolerate the changes caused by severe hypothyroidism, so it decompensates. This is a life-threatening state that requires immediate medical attention. Along with the signs and symptoms of severe hypothyroidism, symptoms of myxedema crisis can include: Myxedema crisis can cause death often due to complications from infection, bleeding, or respiratory failure. It’s more common in women and people over the age of 60. It can occur during pregnancy as well. Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid stops functioning properly. This may be caused by: an autoimmune condition, including certain medications, such as lithium or (Pacerone) immune system medications, like those used in cancer treatment Myxedema is a result of undiagnosed or untreated severe hypothyroidism. It can also develop when someone stops taking their thyroid medication. It’s more common in the elderly and in women. Deposits of chains of sugar molecules (complex mucopolysaccharides) in the skin cause the skin condition myxedema. These compounds attract water, which lead to swelling. These skin changes are a result of hypothyroidism. Myxedema crisis often occurs after a long history of hypothyroidism. It’s more common during cold winter months. It can be triggered by any of the following: certain drugs that suppress the central nervous system Your symptoms will lead your doctor to suspecting severe hypothyroidism. Blood tests can help your doctor confirm this. A measures how much TSH your pituitary gland produces. Your pituitary gland will increase TSH production if your thyroid isn’t producing enough. In other words, a high level of TSH could mean you have hypothyroidism. A TSH test is typically checked along with a . This test measures the level of T4, a hormone produced directly by your thyroid. If you have low levels of T4 coupled with a high level of TSH, you have hypothyroidism. Your doctor will likely want to perform more tests to determine your thyroid function and other conditions that may be affecting it. Myxedema crisis is a medical emergency. Once suspected, TSH and T4 levels will be checked right away. Treatment can begin as soon as possible. The initial diagnosis often relies on the physical examination. Emergency medical personnel will look out for other features of severe hypothyroidism such as: You’ll start to receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy if your doctor suspects a myxedema crisis. The preferred route is through a vein using an intravenous line (IV). Your doctor will order other blood tests to get a thorough picture of your body systems. A of your brain will likely be needed as well. Your vital functions and level of consciousness are also continually monitored during this process. You’ll require hospitalization treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) until you’re stable. Thyroid hormone is important for cell metabolism. So severely advanced cases of hypothyroidism can slow down metabolism and affect oxygen use in your body. This can have a negative impact on nearly all bodily processes and body systems. As a result, myxedema can lead to: decreased drug metabolism leading to overdosing of medications pregnancy issues, including , , stillbirth, and birth defects Treatment for hypothyroidism involves taking a synthetic version of the T4 hormone known as levothyroxine (Levothroid, Levoxyl). Once T4 hormone levels are restored, symptoms become more manageable, though this may take several weeks. You’ll likely have to remain on this medication for the rest of your life. Myxedema crisis is considered a medical emergency and requires immediate attention. Those undergoing a myxedema crisis need to be treated in an ICU. Their heart and breathing are continually monitored. Along with thyroid hormone replacement, steroid treatments and other medications may be needed. Without a rapid diagnosis, myxedema crisis is often fatal. The mortality rates may be as high as even with treatment. Elderly people are at a higher risk of having a poor outcome. If not treated, advanced hypothyroidism can lead to severe complications and even death. The outlook for myxedema is good if you receive thyroid replacement therapy. However, you must continue treatment for the rest of your life. If hypothyroidism is well-controlled, it won’t shorten your life span. — — Standard treatment for hypothyroidism includes oral medication, but there are natural therapies too.

61a14556-4f28-4175-a225-28a50c0d3d39,"— — A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test measures the amount of TSH in the blood. TSH is produced by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of your brain. It’s responsible for regulating the amount of hormones released by the thyroid. The thyroid is small, butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck. It’s an important gland that creates three primary hormones: The thyroid controls numerous different bodily functions, including metabolism and growth, through the release of these three hormones. Your thyroid will produce more hormones if your pituitary gland produces more TSH. In this way, the two glands work together to make sure the right amount of thyroid hormones is produced. However, when this system is disrupted, your thyroid can produce either too many or too few hormones. A TSH test is often performed to determine the underlying cause of abnormal thyroid hormone levels. It’s also used to screen for an underactive or overactive thyroid gland. By measuring the level of TSH in the blood, your doctor can determine how well the thyroid is working. Why is a thyroid-stimulating hormone test performed? Your doctor may order a TSH test if you’re experiencing symptoms of a thyroid disorder. Thyroid diseases can be categorized as either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. is a condition in which the thyroid produces too few hormones, causing metabolism to slow down. The symptoms of hypothyroidism include , weakness, and . The following are some of the most common causes of hypothyroidism: This is an that causes the body to attack its own thyroid cells. As a result, the thyroid is unable to produce a sufficient amount of hormones. The condition doesn’t always cause symptoms, so it can progress over several years before it causes noticeable damage. This is an inflammation of the thyroid gland. It’s often caused by a viral infection or an autoimmune disorder, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This condition interferes with thyroid hormone production and eventually leads to hypothyroidism. This is a temporary form of thyroiditis that may develop in some people after childbirth. The thyroid uses iodine to produce hormones. An iodine deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism. It’s extremely rare in the United States due to the widespread use of iodized salt. However, it’s more common in other regions of the world. is a condition in which the thyroid produces too many hormones, causing the metabolism to speed up. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include increased appetite, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. The following are some of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism: This is a in which the thyroid becomes larger and produces an excessive amount of hormones. The condition shares many of the same symptoms as hyperthyroidism and often contributes to the development of hyperthyroidism. It eventually leads to hypothyroidism, but in the short term, it can also trigger hyperthyroidism. This may occur when the inflammation causes the thyroid to produce too many hormones and release them all at once. Having too much iodine in the body can cause the thyroid to become overactive. This typically occurs as a result of continuously using medications that contain iodine. These medicines include some cough syrups as well as amiodarone, which is used to treat heart arrhythmias. These are that sometimes form on the thyroid. When these lumps begin to increase in size, they may become overactive and the thyroid may start producing too many hormones. How do I prepare for a thyroid-stimulating hormone test? The TSH test doesn’t require any special preparation. However, it’s important to tell your doctor if you’re taking medications that might interfere with the accuracy of the TSH measurement. Some medications that could interfere with a TSH test are: You may need to avoid using these drugs before the test. However, don’t stop taking your medications unless your doctor tells you to do so. How is a thyroid-stimulating hormone test performed? A TSH test involves taking a sample of blood. The blood is typically drawn from a vein that’s inside the inner elbow. A healthcare provider will perform the following procedure: First, they’ll clean the area with an antiseptic or other sterilizing solution. They’ll then tie an elastic band around your arm to make the veins swell with blood. Once they find a vein, they’ll insert a needle into the vein to draw blood. The blood will be collected in a small tube or vial attached to the needle. After they draw enough blood, they’ll remove the needle and cover the puncture site with a bandage to stop any bleeding. The entire procedure should only take a few minutes to complete. The blood sample will be sent to a lab for analysis. Once your doctor receives the test results, they’ll schedule an appointment with you to discuss the results and explain what they may mean. What do the results of a thyroid-stimulating hormone test mean? The normal range of TSH levels is 0.4 to 4.0 milli-international units per liter. If you’re already being treated for a thyroid disorder, the normal range is 0.5 to 3.0 milli-international units per liter. A value above the normal range usually indicates that the thyroid is underactive. This indicates hypothyroidism. When the thyroid isn’t producing enough hormones, the pituitary gland releases more TSH to try to stimulate it. A value below the normal range means that the thyroid is overactive. This indicates hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid is producing too many hormones, the pituitary gland releases less TSH. Depending on the results, your doctor may want to perform additional tests to confirm the diagnosis. — — Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI) Level Test A test to measure the level of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) in your blood is available.

Weight loss, rapid heart rate, and heat sensitivity are likely symptoms of... The definition of hyperthyroidism is an overactive thyroid gland. As a result, the thyroid gland produces more hormones than the body needs. These high levels of thyroid hormone can lead to weight loss, increased heart rate, and heat intolerance. An abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland is called a goiter. Goiter is a non-specific term for enlargement of the thyroid gland. Goiter can be a normal finding or an indicator of thyroid dysfunction. Goiter has become much less common since the widespread use of iodized salt over the past century. Symptoms such as very high body temperature, rapid heartbeat, and shortness of breath describe: Thyroid storm is a rare medical emergency and requires hospitalization to stabilize the patient. Thyroid storm generally occurs in the context of undiagnosed hyperthyroidism, after several weeks or months of progressively worsening symptoms unrecognized by the affected person or family members until the thyroid storm occurs. Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, is much more common than hyperthyroidism. Failure of the thyroid to form is the most common cause of hypothyroidism present at birth (congenital hypothyroidism). In older children and adults, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is when the body's white blood cells silently destroy the thyroid in error (called autoimmune thyroiditis). Proper thyroid function is required to maintain normal weight. If you significantly gain or lose weight unintentionally as an adult (for example, more than 10 pounds in 6 months), consult your health-care professional. Thyroid disorders are sometimes mistaken for which disease or condition? In some women, symptoms related to thyroid disorders may be mistaken for those of menopause. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism like menstrual changes or lack of menstruation (amenorrhea), mood swings, hot flashes, and insomnia may be mistaken for menopause symptoms. In addition, women are more likely than men to experience thyroid disorders. Some investigators believe that immune system changes during pregnancy and delivery, may contribute to the higher risk of autoimmune disorders in adult women. Once over the age of 35, thyroid function screening should take place every 5 years. Subtle thyroid disease can be detected by a blood test. Thyroid disease becomes more common with normal aging. Additional risk factors for thyroid disorders include exposure to certain kinds of radiation (for example, radiation therapy for cancer), brain or neck surgery, major head injury, and specific genetic conditions (as examples, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, type 1 diabetes, lupus, etc.). All adults older than 35 should be screened for thyroid disease every 5 years by simple blood tests. If there is a problem detected, you may see an endocrinologist, a specialist who treats individuals with hormone problems and endocrine gland disorders. In most people, one radioactive iodine treatment will cure hyperthyroidism. Graves's hyperthyroidism can be treated with medication (methimazole) to suppress the thyroid, radioactive iodine to destroy the thyroid, or surgery to remove the thyroid (called thyroidectomy). The risks, potential benefits, and timing of each approach should be discussed with your endocrinologist or health-care professional based on your specific circumstances. Pediatric patients (younger than 18) with Graves' hyperthyroidism may enter remission with medication alone, thereby avoiding the risks and inconvenience of radioiodine or surgery. However, most adults with Graves' do not respond with medication alone. Radioiodine is preferred as initial therapy for Graves' disease in adults. Permanent hypothyroidism should be expected after radioiodine or thyroidectomy, and hypothyroidism can be conveniently treated with once daily dosing of a small thyroid hormone replacement pill. 123RF Stock Photos/p> The Johns Hopkins University.

8ad25758-e388-491f-8974-b6f2a4680d38,"Still unsure: Hi everyone, I posted a while back... - Thyroid UK Hi everyone, I posted a while back about possible undiagnosed Hypothyroidism and had some really helpful and interesting advice (thanks again). However I am still continuing to have many persistent symptoms, which I suspect could be related to a Hypothyroidism, but then again have my doubts - this is mainly because I tend to lose weight really easily and quickly (but also gain easily). My main symptoms that have been ongoing for many years are: More recently, ectopics (diagnosed by cardio pulmonary exercise test) I don't have dry skin or as mentioned before, difficulty losing weight. My B12 is within normal range, but my iron and calcium levels are sometimes low. TSH and T4 always come back as 'normal'. I would appreciate any advice in relation to Thyroid disorders and what type mine could relate to. Also is it possible to be Hypothyroid and not have difficulty losing weight? These were my last Thyroid blood test results: Serum TSH 1.15 ml (normal range 0.34 - 5.6) and T4 level 9.30 pmol (7.5 - 21.1). As expected, GP said they were 'normal', but to me they look on the low end of normal. Being hypothyroid - unexplained weight gain plus heart playing up could very well be hypo. You can also tick off other symptoms you may have:- If you have thyroid antibodies - (you should have a check) then you'd have an Autoimmunr Thyroid Disease called Hashimoto's or hashi's but treatment is the same. Going gluten-free can help reduce the antibodies as they attack the gland and wax and wane until hypothyroid. Always get a print-out of your blood results with the ranges for your own records and post if you have a query. It is not enough for B12 or any other vitamin/mineral to be 'in range' - they all have to be at an optimum (near the top). All blood tests have to be at the earliest, make advance appointments, fasting (you can drink water) and allow a gap of 24 hours between last dose of levo and test and take afterwards. Hi Shaws, thank you for all the info. I had been looking into private blood tests for Thyroid - as I understand from many posts on this forum, Medichecks and Blue Horizon are the main choices. My GP (as I'm sure many others do) only test for TSH and T4 and if those are within 'normal' range, then you're fine! Would the GP take private blood test results into account? Also, is a pinprick test as reliable as venous collection? Not sure whether to opt for the d.i.y one or go to a clinic. There are over 300 known symptoms of hypo. But, you don't have to have them all to qualify. Some hypos put on weight, some lose it, some just stay the same. Weight-gain or loss is not something to base a diagnosis on. The main reason for being hypo is autoimmune thyroiditis - aka Hashi's. To know if you have that, you test for antibodies - TPO and Tg antibodies. However, antibodies levels are not always reliable. If they are high, then we know you have Hashi's. But, if they are low it doesn't prove anything, because antibodies fluctuate, and could be high at a time when you don't have a blood test. Also, some people with Hashi's never develop high antibodies, and are diagnosed by ultrasound when some damage starts showing. Another cause, less common, is Central hypo, when the problem lies with the pituitary (Secondary hypo) or the hypothalamus (Tertiary hypo), rather than the thyroid itself (Primary hypo). With CH, your Frees will be low but so will your TSH, because the pituitary cannot secrete enough TSH to stimulate the thyroid to make more hormone. This can be cause by a tumour or a bang to the head of some kind. But, there are many other causes of hypo - genetics - it runs in families - endocrine disrupters in the air or our water, or cosmetics or cleaning products; whiplash in a car accident… It's often impossible to know what caused your hypo. And, you cannot count on blood tests to diagnose you, because 'normal' just means 'in-range'. However, the ranges are mostly far too wide, so you could be 'in-range' but still hypo. Hi Greygoose, thanks for all the info. I was surprised to learn there are over 300 Hypo symptoms! Makes you wonder how many of your own could be thyroid related. With regards to CH, I did have a period of epileptic seizures in my early teens - wonder if it had a lasting effect on my pituitary gland? I had a full neck ultrasound about 3 years ago (for a suspected swollen lymph node), but all turned out ok. My question is, is it possible to have had hypo symptoms for many (over 20) years, yet always have a supposedly 'normal' blood result? I'm at that stage where I actually wish my results would come back out of range, then at least my GP would take that into account! Yes, it is. It's something that creeps up on us slowly, and hypo symptoms begin long before hypo shows up in the blood test results. Plus, it depends what is meant by 'normal'. When a doctor says 'normal', all he means is 'in-range'. But, most ranges are too wide, so it's not possible for a result at the top and a result at the bottom to both be 'normal'. But, doctors don't know enough about thyroid to understand that. I'm afraid I don't know about any link between epilepsy and the pituitary, but it's a lead worth pursuing, I would have thought. all the same but tsh lower. Reverse t3 is 11.5 and range is 9-27ng/dl.

Others, like Graves’ disease, get worse over time without treatment. The complications of Graves’ disease can be life-threatening and affect your long-term quality of life. Early diagnosis and treatment of symptoms improve the long-term outlook. Answers represent the opinions of our medical experts.

d6fc8406-0037-4830-bb14-2d186ea16cb8,"The thyroid gland produces two related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which play a critical role in thermogenic and metabolic homeostasis. T3 and T4 are normally synthesized and released in response to a combined hypothalamic pituitary signal mediated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary and thyrotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. There is a negative feedback from thyroid hormone concentration, primarily T3, to TSH production causing total T4, total T3, free T4, and free T3 concentrations to move in opposition to TSH concentration. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is functionally inadequate. Causes of hypothyroidism include autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, atrophic thyroiditis, and postpartum thyroiditis; iodine deficiency, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in underdeveloped areas; congenital defects; medications or treatments that can result in hypothyroidism; central hypothyroidism in which the thyroid is not stimulated by the pituitary or hypothalamus; and infiltrative processes that damage the thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamus. These different causes of hypothyroidism are often interrelated. Usually the exact cause of the hypothyroidism cannot be definitively determined. Drug-induced hypothyroidism is an under active thyroid gland caused by certain medications. The medications that can cause hypothyroidism may be drugs normally used to treat hyperthyroidism or that are related to thyroid function and a group of nonthyroid related drugs. The drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism or are related to thyroid function that can result in drug-induced hypothyroidism are propylthiouracil, radioactive iodine, potassium iodide, and methimazole. Iodides, in general, alter thyroid function. Total T3 and total T4 are 3 and 4 iodinated tyrosines. Even iodide containing solutions used for sterilization or iodides used in dyes and contrast media can cause hypothyroidism. Iodide can also causes hyperthyroidism. The group of drugs not used to treat thyroid dysfunction, which can result in drug-induced hypothyroidism includes amiodarone, nitroprusside, sulfonylureas, thalidomide, interleukin, lithium, perchlorate, and interferon-alpha therapy. Drug-induced hypothyroidism presents with the same signs and symptoms as are seen with other hypothyroid conditions (i.e., fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, depression, and dry skin). What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? TSH and free T4 are the usual laboratory diagnostic tools in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism due to drug-induced hypothyroidism, free T4 will be decreased and TSH will be increased in an effort to provide the body with adequate thyroid hormones. T3 is not as reliable in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. However, measuring TSH, free T4, or other analytes will not identify the cause of the hypothyroidism as drug induced. In a patient with stable thyroid status, TSH is the more sensitive test in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, since the relationship between TSH and free T4 is log/linear. Intraindividual variation for free T4 is quite small, so any small deficiency of free T4 will be sensed by the anterior pituitary relative to the individual’s set point and cause an amplified, inverse response in TSH. In a patient with unstable thyroid status, free T4 is the more reliable indicator. Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? Interferences may obscure the diagnosis of drug-induced hypothyroidism or complicate the monitoring of the effectiveness of thyroid replacement therapy. Most thyroid testing today is performed by either immunoassay in which labeled and unlabeled ligands compete for a limited number of antibody sites, or immunometric assays in which an antibody is bound to a solid surface rather than an antibody. Cross reactivity of autoantibodies or heterophilic antibodies can affect diagnostic accuracy of competitive binding based tests. The term heterophilic antibodies is often loosely applied to relatively weak antibodies with multiple activity sites, known as autoantibodies, seen in auto immune disorders; broadly reactive antibodies induced by infections or exposure to therapy containing monoclonal mouse antibodies (HAMA); or human anti-animal immunoglobulins produced against well defined, specific antigens following exposure to therapeutic agents containing animal antigen or by coincidental immunization through exposure to animal antigens. The latter, Human Anti-Animal Antibodies (HAAA), are strong reactors. HAMA and HAAA affect immunometric assays more than simple competitive immunoassays. In immunometric assays, HAMA and HAAA can form a bridge between the capture and signal antibodies. Autoantibodies and heterophilic antibody interferences can sometimes be detected by simply using a different manufacturer’s method employing a slightly different antibody. Tests in which dilutions are acceptable, such as total T4, total T3, or TSH, but not free T4 or free T3, may be checked for linearity of response to help identify heterophilic antibody interference. Most circulating thyroid hormones are bound to protein. Only the hormone that is free is biologically active. Variations in binding protein will cause variations in concentrations of total hormones. In general, serum TSH is less affected by binding issues than T3 and T4, and T4 is bound more tightly than T3. T3 and T4 circulate in the body bound to thyroid binding globulin (TBG); transthyretin, formally known as thyroixine binding prealbumin; and serum albumin. Physiological shifts toward greater total hormone binding will decrease available free hormone. Theoretically, free T3 and free T4 are not affected analytically by binding. In reality, all of the free methods are binding dependent to varying degrees. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, aspirin, and furosimide compete with thyroid hormone for protein binding sites and, thus, acutely increase free hormone and reduce total hormones. Eventually, a normal equilibrium is reestablished where free levels normalize at the expense of total levels. Heparin stimulates lipoprotein lipase, liberating free fatty acids, which inhibit total T4 protein binding and elevate free T4. Free fatty acids are known to affect some methods. Estrogens increase TBG increasing total thyroid hormones. There are no confirmatory tests for drug-induced hypothyroidism, as drug-induced hypothyroidism cannot be differentiated from other hypothyroidisms, other than by implication. If a drug known to cause drug-induced hypothyroidism is present and/or if the hypothyroidism is corrected with the removal of the implicated drug, then the hypothyroidism is presumed drug induced. Otherwise, it has been suggested that the best confirmation of hypothyroidism, in general, is an evaluation of response to a trial administration of thyroxine supplement in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? Patients with positive thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) are at an increased risk of developing drug-induced hypothyroidism with several of the nonthyroid related drugs. Patients with positive TPOAbs are at particular risk when a preexisitng Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is present or when taking amiodarone. Amiodarone is an iodine containing antiarrhythmic. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry has specific guidelines for patients taking amiodarone. These guidelines recommend: if TSH is abnormal, a complete physical examination with baseline TSH, TPOAb, free T4, and free T3 should be undertaken prior to amiodarone therapy initiation thyroid status should be monitored every 6 months via TSH after amiodarone initiation. TPOAb is a risk factor for developing drug-induced hypothyroidism at any time during amiodarone therapy Amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism (AIH) can also occur. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may include brittle fingernails, coarsening and thinning of hair, puffy eyes, weakness, and constipation. Symptoms expressing themselves later in the course of the disease are hoarseness; menstrual disorders; puffy hands, face, and feet; thickening of the skin; thinning of eyebrows; increased cholesterol levels; muscle and/or joint aches and stiffness; slowed speech; and decreased hearing. Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? A combination of high free T4 and high TSH may be an indication of therapeutic noncompliance. Acute ingestion of missed levothyroxine (L-T4) just prior to a clinic visit will raise the free T4 but fail to normalize the TSH because of a “lag effect.” Free T4 is the short-term indicator, whereas TSH is a long-term indicator. Since TSH is the long-term indicator, it is not influenced by time of L-T4 ingestion. When testing free T4, the daily dose of L-T4 should be withheld until after sampling, as free T4 is significantly increased above baseline for up to 9 hours after ingesting L-T4. Ideally, L-T4 should be taken prior to eating, at the same time each day, and at least 4 hours apart from other medications. Many medications, and even vitamins and minerals, can influence L-T4 absorption. L-T4 should not be taken with iron supplements. Patients should not switch from brand to brand of L-T4, and prescriptions should not be written generically, as doing so will allow brand to brand switches. Although stated concentrations of L-T4 may be the same, slight variations exist between pharmaceutical manufacturers in terms of bioavailability. Medication storage recommendations should be scrupulously followed. Medication should be stored away from humidity, light, and increased temperatures. When ordering medication, it is best to avoid the summer for shipping. TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading during transition periods of unstable thyroid function. Often, these transition periods occur in the early phase of treating hyper- or hypothyroidism or changing the L-T4 dose. It takes 6-12 weeks for pituitary TSH secretion to reequilibrate to the new thyroid hormone status. Similar periods of unstable thyroid status may occur following an episode of thyroiditis. TSH or free T4 levels may be diagnostically misleading in cases of abnormalities in hypothalamic or pituitary function in which the usual negative feedback is not seen and TSH may remain within normal ranges. Free T4 and TSH have reduced specificity in hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness. Most hospitalized patients have low serum total T3 and free T3. These abnormalities are seen with both acute and chronic nonthyroid illness and are thought to be the malfunction of central inhibition of hypothalamic releasing hormone. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry guidelines for testing of hospitalized patients with nonthyroid illness recommendations indicate: Acute or chronic nonthyroid illness has complex effects on thyroid function testing. Whenever possible, diagnostic testing should be deferred until the illness has resolved, except in cases in which there is a suggestion of presence of thyroid dysfunction. Physicians should be aware that some thyroid tests are inherently not interpretable in severely ill patients or patients receiving multiple medications. TSH in the absence of dopamine or glucocorticoid therapy is the more reliable test. TSH testing in the hospitalized patient should have a functional sensitivity of less than 0.02 mIU/L; otherwise, sick, hyperthyroid patients with profoundly low TSH cannot be differentiated from patients with mild transient TSH suppression caused by nonthyroid illness. An abnormal free T4 in the presence of serious somatic disease is unreliable. In hospitalized patients, abnormal free T4 testing should reflex to total T4. If both free T4 and total T4 are abnormal in the same direction, a thyroid condition may exist. Discordant free T4 and total T4 abnormalities are more likely the result of illness, medication, or a testing artifact. Total T4 abnormalities should be considered in conjunction with the severity of the patient illness. A low T4 in patients not in intensive care is suspicious of hypothyroidism, since low total T4 levels in nonthyroid illness in hospitalized patients are most often seen in sepsis. If a low total T4 is not associated with an elevated TSH and the patient is not profoundly sick, hypothyroidism secondary to pituitary or hypothalamic deficiency should be considered. Reverse T3 formed by the loss of an iodine group from T4 where the position of the iodine atoms on the aromatic ring is reversed is rarely helpful in the hospital setting, because paradoxically normal or low values can result from impaired renal function and low binding protein concentrations. During pregnancy, estrogens increase TBG to 2 or 3 times prepregnancy levels. This shifts binding such that total T3 and total T4 are approximately 1.5 times nonpregnant levels at 16 weeks gestation. TSH is also altered during pregnancy. TSH is decreased in the first trimester because of the thyroid stimulating activity of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). The decline in TSH is associated with a modest increase in free T4 from the increased TBG. In approximately 2% of pregnancies, the increase in free T4 leads to a condition known as gestational transient thyrotoxicosis. This condition may be associated with hyperemesis. In the second and third trimester, free hormone levels decrease 20-40% below reference ranges. Pregnant patients receiving L-T4 replacement may require increased dose to maintain a normal TSH and free T4. TSH has a very short half-life of 60 minutes and is subject to circadian and diurnal variation peaking at night and reaching a nadir between 10 AM and 4 PM. T4 has a much longer half-life of 7 days. It should be noted that there is a continuous decrease in the TSH/free T4 ratio from the middle of gestation through completion of puberty. In adulthood, TSH increases in the elderly. Age related reference ranges, or at least ratio adjusted reference ranges, should be used for these analytes. For a change in value to have clinical significance, the difference should take into consideration analytical and biological variabilities. The magnitude of difference in thyroid testing values reflecting a clinical significance when monitoring a patient’s response to therapy are: Copyright © 2017, 2013 Decision Support in Medicine, LLC.

Medical Author: Stephanie L Lee, MD, PhD, FACE Medical Editor: Medical Editor: What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism (Low Thyroid Hormone Level)? What Are Signs and Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism (Overactive Thyroid)? What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Thyroid Nodules and Goiter? When Should You See a Doctor for Thyroid Problems? What Are the Treatments and Medications for Thyroid Problems? What Are The Supplements and Remedies for Thyroid Disease? The thyroid gland is located on the front part of the neck below the thyroid cartilage (). The gland produces thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolic rate (how fast calories are consumed to produce energy). Thyroid hormones are important in regulating body energy, body temperature, the body's use of other hormones and , and the growth and maturation of body tissues. Diseases of the thyroid gland can result in either production of too much (overactive thyroid disease or ), too little (underactive thyroid disease or ) , , and/or . Thyroid problems are much more common in women than in men. The process of hormone synthesis begins in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). The TRH travels through the venous plexus located in the pituitary stalk to the , also in the brain. In response, the pituitary gland then releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, also called thyrotropin) into the blood. The TSH travels to the thyroid gland and stimulates the thyroid to produce the two thyroid hormones, L-thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). The thyroid gland also needs adequate amounts of dietary iodine to be able to produce T4 and T3, the molecules of which contain four and three atoms of iodine, respectively. To prevent the overproduction or underproduction of thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland senses how much hormone is in the blood and adjust the production of hormones accordingly. For example, when there is too much thyroid hormone in the blood, TRH and TSH production are both decreased. The sum effect of this is to decrease the amount of TSH released from the pituitary gland and to reduce production of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland to restore the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood to normal. Defects in these regulatory pathways rarely may result in hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid problem) or (overactive thyroid problem). The most common cause of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism occurs due to problems within the thyroid and not the regulatory system. Thyroid goiter is any enlargement of the thyroid that can occur with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism but also with and (cancerous) nodules. Worldwide, the most common cause of goiter is iodine deficiency. Although it used to be very common in the U.S., it is now less common with the use of iodized salt. Multiple nodules in the thyroid are very common, but only about 5% of the nodules are a . Thyroid rates have been increasing steadily by about 6% every year for more than 20 years. It is one of the few cancers whose rate is increasing and whose very low rate of mortality is also rising with time. Although exposure as a child can increase the risk of thyroid , we do not know why the overall rate has been increasing. Thyroid is diagnosed after a thyroid exam and a needle aspiration biopsy of the nodule. Newly diagnosed hypothyroidism in is rare because most women with untreated hypothyroidism do not ovulate or produce mature eggs in a regular manner, which makes it difficult for them to conceive. It is a difficult new diagnosis to make based on clinical observation. The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism (, poor attention span, weight gain, numbness, and tingling of the hands or ) are also prominent symptoms of a normal pregnancy. Undiagnosed increases the chance of stillbirth or growth retardation of the fetus. It also increases the chance that the mother may experience complications of pregnancy such as , , and placental abruption. Probably the largest group of women who will have hypothyroidism during pregnancy are those who are currently on thyroid hormone replacement. The ideal thyroxine replacement dose (for example, [, , , ]) may rise by 25% to 50% during pregnancy. It is important to have regular checks of T4 and TSH blood levels as soon as pregnancy is confirmed; and frequently through the first 20 weeks of pregnancy to make sure the woman is taking the correct medication dose. It is recommended that the levothyroxine dose be adjusted to keep the TSH level < 2.5 mIU/L during the of pregnancy and < 3 mIU/L during the last two of pregnancy. Usually the increase in thyroid hormone needed during pregnancy disappears after the delivery of the baby and the pre-pregnancy dose of levothyroxine can be resumed immediately post-partum. Newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism occurs in about 1 in 2,000 pregnancies. accounts for 95% of cases of hyperthyroidism newly diagnosed during pregnancy. As with hypothyroidism, many symptoms of mild hyperthyroidism mimic those of normal pregnancy. However, anyone experiencing symptoms such as significant , , increased , or persistently fast heart rate should have blood tests to evaluate whether hyperthyroidism is present. Mild or subclinical hyperthyroidism defined as a lower than normal TSH and normal Free T4 level is not dangerous to the mother or baby and does not need to treated. Thyroid tests should be checked again in 4 weeks. However, untreated moderate to severe hyperthyroidism does cause fetal and maternal complications including poor weight gain and tachycardia (an abnormally fast heart rate). There are new recommendations for the treatment of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is used during the first trimester to block the synthesis of thyroid hormone and to bring thyroid hormone levels to borderline or slightly higher than normal levels. Propylthiouracil has a lower risk of some rare fetal malformations compared to () and is preferred during the critical fetal developmental period during the first trimester. Propylthiouracil is not recommended during the remainder or pregnancy because of the risk of serious . During the second and , propylthiouracil should be switched to methimazole. The incidence rate of side effects for each medication is not increased in pregnancy. Iodine will cross the placenta, so its use in either a thyroid scan or in treatment with radioactive iodine is prohibited in pregnancy. One positive note for women with hyperthyroidism is that those with Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis may have improvement in their symptoms as the pregnancy progesses. It is common for a goiter to enlarge slightly during pregnancy. It is more common when the mother lives in an area of iodine deficiency. In the United States, the average intake of iodine is adequate but can be low if someone avoids consumption of milk, eggs, and iodized salt. Not all contain iodine, but it is recommended that only prenatal vitamins that contain iodine should be used during pregnancy. If a is found during pregnancy, new recommendations are not to wait until the end of pregnancy, but to arrange for an evaluation and possible biopsy as soon as possible. Some women may have temporary thyroiditis called postpartum subacute thyroiditis that usually occurs within 3 to 6 months after giving birth. It also may occur after . The classic clinical picture is a woman who will first have symptoms of hyperthyroidism with , , and , followed by hypothyroidism with , , and weight gain, culminating in normal thyroid function in 90% of women of experience this condition. Women with type I have a 25% risk of developing postpartum thyroid dysfunction. Consult your doctor if you have symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism after pregnancy or miscarriage. Treatment of hyperthyroidism by radioactive destruction of thyroid tissue or surgical removal of thyroid tissue can result in hypothyroidism. These may be present in people who have , , , chronic hepatitis, or Sjogren's syndrome. These antibodies may cause decreased production of thyroid hormones because of thyroid destruction. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in an adult, occurs because of autoimmune destruction of the thyroid results in a decreased production of thyroid hormone and an increased amount of TSH. Congenital defects in the production of thyroid hormone: Hypothyroidism can be present from birth. This is commonly discovered early with nationwide screening for this disease. When one of the steps in thyroid hormone synthesis is defective, the production of thyroid hormone is reduced, with a subsequent increase in TSH. The increased TSH results in a goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland itself that can be seen as an obvious swelling in the front of the neck). If the metabolic block is severe, thyroid hormone levels are low begining at birth, resulting in mental retardation, goiter, and (hypothyroid cretinsim). Some medications, particularly (, ), may cause a drug-induced hypothyroidism. This autoimmune thyroid condition results from abnormal stimulation of the thyroid gland by a material in the blood termed the thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI). TSI overstimulates the thyroid causing a goiter. It also causes Grave's eye disease, including a ""bug-eyed"" look and ""frightened stare."" This can progress to severe or eye muscle weakness causing tearing and double vision. In severe cases, the swelling of the eye and surrounding tissue can cause loss of vision. It also causes raised, thickened skin over the shins or tops of the feet. This occurs when a nodule in the thyroid gland produces thyroid hormones all by itself, without regard to the degree of TSH stimulation. It usually occurs in people with a long-standing goiter, usually in the elderly. Toxic multinodular goiter is different from Graves' disease because of the general lack of eye complications and less severe signs of hyperthyroidism. This temporary inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland includes such conditions as de Quervain's thyroiditis or postpartum subacute thyroiditis. In these conditions, there may be periods of increased thyroid hormone release due to the inflammation, causing excess thyroid hormone to be released. After the all the thyroid hormone has leaked out of the damaged tissue, a temporary hypothyroid period begins and can last 2-4 months. Usually 90% of people with this condition will go back to normal thyroid function without treatment. This of the pituitary gland causes independent TSH production leading to overstimulation of the thyroid gland. This is most commonly caused the the  heart medication (). Most of the time thyroid nodules and thyroid goiters do not cause any symptoms. Some goiters are found because of the thyroid hormone overproduction or underproduction from the thyroid gland. Some nodules are found because a patient or doctor sees or feels a lump in the neck. If the goiter becomes very large, the person may feel a pressure in the front of the neck with swallowing hard or firm foods such as bread crusts or meat. This pressure may also cause a small dry . It is rare that the thyroid can become large enough to completely block swallowing or breathing. This is a condition in which multiple nodules form in the thyroid. There are only two conditions that cause thyroid enlargement and nodules: 1) external radiation exposure, or 2) iodine deficiency. Often several members of a family. will have an enlarged goiter as the condition can be inherited There are several types of thyroid cancer. The most common type, papillary thyroid , occurs in more than 85% of cases. This type of cancer can be caused by radiation exposure as a child or adolescent, including therapeutic radiation used in the treatment of cancers or in accidents such as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Most of the time, the reason for developing thyroid cancer is unknown. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism (Low Thyroid Hormone Level)? Symptoms of hypothyroidism in can include: (yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes) (pain at the wrists and numbness of the hands) Irregular menstrual periods or lack of menstrual periods What Are Signs and Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism (Overactive Thyroid)? Feeling excessively hot in normal or cold temperatures Losing weight despite normal or increased appetite becomes scant, or ceases altogether Symptoms of hyperthyroidism in the may cause: Worsening of () in persons with Worsening of shortness of breath in persons with Muscle weakness, especially in the shoulders and thighs What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Thyroid Nodules and Goiter? The only sign of goiter or nodule is an enlargement in the lower part of the front part of the neck. This enlargement is often not painful or bothersome. When the nodule or goiter becomes large, there can be pressure on the surrounding normal structures in the neck including the (swallowing tube), trachea (breathing tube) and the blood vessels that bring blood to and from the head. A common symptom is feeling a constant pressure in the front of the neck that is worse when the head is tilted down. This pressure on the breathing tube (trachea) may cause a small, dry that can be constant and worsens when lying down. The pressure on the swallowing tube (esophagus) may be noticed as difficulty in swallowing large pills or dry food such as bread and rice with the food ""getting stuck"" in the lower part of the front of the neck. Rarely, this pressure can damage the nerve that controls the voice box, causing of the voice. When Should You See a Doctor for Thyroid Problems? The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism typically develop slowly over a period of weeks to months. If an individual has prolonged symptoms or signs of either condition, call a doctor to be evaluated. Untreated hypothyroidism may have severe effects on the brain as well as cause intestinal obstruction and inability of the heart to beat effectively. An infection, exposure to cold, , and certain medications may often cause a worsening of hypothyroidism. Seek immediate attention at a hospital's emergency department if you have these signs and symptoms associated with thyroid problems. Severe hyperthyroidism, called thyrotoxic crisis (), may be life-threatening because of its effects on the heart and brain. It often occurs in people who are untreated or are receiving inadequate treatment for thyroid problems. A severe infection can also cause a thyrotoxic crisis. Seek immediate attention at a hospital's emergency department if you have these signs and symptoms associated with thyroid problems. Disorientation (person has no knowledge of the date or location) : Seek immediate attention at a hospital's emergency department if you have these signs and symptoms associated with thyroid problems. Shortness of breath especially with stridor (a whistling sound in your neck when you breathe) Extreme pain in your thyroid gland that prevents you from swallowing Sudden enlargement of your thyroid gland, especially if associated with problems breathing or swallowing The medical history and physical exam are important parts of the evaluation for thyroid problems. The health care practitioner will focus on eye, skin, cardiac (heart), and neurologic findings. In most cases, this is the single most useful lab test in diagnosing thyroid disease. When there is an excess of thyroid hormone in the blood, as in hyperthyroidism, the TSH is low. When there is too little thyroid hormone, as in hypothyroidism, the TSH is high. T4 is one of the thyroid hormones. High T4 may indicate hyperthyroidism. Low T4 may indicate hypothyroidism. T3 is another one of the thyroid hormones. High T3 may indicate hyperthyroidism. Low T3 may indicate hypothyroidism. This antibody is present in Graves' disease. This antibody is present in Hashimoto's and Graves' disease. During this scan a small amount of radioactive iodine is swallowed or a similar material, 99m-technetium, is injected into the blood, and then an imaging study of the thyroid is taken that reveals localization of the radioactivity. Increased uptake of the radioactive material in the thyroid gland indicates hyperthyroidism, while decreased uptake is present in hypothyroidism. This test should not be performed on women who are . Thyroid ultrasound helps to determine the size and number as well as the different types of nodules in the thyroid gland. This exam can also detect if there are enlarged parathyroid glands or near the thyroid gland. During this procedure, a thin needle is inserted into the thyroid gland in order to get a sample of thyroid tissue, usually from a nodule. This test can be done in a health care practitioner's office without special preparations. It is recommended that the biopsy be performed with ultrasound guidance. The tissue is then observed under a microscope by a pathologist to look for any signs of cancer. A is occasionally used to look for the extent of a large goiter into the upper chest or to look for narrowing or displacement of the trachea (breathing tube) from the goiter. However, this is not a routine test for thyroid nodules or goiter. What Are the Treatments and Medications for Thyroid Problems? This class of medication works by blocking many of the body's responses to hyperthyroidism. It decreases tremor, nervousness, and agitation. It also reduces the fast heart rate. Beta blocker tablets are prescribed to a patient with mild to moderate symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and as an IV preparation to the person with the severe form of hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxic crisis). Although beta blockers block the responses to hyperthyroidism, it does not treat the underlying cause. This antithyroid drug works by blocking thyroid hormone synthesis. It takes several months after starting the medication for the full therapeutic effect to be achieved. The US FDA has issued a guidance that this drug should be used only during the first trimester of pregnancy, or if there is an intolerance to thimazole. Common mild side effects include an itchy . More rare, serious side effects include a decrease in , which can decrease the ability to fight off infection. Therefore, a high fever should prompt a call to the doctor. This is the preferred antithyroid drug in everyone except women in the first trimester of pregnancy for hyperthyroidism. This antithyroid drug also works by blocking thyroid hormone synthesis. It may take slightly longer than propylthiouracil to achieve its full effect. It has similar side effects as propylthiouracil. This medication works by inhibiting the release of thyroid hormone from the overfunctioning thyroid gland. It must be used in conjunction with an antithyroid drug because the iodine can be used to increase the amount of thyroid hormone produced and worsen the hyperthyroidism. Common side effects include and a metallic taste in the mouth. An endocrinologist or nuclear medicine specialist can treat overactive thyroid conditions with radioactive iodine swallow. This is generally a different type of radioactive iodine than used for diagnostic scans. This treatment takes several months to work by scarring down the thyroid gland, resulting in a smaller- sized gland, often accompanied by hypothyroidism. L-thyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl, Levothroid, Unithroid, Tirsosint): This medication is the mainstay of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in hypothyroidism. This is a synthetic form of thyroxine. This is exactly the same hormone that the thyroid makes. The body tissues convert it to the active product L-triiodothyronine. Side effects are rare, and it has an excellent safety record. Tirsosint is a new liquid form of levothyroxine in a gelcap that may be easier to absorb in the bloodstream. This is rarely used alone as thyroid hormone replacement, because it has a much shorter persistence in the blood than L-thyroxine. Its use can cause rapid increases in triiodothyronine concentration, which can be dangerous in the elderly and in people with cardiac disease. It may be used in combination with L-thyroxine for people who have poor symptomatic relief with L-thyroxine alone. This is dried and powdered pig thyroid gland. The hormone is not purified and the exact amount of T4 and T3 can be variable. This is not recommended as a thyroid hormone replacement. There is an excess of T3 in this preparation. If the thyroid function is abnormally high or low, then the treatments are as described above. If the thyroid function is normal with thyroid nodules, there are no good medical treatments to shrink the nodules and surgery is usually suggested. Many years ago it was standard of care to give levothyroxine to ""shrink"" nodules, but it was found after careful research that administration of thyroid hormone rarely shrinks large nodules. An emerging treatment of nontoxic goiters/nodules is radioactive iodine therapy. This therapy is used commonly in Europe and South America but is not yet commonly used in all patients in the United States. This treatment is considered when a patient has a large goiter and there are medical problems that prevent a surgical treatment. What Are The Supplements and Remedies for Thyroid Disease? It can be very dangerous to take for your thyroid condition without consulting a doctor. that contain large amounts of iodine such as seaweed can make thyroid hormone levels go very high if you have nodular goiter, or very low if you have a history of an autoimmune thyroid condition such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease. There is no scientific evidence that herbal supplements, poses, natural thyroid treatments, or natural thyroid remedies improve thyroid health and function. Dietary supplements are not regulated by any agency and therefore there is no quality control of these supplements. It is not recommended that any supplement be taken for thyroid health. Surgery for hyperthyroidism (), large thyroid nodules, or nontoxic goiters may involve removal of much of the thyroid tissue, leaving some intact to continue to produce thyroid hormone. Risks of this procedure include damage to the nerves that control the vocal cords, damage to the parathyroid glands (resulting in low calcium levels), which lie just behind the thyroid gland, and . Hypothyroidism may also occur, but occurs less frequently than with radioactive iodine treatment. Persistent hyperthyroidism may also occur. If so, the entire thyroid gland is removed. In general, in the hands of an experienced surgeon, this is considered an effective and relatively safe procedure. About 70% of patients who retain half of their thyroid gland will continue with normal thyroid function after the surgery. Those patients who have the entire thyroid removed must take thyroid hormone for the rest of their lives. Patients with thyroid cancer will need special treatments and scans with radioactive iodine. Most patients with thyroid cancer are managed by endocrinologists and not oncologists. Anyone diagnosed with Graves' disease should stop immediately because increases the risk of progression to Graves' eye disease. Follow the medication schedule prescribed by your health care professional. Ask your doctor or pharmacists what side effects the medications may cause. Also discuss with your doctor the kinds of symptoms that would prompt a call to the doctor or a visit to the emergency department. There is no known way to prevent hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. In the United States, iodine deficiency is rare, so there is no way to prevent goiter or thyroid nodules. It is not recommended that a person take extra iodine. Instead, there is plenty of iodine in an adult multiple supplement if it contains iodine. Read the ingredient label to make sure the vitamin contains iodine. Radiation will induce both benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Individuals should avoid excess radiation or unnecessary CT scans of the head and neck and use a ""thyroid shield"" when dental X-rays are performed. Most people with either hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and benign and malignant thyroid nodules, with proper diagnosis and treatment, can control their condition with no long-term effects and a normal life expectancy. However, those with undiagnosed disease may progress to hypothyroid coma or thyrotoxic crisis (), with death rates approaching 50%. Graves' eye disease has been treated with corticosteroid medication, radiotherapy, and surgery with varying success. Patients with thyroid cancer have a very low mortality rate (<5%) but the overall risk depends on age, type of thyroid cancer, and the extent of spread of the tumor. Endocrinologists will manage the evaluation and treatment of thyroid cancer, rather than an . Symptoms of hypothyroidism usually appear slowly over months or years.

4a55375a-b3e2-472b-addb-95bdee9c244d,"Hypothyroidism: Can it cause peripheral neuropathy? Can hypothyroidism cause peripheral neuropathy and, if so, how is it treated? Hypothyroidism — a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone — is an uncommon cause of peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy is damage to your peripheral nerves — the nerves that carry information to and from your brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and the rest of your body, such as your arms and legs. Peripheral neuropathy may be caused by severe, long-term, untreated hypothyroidism. Although the association between hypothyroidism and peripheral neuropathy isn't fully understood, it's known that hypothyroidism can cause fluid retention resulting in swollen tissues that exert pressure on peripheral nerves. One of the more common areas this occurs in is the wrists, because the nerve serving the hands goes through a ""tunnel"" of soft tissue, which can swell, pressing on the nerve, resulting in carpal tunnel syndrome. The vast majority of carpal tunnel syndrome cases are not due to hypothyroidism, but this would be the most likely area for this to occur with hypothyroidism. Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may include pain, a burning sensation, or numbness and tingling in the area affected by the nerve damage. It may also cause muscle weakness or loss of muscle control. See your doctor if you know or suspect you have hypothyroidism and you're having troubling or painful symptoms in your limbs. Treatment of peripheral neuropathy due to hypothyroidism is directed at managing the underlying hypothyroidism and treating the resulting symptoms.

0ae838ac-c5b0-45b4-8d92-b7bfa699e15e,"Find out what's misunderstood about this important metabolism-controlling gland. The thyroid gets a bad rap, blamed for everything from fatigue to weight gain. And while these are common symptoms of an , this important endocrine gland isn't always responsible for your negative physical symptoms. In fact, people throw around the word ""thyroid"" without understanding what exactly it does. Eat This, Not That! is here to clear things up. Your thyroid is the butterfly-shaped gland in your neck that releases two important hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine), which regulate your body temperature, metabolism, and how you digest food. It's also in charge of vital organs such as your heart, brain, liver, kidneys, and skin. Conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Graves disease, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis fall under the umbrella term of thyroid disease. Although an estimated 20 million Americans suffer from some kind of thyroid disease, the symptoms are hard to pin down and tend to mimic the common stressors of everyday life: fatigue, anxiety, or feeling too hot (or cold), to name a few. Since so much is still misunderstood about this metabolism-controlling body part, we're separating fact from fiction. Want to keep your thyroid functioning at its best? Check out the 25 Best Foods to Eat for Your Thyroid and Metabolism. Your thyroid may be a convenient scapegoat for noticeable weight gain; after all, it controls your metabolism, which affects how many calories you burn throughout the day — an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) means a slower metabolism, and therefore a slower rate at which your body can convert food into energy. But in reality, a slow metabolism is pretty rare. ""Although the thyroid does have a role in regulating metabolism, it is one variable in a very complicated network of hormones and neurological connections,"" explains Dr. Eduardo Grunvald, program director at UC San Diego's Weight Management Program. ""While there a minority of patients that will notice a significant weight gain with untreated hypothyroidism (and weight loss with treatment), most people have to address all the other factors that contribute to weight even when the thyroid is off."" Check out our to see what else could be the culprit. Other symptoms other than weight gain could also signal an issue with your thyroid: fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, and dry skin. If you're convinced you have a thyroid issue, make sure you visit a doctor to get a blood test. Myth: Sudden Weight Loss Means You Have an Overactive Thyroid On the flip side, an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or Graves' disease can manifest itself with symptoms of weight loss, but not always. Some people actually gain weight while their thyroid is overactive. Other symptoms of hyperthyroid include a fast heart rate, high body temperature, and difficulty sleeping. It's true that more women than men get thyroid disease, especially hypothyroidism. That's because it's an autoimmune disease, which is more common in women thanks to the presence of estrogen. But men can have thyroid problems, too. In fact, the symptoms men experience from an underactive thyroid include hair loss, constipation, fatigue, loss of sex drive, and sore muscles, among others. Myth: You Don't Need Medication to Control Your Thyroid If you have a thyroid disease, treating it is more complicated than swapping your potato chips for an apple. Sure, making will impact your thyroid, but it can't be treated with diet alone. If you've been diagnosed with a thyroid disease, make sure you check with your doctor to see what the best course of treatment is. Often times, it's a mix of medication, healthy diet, and exercise. Myth: You Can't Take Thyroid Medication During Pregnancy Pregnancy usually means giving up an exhaustive list of food and medicine for nine months: alcohol, sushi, caffeine, deli meat, aspirin, ibuprofen. Luckily, thyroid medication isn't one of them. Of course, get the go-ahead from your doctor before taking any medication while pregnant. Thyroid issues are usually associated with people of a certain age; after all, women over 60 have a 20 percent chance of having a problem with their gland. But it's not just a senior citizen's disease. It can happen to people of all ages: especially women after pregnancy, or in their late 30s when their hormones change. Even if you're young and still notice symptoms of thyroid issues (weight gain, fatigue, depression, change in body temperature, etc.), be sure you tell your doctor. Like we mentioned earlier, diet changes can definitely impact your thyroid for the better. But it's not a cure-all. Most thyroid disease, like Graves' disease and Hashimoto's, have a genetic component, so family history is your biggest trigger — not a diet rich in gluten. If you happen to have celiac disease as well as a thyroid issue, then, of course, banish the bread. Otherwise, thyroid disease is usually treated with medication prescribed by your doctor. Myth: A Lump in Your Neck is Probably Thyroid Disease Although a lump on your neck signal an enlarged thyroid or thyroid cancer, that's not always the case. It could be a swollen lymph node, which happens when you have a cold or a sore throat. Or it could be an enlarged cyst. Have your doctor check it out to be 100 percent sure. Myth: You Can Treat Thyroid Disease Yourself with Iodine It's true, your thyroid uses iodine (commonly found in table salt) to function, so getting enough of it is key to a working gland. And radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is sometimes used to treat overactive thyroid disorders or thyroid cancer. But in reality, most people get adequate amounts of iodine just in their daily diets. In fact, overdoing it on the iodine could actually cause more thyroid problems, like producing too much thyroid hormone in an attempt to process all the extra iodine. So don't go the DIY route and take iodine supplements on your own without consulting with your doctor first. Although a popular choice for plant-based protein, soy can activate your body's estrogen receptors, which may mess with your hormones. And if you're taking thyroid medication, soy could impair how it's being absorbed in the body. But this vegan protein doesn't need to be avoided entirely. Soy can be enjoyed in moderation—say, a few times a week at dinner to avoid interfering with morning medication.

0741c04e-c540-41bc-831f-bd1844a0838f,"The thyroid is a located at the front of your neck. It produces two hormones, , which regulate how the body uses energy. These hormones affect most organs and are vital to a wide range of physiological processes, such as breathing and heart rate, digestion, and body temperature. Too many or not enough of these hormones can have adverse effects, so balanced thyroid activity is needed to maintain proper health. Thyroid issues can lead to sleep problems, as well. Conversely, thyroid conditions like hypothyroidism (underactive) and hyperthyroidism (overactive) are considered risk factors for . Our bodies operate on a known as circadian rhythm, which is regulated by the master circadian clock located in a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) located in the hypothalamus. The SCN releases different hormones that help maintain balance in the body and control different bodily functions, including your sleep-wake cycle. One of these hormones, thyrotropin, stimulates the thyroid to trigger the release of thyroid hormones. If the thyroid is overactive or underactive, this can interfere with thyrotropin production and your overall circadian rhythm. The condition known as , or underactive thyroid, occurs when the thyroid does not produce enough hormones. According to current U.S. estimates, 1 in 20 people aged 12 and older have hypothyroidism. These patients are often treated with artificial thyroid hormones. , or overactive thyroid, affects about 1 in 100 people in the U.S. This condition arises when the thyroid produces an excessive amount of hormones. Patients with hyperthyroidism are often prescribed medications that lower their thyroid hormone levels. For some people with thyroid issues, an underlying autoimmune disorder is at least partly to blame. In these instances, the immune system will mistake the body’s cells for harmful agents and attack them. Conditions like Graves’ disease can cause hyperthyroidism, whereas other diseases like Hashimoto’s disease can cause hypothyroidism. Type 1 diabetes is also considered a risk factor for hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Pregnancy has also been linked to thyroid problems, even in women who do not have a history of thyroid disease. Doctors will routinely monitor thyroid hormone levels to ensure good health for both the mother and her child. Some women experience overactive or underactive thyroid issues for up to a year after they give birth. Women with pre-existing thyroid problems are urged to treat their condition before getting pregnant. Lastly, iodine intake can play a role in thyroid health. The thyroid gland uses iodine to produce hormones, so an inadequate or excessive amount of iodine in your diet can contribute to thyroid disease. Thyroid imbalances have been linked to sleep problems. Hyperthyroidism (overactive) can cause due to arousals from nervousness or irritability, as well as muscle weakness and constant feelings of tiredness. An overactive thyroid may also lead to night sweats and frequent urges to urinate, both of which can disrupt sleep. People with hypothyroidism (underactive), on the other hand, often experience trouble tolerating cold at night and joint or muscle pain that disrupts sleep. Some studies have linked an underactive thyroid to , longer sleep onset – or the time it takes to fall asleep – and shorter sleep duration during the night. Younger people, individuals with a relatively low body mass index, and women are all considered at higher risk of developing sleep problems due to hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can also cause hypersomnia, or the irrepressible need to sleep or lapses into sleep that occur on a daily basis. Hypersomnia can occur due to an underlying medical disorder, and hypothyroidism is considered the leading cause of hypersomnia due to a disorder in the endocrine system. Additionally, untreated hypothyroidism can be mistaken for sleep-related hypoventilation, or excessively slow or shallow breathing that occurs primarily during sleep. Thyroid disease may be a predisposing factor for . People with this disorder feel uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in their legs while the body is at rest. In most cases, RLS symptoms often occur in the evening or around sleep onset. Because the disorder is so disruptive, RLS can lead to significant sleep loss and daytime impairments. While cases are somewhat rare, an overactive thyroid is also considered a predisposing factor for , a type of parasomnia sleep disorder characterized by sudden, terrified outbursts during the night. Sleep habits may play a role in your susceptibility to thyroid disease. found that people who sleep fewer than seven hours per day are at greater risk of developing hyperthyroidism, while sleeping more than eight hours per day may increase the risk of both overactive and underactive thyroid function. Additionally, optimal sleep is believed to support a healthy immune system and people with weaker immune systems are at higher risk of developing thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism develops slowly, so many people won’t notice their symptoms for years. It also shares symptoms with a wide range of other medical conditions, so your doctor will likely order additional testing. The same is true of hyperthyroidism and most diagnoses for an overactive thyroid also entail multiple blood tests. For many older patients, hyperthyroidism can present differently and may be mistaken for depression or dementia because it can cause similar symptoms such as loss of appetite and social withdrawals. These additional blood tests may evaluate your thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and thyrotropin counts to determine whether your thyroid is overactive or underactive. People with hypothyroidism may be prescribed levothyroxine, an artificial hormone intended to boost your thyroid function, and tested six to eight weeks after they begin taking the medication to see if their counts have improved. If hyperthyroidism is suspected, the patient may be prescribed methimazole or another type of anti-thyroid medication. Thyroid testing is often ordered for pregnant women due to their higher risk of developing thyroid disease. These tests may also be suggested for people seeking fertility treatment, as both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can lead to difficulty conceiving. If you notice an irregular lump or swelling on the side of your throat, you may want to make an appointment with your doctor – this may be the first sign of , a condition that roughly 47,000 adults are diagnosed with each year. Other symptoms of thyroid cancer include trouble breathing or swallowing, or an unusually hoarse voice. Thyroid cancer can originate due to genetically inherited conditions, and exposure to radiation – especially as a child – may also increase your risk. People with thyroid disease who experience sleep loss or disturbances may find relief by taking certain measures. For many, finding the right bedroom temperature is key. Many experts agree that (11) is the optimal sleep temperature for most people. However, those with thyroid disease may feel differently, as hyperthyroidism can cause night sweats and hypothyroidism can decrease your tolerance to the cold. The range of 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6-19.4 degrees Celsius) is considered reasonable, and you may find your preferred temperature falls outside this range if you live with thyroid disease. Practicing good can also improve your sleep quality whether or not you have a thyroid condition. Sleep hygiene refers to practices and habits that promote consistent, uninterrupted and restorative sleep. These include going to bed and waking up at the same times (including on the weekends), for up to an hour before bed, and winding down in the evening with soft music, light stretching, and other relaxing activities. A healthy diet is also crucial for sleep hygiene. Heavy meals leading up to bedtime can be disruptive to sleep, so it’s better to opt for light snacks instead. People with thyroid issues should pay particular attention to their iodine intake, as too much or too little iodine in one’s diet can affect thyroid activity. You may also want to avoid and in the hours before bed, as both of these substances can disrupt sleep. NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison. (2015, September). Thinking About Your Thyroid.

e736498c-3769-4d72-ab8f-dba68de0e2ed,"The thyroid hormones namely thyroxine (T4) and the triiodothyronine (T3) secreted by the thyroid gland affect almost all the parts of our body — the heart, the brain, the muscles; metabolism and other physiological functions. A malfunctioning of the thyroid gland can either make it go on an overdrive or make it under active. A condition wherein the thyroid gland becomes underactive and secrets less hormones than needed is called hypothyroidism. Low levels of thyroid hormones can set the stage for numerous health problems such as obesity, heart problems, joint pains, infertility, etc. This condition affects women more than men and is usually silent at the onset. It is not until late that one gets diagnosed for the same. But due to some congenital defects, this condition can affect a person right from birth. Here are few you are not aware of! There are various reasons that can lead to hypothyroidism. Some of the common causes are as follows:  This is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system produces antibodies which attacks and destroys the thyroid cells. This results in a malfunctioning of the gland which interferes with the production of the hormones and lessens the secretions. Hashimoto disease is one of the most common causes of hypothyroidism. Though the exact reason of this autoimmune disease is not known but experts believe that a genetic flaw could be a probable cause.  Radioactive iodine therapy or ablation used to treat hyperthyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland produces excessive thyroid hormones, can lead to hypothyroidism. The radioactive therapy brings the thyroid gland in control to produce less amounts of the hormone. Sometimes the outcome of the treatment is an underactive thyroid gland with a condition like hypothyroidism. Though rare but this is a probable cause for the condition. Here are few .  A surgery usually done to treat hyperthyroidism in case radioactive therapy or ablation fails to remove the diseased part of the gland that goes on an overdrive, can again lead to same.  Certain medications used to treat heart problems, psychiatric disorders or cancers can make the thyroid gland become underactive. Also if one is treated for hyperthyroidism where medications are given to control the thyroid functioning it can also lead to the same.  Sometimes some congenital defects like an underdeveloped thyroid gland or a defective thyroid can lead to a condition like hypothyroidism. Though such babies appear to be normal by birth, the condition only comes to light during the early years of childhood with dependency of medication for life.  For some unknown reasons the thyroid gland starts to act up in many women during pregnancy and after. Low production of thyroid hormones during pregnancy can lead to miscarriages, premature delivery, and preeclampsia. While post pregnancy sometimes women develop thyroditis, inflammation of the gland which interferes with the hormone production. Though the condition remains put for six months after delivery, but if untreated and ignored it can lead to other consequences later. Here's more on   Sometimes a medical condition like a tumor in the pituitary gland or a malfunctioning in the hypothalamus can initiate less secretion of TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone.  TSH is the hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce the right amount of thyroid hormones. Low levels of TSH can lead to hyper secretion of the thyroid hormone leading to the condition.  Iodine in the diet is responsible for the production of thyroid hormones. A deficiency of iodine can lead to hypothyroidism in many. Here are . The following are the risk factors for hypothyroidism: Being a. Thyroid problems for some reason side more with women than men. Hypothyroidism can be common in women aged 60 and beyond. Also read about . Suffering from an A condition like Hashimoto disease or a genetic disposition of the condition can be a risk factor. Intake of, ablation, anti-thyroid medications or a thyroid surgery. Though these are done to treat an underlying condition or other health crisis but they also increase ones chances of getting hypothyroidism. . A little thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum is natural. Regular monitoring can help deal with this better. The symptoms of hypothyroidism can be passed on as those of the normal wear and tear of life, that’s reason why a thyroid condition is not diagnosed right at its onset. Some of the common symptoms of hypothyroidism are - Muscle weakness along with fatigue, tenderness and stiffness at times Heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods in women In children, hypothyroidism can show symptoms like - Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed in the following ways:  Your doctor might slightly press your thyroid gland to check for any inflammation or any such anomaly. A blood test is usually done to check for the levels of thyroxine or T4, the triiodothyronine (T3) hormone and that of the TSH in the blood stream. With a condition like hypothyroidism the levels of T3 and T4 appear to be normal but the TSH levels would be low. Here's everything to know about .  This is usually done if the doctor suspects any structural changes in the gland. An ultrasound or thyroid scan can detect the presence of cysts, their nature and also the extent of thyroid enlargement that has taken place along with hypothyroidism. Here's how to read your medical test report: Thyroid function tests  The first line of treatment is to prescribe medications in oral form. Synthetic hormone T4 is given in pill form to be consumed daily. This resolves the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism within a fortnight. Though, the pill has to be consumed for a longer period of time till your doctor advices. Iron and other antacids should be avoided along with the T4 intake as they interfere with the absorption. Read everything about medicines for Thyroid Disease – Types, Side-effects and Interactions.  In young adults usually a hormone replacement therapy is suggested, but for older people with an underlying heart problem this could lead to adverse consequences.  Hence in such cases if a replacement is needed small doses of the hormone is given at regular intervals. Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to a number of health problems like:  To treat hypothyroidism, medications are given to stimulate the gland to produce more of the hormones. This over stimulation can lead to inflammation of the gland leading to a condition called goitre.  Apart from appearance a large goitre can affect and may interfere with swallowing or breathing. Here's more on .   levels of thyroid hormones can cause an increase in total cholesterol level coming in the way of smooth heart functioning. It can also lead to enlarged heart muscles and lead to heart failure.  Apart from depression which is common with hypothyroidism there can also be a general retardation in the mental functioning of the patient if treatment is ignored.  Long term uncontrolled hypothyroidism can cause damage to your peripheral nerves that are responsible for proper functioning of arms and legs, resulting in muscle weakness or loss of muscle control.  Undiagnosed hypothyroidism can lead to this life-threatening condition characterized by intense cold intolerance and drowsiness followed by extreme lethargy leading to unconsciousness or a state of coma. Though a rare occurrence but it calls for a medical emergency.  Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which impairs fertility. Here's  Untreated hypothyroidism in women can lead to congenital defects in babies born to them. There isn’t any particular diet to help deal with symptoms of this condition. But weight gain is common if one suffers from hypothyroidism. Hence it is essential and wise to check the calorie intake and have a healthy diet plan in place. Apart from weight gain the condition also interferes with muscle tone and strength. Flexibility training and some strengthening exercises can help gain back some vigor. Even with medications as your symptoms come to a check make sure you take enough rest to counter hypothyroidism induced fatigue and practice some meditation techniques to also fight off depression.

Universal Images Group Editorial/Universal Images Group/Getty Images Symptoms of low thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, levels due to hyperthyroidism include rapid heartbeat, sudden weight loss, nervousness, tremors and increased appetite, notes Mayo Clinic. Some symptoms of low TSH levels due to secondary hypothyroidism are fatigue, depression, weight gain and cold intolerance, states UCLA Endocrine Surgery. Testing TSH levels is the most reliable way to screen for conditions related to the thyroid gland, according to WebMD. When the pituitary gland releases TSH, the thyroid gland is triggered to produce the hormones triiodothyronine, or T3, and thyroxine, or T4, both of which help control metabolism and are necessary for proper brain growth during the early years of life. When an individual has an overactive thyroid gland, the pituitary gland stops releasing TSH, which is not needed to stimulate the thyroid to produce further T3 and T4, resulting in low blood TSH levels, explains Endocrine Web. Some potential causes of hyperthyroidism are Grave's disease, noncancerous tumors called toxic nodules and toxic multinodular goiter, notes WebMD. In some cases, low TSH levels are not indicative of hyperthyroidism but, rather, a damaged pituitary gland that cannot produce TSH, according to WebMD. This condition is called secondary hypothyroidism. Low TSH levels also sometimes occur in pregnant women during their first trimester and patients who take too much medication prescribed for an underactive thyroid gland.

b4ef03d6-ab80-4462-91cf-1329ac696ed3,"search close Subclinical Hypothyroidism: Deciding When to Treat VICTOR ADLIN, M.D., Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Abstract Abstract While screening patients for thyroid disease, physicians often find increased thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in patients whose free thyroxine (T) levels are not below normal. This state, termed “subclinical hypothyroidism,” is most commonly an early stage of hypothyroidism. Although the condition may resolve or remain unchanged, within a few years in some patients, overt hypothyroidism develops, with low free T levels as well as a raised TSH level. The likelihood that this will happen increases with greater TSH elevations and detectable antithyroid antibodies. Because patients with subclinical hypothyroidism sometimes have subtle hypothyroid symptoms and may have mild abnormalities of serum lipoproteins and cardiac function, patients with definite and persistent TSH elevation should be considered for thyroid treatment. Levothyroxine, in a dosage that maintains serum TSH levels within the normal range, is the preferred therapy in these patients. Hypothyroidism is quite common in older persons. In one study, thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels greater than 10 μU per mL (10 mU per L) were found in 7 percent of women and 3 percent of men who were 60 to 89 years of age, living active lives in the community (normal range: approximately 0.5 to 4.5 μU per mL [0.5 to 4.5 mU per L]). Clinical suspicion of hypothyroidism may be delayed in elderly patients because symptoms such as fatigue and constipation, and other early manifestations of thyroid failure may be attributed to aging itself. The high prevalence of thyroid failure and the difficulty of making an early clinical diagnosis in older persons suggest that screening for hypothyroidism might be useful in this group, especially since a simple test, the serum TSH level, is available. Recommendations about thyroid screening, however, have been inconsistent. Currently, no organizations recommend routine universal screening. For example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended that asymptomatic adults not be screened because evidence of clinical benefit is insufficient. More recently, some authors have recommended testing in women more than 40 years of age and in patients in geriatric facilities. Danese and co-workers demonstrated through a decision model that TSH screening every five years, starting at age 35, was cost-effective because progression to overt hypothyroidism was prevented, serum cholesterol levels were reduced and symptoms were relieved with early treatment of hypothyroidism. In the absence of definitive guidelines, some clinicians may elect to perform routine screening with serum TSH measurement or to measure TSH in patients with persistent non-specific complaints, especially women, the elderly and persons with risk factors for thyroid failure . Medications: lithium, amiodarone (Cordarone), iodine Medications: lithium, amiodarone (Cordarone), iodine Abstract Measurement of serum TSH is generally considered the best screening test for thyroid disease; increased values usually indicate hypothyroidism, and decreased values usually indicate hyperthyroidism. This test has proved to be both sensitive and specific. Its very sensitivity, however, may create a dilemma, since some patients are found to have elevated serum TSH levels, suggesting hypothyroidism, but have normal levels of thyroid hormone, whether measured as free thyroxine (T) or free T index. This state—an elevated TSH level with a normal free T level—is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. The term “subclinical” may not be strictly correct, since some of these patients may have clinical symptoms, but no better term has been proposed. The elevation of TSH levels reflects the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to small decreases in circulating thyroid hormone; as the thyroid gland fails, the TSH level may rise above the upper limit of normal when the free T level has fallen only slightly and is still within the normal range. Clinical manifestations, if present, may be explained by assuming that a T level of 6 or 7 μg per dL (77 to 90 nmol per L), although not outside the normal range of 4.5 to 12.5 μg per dL (58 to 160 nmol per L), may represent a significant fall from an original level of 9 or 10 μg per dL (116 to 129 nmol per L) and, thus, is low for this particular patient. Abstract Subclinical hypothyroidism is caused by the same disorders of the thyroid gland as those that cause overt hypothyroidism . Chief among these is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease), which is commonly associated with increased titers of antithyroid antibodies, such as antithyroid microsomal antibodies (antithyroid peroxidase) and antithyroglobulin antibodies. This disorder is suspected when thyroid enlargement is observed, but antithyroid antibodies may also be associated with atrophy of the thyroid and hypothyroidism. Medications: lithium, iodine, amiodarone (Cordarone) Medications: lithium, iodine, amiodarone (Cordarone) Another common cause of hypothyroidism is the treatment of Graves' disease. Thyroid failure is most common after radioactive iodine treatment, but hypothyroidism may eventually occur in 5 to 25 percent of patients treated with surgery or antithyroid drugs. Less common causes of hypothyroidism include use of medications such as lithium and amiodarone (Cordarone). Pituitary failure is a cause of secondary hypothyroidism but since, in this circumstance, the TSH level is low rather than high (and thus the direct cause of the thyroid failure), this condition cannot be diagnosed with certainty until thyroid hormone levels fall below normal, and subclinical hypothyroidism as usually defined would not be detected. Abstract What happens to patients who are found to have an elevated TSH level without other findings? In some cases, the TSH level will be normal if measured again several months later; we would then attribute the initial elevation to laboratory error or, perhaps, to an episode of silent thyroiditis with a transient hypothyroid phase. In other cases, the subclinical hypothyroidism remains unchanged. The third possibility, progression to overt hypothyroidism, occurs at a rate of about 5 percent per year in patients with raised TSH levels and detectable antithyroid antibodies. In selected cases (e.g., elderly patients with high titers of antithyroid antibodies), the risk of progression to overt disease may be closer to 20 percent per year. Consideration of these possible outcomes affects the decision about whether to treat or to observe without treatment. Abstract The clinical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism are manifest when the disease is fully developed. But even in the earliest (subclinical stage), one or more of these findings may occur. In one study, symptoms in 33 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism were compared with symptoms in 20 euthyroid patients in the same thyroid clinic. Dry skin, cold intolerance and easy fatigability were significantly more common in the patients with raised TSH levels, and these symptoms improved after treatment with thyroid hormone. In another study of 69 female patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, a clinical index based on symptoms and physical signs was shown to be more abnormal in patients with higher TSH levels, even though all patients had normal serum levels of T and free T. These studies suggest that some patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do indeed have clinical manifestations of mild thyroid failure. Slowing of return phase of reflexes (e.g., knee jerk) Slowing of return phase of reflexes (e.g., knee jerk) In patients with full-blown hypothyroidism, serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are elevated. In patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, not surprisingly, the same changes are present but are less marked and less consistent. This pattern of lipid abnormalities, of course, is important because it is a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Some studies, but not others, have shown a decrease in LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol levels after treatment with levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Levothroid, Synthroid). In several studies, a sensitive measure of myocardial contractility, the ratio of pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time (PEP:LVET) was shown to improve significantly in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism who were treated with levothyroxine, compared with patients who were treated with placebo. Abstract Indications for treatment in subclinical hypothyroidism are not established, but general guidelines can be offered. Greater magnitude and duration of TSH elevation and higher titers of antithyroid antibodies increase the probability that the condition will progress to overt hypothyroidism and, therefore, increase the potential benefit of treatment with levothyroxine. The presence of symptoms that might be related to mild hypothyroidism also increases the potential benefit of treatment. Risk of harm to the patient, against which this potential benefit must be balanced, is quite small, since the use of the sensitive TSH assay provides assurance that we are not raising the blood thyroid hormone levels too much as long as TSH levels do not fall below the normal range. In patients with coronary artery disease and minimal elevations of TSH, however, it may be advisable to follow the TSH level rather than subject the patient to the small risk of levothyroxine therapy. In short, it seems reasonable to treat patients who have a TSH level that is consistently elevated above 10 μU per mL (10 mU per L), especially if titers of antithyroid antibodies are increased. Also, patients who complain of fatigue, dry skin, constipation, muscle cramps or other common symptoms of hypothyroidism may possibly benefit from treatment even if their TSH level is elevated only into the 5 to 10 μU per mL (5 to 10 mU per L) range. An algorithm summarizing this approach is presented in . Algorithm for the management of subclinical hypothyroidism. (T = thyroxine; TSH = thyrotropin-stimulating hormone) Algorithm for the management of subclinical hypothyroidism. (T = thyroxine; TSH = thyrotropin-stimulating hormone) Abstract Treatment is similar to that recommended in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is the agent of choice, rather than a preparation containing tri-iodothyronine (T), since T has a short half-life and requires multiple daily doses to maintain blood levels in the normal range. Levothyroxine, however, has a long half-life (approximately seven days) and is partially converted to T in the body, resulting in a constant physiologic blood level of both T and T with a single daily dose. In patients with overt hypothyroidism, the average daily replacement dosage of levothyroxine is 75 to 125 μg, or 50 to 100 μg in the elderly, or about 1.6 μg per kg per day. Treatment is commonly initiated with 25 to 50 μg daily and raised by increments of 25 to 50 μg, according to TSH measurements at six- to eight-week intervals. In patients who are elderly or debilitated, or who have heart disease, lower starting dosages and slower increases are advisable. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, because of the minimal extent of the thyroid hormone deficiency, may be controlled with total daily dosages of levothyroxine as low as 25 to 50 μg. This initial dosage should be maintained for six to eight weeks before a TSH measurement is repeated to guide adjustment of the levothyroxine dosage. The goal is to maintain the TSH level within normal limits; the dosage of levothyroxine should be increased if the TSH level remains above normal and should be decreased if the TSH level falls below normal. Once the correct dosage of thyroxine is established, the frequency of TSH measurement may be decreased to every six to 12 months. A common error is the failure to decrease the levothyroxine dosage if the TSH level is suppressed below the normal range, which may occur without the free T level rising above normal. This state is considered to represent “subclinical hyperthyroidism,” and although formerly it was thought to be harmless, it is now believed to be associated with undesired effects on bone density (osteoporosis) and cardiac function, and to be a possible cause of neuropsychologic symptoms and other mild manifestations of hyperthyroidism. Abstract At this juncture, evidence does not support routine universal screening for hypothyroidism, but ongoing studies may provide support for screening in selected populations, especially women, the elderly and those at higher risk. However, when a patient presents with nonspecific complaints such as depression or fatigue, the TSH level is often screened, and an elevated TSH level with a normal T level may or may not account for the clinical findings. Under these circumstances, retesting at regular intervals or treatment with low doses of levothyroxine may be warranted. Choose a single article, issue, or full-access subscription.

The thyroid is a small butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of your neck (just below the voice box, or larynx). The thyroid gland is a vital part of the endocrine system. It’s responsible for producing two important hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones regulate the rate at which processes in the body (e.g., breathing, contracting muscles) convert and use energy (metabolism). Women are 5-8 times more likely to have a thyroid problem. Approximately 20 million Americans currently have some form of thyroid disease. Undiagnosed thyroid disease can increase risk for osteoporosis, infertility and cardiovascular disease. Pregnant women with undiagnosed hypothyroidism have an increased risk for preterm delivery, developmental problems (in baby), and miscarriage. Diagnosing thyroid disease can be tricky, as the symptoms associated with thyroid disease can overlap and be confused with many different health problems. To determine if you have a thyroid condition, your doctor may perform a physical exam, a thyroid  Depending on results of TSH test, additional blood tests may be needed to check the levels of one or both of your T3 and T4 hormones. TSH is produced by the pituitary gland and helps regulate thyroid hormone production. When thyroid hormone levels drop or rise, the pituitary gland responds by dropping or raising TSH. In most situations, the TSH test is the most accurate test for diagnosing both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.   If a family member has thyroid disease, you have a higher chance of developing the disease at some point in your life. If you believe that you are having symptoms, it's recommended that you come in for a screening. Many primary care physicians can diagnose and treat mild hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and thyroiditis. However, when symptoms are severe and do not improve on their own within a few months, you should be assessed by an endocrinologist. When the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, this is known as hyperthyroidism. Graves’ disease is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism. Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition where your own immune system triggers your thyroid to overproduce thyroid hormone. It is most common in women over the age of 20, but can occur in men too. Learn more about hyperthyroidism in our health library Hypothyroidism occurs when your thyroid gland is underactive or doesn’t produce enough hormones to meet the body’s needs. Many body functions require the hormones produced by your thyroid gland. Without them, functions slow down. While hypothyroidism is most common in women 50 or older, it can occur in anyone – man or woman – at any age. People who have a parent or grandparent with an autoimmune disease also have an increased risk.

It also secretes several hormones: Thyroid problems can affect women of any age. Thyroid disorders are much more common in women than in men. The functions of the thyroid gland have much to do with a woman's reproductive system, particularly if the thyroid is overactive or underactive. This imbalance in hormone levels may have the following effects on a woman's body: Thyroid disorders can cause puberty and menstruation to occur abnormally early or late. In addition, high or low levels of thyroid hormone can cause very light or very heavy menstrual periods, irregular menstrual periods, or absent menstrual periods (a condition called amenorrhea). An overactive or underactive thyroid may also affect ovulation. This is the release of an egg for fertilization. Thyroid disorders may prevent ovulation from occurring at all. In addition, the ovaries are at an increased risk for cyst development if the woman has an underactive thyroid (hypothyroid). Severe hypothyroidism can actually cause milk production in the breast, while preventing ovulation. Thyroid disorders during pregnancy can harm the fetus and may lead to thyroid problems in the mother after birth, such as postpartum thyroiditis. A deficiency of thyroid hormone can cause pre-eclampsia, miscarriages, preterm delivery, stillbirth, heart failure (rarely), and bleeding after giving birth. Women with overactive thyroid during pregnancy are at risk of having more severe morning sickness. Thyroid disorders may cause the early menopause (before age 40 or in the early 40s).Some symptoms of overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) may also be mistaken for early menopause. These include lack of menstruation, hot flashes, inability to sleep (insomnia), and mood swings. Treating hyperthyroidism can sometimes ease symptoms of early menopause or prevent early menopause from happening.",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-7.197568893432617,69

In the United States, Hashimoto’s is the most common cause of hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid). Your thyroid releases hormones that regulate your metabolism, body temperature, muscle strength, and many other functions of the body. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder. The condition causes white blood cells and antibodies to mistakenly attack the cells of the thyroid. Doctors do not know why this happens, but some scientists believe genetic factors may be involved. Am I at risk for developing Hashimoto’s thyroiditis? The cause of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is not known. However, several risk factors have been identified for the disease. It is to occur in women than men, especially women who have been pregnant. Your risk may also be higher if you have a family history of autoimmune diseases, including: Symptoms of Hashimoto’s are not unique to the disease. Instead, it causes the symptoms of an underactive thyroid. Signs that your thyroid isn’t working properly include: You may have Hashimoto’s for many years before you experience any symptoms. The disease can progress for a long time before it causes noticeable thyroid damage. Some people with this condition develop an enlarged thyroid. Known as a goiter, this may cause the front of your neck to become swollen. A goiter rarely causes any pain, though it may be tender when touched. However, it may make swallowing difficult, or cause your throat feel full. Your doctor may suspect this condition if you have the symptoms of an underactive thyroid. If so, they’ll check your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with a blood test. This common test is one of the best ways to screen for Hashimoto’s. TSH hormone levels are high when thyroid activity is low because the body is working hard to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones. Your doctor may also use blood tests to check your levels of: Most people with Hashimoto’s need treatment. However, if your thyroid is functioning normally, your doctor may monitor you for changes. If your thyroid isn’t producing enough hormones, you need medication. Levothyroxine is a synthetic hormone that replaces the missing thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4). It has virtually no side effects. If you need this drug, you’ll likely be on it for the rest of your life. Regular use of levothyroxine can return your thyroid hormone levels to normal. When this happens, your symptoms will usually disappear. However, you’ll probably need regular tests to monitor your hormone levels. This allows your doctor to adjust your dose as necessary. Some supplements and medications can affect your body’s ability to absorb levothyroxine. It’s important to talk to your doctor about any other medications you’re taking. that are known to cause problems with levothyroxine include: proton pump inhibitors, a treatment for acid reflux You may need to adjust the time of day you take your thyroid medication when taking other medicines. Certain foods may also affect absorption of this drug. Talk to your doctor about the best way for you to take thyroid medication based on your diet. If left untreated, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can cause complications, some of which can be severe. These can include: Hashimoto’s can also cause problems during pregnancy. suggests that women with this condition are more likely to give birth to babies with heart, brain, and kidney defects. In order to limit these complications, it’s important to monitor thyroid function over the course of pregnancy in women who have thyroid problems. For women with no known thyroid disorders, routine thyroid screening , according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. — — Medically reviewed by The superior thyroid artery is located within the neck.

It produces the hormones: triiodothyronine (T3), a hormone that controls energy levels, temperature, metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure and development of a fetus thyroxine (T4), a hormone that controls how the heart works, metabolism, health of the muscles and bones and brain development. Some thyroxine is changed into triiodothyronine calcitonin, which controls the amount of calcium and phosphate in the blood What medical conditions are related to the thyroid gland? Almost 1 in 6 Australians has a . The chance of having trouble with your thyroid becomes greater as you get older. Sometimes people have problems with their thyroid being overactive and producing too much thyroxine (). It can be caused by an autoimmune disorder causing inflammation of the thyroid gland, , or nodules on the thyroid. Hyperthyroidism makes the body use energy too quickly. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: In contrast, if the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones (), the metabolism will reduce. This is the most common thyroid condition in Australia and is more common in men. It is often caused by the autoimmune disorder Hashimoto’s disease, but it can also be caused when the thyroid is damaged during surgery or cancer treatments. Hypothyroidism is usually permanent and is treated by replacing thyroxine. Your doctor will be able to diagnose these problems by performing a blood test to check for the levels of thyroxine and other related hormones in your body. If you have a problem with your thyroid, many different treatments are available. They might involve medication and, in some cases, your doctor may recommend surgery.

Information on the thyroid gland and its function in regulating your body’s metabolism. Your thyroid gland makes hormones that control your metabolism. An overactive or underactive thyroid can cause symptoms. What hormones are produced by the thyroid? The thyroid makes triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and calcitonin. These hormones are important for metabolism, energy production, body temperature, heart rate, bone growth, reproductive function and other bodily functions. Grave's diease is an autoimmune disorder which affects hormone production in the thyroid gland. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a lifelong condition where your thyroid gland doesn’t make enough thyroid hormones. The endocrine system is a network of hormone-producing glands such as the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland, the pancreas, the parathyroid glands and the adrenal glands.

Please refer to an authoritative source if you require up-to-date information on any health or medical issue.   Patient A is a 49 year old female of 76 kilograms and height of 161.5 centimetres. The patient has attempted to diet but has gained 11.3 kilograms in the previous months. The patient also sleeps for 14-16 hours a day. Her movements were slothful. The patient’s signs consisted of a slight enlargement of the neck area, coarse textured hair and dry skin. When her blood sample was analysed it showed that the hormone T4 (thyroxin) levels were 3.2 micrograms/millilitre which is lower than the normal range, 4.2-11.2 micrograms/millilitre. In addition to this her TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels were high. If you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help! The analysis of the weight gain using the diagnosis table shows that this could be as a result of hyperthyroidism or Cushing syndrome or hypothyroidism. The slothful behaviour could be caused by Addison’s disease or hypothyroidism. The dry skin of the patient is consistent with the hypothyroidism condition. The swelling on the neck could be a goitre which results from a lack of iodine in the thyroid gland. Overstimulation causes the thyroid gland to swell. This swelling could also be a result of hyperthyroidism whereby the thyroid gland secretes too much thyroid hormone and the swelling also results, or it could be a thyroid tumour which also causes the swelling. [1,2] The signs and symptoms are consistent with either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and are on the thyroid gland. Cross-section diagram of the neck showing the thyroid gland (106.gif) http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Hypothyroidism-Underactive-Thyroid.htm Analysis of blood samples and effect of hormones on homeostasis The hormone T4 speeds up metabolic rates regulates the amount of oxygen used up by cells and regulates body heat. [3] The patient’s weight gain could be as a result of a decrease in the rate of digestion. Low T4 levels mean that not enough digestive juices are being secreted because T4 controls metabolic rates resulting in the slow movement of smooth muscles lining the stomach. T4 promotes the normal development of muscle tone and normal functioning of skeletal and cardiac muscles. This possibly explains why the patient is experiencing slothful movement. [1] In addition to this T4 also promotes the hydration of the skin, secretion of the exocrine glands and the growth of hair. The consequences of low T4 could explain why the patient’s hair is coarse and why the patient has dry skin. [1] To distinguish between hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism a T4 and TSH test have to be done. [4] The TSH test is normally chosen for the evaluation of the thyroid function and for the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. It is often done with or after a T4 test. The results of the tests performed show an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level which show that the patient has hypothyroidism. TSH Normal Low High Low T4 Normal High Low Low [4] Hypothyroidism is a condition caused by the underactive functioning of the thyroid gland whereby the thyroid does not produce enough or does not even produce triodothyronine (T3) and thyroxin (T4). [1] The thyroid gland is a butterfly shaped organ which is found inferior to the Larynx and in front of the neck. [1] If the thyroid is underactive hypothyroidism appears. They are two types of hypothyroidism and these are primary and secondary hypothyroidism. [4] Primary Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid does not produce T4 and T3 hormones at all. [4] Secondary Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid produces amounts of T3 and T4 which are below the normal levels. [4] The thyroid gland swells up in as a result of it trying to achieve homeostasis. The body has low T4 levels therefore the gland works even harder to try and produce more hormones and this causes an increase in the size of the gland. 95% of the time the thyroid gland is not secreting sufficient thyroid hormone and this could cause the hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism could be an autoimmune disease. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances and infection. However, in this case the immune system mistakes the thyroid gland cells and enzymes, as foreign objects and attacks them resulting in the low production of thyroid hormone. [5] Our academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have. From simple essay plans, through to full dissertations, you can guarantee we have a service perfectly matched to your needs. Hypothyroidism could also be as a result of Hashimoto disease (chronic thyroiditis). This is a genetic autoimmune disease which could also result the enlargement of the thyroid gland causing goitre. Goitre is a cyst like fibrous growth in the neck region and is caused by an immunologic dysfunction or by an infection and requires lifelong treatment. Stress, poor dieting and strenuous exercise could also cause an imbalance of hormones and leads to hypothyroidism. [6] Hypothyroidism can also result from low iodine concentrations in the body. Iodine is required for the proper and normal functioning of the thyroid gland’ hence insufficient amounts would cause a dysfunction. [5] The enlargement of the gland is an attempt by the thyroid gland to trap more iodine. X-ray radiation, drug abuse and pesticide residues also contribute to having an underactive thyroid gland. [7] Another way of acquiring hypothyroidism could be the after effect of a surgery for example on the removal of thyroid glands. The surgery could be performed on a patient with cancer or the Grave’s Disease but if partially removed it could fail to produce enough thyroid hormone necessary to regulate normal and necessary bodily functions. [7-8] Surgery could also be performed on the pituitary gland which sends instructions to the thyroid gland on how much thyroid hormone should be produced. [5] Any damage to the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus could cause hypothyroidism as they both play a role in sending signals to the thyroid gland so that it produces more thyroid hormone. In some cases the condition could arise from the use of drugs such as amiodarone, lithium interferon alpha, and interkulin-2. These drugs stop the thyroid gland from producing the thyroid hormone at a normal and are likely to trigger hypothyroidism especially in patients with a genetic tendency to auto immune thyroid disease. [5] To treat hypothyroidism artificial hormones such as Levothyroxine or Liotrix can be administered to the patient so as to replace the hormones; T4, TSH or T3 that are lacking in the body. Iodine supplement’s or iodised salt for those with iodine deficiency can be effective as well. [9-10] The doses of the drugs are not fixed hence the medicine is only formulated when the amount of hormone in the patient has been determined, therefore the patient has to return for constant check-ups after 6 week intervals so that the blood samples and the hormones can be analysed again so that the dosage can be changed. [7-10] When treating the elderly that have a history of heart disease, low doses of the drug have to be administered as this could lead to a greater/increased risk of heart attack. [10] For the short term treatment of hypothyroidism, T hormones are used to inhibit the synthesis of TSH in the body. Hormone replacement is predominated by the prolonged effect of T hormones on the level of TSH present. For those who do not prefer drug therapy for hypothyroidism homeopathic remedies are also available. The homeopathic remedies such as Thyax and Thyroidinum 6C can be used to stimulate the thyroid gland to start to produce its own hormone. [11-12] If the condition of hypothyroidism is detected early there is a high chance that the condition can be completely controlled using medicine. After treatment with drugs, the levels of thyroid hormones usually return to normal after several months, whereas in other individuals suffering from hypothyroidism, the disorder is a lifelong problem. [13] Their treatment should be taken consistently every day for the rest of their lives. [14] If hypothyroidism goes untreated it could lead to other complications. Low thyroxin levels cause the level of lipids and cholesterol to rise, causing the patient to suffer from heart disease. [13] In pregnant women there is an increased risk in having anaemia, still birth and serious bleeding after birth or it could lead to a myxoedema coma, which arises due to the low levels of thyroid hormone. [13-14] Advantages and disadvantages of chosen treatment methods With allopathic remedies there is a chance that if the drug dosage is too low it could cause hypothyroidism and if the drug dosage is too high it could lead to hyperthyroidism. The homeopathic remedies are the best treatment methods as compared to the supplementation medications as it aids the gland to function properly, whereas in the supplementation medications the gland could become too dependent on the drugs and throw the other glands in the body off balance. [12] If the doses of the artificial hormones are not check or changed, with time this could lead to hyperthyroidism. There are no medication preventative methods for hypothyroidism, but a healthy diet can protect and preserve one’s health. The patient can take iodine supplements in their food and this reduces the risk of them contracting it. Exercising, getting enough sleep, relaxation are ways in which hypothyroidism future problems can be avoided. Exercise is another activity that boosts the levels of thyroid hormone therefore reducing the risk of hypothyroidism. [15] There is no cure to the condition therefore the patient will have to keep taking medicine for the rest of their lives. The patient will have to go for constant check-ups in order to change the dose according to the thyroid hormone levels that they have, and the misuse of the drugs could make their condition worse.

We provide the most advanced diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for thyroid nodules. What is the thyroid gland and what is its function? The thyroid gland is an important endocrine gland that produces thyroid hormones, which circulate and affect most organs in the body. The major hormones are known as “T4” and “T3”. Thyroid hormone is essential for growth and development, and plays an important role in energy metabolism, and normal cardiac and bone function. When the thyroid is under-functioning (underactive, hypothyroid), patients may feel cold and tired. Although weight gain is typically thought to be a symptom of low thyroid, that is rarely the case. When the thyroid is over-functioning (hyperthyroid, overactive), patients may feel anxious, hot, involuntarily lose weight, note palpitations and rapid heartbeat, and may develop cardiac problems. The thyroid gland is controlled by the pituitary gland through the hormone TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). When the thyroid gland is underactive, the TSH concentration is elevated. When the thyroid is overactive, the TSH concentration is low. Measurement of serum TSH is the most sensitive test of thyroid function. A normal serum TSH concentration excludes abnormal thyroid function in more than 99% of individuals. The thyroid gland also produces the hormone calcitonin. The role of calcitonin in normal individuals is uncertain. However, a rare cancer of the thyroid gland (medullary thyroid carcinoma) is associated with elevated serum calcitonin. The thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly, with the wings corresponding to the lobes of the thyroid and the connecting piece between the lobes, known as the isthmus. The thyroid gland sits on top of and to the sides of the windpipe (trachea). It sits below the Adam’s apple and above the collar bone. The thyroid gland sits in front of the parathyroid glands. The nerves to the vocal cord tend to run behind the thyroid. Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) may cause fatigue, low energy, muscle aches, cold intolerance (feeling cold, even in a warm room), dry skin and hair loss. When the thyroid is only mildly underactive (subclinical hypothyroidism), patients may or may not be symptomatic. Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) may cause anxiety, heat intolerance (feeling hot all the time) weight loss despite increased appetite, pounding of the heart (palpitations), difficulty sleeping and shortness of breath. If the thyroid function is only slightly overactive, patients may or may not be symptomatic. Measurement of serum TSH is the most sensitive test to determine an overactive thyroid (see above). When symptoms suggestive of thyroid gland over-activity or under-activity are present, serum TSH should be measured. Although many patients have symptoms suggestive of low thyroid, if the serum TSH is within normal limits, it is unlikely that the symptoms are related to the thyroid. If the serum TSH is abnormal, additional blood tests may be necessary. When the serum TSH is elevated, we also measure free T4. When the serum TSH is low, we also measure free T4 and T3. Thyroid disease may affect thyroid function, causing hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism (see above). Thyroid disease may be “structural,” causing enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter) and/or lumps or tumors in the thyroid. In many cases, structural disease of the thyroid is discovered incidentally when patients have tests including CT scans, MRI scans or carotid ultrasound examination. In some patients, abnormal thyroid function and structural disease co-exist. For example, some thyroid nodules cause over-activity of the thyroid gland. Frequently Asked Questions: Thyroid Nodules & Goiters A thyroid nodule is the term used for a “lump” in the thyroid. Thyroid nodules are very common occurring in more than 50% of individuals over age 65. Most nodules are tumors in the thyroid gland. Fortunately, about 90% of thyroid nodules are noncancerous (benign). If a physician or a patient feels a lump in the region of the thyroid gland, a thyroid ultrasound will confirm or exclude the presence of a thyroid nodule. When nodules are found incidentally with a CT scan, MRI or carotid ultrasound, a thyroid ultrasound is also indicated to learn as much as possible about the nodules. Most nodules are asymptomatic. Some nodules are large enough to be visible, particularly in a thin neck. Thyroid nodules rise with swallowing. When large, thyroid nodules may cause a sense of pressure in the neck and rarely may affect breathing and swallowing. Patients with a thyroid nodule should see a physician who can assess and help determine whether treatment is needed. In many cases, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is necessary to determine if a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant. What is the difference between a nodule and a goiter? A goiter is a medical term that means abnormal enlargement of the thyroid. This can appear as a swelling in the front of the neck. A common cause of general thyroid enlargement is the benign thyroid inflammation called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, which may cause thyroid gland under-activity (hypothyroidism). The thyroid gland may also become generally enlarged with an overactive thyroid due to the condition called Graves’ disease. The thyroid may also be enlarged because it contains multiple nodules (multinodular thyroid). Multinodular thyroid glands generally function normally, but may be associated with thyroid gland over-activity (hyperthyroidism). What is a multinodular thyroid or multinodular goiter? When a thyroid gland contains multiple nodules, it is considered multinodular. There is no clear distinction between a multinodular thyroid and a multinodular goiter, but the term goiter implies that the thyroid gland is enlarged. Sometimes a multinodular goiter contains many small nodules, but if the nodules continue to enlarge, they may cause neck pressure and difficulty breathing or swallowing. Patients with a multinodular goiter need to have the nodules evaluated by a physician on a regular basis with a physical exam and ultrasound. Occasionally, additional studies such as a CT scan (without contrast) or an MRI are necessary to be certain that the nodules are not causing the airway (trachea) to be narrowed. We simply do not know why thyroid nodules are so common. Although thyroid nodules may run in families, they are so common in the general population that it is often not certain whether the condition is truly genetic. Exposure to excess radiation in childhood increases the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer (e.g., radiation therapy that was used for acne, enlarged tonsils, ringworm and other benign conditions). However, radiation therapy has not been used for these purposes for decades. The benign inflammation known as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis often causes a “lumpy” thyroid, which may be misinterpreted as a nodular thyroid gland either on physical examination or by ultrasound examination. In areas of iodine deficiency, nodules often grow to large size, but iodine deficiency itself does not cause thyroid nodules. Thyroid nodules are most commonly discovered by chance during imaging studies, such as CT or MRI scans or ultrasounds that are performed for other reasons. Thyroid nodules may be discovered by the patient or a physician during a physical examination. If you think that you may have a thyroid nodule, you should be evaluated by a physician. You will likely have the following during your evaluation: Physical exam with a review of your medical history Blood test to check the function of your thyroid (i.e. thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) test). If thyroid function is overactive (low TSH), a radioactive iodine scan may be performed Thyroid ultrasound to verify the presence of the nodule, assess the size and characteristics (fluid-filled or solid) and assess for other nodules in or around the thyroid Depending on the findings, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be recommended to check the kinds of cells in the nodule and to ensure they are benign (noncancerous) Many patients just want to know if their nodule is a sign of thyroid cancer. Your physician will use information from your history, physical exam, blood work and biopsy results to determine if a particular nodule requires treatment. What are the treatment options for thyroid nodules that are shown to be non-cancerous (benign) on FNA biopsy? For patients with normal thyroid function and thyroid nodules, observation with periodic physical examinations and ultrasounds are necessary to be certain that the nodule is not changing. Repeat biopsies may become necessary if the nodule size or ultrasound characteristics change. Although a benign biopsy is very reassuring, such biopsies will be correct 98 or 99% of the time, not 100%. Therefore, continued surveillance is necessary. For some patients with normal thyroid function and thyroid nodules, thyroid hormone is prescribed to prevent further growth or to possibly decrease the size of the nodule. When thyroid nodules cause local symptoms, exhibit continued growth or are a source of anxiety, surgery is often the appropriate treatment option. When thyroid function is high (hyperthyroidism) in a patient with thyroid nodules, radioactive iodine or surgery are both excellent alternatives. In some patients, medication alone is used to control the thyroid over-activity. What are the treatment options for thyroid nodules that are shown to be cancerous (malignant)? Nodules that are suspicious on biopsy are usually treated with surgery. Treatment for most cancerous thyroid nodules begins with surgery. The most common thyroid cancers are called well-differentiated thyroid cancer and include papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid carcinoma and Hurthle cell carcinoma. After surgery for well-differentiated thyroid cancer, radioactive iodine therapy may be necessary to destroy remaining thyroid tissue or treat residual cancer. Read thyroid surgery frequently asked questions (PDF). Medullary thyroid carcinoma also requires surgery, but there are special considerations. In some patients, this cancer is associated with an adrenal tumor called a pheochromocytoma, and that must be excluded prior to thyroid surgery. In some patients, this cancer runs in families, therefore patients may require specific genetic testing. What are the treatment options for nodules that are considered ""indeterminate""? Most thyroid nodules will be diagnosed as benign or malignant (cancer) on FNA. However, 20-25% of FNA biopsies are considered indeterminate. This means that we cannot definitely decide whether the nodule is benign or malignant based on that biopsy alone. Several alternatives are available for indeterminate biopsies depending upon the specific biopsy result. These include: Repeating the biopsy with special tests to analyze the genetic make-up of the tumor It is important to see a doctor if you think you may have a thyroid nodule or goiter, or if you are experiencing abnormal swelling or pressure in your neck, especially with difficulty breathing or swallowing. You should also see a doctor if you experience any of the symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism over an extended period of time.

26547441-ed69-4058-9aaf-23de29980569,"Help with these results and symptoms - tired of... - Thyroid UK Help with these results and symptoms - tired of 'wait and see' approach of NHS As my profile outlines, I have been suffering from underactive symptoms for a long time and am repeatedly tested and only ever offered a ‘wait and see’ approach. I have recently seen my GP (repeatedly), had an ulstrasound and a CT scan and an appointment with a Private Endo (who I suspect is a diabetes speciliast and not a Thyroid expert) and been told that I am potetially ‘hyper’ if anything – this is obviously based on TSH and doesn’t take in to account the lower than opitmal T4 and T3 and certainly doesn’t take my symptoms in to consideration. From looking at my results (in my profile) My feeling is that 1. I have Hashis ( this has been confirmed by the TPO and so too by the docs) but that also there may be a secondary/pituitary hypothyroidism scenario at play i.e suppressed TSH with low/normal T3 and T4. What I am looking for is for you guys ot give my your thoughts and anything that might help me get my docs to investigate this conclusion as opposed to ‘wait and see’ or ‘you’re hyper’…because I am at my wits end and feel nothing even remotely hyper in my opinion. nails brittle and peelingsensitivity to hot and cold temps Aching bones and jointsweight gain (approx 3 stone in last 2 years) inability to lose weight (even when dieting and exercising) Accelerated Skin aging / thickening (face and chest in particular)itchy ears I have what I can only describe as cyclical flar-ups that are mostly worsening of the above: You do not appear to have had vitamin D, folate, ferritin and B12 tested These are very often too low due to Hashimoto's. Essential to test and supplement to bring up to optimal levels. This can then increase TSH as having optimal vitamins helps Thyroid hormones work well For full Thyroid evaluation you need TSH, FT4, TT4, FT3 plus TPO and TG thyroid antibodies and also very important to test vitamin D, folate, ferritin and B12 Private tests are available. Thousands on here forced to do this as NHS often refuses to test FT3 or antibodies Medichecks Thyroid plus ultra vitamin or Blue Horizon Thyroid plus eleven are the most popular choice. DIY finger prick test or option to pay extra for private blood draw. Both companies often have money off offers. All thyroid tests should ideally be done as early as possible in morning and fasting. This gives highest TSH, lowest FT4 and most consistent results. (Patient to patient tip, GP will be unaware) Hashimoto's affects the gut and leads to low stomach acid and then low vitamin levels. Low vitamin levels affect Thyroid hormone working Poor gut function can lead leaky gut (literally holes in gut wall) this can cause food intolerances. Most common by far is gluten. According to Izabella Wentz the Thyroid Pharmacist approx 5% with Hashimoto's are coeliac, but over 80% find gluten free diet helps significantly. Either due to direct gluten intolerance (no test available) or due to leaky gut and gluten causing molecular mimicry (see Amy Myers link) Changing to a strictly gluten free diet may help reduce symptoms, help gut heal and slowly lower TPO antibodies But don't be surprised that GP or endo never mention gut, gluten or low vitamins. Hashimoto's is very poorly understood Come back with new post once you have results and ranges on vitamins Hi SlowDragon, I've updated my profile with other blood test results including folate, B12 and the Coeliac profile. My B12 is within range but definitely low enough to be looked at i think. I've had my ferritin tested too but cant find the results - but i do know that it was at the top end of the healthy range. I have experimented with gluten free diet and felt no change. I requested the RT3, TT4 and TG tests but was told no by GP. Unfortunately having spent the money on the private endo appointment ( and two children in full time childcare) I just dont have the cash to pay for more private tests/Blue Horizon etc . I am awaiting an NHS appointment in September to see another Endo, so what I want to do now is have you guys (who know so much its amazing!) have a look at what we do know so far and give an indication as to what you think might be the overall picture and the tests I need to beg the hospital to do. I basically have to tell them what i think it is and give them the clinical business case for investigating it. It's ridiculous. Ultimately they won't test RT3, TT4 and TG unless they think it is 'XYZ' and need the tests simply to confirm their diagnosis. They also wont look at it being pituitary related because it is so rare and poorly understood - so if anyone has experience of or in Pituitary/Secondary hypo and thinks my suppressed TSH and lowish T4/T3 could be indiciative of that, I'd love to hear about it because seeing that evidence and similar cases might get the docs attention. If i go in and have nothing for them they will scratch their heads and say 'we don't know whats wrong with you. you dont fit neatly into a box'. I have been through this same cycle every couple of years for the past 15 so I can write the script! Your folate and B12 are both very low. So first step is possibly to take a daily good quality vitamin B complex, one with folate in, not folic acid If you are taking vitamin B complex, or any supplements containing biotin, remember to stop these 3-5 days before any blood tests, as biotin can falsely affect test results If you have symptoms of low B12 you may also need sublingual B12 for a few months as well Absolutely essential to test this - only £29 via NHS postal kit if GP won't test. Your calcium is below range, this very strongly suggests low vitamin D. Calcium levels naturally increase as vitamin D levels increase Getting B vitamins and vitamin D optimal are likely to increase TSH so that your thyroid problems are recognised Gluten free diet may not give any immediate noticeable improvement, but long term it can slowly heal gut and improve nutrient levels No point at all testing RT3. It doesn't tell you much. NHS never offer it. Only relevant if on high above range FT4 and low FT3 TT4 is useful when on Levothyroxine, but only available on private tests Thyroglobulin antibodies are usually tested on NHS if TPO are high, which your are. But you already know you have Hashimoto's from high TPO so it's largely irrelevant and not worth fussing about With Hashimoto's fair number of people are dairy intolerant. Something to consider too Only add one supplement at a time or make one change at a time or you don't know which is helping Come back on new post with vitamin D result once you have it. Low vitamins often results in low TSH regardless of FT4 and FT3 Thanks SlowDragon. Really appreciate the effort you put into your responses ! After looking at your recent post about your mother I have come back to this one to reply. You are right about endos - they are all diabetes specialists and do not seem to know much about thyroid. Their justification is the massive increase in the number of people with diabetes. T3 is the active thyroid hormone which controls almost every cell in the body. Your is in the lower part of the normal range so would not be recognized as hypothyroid. Your family history of hypothyroidism points to a genetic condition - thyroid hormone resistance, also known as impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone. This could explain your symptoms and your goitre. The condition requires high Free T3 levels to overcome the resistance and the recommended treatment is a single daily dose of T3. I noticed that you had requested suppliers of T3 - did you get some responses? You are very unlikely to find a doctor willing to help, so like many people on this forum you have to consider self medication. Hi HughH thank you for taking the time to read the post about my mum, then reading my posts about me. I was actually reading about the hereditary resistance issue earlier for the first time! I will be bringing it up with new hospital Endo appt next week. I did get some msgs about T3 suppliers but they didn’t seem like legit sources so haven’t ordered anything.

Norwich, New York www.mzassociatesinc.com Recipient of the Excellence in Geriatric Pharmacy Practice Award from the Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy. Thyroid disorders are common in the elderly. These conditions are diagnostically challenging and are often overlooked in seniors since signs and symptoms are frequently nonspecific and are attributed to comorbidities or the normal aging process. Pharmacists who interact with patients and/or monitor patients’ response to pharmacotherapy have an opportunity to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism () and identify medications that may affect thyroid function (). This column will focus on the relatively common condition known as , also referred to as . With regard to metabolism, the thyroid gland and thyroid hormones influence practically all cellular function. The largest endocrine organ in the body, the two-lobed thyroid gland, is located in the anterior neck and produces the two main thyroid hormones: triiodothyronine (T), the most active form, and tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, T), which has minimal hormonal activity.Approximately 80% of the production of T is derived from T-to-T conversion in extrathyroidal tissues (liver, muscles, kidneys); the thyroid gland secretes the remaining 20% of T.   The hypothalamus, the anterior pituitary, and the thyroid gland regulate thyroid hormones through a negative feedback loop.Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) within the hypothalamus stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary gland; TSH is responsible for increasing thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion.From the serum, T and T feed back to inhibit TSH and TRH production and secretion. Of note, the thyroid gland also secretes the hormone calcitonin, which is classified as a serum calcium–lowering hormone. Preparations of calcitonin (e.g., calcitonin-salmon) help regulate calcium via bone, renal, and gastrointestinal effects, and are used in the treatment of osteitis deformans, postmenopausal osteoporosis, and hypercalcemia. While the thyroid gland is not essential for life, in a newborn, thyroid hormone is required for normal brain function and somatic tissue development; in individuals of all ages, thyroid hormone regulates protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism. By maintaining a level of metabolism in the tissues that is optimal for normal function, the thyroid gland facilitates normal growth and maturation. The notion that biological aging is a multifactorial process, is commonly accepted. In general, changes associated with aging occur morphologically (e.g., sclerosis of heart valves, decreased elasticity of lung) and/or functionally (e.g., decreased T-cell activity, increased motor response time, slowed intestinal motility). With regard to the thyroid, age-related changes manifest as alterations in anatomy (e.g., increase in fibrosis) and function (e.g., decrease in T concentration); the vast majority of seniors, however, maintain normal thyroid function. The insidious process of thyroid failure and a state of decreased thyroid hormone available to peripheral tissues constitutes the clinical situation known as thyroidism. In the general population, in patients over the age of 60 years the incidence of overt hypothyroidism is approximately 2% to 10%. Medications such as amiodarone and lithium often induce hypothyroidism. Other risk factors for failure of the thyroid gland can be found in .  Inadequate secretion of thyroid hormone (thyroidism) results in a variety of signs and symptoms including bradycardia, cold intolerance, and mental and physical slowing. There may be a delay in clinical suspicion of hypothyroidism in elderly patients because early manifestations, such as fatigue and constipation, may be attributed to aging itself. In fact, elderly patients have fewer symptoms of hypothyroidism than their younger counterparts and present with more subtle and vague complaints. Pharmacists should note that this is in contrast to secretion of thyroid hormones (thyroidism) resulting in signs and symptoms including tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, body wasting, nervousness, tremor, and excess heat production. Serum TSH (adult reference range approximately 0.3-4 mIU/L) is generally considered the best screening test for thyroid disease due to its sensitivity and specificity; elevated values usually are indicative of hypothyroidism, and decreased values usually are indicative of hyperthyroidism. Laurberg et al recommend that TSH levels be part of biochemical testing for medical conditions in elderly patients. The sensitivity of serum TSH measurement may reveal patients with elevated serum TSH levels, however, implying hypothyroidism but with an accompanying free Tlevels (adult reference range approximately 0.8-1.8 ng/dL); see Subclinical Hypothyroidism, below. During a routine screening for thyroid disease, a patient may be found to have hypothyroidism—an elevated TSH level in conjunction with a free Tlevel that is below normal and is also referred to as . The patient may be asymptomatic or present with minimal symptoms of hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism is frequently an early stage of hypothyroidism.When a patient presents with a serum TSH > 10.0 mIU/L, there is a high likelihood of progression to overt hypothyroidism presenting with low serum free T4 in the upcoming 10 years. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is approximately 3% to 8.5% of the general population; it is more common in women than in men, and its prevalence increases with age—rising to as high as 20% in women over the age of 60 years. Subclinical hypothyroidism progresses to overt hypothyroidism at a rate of 5% to 20% per year in patients who have both mildly elevated TSH levels and antithyroid (peroxidase) antibodies. Patients with this condition are more likely to have hypercholesterolemia. According to Hak et al, the Rotterdam study indicated that subclinical hypothyroidism is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction in elderly women.Furthermore, Biondi et al have noted subclinical hypothyroidism to be associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction that is improved with T therapy. Subclinical thyroidism is far more common than subclinical thyroidism. It occurs especially in geriatric women with an underlying autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis). While Surks et al indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening, they indicate that aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction. Although it has been controversial as to whether or not to treat patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, patients with this condition sometimes have subtle hypothyroid symptoms and may have mild abnormalities of serum lipoproteins and cardiac function. Furthermore, there is the risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism in these individuals; therefore, patients with definite and persistent TSH elevation should be considered for thyroid treatment. While various preparations of thyroid hormone are available, levothyroxine is preferred; therapy is initiated at low doses (12.5-25 mcg) in the elderly. Fatourechi notes that large-scale randomized studies are required for evidence-based recommendations regarding screening for subclinical hypothyroidism and levothyroxine therapy for this condition. However, these researchers note that currently the practical approach is routine levothyroxine therapy, which normalizes serum TSH levels for persons with a persistent serum TSH of greater than 10.0 mIU/L, and individually tailored therapy for those with a TSH of less than 10.0 mIU/L. Other experts specify that for those patients with TSH levels between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, it is reasonable to introduce a trial of levothyroxine if early hypothyroid symptoms (e.g., fatigue, depression) are present.Treatment is also recommended in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism if there are clinical features of hyperlipidemia or goiter. Pharmacists may also refer to an algorithm for the management of subclinical hypothyroidism that has been proposed by Cooper (see Reference 17).    Of note, pregnant women and women who plan to become pregnant are treated with levothyroxine to avoid harmful effects secondary to hypothyroidism with regard not only to the pregnancy but to fetal development as well.  Patients under treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism should be evaluated for efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy; assessment of serum lipid concentrations, cognitive function, and psychiatric status is recommended. Since therapy with levothyroxine decreases LDL-C and apolipoprotein B level and decreases the ratio of cholesterol to HDL-C in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, there may be a reduction in the risk for the development of coronary artery disease. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism who are asymptomatic and do receive levothyroxine therapy should be monitored to assess the progress of their condition; this is achieved by measurement of serum TSH and free Tevery 6 months to annually.Symptoms of thyroidism (e.g., weight loss, increased sweating, palpitations) will occur with excessive thyroid hormone replacement. Patients should be made aware of this possibility and instructed to report such occurrences to a health care professional. Due to the long half-life of levothyroxine, laboratory assessment is generally not carried out at less than 6-week intervals.  The prevalence of hypothyroidism increases dramatically in geriatric individuals. Subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in women than in men, and its prevalence increases with age. According to researchers, the most important implication of this disorder is the high likelihood of progression to overt hypothyroidism. Furthermore, patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are more likely to have hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Pharmacists can assist in the identification of subclinical hypothyroidism and provide recommendations regarding appropriate pharmacotherapy, thyroid function testing and outcome management including monitoring for efficacy and toxicity. 1.

WILSON, M.D., University of Florida Health Science Center, Jacksonville, Florida R. WHIT CURRY, JR., M.D., University of Florida Health Science Center, Gainesville, Florida Abstract Abstract Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 μU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 μU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 μU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course. Subclinical hyperthyroid and hypothyroid disease are laboratory diagnoses. In 2002, a scientific review and consensus committee, which included representatives from the American Thyroid Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and the Endocrine Society, convened a panel of experts to define subclinical thyroid disease, review the literature concerning risks and benefits of treatment, and make recommendations about evaluation and population-based screening. This committee defined subclinical hypothyroidism as “a serum TSH [thyroid-stimulating hormone] concentration above the statistically defined upper limit of the reference range when serum free T [thyroxine] (FT) concentration is within its reference range.” Subclinical hyperthyroidism was defined as “a serum TSH concentration below the statistically defined lower limit of the reference range when serum FT and T [triiodothyronine] concentrations are within their reference ranges.” Based on a series of studies, the panel determined that the reference range for serum TSH is 0.45 to 4.50 μU per mL (0.45 to 4.50 mU per L). Screening asymptomatic persons for thyroid disease should be considered, especially for those older than 60 years or with risk factors. A = consistent, good quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or limited quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series.

A = consistent, good quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or limited quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series. For more information about the SORT evidence rating system, see page 1435 or. Despite a working definition of subclinical thyroid disease, the panel found little evidence to guide physicians in managing subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Some patients will progress to overt disease, and in some patients, the serum TSH concentration will remain stable over time or will spontaneously return to the reference range. There also is controversy regarding what, if any, adverse outcomes occur from subclinical thyroid disease, and whether benefit can be expected from treatment. As a result, various organizations have adopted diverse recommendations regarding screening for subclinical thyroid disease. Abstract In January 2004, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force updated its 1996 recommendations regarding routine screening for thyroid disease. The new recommendations state that “the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for thyroid disease in adults.” The most recent revision of the American Academy of Family Physicians’ policy recommendation for periodic health examinations remains unchanged; it recommends against routine screening for thyroid disease in patients younger than 60 years, based on a lack of evidence to support “net benefit over harm.” The 2002 consensus group’s expert panel recommended against population-based screening but “encouraged” assessment in high-risk groups (defined as women with a family history of thyroid disease, prior thyroid dysfunction, symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, abnormal thyroid gland on examination, type 1 diabetes, or a personal history of autoimmune disorder). The panel found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening pregnant women or women planning a pregnancy. The American College of Physicians (ACP) issued its most recent policy statement on thyroid disease in 1998, in which it recommends screening for women older than 50 years who have symptoms consistent with thyroid disease. The ACP was not a member of the consensus committee. Abstract In many patients who have subclinical hyperthyroidism, careful clinical evaluation will suggest an etiology. Early Graves’ disease accounts for the majority of cases, with the remainder caused by toxic multinodular goiter, autonomous functioning nodules, or exogenous levothyroxine (Synthroid). Other causes of low serum TSH concentration include delayed recovery of the pituitary after treatment for hyperthyroidism; pregnancy; euthyroid sick syndrome; or medications such as dopamine (Intropin), glucocorticoids, and dobutamine (Dobutrex).  Few persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism progress to overt disease . Serum TSH reference range (0.45 to 4.50 μU per mL [0.45 to 4.50 mU per L]) Hyperthyroidism (factitious/iatrogenic, Graves’ disease, toxic nodule) TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone; FT = free thyroxine. Serum TSH reference range (0.45 to 4.50 μU per mL [0.45 to 4.50 mU per L]) Hyperthyroidism (factitious/iatrogenic, Graves’ disease, toxic nodule) TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone; FT = free thyroxine. Subclinical hyperthyroidism appears to be associated with atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, cardiac dysfunction, and progression to overt hyperthyroidism in patients with known thyroid disease. In the Framingham Study, investigators found that persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a relative risk of three to one for developing atrial fibrillation when compared with control patients over 10 years. In another study, accelerated bone loss was documented in women who received excessive levothyroxine replacement therapy when compared with control patients over a period of more than eight years. The authors of a 10-year, population-based cohort study concluded that there was an “increase in mortality from all causes and from circulatory diseases in individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism,” and that patients with low levels of serum TSH “were at a clear survival disadvantage during the first [five] years of follow-up.” However, these data were not adjusted for comorbidity.  The consensus committee found fair evidence that treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is beneficial for slowing the loss of bone mineral density. However, committee members found no evidence or insufficient evidence that treatment benefits other outcomes . Quality of Evidence on the Strength of Association and Benefits of Treatment of Subclinical Hyperthyroidism The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The consensus guidelines recommend that patients with abnormal levels of serum TSH be evaluated. Patients who are not receiving levothyroxine and who have serum TSH levels between 0.10 and 0.45 μU per mL (0.10 and 0.45 mU per L) should have a repeat test of serum TSH levels for confirmation. If results of the repeat test are still outside the reference range, testing of FT and T or free T levels should be done in two weeks for patients with atrial fibrillation, known cardiac disease, or other serious medical conditions. Patients who are otherwise healthy can wait three months before repeating these studies. If the patient’s serum TSH level remains between 0.10 and 0.45 μU per mL at follow-up, a radioactive iodine uptake and scan are required to evaluate for endogenous subclinical hyperthyroid disease (i.e., destructive thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, or nodular goiter). Once endogenous disease is excluded, serum TSH measurement can be repeated every three to 12 months. Patients whose serum TSH levels remain stable can discuss with their physician whether their condition requires further evaluation. When the etiology of a low serum TSH level is determined to be excessive levothyroxine replacement therapy, the dosage should be lowered until the serum TSH level is within the reference range, unless serum TSH suppression for thyroid cancer or nodules is the goal. The consensus panel recommends against routine treatment of patients with serum TSH levels between 0.10 and 0.45 μU per mL. However, the panel suggests that physicians might consider treatment in older persons because of the possible association with increased cardiovascular mortality Suggested Approach to Diagnosis and Management of Subclinical Hyperthyroidism The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. When the serum TSH concentration is less than 0.10 μU per mL, evaluation for signs and symptoms of cardiac disease or other urgent medical problems should be performed promptly. Repeat serum TSH testing, along with FT and T or free T testing, should be performed within four weeks. There is insufficient evidence to guide treatment decisions when the serum TSH concentration is less than 0.10 μU per mL, although the panel does recommend that treatment be considered when a low level of serum TSH is caused by Graves’ disease or nodular thyroid disease. The two most common abnormalities encountered in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are spontaneous atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis. The Framingham data showed an increased risk of spontaneous atrial fibrillation in persons older than 60 years who had an undetectable serum TSH level. Using these data, investigators determined that over 10 years the number needed to treat to reduce the risk of spontaneous atrial fibrillation to that of the general population would be 4.2. However, data showing a decrease in the incidence of spontaneous atrial fibrillation or osteoporosis as a direct result of shifting serum TSH into the reference range are not available. There is some evidence that treated patients may benefit from less bone loss. When a low serum TSH concentration is caused by destructive thyroiditis, symptomatic treatment with agents such as beta blockers is sufficient because this condition resolves spontaneously. Abstract Because there are no long-term outcome data for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, it is difficult to state definitive etiologic abnormalities. With a progression rate of only 5 percent per year, it is reasonable to assume that, in many patients, subclinical hypothyroidism may not be caused by the progression of any specific disease state. However, there is good evidence that a significant number of patients with a history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis progress to overt hypothyroidism. Therefore, a finding of subclinical hypothyroidism may represent a point on that continuum, although a causal relationship has not been shown. Other possible causes of subclinical hypothyroidism include protracted recovery from acute thyroiditis, early primary pituitary or hypothalamic disorder, and inadequate levothyroxine replacement therapy in a patient with known hypothyroidism. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt hypothyroidism, and there is fair evidence that serum TSH levels greater than 10 μU per mL (10 mU per L) are associated with elevations in total and lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.  There is insufficient evidence regarding adverse cardiac events, cardiac dysfunction, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or systemic symptoms of hypothyroidism . Quality of Evidence on the Strength of Association and Risk/Benefits of Treatment of Subclinical Hypothyroidism The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. In one study, investigators compared 57 women with subclinical hypothyroidism with 34 healthy control patients, looking at blood pressure, body mass index, levels of fasting TSH, FT, thyroid antibodies, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Women with subclinical hypothyroidism had a higher incidence of diastolic hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, and elevated LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol. The authors of two studies reported increased prevalence of dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and peripheral arterial disease in older men and women with subclinical hypothyroidism. There is only fair evidence to support an association between subclinical hypothyroidism and adverse outcomes in pregnancy. However, the consensus panel recommends screening serum TSH levels in patients who are pregnant or who are planning to become pregnant when there is a family or personal history of thyroid disease, evidence of goiter, symptoms of hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes, or a personal history of autoimmune disorder. Although there are few data, the panel recommends treatment with levothyroxine during pregnancy to maintain serum TSH levels within the reference range, with repeat testing every six to eight weeks. Physiologic requirements of levothyroxine often increase during pregnancy; therefore, women who were receiving therapeutic replacement dosages before becoming pregnant should have their serum TSH level monitored every six to eight weeks during pregnancy. The consensus panel recommends that patients with an elevated serum TSH level have the test repeated, with a serum FT measurement, in no sooner than two weeks but no later than three months. When repeat studies confirm subclinical hypothyroidism, further evaluation is required, including signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, previous treatment for hyperthyroidism (e.g., radiotherapy, partial thyroidectomy), thyromegaly, and family history of thyroid disease. In addition, these patients should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Although the presence of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies increases the chance of progression to overt hypothyroidism, the panel found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against obtaining titers because determining the presence of antibodies does not change management. Asymptomatic patients with serum TSH levels between 4.5 and 10 μU per mL should have a repeat test every six to 12 months. Available data do not support a benefit for early treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism; therefore, the panel does not recommend treatment with levothyroxine for these patients. Also, there is insufficient evidence to support therapeutic intervention in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism whose serum TSH concentration is between 4.5 and 10 μU per mL. However, the panel suggests that patients may try levothyroxine to see if symptoms improve. In this instance, the panel advises that treatment be continued only if there is “clear symptomatic benefit” to the patient. Patients should be monitored to evaluate improvement in symptoms. The panel recommends treatment with levothyroxine for patients with serum TSH levels greater than 10 μU per mL. There is no conclusive evidence that treatment will improve symptoms or associated clinical conditions such as hyperlipidemia; however, because the rate of progression to overt hypothyroidism is 5 percent, treatment may prevent development of symptoms in patients whose FT level becomes low. Suggested Approach to Diagnosis and Management of Subclinical Hypothyroidism The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. In patients who have overt hypothyroidism, who are receiving levothyroxine replacement therapy, who have serum TSH levels greater than 4.5 μU per mL, and have an FT concentration in the reference range, the dosage of levothyroxine should be increased to bring the serum TSH concentration into the reference range. For patients on levothyroxine replacement therapy who experience symptoms of hypothyroidism, and whose serum TSH level is in the upper half of the reference range, it is reasonable to adjust the dosage of levothyroxine until the serum TSH level moves into the lower half of the range.

59645bcc-f267-4dec-bd3a-0b772b66cb4a,"Gallstones and hypothyroidism is there a link? - Thyroid UK I was diagnosed around 5 years ago as being hypothyroid, I've been on T4 only replacement since and never had any symptoms of gallstones untill after going on the T4. It started with what I thought was lactose intolerance and IBS symptoms but I knew it wasn't IBS. After about 2 years of feeling awful my old surgery basically said that the pain from the IBS and acid reflux was all in my head and tried repeatedly to prescribe me antidepressants!! I was furious! I wasn't depressed just worried about my health! So a year after this I moved house and gp surgery too thankfully. Early last year I started having absolutely horrific pain in my right side and across the middle of my stomach. I couldn't move I was in so much pain, sweating, shakes being sick and could barely breath. So went to the new doctors and straight away she said "" I bet it's gallstones"" booked me in for a scan and he presto I had gallstones! I'm now awaiting surgery after having a nasty infection in the gallbladder just before Christmas. I was wondering if it could be due to my hypothyroidism as I have never eaten a hight fat diet? Also has anybody had there gallbladder out with hypothyroidism and if so did u manage to lose weight after? I'm so worried as I struggle so badly with my weight! Thank u all in advance Hypothyroidism increases the chances of gallstones due to elevated cholesterol and impaired emptying of the gallbladder due to a slow metabolism. If you are having an attack it would help if your doctor did a liver function test (LFT). This is taking blood and measuring enzymes, in particular bilirubin. If the problem is gallbladder the LFT result will be massively elevated, confirming the diagnosis. Removing the gallbladder is a very successful operation. IF THE CAUSE IS GALLBLADDER. About half the population develops gallstones and have no symptoms. Removing the gallbladder will have no effect on your weight. That's good news, I'm very worried about gaining weight! Yes my LFT were around 50 at the beginning of last year, when the GP last tested them (before the infection) they were over 500, he said it's due to the gallstones. X I'm a bit confused about your question about gaining weight. Removing your gallbladder will not affect your weight in any way, I hope this clarifies my reply. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. It is a very successful operation provided the symptoms were due to gallbladder in the first place. This seems to be so in your case. They don't remove the gallbladder while it is inflamed, they have to wait until it has settled down. A couple of tips. As this is elective surgery I'd suggest you start a little exercise regime (if you don't have one). Nothing heavy, just some walks or whatever. The fitter you can become the quicker you will recover. It's just a question of gentle exercise. Secondly, after the operation it is a good idea to move around a bit. For the first hour or so you won't be able to do much but after that try moving around the ward (with someone to hold you at first). Then a few hours later you should be able to walk much more. This light exercise is very good as it speeds up your recovery and prevents 'adhesions' which can occur after an operation. You can mention this to your surgeon before the operation and they can advise you. Thank u for the advice, I will try and do a bit of extra walking. I have started bike riding and I have horses so they keep me fairly active. I am only concerned about my weight as some people have reported gaining a lot after surgery, I would guess this is due to being able to eat what they want again. So I shall be careful and try not too fall into that trap. I will speak to my surgeon about adhesions.. what are those out of curiosity? Adhesions are when two tissues stick together. This is more likely after an operation when the scar tissue adheres to surrounding tissue. In some cases this can cause problems. Adhesions are quite common and do occur in people who have never had an operation. You will almost certainly have a laparoscopic cholestectomy (keyhole surgery) which I believe is low risk for adhesions. I really wouldn't worry about adhesions, I'm sure most people are fine. I had an outstanding surgeon and he is keen that his patients prudently move around after their operation as he believes it benefits their recovery. My gall bladder was removed before my diagnosis of underactive thyroid. I struggle with my weight, but more from the thyroid I suspect. yes and if you have hashi's or are under treated, you will be prone to infections and all kinds of other autoimmune disease. You can't have your gallbladder out if you suffer from hypothyroidism, you need those hormones for the operation on your gall bladder, my boyfriend has recently been told this caused the stones to move. I guess I will never know the answer to that one. symptomatically hypothyroid, normal labs (before meds) and am on T3.

96761ac7-aac6-46ea-abfc-561e491d0fb6,"Originally published May 19 2010 An Underactive Thyroid may be Cause of Your High Cholesterol by Deanna Dean (NaturalNews) An estimated 98 million American adults have high cholesterol or total blood cholesterol values of 200 mg/dL or higher. Your doctor may be following the clarion call, insisting you take a statin drug to lower these levels. Both you and your doctor may not be aware that hypothyroidism, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program, is a common secondary cause, after diet, associated with high cholesterol.The Mayo Clinic concurs with medical experts that, ""hypothyroidism may also be associated with an increased risk of heart disease, primarily because high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol - the ""bad"" cholesterol - can occur in people with an underactive thyroid. It is not unusual when low thyroid function is addressed, cholesterol will often return to normal levels.""Hypothyroidism is a condition where too little thyroid hormone is in the bloodstream, and yet of the more than 13 million Americans who have a thyroid disorder, nearly half have been undiagnosed.""The thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate the body's metabolism. If the thyroid gland produces too little hormone, metabolism can slow, having a direct impact on the body's ability to clear cholesterol from the bloodstream. As a result, the risk of cholesterol being deposited in the arteries, especially around the heart, is increased, thereby increasing the risk for heart disease.""Even if your thyroid is under active, and not true hypothyroidism, there can be an increase in total levels, in addition to an impairment of your heart's ability to pump efficiently. Hypothyroidism can also lead to an enlarged heart and heart failure.Tests from the University of Texas-Southwest Medical School, Dallas, TX underscore a clear correlation between and hypercholesterolemia, (high blood cholesterol.) Ninety percent of patients with overt hypothyroidism have increased cholesterol and/or triglycerides. Once hypothyroidism is treated with a hormone replacement, and the TSH level is restored to normal, the majority of patients show an estimated 20 to 30 percent reduction in cholesterol levels.While research shows thyroid stimulating hormones have a positive relationship on cholesterol, the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism on cardiovascular disease are nonetheless under debate. However, most current data suggest that even modest thyroid-stimulating hormone elevations result in improved lipid profiles. Even with adequate treatment of a thyroid condition, there may still be other reasons for your cholesterol to remain above normal, such as diet and genetic factors.- Meet with your doctor and request a TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) blood test, along with T4, T3, Free T4 and Free T3 tests.- At most labs in the U.S., the normal range is from around .3 to 3 as of early 2003. If the TSH level is at the higher end of the range, or above the range, your doctor may determine that you are hypothyroid (underactive thyroid.) If you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, here are some natural supplements to improve your thyroid .Iodine -- You can increase your iodine intake through diet and kelp supplementation. Kelp is rich in iodine. Foods that contain iodine are yogurt, eggs, fish and other seafood, radish, parsley, potatoes, oatmeal and bananas.Selenium -- Many people diagnosed with hypothyroidism were found to be selenium deficient. Selenium deficiency can reduce the activity of the thyroid hormones.Tyrosine -- Tyrosine is an amino acid needed by the body to manufacture thyroid hormones from iodine.Thyroid Glandular -- Thyroid glandular supplements are usually sold through your practitioner.Bladderwrack -- Bladderwrack is a seaweed that is a rich source of iodine that is thought to stimulate the thyroid gland increasing metabolism.If you have , have your doctor check your thyroid before taking drugs.Your healthmate,Deanna DeanPMID: 11832675 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]American Association of Clinical EndocrinologistsClinic/Feld S, Dickey RA.University of Texas-Southwest Medical School, Dallas, TX 75248.By Howard LeWine, M.D., Harvard Health Publications/Milionis HJ, Tambaki AP, Kanioglou CN, Elisaf MS, Tselepis AD, Tsatsoulis A.Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.Deanna Dean is the Wellness Director for Your Health Coach, a company dedicated to health and wellness education. website: yourhealthcoachdee.com Dee is a Wellness & Weight Loss Coach, a Certified Natural Health Professional, is pursuing an ND degree-Naturopathic Doctor, is a certified Raw Chef, certified in Dietary Guidelines from the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research, former Personal Trainer, Yoga and Fitness Studio Owner, TV and Radio Guest, Health Columnist.Deanna develops customized programs to enhance the health of her clients, educates, and coaches dieters for safe weight loss.

35076372-eea1-40bf-b073-502f5a2612bc,"How Do I Get More Iodine & Zinc in My Diet Without Meat? What Foods & Supplements Are Good for Raising Hemoglobin Levels? Located in your lower neck, your thyroid gland helps regulate your metabolism and release needed hormones into the bloodstream. For most people, a balanced diet that includes essential vitamins and minerals supports the healthy function of the thyroid. In some, however, this gland becomes sluggish because of a nutrient deficiency, genetic factors, an autoimmune condition or age. The result is a condition known as hypothyroidism, which can cause symptoms like weight gain, fatigue and mental fog. Talk to your doctor or dietitian about nutrients to help improve the function of an underactive thyroid. The mineral iodine is the most vital nutrient for thyroid health; without it, your body can’t produce thyroid hormones. Adults require at least 150 micrograms of iodine daily in their diets, and a deficiency over time can lead to an underactive thyroid or enlargement of the gland, also called a goiter. To get ample iodine in your diet, incorporate these rich food sources into your meals: Sea vegetables, including kelp, dulse, kombu and nori Many supermarkets carry shakers of sea vegetable flakes, which can be sprinkled onto vegetables and other foods for added flavoring. Another mineral that assists with thyroid function is selenium. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism suggests a link between selenium deficiency and risk of thyroid disorders. Healthy adults need just 55 micrograms a day. Seafood, eggs and dairy are good food choices for selenium as well as iodine. The richest source is Brazil nuts, but don’t go overboard: Just one Brazil nut gives you more selenium than a healthy person needs in a day. Your thyroid also needs adequate iron in the diet to function properly, and low levels of this mineral may go hand in hand with a slow thyroid. Women in their childbearing years need 18 milligrams daily, while adult men need just 8 milligrams. Good dietary sources of iron include: Fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants like vitamin C are smart dietary choices for boosting thyroid function. Berries are among the fruits highest in antioxidant content; toss them into a cup of yogurt for breakfast or a snack. Serve a main course of wild-caught fish with a side of squash or sauteed bell peppers for a thyroid-friendly dinner. Cruciferous veggies – broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale and Brussels sprouts – may interfere with thyroid function when you have an underactive gland. Because these veggies are among the most nutrient-rich you can eat, don’t avoid them completely but choose them much less often than others. Additional foods to limit include: Milton S. Hershey Medical Center: Hypothyroidism Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism: Low Population Selenium Status Is Associated with Increased Prevalence of Thyroid Disease Clinical Thyroidology: Iron Deficiency Anemia in Patients with Subclinical Hypothyroidism Paula Martinac is a nutrition educator, writer and coach.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine thyroidectomized patients underwent neuropsychological testing and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of their brains with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD), a lipophilic cerebral blood flow radiotracer, while hypothyroid, and again following thyroid hormone replacement. Neuropsychological test scores and TSH levels while hypothyroid were correlated with rCBF in hypothyroid-affected areas of the brain. RESULTS: Correlations were found during hypothyroidism between the noted parameters and ECD radiotracer accumulation in the following respective regions, all of which demonstrated hypothyroid-related cerebral blood flow (CBF) aberrations: TSH and left middle occipital gyrus; psychomotor performance speed and left precentral gyrus; and depression and right middle frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right insula, and left thalamus. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of psychomotor impairment and depression, and TSH level during hypothyroidism appeared to correlate with CBF to brain regions associated with motor activity, mood and vision, respectively; and previously shown to manifest significantly altered rCBF during hypothyroidism.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the most common type of this health problem. It is an autoimmune disease. It occurs when your body makes antibodies that attack the cells in your thyroid. The thyroid gland becomes overrun with white blood cells and becomes scarred. This makes the gland feel firm and rubbery. The thyroid then can’t make enough of the thyroid hormone. Many people with this problem have an underactive thyroid gland. That’s also known as hypothyroidism. They have to take medicine to keep their thyroid hormone levels normal. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder. Normally, your immune system protects your body by attacking bacteria and viruses. But with this disease, your immune system attacks your thyroid gland by mistake. Your thyroid then can’t make enough thyroid hormone, so your body can’t work as well. Things that may make it more likely to you for to get Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are: Women are about 8 times more likely to have the disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis sometimes begins during pregnancy. The condition may get better in some women during pregnancy. But then it returns after delivery. Most cases happen between ages 40 and 60. But it has been seen in younger people. Having a family member with the disease (heredity). The disease tends to run in families. But no gene has been found that carries it. These health problems raise a person’s risk. Some examples are rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. Having this type of thyroiditis puts you at higher risk for other autoimmune illnesses. Each person’s symptoms may vary. Symptoms may include: This is an enlargement of your thyroid gland. It causes a bulge on your neck. It is not cancer. But it can cause problems such as pain or trouble with swallowing, breathing, or speaking. When your thyroid doesn’t make enough thyroid hormone, it can cause these symptoms: When the thyroid is attacked by antibodies, it may at first make more thyroid hormone. This is called Hashitoxicosis. It does not happen to everyone. But it can cause these symptoms:  These symptoms may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Your healthcare provider will ask about your health history and give you a physical exam. You will also have blood tests. These can measure your thyroid hormone levels and check for some antibodies to proteins in the thyroid. Treatment will depend on your symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. You will not need treatment if your thyroid hormone levels are normal. But Hashimoto's thyroiditis can cause an underactive thyroid gland. If so, it can be treated with medicine. The medicine replaces lost thyroid hormone. That should stop your symptoms. It can also ease a goiter if you have one. A goiter can cause problems such as pain or trouble swallowing, breathing, or speaking. If these symptoms don’t get better, you may need surgery to remove the goiter. Tell your healthcare provider if your symptoms get worse or you have new symptoms. Hashimoto's thyroiditis can cause your thyroid to not make enough thyroid hormone. It is an autoimmune disease. It occurs when your body makes antibodies that attack the cells in your thyroid. Symptoms may include an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), tiredness, weight gain, and muscle weakness. You don’t need treatment if your thyroid hormone levels are normal. If you have an underactive thyroid, medicine can help. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider: Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.

What is an endocrine gland / endocrine system? The endocrine system is made up of a series of glands that produce chemicals called hormones. Thyroid gland is one of the many endocrine glands such as adrenal, pituitary, pancreas, testes, etc. What is Underactive Thyroid or Hypothyroidism or Hypothyroid? Deficiency of the thyroid hormone (Thyroxine) is called Hypothyroidism or Hypothyroid. It is one of those conditions which is often present for many years before it can be recognized and treated effectively. Estimated one in every 50 females and one in 1000 men tend to suffer with this condition. Underactive Thyroid is also called Hypothyroidism. What are the types of Underactive Thyroid? : Here the problem lies in the thyroid gland and hence it fails to produce sufficient hormones due to certain causes. : In this type, the pituitary gland is at fault and it is unable to produce sufficient quantity of TSH. Lack of TSH in turn causes decreased production of T3 and T4 by the thyroid gland due to lack of stimulus from the pituitary. What are the causes of Underactive Thyroid? Primary Hypothyroidism or Underactive thyroid can be caused due to several reasons such as follows: Secondary hypothyroidism is commonly caused by the following: How stress is related to Underactive Thyroid? Stress is the commonest trigger for thyroid dysfunction: Read more in details on: What are the symptoms of Underactive Thyroid? The symptoms of hypothyroidism are frequently missed out and especially in elderly females these are mistaken to be symptoms of menopause. The beginning of the symptoms is often not noted markedly and hence the condition remains under-diagnosed. Patient may experience few of the following symptoms: Fatigue, exhaustion, weakness, unexplained weight gain, cold intolerance Severe mood swings, depression, memory loss, irritability, reduced concentration Abnormal menstrual cycles, increased menstrual flow Patient may have any kind of combination of the symptoms mentioned above depending on the duration and severity of the condition. Occasionally patient may be asymptomatic or may be having very subtle symptoms. How is Underactive Thyroid diagnosed? Diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be established based on the results of tests done to measure the levels of these hormones in the blood. T3, T4 (levels of thyroid hormones) in the blood Thyroid stimulating hormone levels (TSH) Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies Ultrasonography (USG) of the neck and thyroid. To read more in details about the  What is sub-clinical and clinical Hypothyroidism? The sub-clinical cases have an elevated TSH with a normal T3 and/or T4 The clinical cases have an elevated TSH and a low T4 and/or T3 What are the complications of an untreated Underactive Thyroid? If left untreated, hypothyroidism can lead to several other health issues like: To read more in details about the complications, refer:  I am a case of Underactive Thyroid, why am I not able to lose weight, on the contrary I am putting on more weight? The main purpose of the thyroid hormone is to run the body's metabolism, in case of underactive Thyroid, the metabolism is slowed down which leads to excess weight gain, accumulation of fat and water. Once you start responding to the treatment, one can expect so see a change in the weight as well. Does every woman with Underactive Thyroid have to worry about infertility? Undiagnosed and untreated thyroid disease can be a cause for infertility or recurrent miscarriage as it causes anovulation (failure to ovulate). Once the thyroid is corrected, and ovulation is occurring, fertility is usually very good and one can continue with the pregnancy. I have Underactive Thyroid, what are the chances of my child having it? Genetics do play a role in Underactive Thyroid, if one of the family members has Underactive Thyroid, then you have more chances of having it. What are the other conditions associated with Underactive Thyroid? Usually associated with other auto-immune disorder like insulin dependent diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, etc Gout Addison's disease PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) I am a case of Underactive Thyroid, what kind of diet do I need to take and what should I avoid? Food items that can are helpful for thyroid functions are: carrots, spinach, apricots, asparagus, olive oil, avocado, sunflower seeds, whole grain cereals, bananas, oily fish Food item that may interfere with iodine uptake are and should not be taken in high quantity are: cabbage, kale, broccoli, kohirabi, mustard, lima beans, linseed, sweet potato, peanuts, soy products, so keep these to a minimum. Avoid Stimulants like caffeine drinks like coffee, cola; avoid stimulants like smoking and alcohol as these all effect the thyroid function. Reduce Stress: Stress is a major factor and is thought to be a contributing factor to the development of hypothyroidism. What is the conventional treatment for Underactive Thyroid? Conventional treatment is basically a Thyroid Replacement therapy Hypothyroidism is treated with the levorotatory forms of thyroxine (levothyroxine) (L-T4) and triiodothyronine (liothyronine) (L-T3). There are several different treatment protocols in thyroid-replacement therapy: T4 only: This treatment involves supplementation of levothyroxine alone, in a synthetic form. It is currently the standard treatment in mainstream medicine. T4 and T3 in combination: This treatment protocol involves administering both synthetic L-T4 and L-T3 simultaneously in combination. Why do you suggest Homeopathy for Underactive Thyroid? Homeopathic treatment aims at stimulating the Thyroid gland to produce its own thyroid hormones. External supply of the hormone is not the treatment but an arrangement. We are trying to correct the internal imbalance. This is possible in many cases if not all. If achieved successfully, lifelong need for thyroid supplement may not be required. If I am on conventional treatment, can I still start with Homeopathy? Yes. Most cases of Underactive Thyroid who are on the conventional therapy for less then two years can start with homeopathy. Do they interact with conventional medicines? No. Homeopathic medicines can be safely taken with the conventional medicines. Can my conventional medicines be stopped? Those patients on thyroid supplement for more than two years, stopping the conventional medicines will not be possible. Those patients on thyroid supplement for less than two years, we are able to reduce it, keeping a check on the thyroid hormone levels. What change can I expect in my Thyroid state once I start with Homeopathy? One can expect the TSH levels to reduce, further giving a relief in the intensity of the symptoms. Patients who are on thyroid supplement may take time to reduce the supplement, keeping a watch on the thyroid hormone levels. Early cases(less then two years) can find an alternative to life long thyroid supplements. What is the success rate in treating Underactive Thyroid with Homeopathy? Few Limitations of homeopathy in treating Underactive thyroidism are: Homeopathic treatment works in early cases of Underactive Thyroid Those patients on thyroid supplement for more that two years may not show results The treatment works if the thyroid gland has some inherent capacity to get activated. How long do I have to be on your treatment? The total length of treatment varies form case to case, depending of the following factors: Duration of Underactive Thyroid (We are able to produce best results in the cases up to three years duration) Extent of dysfunction (Levels of TSH and T3, T4 hormones) Concurrent thyroid supplement.( Patients who are on thyroid supplement for more than 2 years do not respond to homeopathy) Age of the patient: Our experience is that that patients below 45 respond better Our Homeopathy treatment is now just a few clicks away.

6add5b32-5eae-4f49-be21-870381a20714,"You may be surprised to learn that the most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S. isn’t one of the statins or a blood pressure drug—it’s levothyroxine, a synthetic version of a thyroid hormone (called thyroxine, or T4) that’s used to treat an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). It is taken by morethan 15 percent of older Americans, and its use has been rising over the years. Why is levothyroxine prescribed so much? Largely because many health care providers include a test for thyroid function when they order routine blood work for their older patients, especially women, even though routine thyroid screening is controversial. Such screening often leads to the discovery of “abnormal” findings and to drug treatment that has not been demonstrated to be beneficial except in a minority of people. In recent decades, many Americans and their doctors have been overly keen on “replacing” hormones that tend to decline with age, whether it’s , , or thyroid hormone. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, when there were no accurate blood tests to measure thyroid hormones, many doctors all-too-readily prescribed thyroid hormones for general symptoms such as “low energy” and weight gain. Everyone now realizes that was a mistake, since the prescribed hormones can themselves have serious side effects (such as bone loss and cardiac problems) when not properly dosed and monitored. Now doctors have accurate tests for thyroid hormones, but concerns still remain about over-diagnosis and overtreatment. For a small organ, the thyroid gland can cause lots of problems if it is under- or overactive. Located in the neck just below the Adam’s apple, the butterfly-shaped gland produces hormones (mostly T4) that regulate metabolism and affect almost every bodily function, including cell growth, heart rate, breathing, and bone remodeling, as well as the cardiovascular, reproductive, and central nervous systems. Most of these systems slow down if thyroid hormones are insufficient. The thyroid works with parts of the brain, notably the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, to help regulate hormone production. There are two main types of thyroid dysfunction: thyroidism (underactive thyroid) and thyroidism (overactive thyroid; see inset). Hypothyroidism, an underproduction of thyroid hormones, is usually caused by an autoimmune disorder (Hashimoto’s disease), which causes the body to produce antibodies that identify thyroid tissue as foreign and destroy it. It also occurs as a result of iodine deficiency, surgical removal of the thyroid (due to cancer, for instance), or the use of certain medications. Symptoms vary, depending on the age of onset and the severity and duration of the hormone deficiency. They include fatigue, sluggishness, weight gain, memory problems, hair loss, depression, difficulty sleeping and swallowing, constipation, muscle pain, mood swings, dry skin, menstrual irregularity, intolerance to cold, hoarseness, and muscle weakness or cramps. Untreated hypothyroidism can cause enlargement of the thyroid (goiter) and high cholesterol levels (see inset). In older people, the disorder may cause confusion and thus may be misdiagnosed as dementia. In pregnant women, an underactive thyroid increases the risk of premature labor, fetal damage, low-birth-weight babies, and miscarriage. Hypothyroidism is almost always treated with levothyroxine. It’s estimated that 5 to 10 percent of American adults have at least some degree of thyroid dysfunction, though most often it is “subclinical” and undiagnosed. Hypothyroidism is much more common than hyperthyroidism, and the risk increases markedly at older ages. Women are five to eight times more likely to have hypothyroidism than men. Having an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes or , increases the risk, as does a family history of thyroid or autoimmune disease. Hypothyroidism caused by iodine deficiency, which was common a century ago, is no longer a significant problem in the U.S. and Canada, since iodine is now widely dispersed in the food supply, primarily via . Other than iodine deficiency and ), thyroid dysfunction is not caused by modifiable factors such as diet or lack of exercise. Hyperthyroidism: When Your Thyroid is an Overachiever Hyperthyroidism: When Your Thyroid is an Overachiever An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) revs up your metabolism, causing symptoms such as nervousness, rapid or irregular heart rate, weight loss, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, muscle weakness, and bulging eyes. Your doctor can check for thyroid problems by evaluating your symptoms (if any) and doing a physical exam. However, hypothyroidism may be hard to spot, since symptoms can be mild or nonexistent. In addition, many of the symptoms, such as fatigue, are vague and can also be caused by a variety of other common ailments, especially in older people, which can lead to misdiagnosis. The primary blood test to screen for thyroid dysfunction measures thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the release of hormones by the thyroid. When the thyroid does not secrete enough hormones, the pituitary normally prods it to produce more by increasing TSH. This is why high TSH usually indicates hypothyroidism; low TSH, hyperthyroidism. Normal TSH levels can vary markedly from person to person as well as from season to season, day to day, even hour to hour. Factors such as age, sex, and overall health play large roles. Some medications, such as corticosteroids and dopamine, can alter thyroid function and thus TSH values. For all these reasons, if TSH results are only mildly to moderately abnormal, the test should be repeated over several months to confirm the finding. In about one-third of people, elevated TSH levels return to normal within a few years without treatment. If you have persistently high TSH, testing of thyroid hormone (T4) can differentiate between subclinical (with normal T4 level) and “overt” (with low T4 level) hypothyroidism. If your TSH is high and T4 low, that indicates that your thyroid is inadequately responding to TSH stimulation. Routine screening—that is, testing all people or just all older women, even if they have no symptoms or risk factors—for thyroid problems remains controversial. It’s clear that testing should be done if people have symptoms or signs that may indicate thyroid problems, but many doctors commonly include TSH as part of routine blood work. Some medical groups recommend routine screening, at least for certain groups. For instance, the advises screening everyone over age 35 every five years. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists advises screening older people, especially women. But in 2015 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded, as it had a decade earlier, that there was inadequate evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routinely screening people without symptoms or clinical signs. Since it couldn’t determine if such screening is beneficial overall, it did not recommend for or against it. While severe hypothyroidism requires treatment, there is much debate among experts about how to define and whether to treat the milder, subclinical forms. Indeed, there’s even debate about where the upper (and lower) limit for “normal” TSH range should be drawn, especially in older people, who are much more likely to have some degree of hypothyroidism. Most labs use a range of 0.4 to 4.5 or 5.0 as normal. TSH higher than that, with normal T4 level, is generally categorized as subclinical hypothyroidism, though some experts think that TSH over 2.5 should be considered elevated. If elevated TSH is accompanied by low T4 hormone level, or if TSH is very high (above 10), drug treatment is usually initiated. As the USPSTF pointed out, it isn’t currently possible to differentiate people with subclinical hypothyroidism who will have a significant worsening of thyroid function from those whose TSH levels will remain stable or even normalize. Even so, it noted, “Clinicians seem to be treating more persons with thyroid dysfunction, at earlier times after initial diagnosis, and at TSH levels closer to normal.” If you have high LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, your doctor should check to see if you have hypothyroidism, especially if you are a woman over 60. If so, it makes sense to treat the thyroid condition first, rather than take cholesterol-lowering medication. Overt hypothyroidism poses known health risks, notably to the cardiovascular system. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the link between hypothyroidism and cardiovascular disease, including increases in lipids and inflammation and a negative impact on blood vessels. However, research has been inconsistent about the adverse effects of subclinical hypothyroidism (that is, elevated TSH but normal T4). During the past 20 years, many observational studies have linked it to atherosclerosis and increased risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cardiac dysfunction, but others have not. What about research on levothyroxine as a treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism? Few, if any, well-designed clinical trials have found benefits from such treatment. Notably, a large Scottish placebo-controlled in the in 2017 found that treating older people with subclinical hypothyroidism for at least a year produced no reduction in symptoms, including no improvement in energy level, body weight, physical or mental function, and quality of life. Still, it found no adverse effects from the drug, the use of which was carefully monitored. You should be screened if you have symptoms or signs that suggest thyroid dysfunction, have a family history of thyroid problems, or have a personal or family history of autoimmune disease (such as type 1 diabetes). Other indications for screening include having had radiation to the neck, or use of lithium or certain other medications. Even if you don’t fall into one of these categories, if you’re a woman over 60 or are pregnant, talk to your doctor about thyroid screening. If you have hypothyroidism and have been put on levothyroxine, you must be monitored to make sure your dosage is correct. Many people are inadvertently given doses that are too high—in effect, producing , which has its own risks. If you only have subclinical hypothyroidism, you and your doctor should be cautious about starting medication—and if you have been taking levothyroxine, discuss whether it is really necessary. Many people take the drug for years without proper reevaluation. © 2021",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-9.50714111328125,87

To check for previous infection - Antibody Blood Test Understand what an underactive thyroid is and how it can be treated. An underactive thyroid gland also referred to as hypothyroidism, is a condition in which your thyroid does not produce enough hormones (1).  Briefly, the thyroid is a small gland positioned in front of your windpipe. It creates hormones that provide energy to your organs, and regulate your heartbeat, digestive system and many other bodily functions. The hormones are called triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and without these, your body begins to slow down.  An underactive thyroid can occur in both men and women at any age but is more common in women over 60. 1 in 20 women of this age have hypothyroidism (2). Some babies can also be born with it, so the UK uses blood spot tests to screen babies at five days old.  Hypothyroidism could have many causes, including:  Immune system problems – autoimmune thyroid disease is a process in which your immune system attacks your thyroid gland, reducing its ability to produce hormones. The common name for this is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Response to treatments – some cancer treatments that target the neck and head can damage your thyroid glands. Or, if an overactive thyroid gland is removed, you may need replacement hormones for life.  Certain medicines – Medicines and supplements with large amounts of iodine, lithium used to treat mental health, and amiodarone used to treat heart problems could all cause hypothyroidism (3).  Low thyroid hormones result in your mental and physical processes slowing down. The symptoms of an underactive thyroid are often similar to other conditions and develop slowly, so may go unnoticed for years. Common symptoms include:  The intensity in which signs and symptoms appear indicates the severity of the condition. However, many early symptoms are common with ageing, which often leads to women and doctors mistaking hypothyroidism with menopause (4). Typically, this condition is diagnosed with a consultation, physical examination and blood tests.    Your doctor will evaluate your medical history and check for physical signs such as dry skin, slow reflexes, swelling, and a slow heart rate etc. (5). If you have any thyroid or autoimmune conditions in your family, it is important to tell your doctor.  A blood test is a very accurate method of diagnosing an underactive thyroid. This condition causes high levels of a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low levels of thyroxine (T4) (6). However, there is a spectrum in thyroid disorders, so other tests may be necessary.  Check out Medichecks’ range of or read if you need help choosing which test is most suitable for you.  An underactive thyroid is a lifelong condition, but the symptoms can be treated with daily hormone medication. Lifestyle changes may also help you to control your symptoms.  Levothyroxine is hormone replacement medication which raises your thyroxine (T4) levels to be normal. It has minimal side-effects when taken in the right dose. Dosages are dependant on your weight and blood results. Your doctor will take regular blood tests to measure the correct dose and then monitor your hormone levels annually. Once you have begun treatment and your hormones are restored, your symptoms should improve within several weeks.  A balanced diet with a few specific foods is known to improve hypothyroidism. Your thyroid needs iodine and protein to function correctly. These are found in whole grains, beans, saltwater fish, kelp, eggs, meat and seaweed. Take care with iodine quantities, as having too much can be as harmful to the thyroid as too little. Eating soy-based foods can also affect how well your thyroid gland is working but is often unnoticeable in most people (7). When eating products such as tofu, vegan meats and cheeses, and soy milk, try to keep your intake at a stable level. Visit for a comprehensive overview of the thyroid diet. An underactive thyroid can cause problems if it is not treated appropriately or early enough. The condition causes the heart to slow down, and with time, can weaken it or cause permanent damage (8).  Hypothyroidism also commonly occurs with other autoimmune diseases such as  Women with the condition can have healthy pregnancies; however, if they are not undergoing treatment, they may face some complications. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism in pregnancy can cause a range of problems including miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and developmental problems in the newborn child. If you are planning a pregnancy and have an underactive thyroid, it is important to check that your hormone levels are normal. As soon as you are pregnant, you should visit your GP to discuss arranging antenatal care. It is likely that your levothyroxine dose will increase and your target TSH level will be lower than before (9). If you have any concerns or are experiencing any symptoms related to an underactive thyroid, visit your doctor.

8caf7c0d-a553-4421-8275-f18fed39b892,"Iodine is an essential mineral commonly found in seafood. Your thyroid gland uses it to make thyroid hormones, which help control growth, repair damaged cells and support a healthy metabolism (, ). Unfortunately, up to a third of people worldwide are at risk of an iodine deficiency (). People who live in countries where there is very little iodine in the soil. This includes South Asia, Southeast Asia, New Zealand and European countries. On the other hand, iodine deficiencies are rare in the US, where there are sufficient levels of the mineral in the food supply (). An iodine deficiency can cause uncomfortable and even severe symptoms. They include swelling in the neck, pregnancy-related issues, weight gain and learning difficulties. Its symptoms are very similar to those of , or low thyroid hormones. Since iodine is used to make thyroid hormones, an iodine deficiency means your body can’t make enough of them, leading to hypothyroidism. Here are 10 signs and symptoms of an iodine deficiency. Swelling in the front of the neck is the most common symptom of an iodine deficiency. This is called a goiter and occurs when the thyroid gland grows too big. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes thyroid hormones upon receiving a signal from the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (, ). When blood levels of TSH rise, the thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. However, when your body is low in iodine, it can’t make enough of them (). To compensate, the thyroid gland works harder to try to make more. This causes the cells to grow and multiply, eventually leading to a goiter. Fortunately, most cases can be treated by increasing your iodine intake. However, if a goiter hasn’t been treated for many years, it might cause permanent thyroid damage. Swelling in the front of the neck, or a goiter, is a common symptom of an iodine deficiency. It occurs when your thyroid gland is forced to make thyroid hormones when there is a low supply of iodine in the body. Unexpected weight gain is another sign of an iodine deficiency. It may occur if the body does not have enough iodine to make thyroid hormones. This is because thyroid hormones help control the speed of your metabolism, which is the process by which your body converts food into energy and heat (, ). When your thyroid hormone levels are low, your body burns fewer calories at rest. Unfortunately, this means more calories from the foods you eat are stored as fat (, ). Adding more iodine to your diet may help reverse the effects of a slow metabolism, as it can help your body make more thyroid hormones. Low iodine levels may slow your metabolism and encourage food to be stored as fat, rather than be burned as energy. This may lead to weight gain. Fatigue and weakness are also common symptoms of an iodine deficiency. In fact, some studies have found that nearly 80% of people with low thyroid hormone levels, which occur in cases of iodine deficiency, feel tired, sluggish and weak (). These symptoms occur because thyroid hormones help the body make energy. When thyroid hormone levels are low, the body can’t make as much energy as it usually does. This may cause your energy levels to plummet and leave you feeling weak. In fact, a study in 2,456 people found that fatigue and weakness were the most common symptoms among those with low or slightly low thyroid hormone levels (). Low iodine levels may leave you feeling tired, sluggish and weak. This is because your body needs the mineral to make energy. Thyroid hormones help control the growth of hair follicles. When your thyroid hormone levels are low, your hair follicles may stop regenerating. Over time, this may result in hair loss (). For this reason, people with an iodine deficiency may also suffer from hair loss (). One study in 700 people found that 30% of those with low thyroid hormone levels experienced hair loss (). However, other studies have found that low thyroid hormone levels only seem to cause hair loss in those with a family history of hair loss (). If you experience hair loss because of an iodine deficiency, getting enough of this mineral may help correct your thyroid hormone levels and stop hair loss. An iodine deficiency may prevent hair follicles from regenerating. Fortunately, getting sufficient iodine can help correct hair loss that occurs due to an iodine deficiency. Dry, flaky skin may affect many people with an iodine deficiency. In fact, some studies have found that up to 77% of people with low thyroid hormone levels may experience dry, flaky skin (). Thyroid hormones, which contain iodine, help your skin cells regenerate. When thyroid hormone levels are low, this regeneration doesn’t occur as often, possibly leading to dry, flaky skin (). Additionally, thyroid hormones help the body regulate sweat. People with lower thyroid hormone levels, such as those with an iodine deficiency, tend to sweat less than people with normal thyroid hormone levels (, ). Given that sweat helps keep your skin moist and hydrated, a lack of sweat may be another reason why dry, flaky skin is a common symptom of iodine deficiency. Dry, flaky skin may occur with an iodine deficiency, as the mineral helps your skin cells regenerate. It also helps your body sweat and hydrates your skin cells, so an iodine deficiency can cause you to sweat less. Feeling cold is a common symptom of an iodine deficiency. In fact, some studies have found that over 80% of people with low thyroid hormone levels may feel more sensitive to cold temperatures than usual (). Since iodine is used to make thyroid hormones, an iodine deficiency can cause your thyroid hormone levels to plummet. Given that thyroid hormones help control the speed of your metabolism, low thyroid hormone levels may cause it to slow down. A slower metabolism generates less heat, which may cause you to feel colder than usual (, ). Also, thyroid hormones help boost the activity of your brown fat, a type of fat that specializes in generating heat. This means that low thyroid hormone levels, which may be caused by an iodine deficiency, could prevent brown fat from doing its job (, ). Iodine helps generate body heat, so low levels of it may leave you feeling colder than usual. Your heart rate is a measure of how many times your heart beats per minute. It may be affected by your iodine levels. Too little of this mineral could cause your heart to beat slower than usual, while too much of it could cause your heart to beat faster than usual (, ). A severe iodine deficiency may cause an abnormally slow heart rate. This could make you feel weak, fatigued, dizzy and possibly cause you to faint (). An iodine deficiency may slow your heart rate, which may leave you feeling weak, fatigued, dizzy and at risk of fainting. An iodine deficiency may affect your ability to learn and remember (, , ). A study including over 1,000 adults found that those with higher thyroid hormone levels performed better on learning and memory tests, compared to those with lower thyroid hormone levels (). Thyroid hormones help your brain grow and develop. That’s why an iodine deficiency, which is required to make thyroid hormones, can reduce brain development (). In fact, studies have found that the hippocampus, the part of the brain that controls long-term memory, appears to be smaller in people with low thyroid hormone levels (). An iodine deficiency at any age may cause you to struggle to learn and remember things. One possible reason for this might be an underdeveloped brain. Pregnant women are at a high risk of iodine deficiency. This is because they need to consume enough to meet their own daily needs, as well as the needs of their growing baby. The increased demand for iodine continues throughout lactation, as babies receive iodine through breast milk (). Not consuming enough iodine throughout pregnancy and lactation may cause side effects for both the mother and baby. Mothers may experience symptoms of an underactive thyroid, such as a goiter, weakness, fatigue and feeling cold. Meanwhile, an iodine deficiency in infants may stunt physical growth and brain development (). Furthermore, a severe iodine deficiency may increase the risk of stillbirth (). Getting enough iodine is especially important for pregnant and breastfeeding women, as they have higher needs. An iodine deficiency may cause severe side effects, especially for the baby, such as stunted growth and brain development. Heavy and irregular menstrual bleeding may occur as a result of an iodine deficiency (). Like most symptoms of iodine deficiency, this is also related to low levels of thyroid hormones, given that iodine is needed to make thyroid hormones. In one study, 68% of women with low thyroid hormone levels experienced irregular menstrual cycles, compared to only 12% of healthy women (). Research also shows that women with low thyroid hormone levels experience more frequent menstrual cycles with heavy bleeding. This is because low thyroid hormone levels disrupt the signals of hormones that are involved in the menstrual cycle (, ). Some women with an iodine deficiency may experience heavy or irregular periods. This is because low thyroid hormone levels may interfere with hormones that are involved in regulating the menstrual cycle. There are very few good sources of iodine in the diet. This is one reason why iodine deficiency is . The recommended daily intake (RDI) is 150 mcg per day. This amount should meet the needs of 97–98% of all healthy adults. However, pregnant or breastfeeding women need more. Pregnant women need 220 mcg daily, while lactating women need 290 mcg daily (). The foods below are excellent sources of iodine (): 11–1,989% of the RDI 47% of the RDI is usually a great source of iodine, but this depends on where it came from. Seaweed from some countries, such as Japan, are rich in iodine (). Smaller amounts of this mineral are also found in a variety of foods like , shellfish, beef, chicken, lima and pinto beans, and other dairy products. The best way to get enough iodine is to add iodized salt to your meals. Half a teaspoon (3 grams) over the course of the day is enough to avoid a deficiency. If you think you have an iodine deficiency, it’s best to consult your doctor. They will check for signs of swelling (a goiter) or take a urine sample to check your iodine levels (). Iodine is found in very few foods, which is one reason why deficiency is common. Most healthy adults need 150 mcg per day, but pregnant and lactating women need more to meet the needs of their growing babies. Iodine deficiencies are very common, especially in Europe and Third World countries, where the soil and food supply have low iodine levels. Your body uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. That’s why an iodine deficiency can cause hypothyroidism, a condition in which the body can’t make enough thyroid hormones. Luckily, deficiency is easy to prevent. Adding a dash of iodized salt to your main meals should help you meet your requirements. If you think you have an iodine deficiency, it’s best to talk to your doctor. They will check for visible signs of an iodine deficiency, like a goiter, or take a urine sample. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that can build up in your body if taken in excess amounts.

3e315e0e-3fcb-4523-872f-7b407076f929,"by January is thyroid disease awareness month, and since an estimated 25 million people in the U.S. have various thyroid problems, I thought it would be a good idea to get an expert update on this often over-looked gland. Victor Bernet, FACP, is Director of the National Capitol Consortium Endocrinology Fellowship at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and the author of MKSAP 15’s chapter on disorders ofthe thyroid gland. I interviewed him about why thyroid disorders go undiagnosed, what alternative treatments are available, and how primary care physicians and specialists can work together to manage thyroid disease. Please listen to the audio of our conversation or check out the written summary below. It is estimated that more than 25 million Americans have thyroid disease, and as many as half the people with thyroid problems don’t even know it. In your view, what are the main reasons why so many thyroid disorders go undiagnosed? : I think the number is large because it includes mild cases of hypo- and hyperthyroidism as well as nodules that don’t necessarily have symptoms, and when they do, they come on so slowly that people misattribute them to other things. Take for example an elderly person with hypothyroidism. They may attribute their fatigue to normal aging. Clinically significant cases of thyroid disease are often missed because we don’t screen for thyroid disease in the U.S. That’s because the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that screening asymptomatic people with blood tests like TSH does not ultimately improve outcomes. However, some professional groups like the ATA (American Thyroid Association) and the ACP (American College ofPhysicians) think it’s prudent to screen at-risk subgroups such as the elderly, pregnant women, children with genetic syndromes like Down’s or Klinefelter’s, or people with a family history of autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Graves Disease). Should thyroid self-exams be recommended to the general population? What are the chances that a self-exam will turn up something clinically relevant? : Studies have shown that in patients between the ages of 50 and 60, a physician’s clinical neck exam had only an 8% chance of detecting a nodule. With ultrasound, detection dramatically increases. It’s estimated that thyroid nodules are naturally occurring in about 40% of 65-year-olds. But most of those nodules aren’t clinically relevant, so ultrasound screening is not recommended for the general population. The AACE (American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists) does recommend thyroid self-exams and offers pamphlets to patients who want to check their own necks. However, research hasn’t shown that self-exams help to find clinically significant disease early nor improve outcomes. Still, thyroid self-exams don’t have much of a downside, although patients and even primary care doctors sometimes feel things incorrectly, and unnecessary evaluations to include biopsies can result. For example, neck cartilage can be mistaken for a nodule. There seems to be some controversy regarding how todiagnose hypothyroidism. Some say TSH is sufficient. Others also checkfree T3 and T4, while others may have different ideas about TSH levelsrequired for a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. What does the currentevidence suggest about how doctors should perform and interpret thyroid tests? : TSH is a great screening test for patients who have no symptoms. However, once a patient is complaining of symptoms of hypothyroidism, then you need to get a free T4 level along with the TSH. That will assure that you don’t miss a rare “central hypothyroidism” where the TSH may not be reliable. As far as free T3 levels are concerned, they usually aren’t affected until hypothyroidism is extremely severe, so free T3 doesn’t really have a role in the hypothyroid patient. It’s a more relevant test for hyperthyroid patients. As far as TSH goals are concerned, historically the normal range has been about 0.45 mIU/L or 0.5 mIU/L to 4.5 mIU/L or 5.0 mIU/L. However, the very large NHANES study showed that actually most Americans, especially those confirmed not to have any underlying thyroid disease, have TSH levels between 0.5 mIU/L to 2.5 mIU/L, so we began to think of normal TSH as being in that narrower window. New research also suggests that TSH levels rise naturally as we age, and we’ve also found that normal TSH levels may vary slightly by race, with African-Americans having slightly lower TSH levels than Caucasians. This can get pretty confusing. Even if we opt for the narrower window as our normal baseline (so that asymptomatic people with TSHs above 3 are diagnosed with hypothyroidism), an improvement in outcomes should be shown before applying this universally. Once a person is diagnosed with hypothyroidism, however, there is general agreement that keeping their TSH in a narrow therapeutic window (about 0.5 mIU/L to 2.5 mIU/L or 3.0 mIU/L) is clinically valuable. Many patients wonder if being overweight has something to do with their thyroid function. At what point is it appropriate to test their thyroid function? : The vast majority of obese patients do not have a definable endocrine abnormality. I usually check to see if the patient has any other symptoms of hypothyroidism (other than weight gain) before I order a TSH screening test. Things like constipation or dry skin would raise my concern for hypothyroidism, though it’s not unreasonable for primary care physicians to order screening TSH tests on patients who are gaining weight and specifically want their thyroid function tested. Tell me about the most popular alternative medicines for thyroid disease and the evidence, if there is any, for their use. : First of all, the thyroid gland primarily makes T4, and just a little bit of T3. T3 is the active thyroid hormone that controls metabolism, etc. and is created through peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Levothyroxine is primarily T4, so people have been theoretically interested in giving T3 directly as an alternative. There was a study in 1999 that showed some potential benefits of giving a combination of T4 (Synthroid) and T3 (Cytomel )agents. However, a 2006 meta-analysis of 11 research studies showed that there was no evidence of benefit of combination T4 and T3 regimens. Armour Thyroid (Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is desiccated animal thyroid gland and some people prefer it to synthetic thyroid hormone. However, the problem with Armour Thyroid is that the ratio  of T4 to T3 thyroid hormone it contains can vary from batch to batch. I’ve had patients complain of palpitations and nervousness at times and studies reveal that blood levels of T3 can fluctuate substantially with T3 containing regimens in comparison with levels seen in patients with normal thyroid function or taking T4 preparations . As far as a thyroid diet is concerned, we have no evidence that any particular diet specifically helps thyroid function. Of course, people need to consume sufficient quantities of iodine or else goiters can result. Do you see a lot of patients who self-diagnose hypothyroidism through a Google search? : Yes. The symptoms of hypothyroidism are often non-specific. Weight gain and fatigue are very prevalent in general. I often find that people are trying to get by on six hours of sleep, eating poorly, and not exercising, and then they complain of fatigue and weight gain and want to ascribe it to a thyroid problem. That being said, the occasional patient does correctly self- diagnose themselves with hypothyroidism based on information obtained on-line or in books. What is the best advice to give a patient with hypothyroidism when they complain that their T4 agent is not making them feel fully well? : Again, I’d want to find out more about their sleep, diet and exercise habits. I’d also make sure their TSH was in an optimal therapeutic range and that they were taking their medicine at regular intervals. Calcium and iron can bind thyroid hormone in the gut so it’s important not to take levothyroxine with vitamin supplements, and proton-pump inhibitors can also reduce their absorption. I also like to remind patients that it can take four to six weeks before thyroid hormone levels normalize after starting therapy or changing a thyroid hormone dose. Patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis need to be aware that they’re at higher risk for other autoimmune disorders like type 1 diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or adrenal insufficiency. When should a primary care physician refer a thyroid patient to an endocrinologist? : Most patients with thyroid disease can be handled very well by a primary care physician. If the PCP notices that the blood tests are atypical and don’t fit a regular pattern, or if a patient is refractory to treatment with thyroid function tests all over the board, or if the PCP finds an anatomic abnormality (like an enlarged or lumpy thyroid gland), they should refer the patient to an endocrinologist. Is there anything that you wish PCPs would do before referring patients to you? : It’s best to have a specific questionf or the endocrinologist. Also, if thyroid function tests are mildly abnormal, you may wish to repeat them after a short interval to make sure it’s not a lab error (or a variation due to illness) before referring the patient to an endocrinologist. If the patient has a couple of abnormal TSH levels and a family history of autoimmune thyroid disease, it’d be appropriate to order ananti-thyroid antibody panel (TPOAb) before referring the patient to the endocrinologist. We also like to see a CBC, Chem 20, and lipid panel because they all can be impacted by hypothyroidism depending on how severe it is. How do you find the right balance between allowing the PCP to manage the patient versus providing specialty help and input? : I think there should be one cook in the kitchen when you’re trying to negotiate changes in thyroid function tests and adjust medication dosing. The endocrinologist should communicate to the PCP what the TSH goal is and why they’re taking the therapeutic approach they’ve chosen, and manage the patient during theperiod of time in which the medication is being adjusted. Once the TSH is in a good therapeutic window, the endocrinologist may well transfer management back to the PCP until there’s a new problem or concern.

We provide the most advanced diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for thyroid nodules. What is the thyroid gland and what is its function? The thyroid gland is an important endocrine gland that produces thyroid hormones, which circulate and affect most organs in the body. The major hormones are known as “T4” and “T3”. Thyroid hormone is essential for growth and development, and plays an important role in energy metabolism, and normal cardiac and bone function. When the thyroid is under-functioning (underactive, hypothyroid), patients may feel cold and tired. Although weight gain is typically thought to be a symptom of low thyroid, that is rarely the case. When the thyroid is over-functioning (hyperthyroid, overactive), patients may feel anxious, hot, involuntarily lose weight, note palpitations and rapid heartbeat, and may develop cardiac problems. The thyroid gland is controlled by the pituitary gland through the hormone TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). When the thyroid gland is underactive, the TSH concentration is elevated. When the thyroid is overactive, the TSH concentration is low. Measurement of serum TSH is the most sensitive test of thyroid function. A normal serum TSH concentration excludes abnormal thyroid function in more than 99% of individuals. The thyroid gland also produces the hormone calcitonin. The role of calcitonin in normal individuals is uncertain. However, a rare cancer of the thyroid gland (medullary thyroid carcinoma) is associated with elevated serum calcitonin. The thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly, with the wings corresponding to the lobes of the thyroid and the connecting piece between the lobes, known as the isthmus. The thyroid gland sits on top of and to the sides of the windpipe (trachea). It sits below the Adam’s apple and above the collar bone. The thyroid gland sits in front of the parathyroid glands. The nerves to the vocal cord tend to run behind the thyroid. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause symptoms. (underactive thyroid) may cause fatigue, low energy, muscle aches, cold intolerance (feeling cold, even in a warm room), dry skin and hair loss. When the thyroid is only mildly underactive (subclinical hypothyroidism), patients may or may not be symptomatic. (overactive thyroid) may cause anxiety, heat intolerance (feeling hot all the time) weight loss despite increased appetite, pounding of the heart (palpitations), difficulty sleeping and shortness of breath. If the thyroid function is only slightly overactive, patients may or may not be symptomatic. Measurement of serum TSH is the most sensitive test to determine an overactive thyroid (see above). When symptoms suggestive of thyroid gland over-activity or under-activity are present, serum TSH should be measured. Although many patients have symptoms suggestive of low thyroid, if the serum TSH is within normal limits, it is unlikely that the symptoms are related to the thyroid. If the serum TSH is abnormal, additional blood tests may be necessary. When the serum TSH is elevated, we also measure free T4. When the serum TSH is low, we also measure free T4 and T3. Thyroid disease may affect thyroid function, causing hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism (see above). Thyroid disease may be “structural,” causing enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter) and/or lumps or tumors in the thyroid. In many cases, structural disease of the thyroid is discovered incidentally when patients have tests including CT scans, MRI scans or carotid ultrasound examination. In some patients, abnormal thyroid function and structural disease co-exist. For example, some thyroid nodules cause over-activity of the thyroid gland. A thyroid nodule is the term used for a “lump” in the thyroid. Thyroid nodules are very common occurring in more than 50% of individuals over age 65. Most nodules are tumors in the thyroid gland. Fortunately, about 90% of thyroid nodules are noncancerous (benign). If a physician or a patient feels a lump in the region of the thyroid gland, a thyroid ultrasound will confirm or exclude the presence of a thyroid nodule. When nodules are found incidentally with a CT scan, MRI or carotid ultrasound, a thyroid ultrasound is also indicated to learn as much as possible about the nodules. Most nodules are asymptomatic. Some nodules are large enough to be visible, particularly in a thin neck. Thyroid nodules rise with swallowing. When large, thyroid nodules may cause a sense of pressure in the neck and rarely may affect breathing and swallowing. Patients with a thyroid nodule should see a physician who can assess and help determine whether treatment is needed. In many cases, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is necessary to determine if a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant. What is the difference between a nodule and a goiter? A goiter is a medical term that means abnormal enlargement of the thyroid. This can appear as a swelling in the front of the neck. A common cause of general thyroid enlargement is the benign thyroid inflammation called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, which may cause thyroid gland under-activity (hypothyroidism). The thyroid gland may also become generally enlarged with an overactive thyroid due to the condition called Graves’ disease. The thyroid may also be enlarged because it contains multiple nodules (multinodular thyroid). Multinodular thyroid glands generally function normally, but may be associated with thyroid gland over-activity (hyperthyroidism). What is a multinodular thyroid or multinodular goiter? When a thyroid gland contains multiple nodules, it is considered multinodular. There is no clear distinction between a multinodular thyroid and a multinodular goiter, but the term goiter implies that the thyroid gland is enlarged. Sometimes a multinodular goiter contains many small nodules, but if the nodules continue to enlarge, they may cause neck pressure and difficulty breathing or swallowing. Patients with a multinodular goiter need to have the nodules evaluated by a physician on a regular basis with a physical exam and ultrasound. Occasionally, additional studies such as a CT scan (without contrast) or an MRI are necessary to be certain that the nodules are not causing the airway (trachea) to be narrowed. We simply do not know why thyroid nodules are so common. Although thyroid nodules may run in families, they are so common in the general population that it is often not certain whether the condition is truly genetic. Exposure to excess radiation in childhood increases the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer (e.g., radiation therapy that was used for acne, enlarged tonsils, ringworm and other benign conditions). However, radiation therapy has not been used for these purposes for decades. The benign inflammation known as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis often causes a “lumpy” thyroid, which may be misinterpreted as a nodular thyroid gland either on physical examination or by ultrasound examination. In areas of iodine deficiency, nodules often grow to large size, but iodine deficiency itself does not cause thyroid nodules. Thyroid nodules are most commonly discovered by chance during imaging studies, such as CT or MRI scans or ultrasounds that are performed for other reasons. Thyroid nodules may be discovered by the patient or a physician during a physical examination. If you think that you may have a thyroid nodule, you should be evaluated by a physician. You will likely have the following during your evaluation: Physical exam with a review of your medical history Blood test to check the function of your thyroid (i.e. thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) test). If thyroid function is overactive (low TSH), a radioactive iodine scan may be performed Thyroid ultrasound to verify the presence of the nodule, assess the size and characteristics (fluid-filled or solid) and assess for other nodules in or around the thyroid Depending on the findings, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be recommended to check the kinds of cells in the nodule and to ensure they are benign (noncancerous) Many patients just want to know if their nodule is a sign of thyroid cancer. Your physician will use information from your history, physical exam, blood work and biopsy results to determine if a particular nodule requires treatment. What are the treatment options for thyroid nodules that are shown to be non-cancerous (benign) on FNA biopsy? For patients with normal thyroid function and thyroid nodules, observation with periodic physical examinations and ultrasounds are necessary to be certain that the nodule is not changing. Repeat biopsies may become necessary if the nodule size or ultrasound characteristics change. Although a benign biopsy is very reassuring, such biopsies will be correct 98 or 99% of the time, not 100%. Therefore, continued surveillance is necessary. For some patients with normal thyroid function and thyroid nodules, thyroid hormone is prescribed to prevent further growth or to possibly decrease the size of the nodule. When thyroid nodules cause local symptoms, exhibit continued growth or are a source of anxiety, surgery is often the appropriate treatment option. When thyroid function is high (hyperthyroidism) in a patient with thyroid nodules, radioactive iodine or surgery are both excellent alternatives. In some patients, medication alone is used to control the thyroid over-activity. What are the treatment options for thyroid nodules that are shown to be cancerous (malignant)? Nodules that are suspicious on biopsy are usually treated with surgery. Treatment for most cancerous thyroid nodules begins with surgery. The most common thyroid cancers are called well-differentiated thyroid cancer and include papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid carcinoma and Hurthle cell carcinoma. After surgery for well-differentiated thyroid cancer, radioactive iodine therapy may be necessary to destroy remaining thyroid tissue or treat residual cancer. Read thyroid surgery frequently asked questions (PDF) Medullary thyroid carcinoma also requires surgery, but there are special considerations. In some patients, this cancer is associated with an adrenal tumor called a pheochromocytoma, and that must be excluded prior to thyroid surgery. In some patients, this cancer runs in families, therefore patients may require specific genetic testing. What are the treatment options for nodules which are considered “indeterminate”? Most thyroid nodules will be diagnosed as benign or malignant (cancer) on FNA. However 20-25% of FNA biopsies are considered indeterminate. This means that we cannot definitely decide whether the nodule is benign or malignant based on that biopsy alone. Several alternatives are available for indeterminate biopsies depending upon the specific biopsy result. These include: Repeating the biopsy with special tests to analyze the genetic make-up of the tumor It is important to see a doctor if you think you may have a thyroid nodule or goiter, or if you are experiencing abnormal swelling or pressure in your neck, especially with difficulty breathing or swallowing. You should also see a doctor if you experience any of the symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism over an extended period of time.

What Actually Is an Under Active Thyroid and What Can You Do About It? Chances are you’ve heard of thyroid problems, in the context of someone you know trying – and struggling – to get to a healthy weight. An under active one is associated with a hard time in the getting lean department and is a common experience – according to , one in 20 people in the UK will be affected by thyroid problems at some point in their lives, with the majority being women. But before we dive into what the symptoms of common thyroid problems are, let’s clear up WTF the thyroid is. Quite simply, the thyroid is a gland. It sits at the front of your neck and is made up of two lobes, each the size of a halved plum, that straddle the windpipe. You could think of them as powerhouses for your cells because their primary function is to keep your cells – and you – active. They do this by secreting carefully balanced levels of the hormones thyroxine (aka T4) and triiodothyronine (aka T3) into the blood, as directed by the pituitary gland, which releases the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Together, T3 and T4 influence the speed at which your cells operate. And if the level of hormones goes out of whack? You guessed it. You’re landed with thyroid problems. What are the symptoms of an under active thyroid? Hypothyroidism or an under active thyroid; whatever you call it, say hello to the most common of the thyroid problems. 'Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid is not secreting enough thyroid hormone,' says Professor Simon Pearce of Newcastle University and medical spokesperson for The British Thyroid Foundation. 'This means your cells function more slowly than normal.' 'Around 6-8% of women will experience subclinical hypothyroidism,' says Lyn Mynott, chief executive of . 'This is where they demonstrate symptoms of the condition but their levels of TSH have not gone out of range. Two per cent, however, will have overt hypothyroidism. Although a woman’s risk increases with age, we are seeing the condition in all age groups.' 'The truth is, though, because hypothyroidism is a slow burner, it is often misdiagnosed as depression,' Mynott says. Which means the real numbers of those women affected could be much higher. Not great when you find out that low thyroid function has also been linked to greater odds of experiencing the , according to . And what are the symptoms of an over active thyroid? This condition is pretty much the 180-degree opposite, occurring when your thyroid is more active than it should be. 'When too much thyroid hormone is secreted, the cells are made to work faster than normal,' says Professor Pearce. 'Everything speeds up, including your metabolism, temperature and heart rate.' This is why the symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: • Quicker bowel movements, which could result in diarrhoea Women are ten times more likely than men to experience hyperthyroidism, with the condition affecting around 1% of the population. And why do thyroid problems occur, in the first place? 'Thyroid problems are typically the result of an autoimmune condition, in which the body’s immune system attacks thyroid cells,' says Professor Pearce. 'For hypothyroidism, the most common cause is the autoimmune disease Hashimoto; for hyperthyroidism, it is a condition called Graves’. Thyroid problems are also found in around 2.5% of pregnancies and, according to by the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Centre, if you suffer from , your chances rise by around 21%. Other thyroid problems include nodules on the thyroid and thyroid cancer (although this is very rare). Most common thyroid problems can be treated with medications designed to rebalance the levels of thyroid hormones in your body. How can you reduce your risk of thyroid problems? Family history plays a key role in determining your risk of developing thyroid problems. Lifestyle changes may help, too, but the research to support these is limited. According to Mynott, however, reducing stress – she recommends through practising mindfulness – could make a difference. And what about diet? Surely that must play a role, right? Well, in terms of managing the symptoms of thyroid problems, the jury is out. • Iron deficiency during pregnancy can elevate a woman’s risk of thyroid problems, says the . • found that more than 75% of people with Hashimoto are lactose intolerant. • According to the , a low-carb, gluten-free diet with plenty of vegetables can provide an alternative to surgery for those experiencing Graves’ eye disease. Professor Pearce believes that simply following a well-balanced diet is best. Izabella Wentz, author of , found that cutting out dairy and gluten, eased her symptoms. Nicole German, aka the , suggests the following: • Reduce or eliminate added sugars (think sugar, brown rice syrup, corn syrup, agave, honey and maple syrup), as these can increase total body inflammation and exacerbate the autoimmune response. • Switch vegetable oils for monounsaturated fats such as avocado, olive oil, and nuts, which promote a reduction in inflammation. • Focus on nutrient-dense foods. Thyroid hormones are better supported when you have plenty of micronutrients. They also need selenium and zinc to convert T4 to its more active T3 form. Furthermore, it is believed that caffeine may inhibit the absorption of thyroid hormones, while foods such as kale, almonds, sweetcorn and soya may – if eaten in excess – prevent the thyroid from using iodine. This is an important nutrient in the production of thyroid hormone, and found in milk and white fish; note you only need 150 micrograms a day – it is a case of more is better. The one thing that is for sure, though, is that support for women with thyroid problems is limited at best. 'Many women feel they are not being listened to,' says Mynott. “And often family members don’t understand what’s. There are a few support groups around but Thyroid UK has the largest forum, which many people have told us is a lifesaver for them.” Now you're clued up on thyroid problems, find out more about and here are an extra .

This website has helped people in 180+ countries   Diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be established based on the results of tests done to measure the levels of these hormones in the blood. Commonly T4 and TSH in blood are measured. Since hypothyroidism is about deficiency or low levels of thyroid hormones, T4 (and T3) levels in the blood are below normal. TSH levels are high in case of Primary hypothyroidism and this can be explained as follows. Since the thyroid is not able to produce adequate amounts of T4 and T3, the pituitary senses this and increases TSH (Thyroid stimulating hormone) production which stimulates the thyroid to increase T4and T3 production. In case of secondary hypothyroidism, the pituitary gland itself fails to produce enough TSH and hence the levels of TSH as well asT4 and T3 will be below normal in the blood. Symptoms may not always correspond to the severity of the lab test abnormalities i.e. some patients may have severe hypothyroidism as revealed by their laboratory values but they may have very mild symptoms. On the other hand, some patients may not have significantly abnormal values but they may be having significant symptoms. It is important to remember that the treatment must not only correct the laboratory values but also make the patient feel better. During the initial stages of Hypothyroidism, increased conversion of T4 to T3 occurs and hence T3 levels are maintained but T4 levels may be low to normal. In order to diagnose Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (as an etiology of primary thyroid failure), Anti-TPO antibody testing may be done. The Anti-TPO Ab which was previously referred to as the Antimicrosomal antibody (AMA) is a useful marker for the diagnosis and management of autoimmune thyroid disease. Ultrasonography (USG) of the neck and thyroid can be used to detect nodules and infiltrative disease. Our Homeopathy treatment is now just a few clicks away.

Within few months her thyroid levels began to improve and we could taper off her thyroid supplements to a good extent. Her dependency on thyroid supplements came down and she felt much better with most of her complaints now. I am glad that we opted for Homeopathy at the right time. Today she is much better with most of her physical complaints, thanks to Homeopathy. I am on your on-line treatment and have observed 80% to 100% results in different parts of my system. I am glad that I found you. Thank you for being so kind.  have observed positive result during the course of the homeopathic medication. The repigmentation ranged 70%. I am happy about it. Your treatment has been very effective. Most of my urticaria has vanished. Slowly, I have stopped all antihistaminic medicines. I was skeptical to begin with, as I never tried treating myself on-line. I am very much pleased with the results of the medicine that you sent me. Role of Homeopathy in Underactive Thyroid Treatment Explained by Dr Shah Homeopathy treats the diseases at a root-level so the results are long-lasting. Homeopathy is one of the most rational sciences with respect to its concepts of health, disease, and cure.

The thyroid is a small gland at the base of your neck that affects essentially every one of your bodily functions. So it’s really no surprise that several issues can arise when this gland suddenly doesn’t release enough thyroid hormone () or when it releases too much (). The most annoying part: The symptoms of thyroid disease mirror the symptoms of a lot of other issues. “Thyroid conditions can do undiagnosed for a long period of time,” says Valentina Rodriguez, M.D., an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Health. “Symptoms vary from person to person, and can come on suddenly or very gradually, so they’re hard to detect.” Still, you need to stay on top of whatever symptoms you experience because thyroid disease is way, way, more common among women. One in eight women will develop a thyroid disorder during her lifetime, according to the , and women are five to eight times more likely than men to have thyroid problems. Even more troubling: 10 to 20 percent of women in their thirties develop thyroid issues, says Eve Feinberg, M.D., assistant professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Leaving a thyroid condition untreated can be really taxing on your other organs, especially your heart, says Rodriguez. Plus, living with the symptoms of a whacked out thyroid really sucks. These are the thyroid symptoms in women you should be aware of: An underactive thyroid slows down all your bodily functions, including your metabolism, says Rodriguez. “Your body is basically being told to put the brakes on everything,” she says. “And many women gain a little weight because of this.” If you have hyperthyroidism, the opposite can happen. “Now your thyroid is laying on the gas, and a lot of functions speed up,” she says. Hyperthyroidism can lead to unexplained weight loss. “A lot of women don’t want to be treated for hyperthyroidism because they see the weight loss as a good thing, but they need to get treatment—the overproduction of the hormone is really hard on the body, especially the heart,"" Rodriguez says. The thyroid hormone is in constant communication with the heart, and impacts how fast or slow it beats. With hypothyroidism, your heart rate will be slower than normal, which affects a host of other organs and body functions. In hyperthyroidism, it’s the opposite—your heart rate speeds up too much. “Either situation can result in heart failure,” says Rodriguez. “Especially if your heart rate is revved up for a long period of time, that extra stress is dangerous.” Another body system that slows down with hypothyroidism is the gut, Rodriguez says. You may notice that you’re not going to the bathroom as often or you’re just really constipated. With hyperthyroidism, you may go a lot and find that your poops are not super-solid. Hypothyroidism wipes you out. “Your energy balance and control is less effective,” says Rodriguez. Maybe that means a full day at work tires you out way more than it used to, or the workouts you used to love are just too exhausting now. This feeling of fatigue can also contribute to weight gain with hypothyroidism. In hyperthyroidism, you’re generally wound up, but this can also result in fatigue, says Rodriguez. If you’re feeling jittery, or like you had too many cups of coffee at all times, that can leave you extremely tired at the end of the day. Your body can only be on overdrive for so long before it needs a break, and hyperthyroidism doesn’t give you that balance. Hypothyroidism can affect the way your brain functions and greatly impact your mood, says Rodriguez. Depression is a symptom many women experience, and it can be hard to recognize that the thyroid might be involved, since depression itself can lead to some of the symptoms of hypothyroidism. If you have hyperthyroidism, your mood might be altered another way. “People will feel like they’re thinking a million miles a minute, they’re anxious, irritable, and tremulous,” says Rodriguez. Both disorders can leave you feeling out of control mentally and emotionally, so it can be helpful to seek mental health treatment, like talk therapy, along with medical treatment. Is your period suddenly way heavier than normal? This could be a sign of hypothyroidism, says Rodriguez. Your thyroid also impacts your cycle, so when something’s off, you’ll often see changes from your typical period. Hyperthyroidism can cause the opposite—you may have much lighter periods than you’re used to, or it may disappear for a few months unexpectedly. Hypothyroidism can cause your hair and skin to be super dried out (major bummer). If you suddenly can’t get enough moisturizer, or notice your hair is brittle and breaking off, that could be a sign of hypothyroidism. Both conditions—hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism—can cause hair to thin, unfortunately. In both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, you may feel muscles aches, joint stiffness, and weakness, says Rodriguez, further tiring you out and making you not want to be active. “Hopefully you’re in tune with your body and recognize something feels different than your baseline,” says Rodriguez. If you haven’t recently done a tough workout, you shouldn’t be feeling weak and sore. Hypothyroidism can actually slow the synapses in your brain, and reduce the speed of your brain function, says Rodriguez. “You won’t be able to think as clearly, and you might feel like you have brain fog,” she says. This slowed-down feeling can come along with mood changes and depression, too. Graves’ disease (an autoimmune disorder that results in hyperthyroidism) can cause some visual changes too, and one telltale sign is puffy, protruding eyes, says Rodriguez. Dry, irritated eyes can be a symptom of both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. If your eyes seem dried out (and there’s no culprit like allergies or medications), or they seem more pronounced than normal, talk to your doctor about your symptoms. Constantly cold? Your temperature sensitivity could be a sign of hypothyroidism, says Rodriguez. Your slowed circulation can leave you feeling chilled when it’s perfectly warm and everyone around you feels fine. The opposite goes for hyperthyroidism—you may be super-sensitive to any heat, and sweat a lot more than it seems like other people do. Many women are surprised to learn that losing part of your eyebrows—specifically from the outer edge—is a sign of hypothyroidism that goes along with general hair loss, Feinberg says. If you notice your eyebrows are getting sparse at the corners—and you're feeling generally unwell—don’t chalk it up to aging and stress, and see your doctor ASAP. If you suddenly notice swelling and puffiness in your lower body—that means the hip, knees, ankle joints, and feet—that's a sign of fluid retention, which can be a sign of hypothyroidism or Grave’s disease, Feinberg says. If you’ve been unsuccessfully trying to get pregnant, you’re likely already stressed out and preoccupied with that issue alone—but infertility can be a sign of other underlying problems like thyroid disease, Feinberg says. On the flip side, undiagnosed thyroid disease can be a cause of infertility, according to the , so you’ll definitely want to raise this as a concern while you’ve got your doctor’s attention.

If the hyperthyroidism was caused by a thyroiditis (inflamation of the thyroid) there is typically a hyperthyroid phase followed by a hypothyroid phase. In most cases the thyroid levels then return to normal, but in about 5% of cases the gland never recovers and permanent hypothyroidism ensues. In graves' disease, about 1% of patients will go from hyperthyroid to hypothyroid each year as a consequence of the autoimmune attack on the gland.

bcd1f7c8-8405-41c1-a079-679fcd0c7ebe,"Hypothyroid results please help : Hi I’m a... - Thyroid UK Hi I’m a hypothyroid I was born with it and have had it all my life. I’m 24 and have symptoms of being very sweaty all the time achey joints and need approximately 2 hour naps every day to get through. iso I got some bloods done they just did a tft my tsh was 4.9 and my T4 was 17. I was really surprised because I would have thought my t4 was way higher because I am sweating buckets... does anyone have any suggestions ? Could you add the lab ranges to the blood test results? We need these to interpret results accurately as lab ranges vary from lab to lab and country to country. It looks like you need more levothyroxine but can't be sure as no lab ranges included in your text. It seems really strange because I only usually sweat this much when I’m really high/too high. I currently take 100mcg levothyroxine one day and 125mg the next. Most people need a TSH of around 1 or even sometimes a little lower to be symptom free. Have you had an evaluation of vitamin levels, particularly vitamin D? It's very common for people with thyroid disease to be low and it can cause symptoms. Ask your doctor to check B12, folate, ferritin and vitamin D. When you have the results, post them here for good advice. Welcome to our forum, and you have my sympathy and most of the other members' too in that you've never known good health. At present your TSH is far too high but that's due to ignorant doctors and endocrinologists believing that if the TSH is 'somewhere' in the range - in your case up to 4.9 that we are on sufficient. We need optimum thyroid hormones to bring TSH to 1 or lower and a Free T4 and Free T3 in the upper part of the ranges. The latter are rarely tested. My personal opinion is that as you've never had a working thyroid gland that you do need a combination of T3/T4 which might work wonders for you, and due to whoever treats you is happy with your TSH result which is too high. We all have to read, learn and ask questions - as you are doing and we can finally get the good health we deserve - if only the NHS will again prescribe T3 which was withdrawn due to exorbitant costs by the providers and it is being investigated at present in the Lords. Levothyroxine is an inactive hormone - it has to convert to T3 (liothyronine) and it is this hormone which runs our whole metabolism from head to toe and we have millions of T3 receptor cells which need T3 - our heart and brain need the most. Many source their own T3 at present due to it being removed from the NHS. It would seem to me that the Thyroid Organisations took the chance to have it removed as they believe that levothyroxine is sufficient to bring good health. On this forum we know that not everyone does and doses prescribed are usually too low to keep the TSH somewhere in the range - never mind if it is at the top instead of near bottom. Request a new blood test - if GP or lab wont do them you can get private home pin-prick tests from one of our three recommended labs. If you decide to do so make sure you are well-hydrated a couple of days before for blood draw. Or surgery may draw blood for you but you'd have to check. All blood tests for thyroid hormones have to be at the very earliest, fasting (you can drink water) and allow a gap of 24 hourws between last dose of levo and test and take afterwards. Always get a print-out of your results, for your own records, and if you have a query you can post them. Your GP should also test B12, Vit D, iron, ferritin and folate. Everything is to be at optimum - not just in range. Also, the original thyroid hormone can be sourced privately - it is the very original and first introduced in 1892 but that has also been withdraw.

Over 2000 case-studies of patients for you to study Actual case-histories of various diseases treated at Life Force  Underactive Thyroid: About Hypothyroidism and its Types Deficiency of the thyroid hormone (THYROXINE) is called Hypothyroidism or Hypothyroid. It can affect any age group though it is most prevalent in older women. It is almost 10 to 20 times more common in females as compared to males. It is one of those conditions which are often present for many years before they can be recognized and treated effectively. An estimated one in every 50 females and one in 1000 men tend to suffer from this condition. Underactive Thyroid is also called Hypothyroidism.  Here the problem lies in the thyroid gland and hence it fails to produce sufficient hormones due to certain causes.  In this type, the pituitary gland is at fault and it is unable to produce sufficient quantity of TSH. Lack of TSH, in turn, causes decreased production of T3 and T4 by the thyroid gland due to lack of stimulus from the pituitary. Underactive thyroid results from an inability of the Thyroid gland to produce adequate Thyroxine hormone. This could be largely due to the genetic tendency. It is important to understand that since there is an inability or sluggishness of the thyroid gland, the treatment should ideally be aiming at stimulating the thyroid gland to do its job, rather than simply supplying deficient Thyroxine hormone from outside.

82df76f8-dfa1-407e-8eaf-c75e6cbc4996,"Hashimotos and neck rash/tingling/pain - Thyroid UK I have unmedicated Hashimotos (my levels are “normal” apparently). I had a baby 8 months ago and my thyroid has been all over the place since as expected. I frequently have thyroid pain overnight and often wake up with worse thyroid symptoms during the night. Last night I woke about 2am and my thyroid was very painful and kind of buzzing. Well this morning I have this rash on my neck right ehymy thyroid is located. It’s not itchy and definitely not an allergic reaction. My thyroid is still uncomfortable today too. Has anyone ever seen anything like this? The rash isn’t itchy or raised. It just looks to me like inflammation. Hello, yes, I had that. I took a photo of it too. It was before I got diagnosed with underactive thyroid and Hashimoto’s. I had a TSH of around 5 for at least 3 years but was never told. (I only know because I requested all my test results online last month). I haven’t had that since I started on meds for the thyroid. (Levo Thyroxine first 2 years and added T3 recently). My thought is it’s your body not being able to regulate temperature or all those annoying antibodies having a go at your thyroid. Maybe you could ask for all your test results over the last few years? If they won’t test you properly, look on seaside suzies posts and find a list of what you need checked and if possible do a private blood test. I've read recently that a skin rash is one of the many possible symptoms of hypothyroidism. Ask the doctor if you can have a trial of T4. I am still classed as ""Subclinical"", in spite of very ""Clinical"" symptoms, because my T4 was still within range, though TSH rather high, but was eventually given a trial of Levothyroxine. I'm still in the process of getting it adjusted to a good level, but it has certainly helped. The only thing is that if you are breastfeeding it might mean you can't be given extra thyroxine, not sure about that. Did you tell your doctor of recent symptoms? Any blood test results (with ranges) that you can post here? Thanks for your message. My tsh is always low in range but my free T3 and free T4 change a lot. Most recently my free T3 was 4 in a range of 3.5-6.5. Sometimes it’s slightly higher. My free T4 was 14 in a range of 12-22. I’ve had plenty of scans and biopsies because I have a 3cm nodule. The nodule biopsied clear for cancer. My TPO antibodies are normally out of range and vary all the time. Most recently they were 77 in a range of less than 50 but they’ve been as high as 1500 from quite painful back of neck/top of shoulders this past week in addition to my throat pain....

The tests measure the amount of different hormones including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). Other tests on the thyroid include various antibodies related to thyroid tissue. TSH is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. TSH is carried in the blood to the thyroid gland, which sits at the front of the neck. From there, TSH influences how much T4 and T3 are released into the blood. TSH, T3 and T4 levels can all be tested in the blood. Your doctor will probably test TSH first, then T3 and T4 if TSH is abnormal. Tests can also be used to measure antibodies to diagnose autoimmune thyroid disease. The 's hormones help control some of your body's metabolic processes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight. Too much or too little of these hormones can make you ill. you have symptoms of (overactive thyroid) or (underactive thyroid) you are taking some form of thyroid hormone replacement treatment you are female and being investigated for infertility Very rarely, babies are born without a working thyroid gland.

What are you actually taking and what were your levels? Ask your doctor, or the receptionist for the results so we can take a look. What medication are you taking for the diabetes and what kind if diet are you following? I follow a low carb diet to keep blood sugar to manageable levels, a bowl of cereal or porridge can set me back with high sugar for a couple of days. If you want help with your diet, then this site will help : I'm sorry you've got two problems to contend with. If your doctor said your thyroid is 'through the roof' it might be because he's not giving you sufficient thyroid hormones. High cholesterol is a clinical symptom of hypothyroidism, and when on sufficient it should reduce without any other medication. It might be that your GP thinks that as long as the patient's TSH level is 'in range' that he stops increasing levothyroxine and is now blaming you for not taking it.

Beauty Wellness Fitness Nutrition Conditions Natural Approaches to Thyroid Health Conditions Signs and Symptoms of an Underactive (Hypothyroid) Condition The thyroid is one of the most misunderstood glands in the human body. Situated in the front lower part of the neck, this small, butterfly-shaped gland produces hormones which communicate with every cell in the human body. Thyroid hormones also affect the speed of metabolism, which can have a dramatic effect on body weight. There are various health conditions that can occur as a result of an abnormal thyroid, but regular exercise along with adequate intake of help ensure the body’s cells are responsive to these hormones.   Some estimates say that thyroid abnormalities affect millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Two common hormone related issues are hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. If the thyroid produces too much hormone, a person is said to have an overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism (which accounts for less than 10 percent of thyroid hormone abnormalities). If the thyroid produces too little hormone, a person is said to have an underactive thyroid, a condition called hypothyroidism. This article will focus primarily on healing and treating those with an underactive thyroid, which affects up to 10 percent of the world population. TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone): Made in the pituitary gland, which is located in the brain. This hormone stimulates the thyroid gland in the neck to make thyroid hormones. T4 Hormone: The main hormone made by a healthy thyroid gland. T4 is also made as a pharmaceutical drug called levothyroxine. T4 must be converted to the active T3 hormone. This conversion occurs in the thyroid, liver, gut, brain, and muscles. T3 Hormone: Generated from T4 hormone, it requires the minerals . T3 is the active thyroid hormone which signals cells and controls the body’s metabolism. Reverse T3: Generated from T4 hormone, reverse T3 is the “opposite” of T3 hormone but is overall “inactive”. During times of stress, trauma, kidney disease, and infection, the body will make more of this inactive reverse T3 hormone instead of the active T3 hormone. Worldwide, the main cause of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is deficiency. It is estimated that globally, one in three people have insufficient iodine intake. Many develop a goiter (thyroid enlargement) or thyroid nodules as a result. Iodine deficiency is common in Africa and  South Asia while 50 percent of people in Europe are also mildly deficient, according to a study in Endocrine Reviews.  A 2018 study of Norwegian pregnant women in Nutrients showed that up to 55 percent of the women had suboptimal iodine intake in their diet. According to the Australian Thyroid Foundation, “More than 50% of children and pregnant or breastfeeding women living in Australia have been shown to be iodine deficient”. demonstrated that almost 10 percent of people in the United States had moderate to severe iodine deficiency. Based on the data, I propose that an additional five to 10 percent are mildly deficient. Therefore, up to one in five people are deficient in the United States.  Those in Japan tend to have a higher intake of iodine than most other countries due to routine consumption of wakame (undaria), nori (porphyra), and kombu (laminaria) The second leading cause of an underactive thyroid is due to an autoimmune attack on the thyroid gland. In this situation, certain antibodies (called anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin) attack the thyroid gland, resulting in the inability of the thyroid to make sufficient T4 thyroid hormone. The most common autoimmune condition is called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, named in 1912 after Dr. Hakaru Hashimoto of Japan.  Other factors that can interfere with adequate thyroid production, according to Dr. Dan Lukaczer of the Institute of Functional Medicine, include stress, trauma, infection, pesticide exposure, fluoride, and celiac disease. An underactive thyroid is diagnosed by most doctors when the TSH (0.4 -4.0  lab test is elevated. This indicates that the brain is making extra TSH hormone in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid gland to make T4 hormone. Many integrative physicians suggest the optimal blood TSH range is 0.4 to 2.0 mIU/L. Signs and Symptoms of an Underactive (Hypothyroid) Condition Fingernails are brittle and break easier than before Women are more likely than men to have thyroid dysfunction intake in the diet. According to the Center for Disease Control, “The median intake of iodine from food in the United States is approximately 240 to 300 micrograms (µg) per day for men and 190 to 210 µg/day for women”.  In 2001, the Institute of Medicine advised ""an iodine intake of 150 µg per day for nonpregnant adults, 220 µg per day for pregnant women and 290 µg per day during lactation”. Low iodine levels have also been associated with learning difficulties in children.  Optimizing gut health is also crucial to thyroid health. Those with irritable bowel syndrome should focus on repairing , which helps to ensure adequate absorption of vitamins and minerals. Studies show that those sensitive to gluten are at increased risk for thyroid disease. In addition, a healthy digestive system and balanced microbiome is important to ensure an appropriate immune system response, which will help prevent autoimmune-induced thyroid diseases. Few realize that 80 percent of our immune system is in our gut. Modern medicine has made a lot of progress over the last century. However, the recognition of a goiter, a term used to describe thyroid enlargement, goes back thousands of years.  In 40 BC, Rome’s finest, Pliny, Vitruvius and Juvenal described the treatment of a goiter using burnt seaweed, which we now know contains large amounts of .   In 1500 AD, Leonardo Da Vinci was the first person to draw the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland,  in addition to drawing the rest of the human body in fine detail.  In 1656, Thomas Warton is the first to name the gland  “thyroid”, which comes from the Greek word , or shield.  Almost 200 years later in 1820, Jean Francois Coindet of France treats a goiter with the newly discovered iodine.   In the late 1890s, the first use of desiccated thyroid formulas, which contained both T4 and T3 hormones were used to treat underactive thyroid glands, or hypothyroidism. According to studies, four in five prescriptions for thyroid medication in the 1960s were for natural combination  (T4/T3) products while in 1988, one in four were for this natural medicine. Since that time, the trend by most physicians has been to prescribe synthetic levothyroxine, a T4 only formula. The brand Synthroid (levothyroxine) came to the market in 1955.  Currently, conventional medicine does little to treat a person with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Most physicians are taught to simply allow the thyroid to “burn out”. Once this occurs, thyroid medication, as listed above will be prescribed when laboratory tests show an abnormality of elevated TSH. Many integrative physicians advise treating the underlying leaky gut to control Hashimito’s thyroiditis.  Levothyroxine (T4) hormone (synthroid) – taken once per day Liothyronine (T3) hormone (Cytomel) – taken once per day T4/T3 Combination  hormone – taken once or twice per day showed that those with higher consumption of fruits, vegetables and had a lower likelihood of developing an autoimmune caused thyroid disease. This type of diet also helps optimize the gut microbiome and maintain balance. The following nutrients are important and aid in the production of thyroid hormones. They may be present in a well-balanced diet or may be consumed by taking a quality or the individual supplement when appropriate. There are also various available that contain many of the below compounds in one capsule. A cofactor involved in two enzymes which help manufacture thyroid hormones. According to a  2014 study in the International Journal of Endocrinology, could lower TPO antibodies when an autoimmune attack is underway. In addition, selenium is needed to help convert T4 into T3, the active hormone. Suggested dose: 200 mcg daily.  Worldwide, a deficiency is the leading cause of goiters, thyroid nodules, and an underactive thyroid. An iodine-rich diet is advised (see above for the list of foods) The preferred method of testing for iodine deficiency, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is by collecting a random urine sample (morning is best). is considered deficient, according to WHO standards.  containing at least 150 mcg of iodine. Others take iodine supplements or kelp to help maintain a healthy iodine level.  No more than 500 mcg of iodine per day should be taken. Too much iodine may worsen thyroid health.  deficiency is common among women who are menstruating. Iron deficiency impairs thyroid metabolism, according to a 2017 study in Thyroid. The authors recommended that clinicians check iron levels to replete any deficiency. Aiming for a ferritin level of 50 to 75 ng/ml or more should be the goal. Suggested dose: As directed by your physician or as stated on the label.  deficiency. Studies have shown that those with low levels are at increased risk for various cancers and autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disease. A 2018 study of obese adults demonstrated that those with lower levels of vitamin D were at increased risk for developing Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Suggested dose: 1,000 IU to 5,000 IU daily. According to the Journal of Nutrition, almost 45 percent of Americans have inadequate intake of in their diets. Worldwide, more than 15 percent of people are zinc deficient. The problem is very common in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. can be impaired.  Additionally, poor dietary intake of zinc-containing foods or routine ingestion of alcohol can also result in chronically low zinc levels. Zinc deficiency is associated with thyroid disorders, skin, and blood issues and increased risk for infection. Zinc also plays an important role in brain health, where its levels are 10 times greater than in the blood. Zinc is required by enzymes in the brain and throughout the body. It is involved in over 300 biochemical reactions and is an important component in over 2,000 proteins. Suggested dose: 15 to 50 mg per day.  Zinc is present in most quality  In addition to the above key nutrients, the following are also needed in one’s diet for a healthy thyroid. A well balanced diet is crucial to thyroid health. Focusing on the gut microbiome is more important than most realize. Avoiding  foods which cause digestive issues is important. A quality should also be considered to optimize thyroid health. Focusing on nutrition and ensure one is getting all the required vitamin and minerals through diet and supplements can help optimize one’s thyroid health.

Are Hashimoto’s Disease and Hypothyroidism the Same Thing? Having an underactive thyroid proves that even your smaller organs can have a mighty effect on your health. As you read this, a tiny butterfly-shaped gland at the front of your neck is commanding a slew of your body’s most important functions. This powerful organ is called your thyroid gland, and it influences things like your , digestion, mood, , and energy levels—essentially various factors of your metabolism, which is a fancy way of saying the way your body uses energy. As you can imagine, if you have an underactive thyroid, things can feel pretty out of whack. If you’ve ever read up on underactive thyroid, you’ve probably encountered the terms “hypothyroidism” and “Hashimoto’s disease” along with, potentially, some confusion about the difference. As someone who’s been diagnosed with both hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s, I know this confusion all too well. I’ve been taking medicine for hypothyroidism since I was 12. But I didn’t realize I also had Hashimoto’s until I noticed the name of the disease scrawled in my file during a visit with a new endocrinologist in my mid-20s. Though I’d been diagnosed with both conditions when I was young, I only ever remembered hearing my parents and doctors refer to it as hypothyroidism. After I sheepishly asked the doc what was up, he offered a clarification—and an assurance that I was far from the first patient who was unclear about what exactly was going on with their thyroid. “It’s a very confusing topic for a lot of patients, and I get that question all the time,” , M.D., an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine, tells SELF. “The words are used synonymously, as if they’re the exact same thing.” The catch is that they’re not. Hashimoto’s and hypothyroidism often occur together, but they’re technically two different health issues. is an autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland. Experts don’t know exactly what prompts the immune system to identify the thyroid gland as a threat. What they do know is that Hashimoto’s often (but not always) results in hypothyroidism. In fact, Hashimoto’s is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States, according to the . Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid is not releasing enough of the two main hormones it produces, T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine). It happens most often in women over 60, but as my own case shows, it can affect anyone. This chronic condition typically comes on gradually and can go undetected for a long time. But as the disease progresses and your metabolism continues to decelerate, you’ll realize something’s up. “Everything slows down and becomes sluggish,” , M.D., an endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic, tells SELF. If you have hypothyroidism, you can experience symptoms like fatigue, slowed heart rate, weight gain, constantly feeling cold, constipation, , dry skin, heavier or irregular , thinning hair, impaired memory, painful or swollen joints, and more, according to the . You may also have a goiter, a swollen area of your neck that appears when your thyroid gland expands as it works to release the hormones you need, or nodules, which are solid or fluid-filled growths inside your thyroid. These nodules are usually benign, but in rare cases, they can be cancerous. These are also the main signs of Hashimoto’s, which typically doesn’t cause symptoms until it damages your thyroid enough to mess with the gland’s ability to produce sufficient hormones. Though Hashimoto’s usually causes hypothyroidism, other health issues that affect your thyroid can bring it on as well. If something besides Hashimoto’s causes your hypothyroidism, the symptoms generally tend to come on more suddenly, Dr. Weinstein says. Possible causes include thyroid surgery to fully or partially remove the gland for some reason, like . Radioactive iodine therapy to treat hypothyroidism’s foil, hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), can be a cause, too. A few medications can trigger an underactive thyroid, including lithium (often prescribed for ), and certain cancer treatments, like radiation to target head and neck cancer. Then there are less common causes, like postpartum thyroiditis. This occurs when a person’s thyroid gland becomes inflamed at some point in their first year after giving birth, according to the . It can present in a few different ways; it might first cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism, like a rapid heartbeat or heart palpitations, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, and more. After that, you might see signs of an underactive thyroid. You could also just experience one or the other. Postpartum thyroiditis typically abates within 12 to 18 months, though it can cause long-term hypothyroidism in some people. Doctors can perform a few specific tests to find out if you have hypothyroidism and whether or not Hashimoto’s caused it. If your primary care practitioner (PCP) or an endocrinologist (a doctor specializing in glands and organs that make hormones) suspects you have hypothyroidism, they should do a comprehensive evaluation before coming to a conclusion. This includes taking full stock of your symptoms and reviewing your medical history to see if Hashimoto’s runs in your family, which of having the condition. They should also check you for other potential causes of hypothyroidism. They may also do a physical exam to check for swelling of your thyroid gland. Most importantly, your doc will likely order a blood test to check for poor thyroid function, which shows up via a high level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), says Dr. Kellis. This indicates that your thyroid is struggling to make enough hormones, causing the pituitary gland to release TSH to get your thyroid moving. Depending on the results, they may follow up with a test to check your levels of thyroxine, one of those crucial thyroid hormones. There is an additional marker they can use to determine if you have Hashimoto’s: elevated levels of of antibodies against , which is an enzyme that helps produce thyroid hormones. These antibodies signal that your immune system is on the offense against your thyroid gland. There is no cure for a chronically underactive thyroid, but the good news is that treatment with synthetic hormones can likely help you feel better. Treatment involves taking a once-daily dose of levothyroxine, a synthetic replacement for thyroid hormone, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. A doctor will re-check your levels of that thyroid stimulating hormone in the first few months after starting you on levothyroxine to see if your dose needs adjusting, then they’ll monitor you over time to make sure you’re not taking too little to reverse your symptoms, or too much for your system (that can cause issues like increased appetite, insomnia, and heart palpitations). Once you’re on the right dosage, your symptoms of hypothyroidism should recede. You’ll typically need to continue treatment for the rest of your life. If you stop, your symptoms might reappear. Treatment for hypothyroidism triggered by something besides Hashimoto’s is generally the same; whether it’s temporary depends on the root cause. For example, if you only need radiation to treat cancer for a short period of time, your thyroid might bounce back to normal once you’re done. And in some instances, people with postpartum thyroiditis have a mild enough case that it doesn’t require treatment, especially since it’s likely to go away eventually, according to the . Even though the symptoms and treatment of Hashimoto’s and hypothyroidism are largely the same, it’s essential to know if you have the former, because it can drive up your chances of having other autoimmune issues. “If you do have Hashimoto’s, which is autoimmune, you can be , like celiac or pernicious anemia [B12 deficiency],” explains Dr. Kellis. “Knowing that information is potentially helpful, because if you have other symptoms, then you might want to be evaluated for another autoimmune condition.” If you’re at all uncertain about if you’re dealing with Hashimoto’s, hypothyroidism, or something else altogether, definitely talk to your PCP or endocrinologist. “Make an appointment to see your doctor, and ask that question directly,” Dr. Weinstein says. “Ask your physician specifically to have your thyroid antibodies checked along with your thyroid function,” adds Dr. Kellis. “Definitely advocate for yourself.” Gina Rodriguez on Hashimoto's, Equal Pay, and Learning to Fight For Herself Carolyn covers all things health and nutrition at SELF.

During migration, the thyroid remains connected to the tongue by a narrow canal, the . At the end of the fifth week the thyroglossal duct degenerates, and over the following two weeks the detached thyroid migrates to its final position. Euthyroid is the term used to describe a state of normal thyroid function in the body. Thyroid disorders include , , thyroid (), thyroid enlargement (), , and . Hyperthyroidism is characterized by excessive secretion of thyroid hormones: the most common cause is the . Hypothyroidism is characterized by a deficient secretion of thyroid hormones: the most common cause is . In iodine-deficient regions, hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency is the leading cause of preventable in children. In iodine-sufficient regions, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune disorder . The presence of the thyroid and its various diseases have been noted and treated for centuries, although the gland itself has only been described and named since the . Knowledge of the thyroid, its biochemistry, and its disorders developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolved throughout the mid-twentieth century, including refinement of surgical techniques for thyroid removal () for the treatment of ; the use of and for the treatment of Graves' disease; and for diagnosis of thyroid nodules. The thyroid gland surrounds the and and consists of two lobes. This image shows a variant thyroid with a pyramidal lobe emerging from the middle of the thyroid. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ composed of two lobes, left and right, connected by a narrow tissue band, called an ""isthmus"". It weighs 25 grams in adults, with each lobe being about 5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and 2 cm thick, and the isthmus about 1.25 cm in height and width. The gland is usually larger in women than in men, and increases in size during pregnancy. The thyroid is near the front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the and . The and lie just above the gland, below the . The isthmus extends from the second to third , with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The lie in front of the gland and the to the side. Behind the outer wings of the thyroid lie the two . The trachea, larynx, lower pharynx and esophagus all lie behind the thyroid. In this region, the and the inferior thyroid artery pass next to or in the ligament. Typically, four , two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the thyroid capsule, at the back of the thyroid lobes. The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. The outer layer is continuous with the , attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior , also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with the movement of these cartilages when swallowing occurs. The thyroid is supplied with arterial blood from the , a branch of the , and the , a branch of the , and sometimes by an the , which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via and , which drain to the , and via the . The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right . Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland. drainage frequently passes the (located just above the isthmus), and the and . The gland receives supply from the superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglion of the . The gland receives supply from the and the . Clear (center) as viewed from the front There are many in the size and shape of the thyroid gland, and in the position of the embedded parathyroid glands. Sometimes there is a third lobe present called the . When present, this lobe often stretches up the hyoid bone from the thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the , which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland's descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the of the tongue to the position of the thyroid in the adult. A small horn at the back of the thyroid lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called . Other variants include a , connecting the isthmus to the body of the , and the presence of the small . Section of a thyroid gland under the microscope. 1 colloid, 2 follicular cells, 3 cells At the , there are three primary features of the thyroid—follicles, , and , first discovered by Geoffery Websterson in 1664. are small spherical groupings of cells 0.02–0.9mm in diameter that play the main role in thyroid function. They consist of a rim that has a rich blood supply, nerve and lymphatic presence, that surrounds a core of that consists mostly of thyroid hormone precursor proteins called , an . The core of a follicle is surrounded by a single layer of follicular cells. When stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. They do this by transporting and metabolising the thyroglobulin contained in the colloid. Follicular cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar, depending on how active they are. Scattered among follicular cells and in spaces between the spherical follicles are another type of thyroid cell, parafollicular cells. These cells secrete and so are also called C cells. Floor of pharynx of embryo between 35 and 37 days after fertilization. In the , at 3–4 weeks , the thyroid gland appears as an proliferation in the floor of the pharynx at the base of the tongue between the and the . The copula soon becomes covered over by the at a point later indicated by the . The thyroid then descends in front of the pharyngeal gut as a bilobed through the . Over the next few weeks, it migrates to the base of the neck, passing in front of the hyoid bone. During migration, the thyroid remains connected to the tongue by a narrow canal, the thyroglossal duct. At the end of the fifth week the thyroglossal duct degenerates, and over the following two weeks the detached thyroid migrates to its final position. The and start to secrete (TRH) and (TSH). TSH is first measurable at 11 weeks. By 18–20 weeks, the production of (T) reaches a clinically significant and self-sufficient level. Fetal (T) remains low, less than 15 ng/dL until 30 weeks, and increases to 50 ng/dL at . The needs to be self-sufficient in thyroid hormones in order to guard against that would arise from maternal . The presence of sufficient iodine is essential for healthy neurodevelopment. The , also known as C cells, responsible for the production of , are derived from foregut endoderm. This part of the thyroid then first forms as the , which begins in the ventral fourth and joins the primordial thyroid gland during its descent to its final location. Aberrations in can result in various forms of which can cause , and if untreated this can lead to . The and have a number of metabolic, cardiovascular and developmental effects on the body. The production is stimulated by release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn depends on release of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). Every downstream hormone has and decreases the level of the hormone that stimulates its release. The primary function of the thyroid is the production of the iodine-containing , (T) and (T) and the . The thyroid hormones are created from and . T is so named because it contains three atoms of iodine per molecule and T contains four atoms of iodine per molecule. The thyroid hormones have a wide range of effects on the human body. These include: The thyroid hormones increase the and have effects on almost all body tissues. Appetite, the absorption of substances, and gut motility are all influenced by thyroid hormones. They increase the absorption in the gut, , , and of glucose. They stimulate the , and increase the number of . Despite increasing free fatty acids, thyroid hormones decrease levels, perhaps by increasing the rate of secretion of cholesterol in . The hormones increase the rate and strength of the heartbeat. They increase the rate of breathing, intake and consumption of oxygen, and increase the activity of . Combined, these factors increase blood flow and the body's temperature. Thyroid hormones are important for normal development. They increase the growth rate of young people, and cells of the developing brain are a major target for the thyroid hormones T and T. Thyroid hormones play a particularly crucial role in brain maturation during fetal development and first few years of postnatal life The thyroid hormones also play a role in maintaining normal sexual function, sleep, and thought patterns. Increased levels are associated with increased speed of thought generation but decreased focus. Sexual function, including libido and the maintenance of a normal , are influenced by thyroid hormones. After secretion, only a very small proportion of the thyroid hormones travel freely in the blood. Most are bound to (about 70%), (10%), and (15%). Only the 0.03% of T and 0.3% of T traveling freely have hormonal activity. In addition, up to 85% of the T in blood is produced following conversion from T by in organs around the body. Thyroid hormones act by crossing the and binding to , which bind with and to modulate . In addition to these actions on DNA, the thyroid hormones also act within the cell membrane or within cytoplasm via reactions with , including , , and . Synthesis of the , as seen on an individual : - is synthesized in the and follows the to enter the colloid in the lumen of the by . - Meanwhile, a pumps iodide (I) into the cell, which previously has crossed the by largely unknown mechanisms. - This iodide enters the follicular lumen from the cytoplasm by the transporter , in a purportedly manner. - In the colloid, iodide (I) is to iodine (I) by an enzyme called . - Iodine (I) is very reactive and iodinates the thyroglobulin at residues in its protein chain (in total containing approximately 120 tyrosyl residues). - In , adjacent tyrosyl residues are paired together. - The entire complex re-enters the follicular cell by . - by various liberates and molecules, which enters the blood by largely unknown mechanisms. The thyroid hormones are created from . This is a within the colloid in the that is originally created within the of follicular cells and then transported into the follicular lumen. Thyroglobulin contains 123 units of , which reacts with iodine within the follicular lumen. is essential for the production of the thyroid hormones. Iodine (I) travels in the blood as (I), which is taken up into the follicular cells by a . This is an on the cell membrane which in the same action transports two sodium ions and an iodide ion into the cell. Iodide then travels from within the cell into the lumen, through the action of , an iodide-chloride . In the follicular lumen, the iodide is then to iodine. This makes it more reactive, and the iodine is attached to the active tyrosine units in thyroglobulin by the enzyme . This forms the precursors of thyroid hormones (MIT), and (DIT). When the follicular cells are stimulated by , the follicular cells reabsorb thyroglobulin from the follicular lumen. The iodinated tyrosines are cleaved, forming the thyroid hormones T, T, DIT, MIT, and traces of . T and T are released into the blood. The hormones secreted from the gland are about 80–90% T and about 10–20% T. in peripheral tissues remove the iodine from MIT and DIT and convert T to T and RT This is a major source of both RT (95%) and T (87%) in peripheral tissues. The production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), released by the gland. TSH release in turn is stimulated by (TRH), released in a pulsatile manner from the . The thyroid hormones provide to the TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones are high, TSH production is suppressed. This negative feedback also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed. TRH is secreted at an increased rate in situations such as cold exposure in order to stimulate . In addition to being suppressed by the presence of thyroid hormones, TSH production is blunted by , , and . The thyroid gland also produces the hormone , which helps regulate blood levels. Parafollicular cells produce calcitonin in response to . Calcitonin decreases the release of calcium from bone, by decreasing the activity of , cells which break down bone. Bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by , so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of calcium into . The effects of calcitonin are opposite those of the (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands. However, calcitonin seems far less essential than PTH, since calcium metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of the thyroid (), but not the . Further information: About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells: 70% of these genes are expressed in thyroid cells. Two-hundred fifty of these genes are more specifically expressed in the thyroid, and about 20 genes are highly thyroid specific. In the follicular cells, the proteins synthesized by these genes direct thyroid hormone synthesis - , , and ; while in the parafollicular c-cells, they direct calcitonin synthesis - , and . , , and specialists play a role in identifying and monitoring the treatment of thyroid disease. and are thyroid specialists. Thyroid surgeons or are responsible for the surgical management of thyroid disease. Excessive production of the thyroid hormones is called . Causes include , , solitary , inflammation, and a which secretes excess TSH. Another cause is excess iodine availability, either from excess ingestion, induced by the drug , or following . Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, , anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause , , hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as . Long-term management of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as , and . Alternatively, can be used to destroy thyroid tissue: radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by thyroid cells, which over time destroys them. The chosen will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. can sometimes be performed as a , a . Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the and the , which innervates the . If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will inevitably result, and will be needed. An underactive thyroid gland results in . Typical symptoms are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, , , hair loss, cold intolerance, and . is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease is the most common cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs and , , and . Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in and severe cases can result in . Hypothyroidism is managed with replacement of the hormone . This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take a few weeks to become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as and may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation. is an autoimmune disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called , as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin. are often found on the gland, with a of 4–7%. The majority of nodules do not cause any symptoms, thyroid hormone secretion is normal, and they are non-cancerous. Non-cancerous cases include simple , , and . Malignant nodules, which only occur in about 5% of nodules, include , , carcinomas and from other sites Nodules are more likely in females, those who are exposed to radiation, and in those who are iodine deficient. When a nodule is present, determine whether the nodule is secreting excess thyroid hormones, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an is often used to investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A may then be performed, and the sample undergoes , in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells. The presence of multiple nodules is called a ; and if it is associated with hyperthyroidism, it is called a . An enlarged thyroid gland is called a . Goitres are present in some form in about 5% of people, and are the result of a large number of causes, including iodine deficiency, (both Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis), infection, inflammation, and infiltrative disease such as and . Sometimes no cause can be found, a state called ""simple goitre"". Some forms of goitre are associated with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus. Goitres may be associated with hyperthyoidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying cause of the goitre. Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are . Inflammation of the thyroid is called , and may cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types of thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes followed by a period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and . There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include , , , and traumatic injury, including . is an in which the thyroid gland is infiltrated by the and . These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's is more common in females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are , , . occurs in some females following . After delivery, the gland becomes inflamed and the condition initially presents with a period of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and, usually, a return to normal function. The course of the illness takes place over several months, and is characterised by a painless goitre. Antibodies against thyroid peroxidase can be found on testing. The inflammation usually resolves without treatment, although thyroid hormone replacement may be needed during the period of hypothyroidism. The most common affecting the thyroid gland is a benign , usually presenting as a painless mass in the neck. Malignant thyroid cancers are most often , although cancer can occur in any tissue that the thyroid consists of, including cancer of C-cells and lymphomas. Cancers from other sites also rarely lodge in the thyroid. Radiation of the head and neck presents a for thyroid cancer, and cancer is more common in women than men, occurring at a rate of about 2:1. In most cases, thyroid cancer presents as a painless mass in the neck. It is very unusual for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are , followed by , , and . Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier in the course of disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo . Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases. Thyroid cancers are treated by . Radioactive may be given to the thyroid. is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With the exception of the rare , which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable. A is the most common clinically significant of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form . Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have programs at birth. Infants with thyroid hormone deficiency () can manifest problems of physical growth and development as well as brain development, termed . Children with congenital hypothyroidism are treated supplementally with , which facilitates normal growth and development. Mucinous, clear secretions may collect within these cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3 cm in diameter. These are present in the midline of the anterior to the . Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by , which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the in the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers. Another disorder is that of which can result in various presentations of one or more accessory thyroid glands. These can be asymptomatic. Child affected by , associated with a lack of iodine. , most common in inland and mountainous areas, can predispose to goitre – if widespread, known as . Pregnant women deficient of iodine can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency. The use of to add iodine to the diet has eliminated endemic cretinism in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination of mandatory. Because the thyroid concentrates iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive of iodine produced by . In the event of large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of , taken in the form of potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the was an increase in in children in the years following the accident. Excessive iodine intake is uncommon and usually has no effect on the thyroid function. Sometimes though it may cause hyperthyroidism, and sometimes hypothyroidism with a resulting goitre. The thyroid is by observation of the gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then , usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves up and down with swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider the upper part of the chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (), listening to the gland with a for , testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. An examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Graves' disease. include a battery of , including the measurement of the thyroid hormones, as well as the measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH). TSH levels are considered the most sensitive marker of thyroid dysfunction. They are however not always accurate, particularly if the cause of hypothyroidism is thought to be related to insufficient (TRH) secretion, in which case it may be low or falsely normal. In such a case a TRH stimulation test, in which TRH is given and TSH levels are measured at 30 and 60-minutes after, may be conducted. T3 and T4 can be measured directly. However, as the two thyroid hormones travel bound to other molecules, and it is the ""free"" component that is biologically active, free T3 and free T4 levels can be measured. T4 is preferred, because in hypothyroidism T3 levels may be normal. The ratio of bound to unbound thyroid hormones is known as the thyroid hormone binding ratio (THBR). It is also possible to measure directly the main carriers of the thyroid hormones, thryoglobulin and throxine-binding globulin. Thyroglobulin will also be measurable in a healthy thyroid, and will increase with inflammation, and may also be used to measure the success of thyroid removal or ablation. If successful, thyroglobulin should be undetectable. Lastly, antibodies against components of the thyroid, particularly anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin, can be measured. These may be present in normal individuals but are highly for autoimmune-related disease. Ultrasound of the thyroid may be used to reveal whether structures are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled or uptake scan may take place. This can determine the size and shape of lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits . A of a sample of thyroid tissue may be taken in order to evaluate a lesion seen on ultrasound which is then sent for and . plays an important role in the evaluation of thyroid cancer. CT scans often incidentally find thyroid abnormalities, and thereby practically becomes the first investigation modality. The thyroid was named by after the ancient Greek shield of a similar pronunciation. Shown is an example of such a shield, as engraved on a . The thyroid gland received its modern name in the 1600s, when the anatomist likened its shape to that of an Ancient Greek shield or . However, the existence of the gland, and of the diseases associated with it, was known long before then. The presence and diseases of the thyroid have been noted and treated for thousands of years. In 1600 BCE burnt and (which contain iodine) were used within China for the treatment of goitres, a practice which has developed in many parts of the world. In , the book written about 1400 BCE described hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and goitre. and in the fifth century BCE describe cases of . Hippocrates and Plato in the fourth century BCE provided some of the first descriptions of the gland itself, proposing its function as a salivary gland. in the first century BCE referred to epidemics of goitre in the and proposed treatment with burnt seaweed, a practice also referred to by in the second century, referred to burnt sponge for the treatment of goitre. The text , written ca. 200-250, also refers to goitre. In 1500 polymath provided the first illustration of the thyroid. In 1543 anatomist gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its modern name, by the anatomist . The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name is derived from the used by Wharton – . means in Latin, and can be traced back to the word θυρεοειδής, meaning /. French chemist discovered iodine in 1811, and in 1896 documented it as the central ingredient in the thryoid gland. He did this by boiling the thyroid glands of a thousand sheep, and named the precipitate, a combination of the thyroid hormones, 'iodothyrin'. in 1907 proved that iodine is necessary for thyroid function. Graves' disease was described by in 1834. The role of the thyroid gland in metabolism was demonstrated in 1895 by . Thyroxine was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and triiodothyroxine in 1952. The conversion of T4 to T3 was discovered in 1970. The process of discovering TSH took place over the early to mid twentieth century. TRH was discovered by Polish endocrinologist in 1970, contributing in part to his Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1977. In the nineteenth century numerous authors described both and , and their relationship to the thyroid. Charles Mayo coined the term hyperthyroidism in 1910. documented a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912, in this disease were demonstrated in 1956. Knowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration. Either in the sixth century CE or Persian in 990 CE conducted the first recorded thyroidectomy as a treatment for goitre. Operations remained risky and generally were not successful until the 19th century, when descriptions emerged from a number of authors including Prussian surgeon , Swiss surgeon and physiologist , American physician , American surgeons and . These descriptions provided the basis for modern thyroid surgery. went on to win the in 1909 ""for his work on the physiology, pathology and surgery of the thyroid gland"". The thyroid gland is found in all . In fish, it is usually located below the gills and is not always divided into distinct lobes. However, in some , patches of thyroid tissue are found elsewhere in the body, associated with the kidneys, spleen, heart, or eyes. In , the thyroid is always found somewhere in the neck region. In most tetrapod species, there are two paired thyroid glands – that is, the right and left lobes are not joined together. However, there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most , and the shape found in humans is common to many other species. In larval , the thyroid originates as an , secreting its hormones into the gut, and associated with the larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the and , have a structure very similar to that of larval lampreys (the ), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds, though not thyroxine. Thyroxine is critical to , and growth throughout the animal kingdom. Iodine and T4 trigger the from a plant-eating water-dwelling into a meat-eating land-dwelling , with better neurological, visuospatial, smell and cognitive abilities for hunting, as seen in other predatory animals. A similar phenomenon happens in the amphibian , which, without introducing iodine, don't transform into land-dwelling adults, and live and reproduce in the larval form of aquatic . Among , administering a thyroid-blocking agent such as (PTU) can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs; in contrast, administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis. In amphibian metamorphosis, thyroxine and iodine also exert a well-studied experimental model of on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles. Iodine, via iodolipids, has favored the evolution of terrestrial animal species and has likely played a crucial role in the of the human brain. Boron WF, Boulpaep EL (2012). (2nd ed.).

fb36cc9c-35af-4794-bf8d-b159a433a143,"— Thyroid conditions, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroid cancer, are common. For example, up to 7% of the U.S. population has hypothyroidism, a condition in which your thyroid doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones (). Depending on the type of disease, thyroid conditions are typically treated with medications like thyroid hormone replacement, surgery, and other procedures, such as radiation therapy for thyroid cancer. In addition to conventional treatments for thyroid conditions, research shows that dietary interventions, including supplements, may help treat certain thyroid diseases. However, certain supplements may do more harm than good when it comes to thyroid health. This article explains how supplements may help certain people with thyroid-related health conditions. If you walk down the supplement aisle of your favorite health food store, you’ll likely see a section dedicated to thyroid health. Due to the prevalence of , many supplement companies have started making supplements that are designed to “support thyroid health.” Although some of these products are harmless, certain thyroid supplements may lead to negative side effects and can even harm your thyroid. Before addressing why thyroid-specific supplements may not be the best choice for everyone, it’s important to explain what nutrients the thyroid needs for optimal functioning. Here are some of the most important nutrients for thyroid health: Selenium, a mineral needed for thyroid hormone production, helps protect the thyroid from damage caused by oxidative stress. The thyroid contains high amounts of selenium, and a deficiency can lead to thyroid dysfunction (). Iodine is critical for thyroid function. In fact, currently, the only known role of iodine is to support thyroid hormone production. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are thyroid hormones that contain iodine. causes thyroid disease (, ). The mineral zinc is required for thyroid hormone production. An optimal concentration of zinc is needed for healthy levels of T3, T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (). The thyroid needs iron to convert T4 into T3, the active form of thyroid hormone. Iron deficiency is associated with thyroid dysfunction (). Other nutrients, including B vitamins and vitamins A and E, are also needed for optimal thyroid function. Being deficient in one or more nutrients can negatively affect thyroid health and increase your risk of thyroid disease (, , , ). For most people, following a rich in whole foods is enough to maintain optimal thyroid function. However, certain populations may need to supplement their diet with vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients to maintain overall health, including the health of the thyroid. These populations include people on restrictive diets, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and those who have a thyroid condition or other health issues. There’s no doubt that a nutritious diet that provides optimal nutrient levels is important for maintaining thyroid health, nor that can lead to thyroid issues. Still, for people who don’t have thyroid issues and follow a well-balanced, nutrient-dense diet, there’s typically no need to take thyroid-specific supplements. In fact, certain supplements marketed toward those looking to promote thyroid health may be dangerous to take. For example, many thyroid supplements contain high amounts of iodine and may contain thyroid hormones. Taking these supplements can lead to dangerous side effects and create thyroid issues in people with healthy thyroid function (). One study that analyzed 10 thyroid supplements found that the majority of them contained detectable amounts of T3 and T4. Some of the products tested contained more T3 and T4 than healthcare providers typically prescribe to people with hypothyroidism (). Taking these supplements may lead to elevated thyroid hormone levels in the blood and cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which can lead to dangerous complications (, , ). What’s more, from supplements may cause hypothyroidism in susceptible individuals (, , ). Thyroid supplements may be unsafe for people who have thyroid conditions, too. This is because people with thyroid issues have specific needs, and taking supplements marketed to enhance thyroid health may negatively affect thyroid function, causing their health and symptoms to worsen. As such, people with and without thyroid conditions should avoid taking supplements marketed to promote thyroid health. Instead, work with a practitioner to come up with a healthy and safe plan that’s based on your specific needs and health status. It’s a smart idea to stay away from dietary supplements marketed to improve thyroid health. These products can cause health issues in people with and without thyroid disease. is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States. It’s an autoimmune disease in which the immune system produces antibodies that attack the thyroid, causing fibrosis or scarring of the thyroid tissue (). Hashimoto’s disease is associated with a variety of symptoms, including weight gain, fatigue, hair loss, anemia, constipation, cold intolerance, joint pain, dry skin, mood changes, difficulty concentrating, and more (). In addition to medication, can help reduce thyroid damage and improve symptoms and overall quality of life in people with Hashimoto’s. Plus, people with Hashimoto’s disease are more likely to be deficient in certain nutrients, which can worsen Hashimoto’s-related symptoms. Studies show that the following supplements can be beneficial for those with Hashimoto’s disease: Studies have shown that supplementing with 200 mcg of selenium per day may help decrease thyroid antibodies and improve mood in people with Hashimoto’s (, ). Inositol is a type of sugar that plays an important role in thyroid function. Some evidence suggests that daily treatment with 600 mg of Myo-Inositol and 83 mcg of selenium may help improve thyroid function in people with Hashimoto’s (, ). Zinc is needed for thyroid hormone production, and a deficiency can result in hypothyroidism. When used alone or in combination with selenium, 30 mg of zinc per day may help enhance thyroid function in people with Hashimoto’s disease (, ). Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in people with Hashimoto’s disease. Taking a B12 or B complex supplement can help prevent and treat deficiency, as well as maintain optimal B12 levels (, ) A magnesium deficiency may increase your risk of developing Hashimoto’s disease and is associated with elevated thyroid antibody levels. Correcting magnesium deficiency may improve Hashimoto’s symptoms (, ). Many women with Hashimoto’s disease have low iron levels or . Anemia negatively affects thyroid function. An iron supplement may be necessary to restore iron to optimal levels (). People with Hashimoto’s disease are more likely to be deficient in vitamin D than the general population, and vitamin D deficiency can have an adverse effect on thyroid function (, ). may help protect your thyroid against oxidative damage. Plus, taking curcumin alongside other anti-inflammatory compounds may help reduce the size of thyroid nodules, which are common in Hashimoto’s disease (, ). Research suggests that taking a vitamin C supplement may help reduce thyroid antibodies in people with Hashimoto’s disease (). Other supplements may help people with Hashimoto’s as well. However, the supplements above have the most research to support their use in the management of Hashimoto’s disease. Research suggests that certain supplements, including selenium, zinc, iron, and vitamins D and B12, may be beneficial for people with Hashimoto’s disease. is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. Like Hashimoto’s disease, it’s considered an autoimmune condition. In Graves’ disease, the immune system attacks your thyroid, causing it to overproduce thyroid hormones. Graves’ disease can also lead to or an enlarged thyroid (). Symptoms associated with Graves’ disease include weight loss, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, diarrhea, eye pain and irritation, fatigue, weakness, menstrual irregularities, insomnia, nervousness, and more (). Current treatment of Graves’ disease includes surgery, medication, and radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) (). Like Hashimoto’s disease, some research shows that dietary modifications may help improve symptoms and quality of life in people with Graves’ disease (). The following supplements may help people with Graves’ disease: Selenium deficiency can raise your risk of Graves’ disease. A review found selenium supplements in daily dosages of 100–300 mcg led to improved thyroid function at 6 months in people with Graves’ disease, but this effect was lost at 9 months (). Research shows that people with Graves’ disease are more likely to be than the general population. Correcting deficiency by taking a supplement may improve thyroid function (, , ). Research has found that hyperthyroidism depletes your body’s stores of carnitine, which plays a critical role in energy production. Taking L-carnitine may help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in people with hyperthyroidism (, ). People with Graves’ disease are at a greater risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency. Taking a high quality B12 or B complex supplement can help maintain healthy B12 levels (, , ). Other supplements may help people with Graves’ disease. Work with a knowledgeable healthcare practitioner to develop a supplement regimen that’s right for you. According to research, vitamin D, selenium, L-carnitine, and vitamin B12 may help people with Graves’ disease. is considered a rare type of cancer, accounting for just 1–4% of all cancers in the United States. Cancers that stem from follicular cells in the thyroid account for up to 95% of all thyroid cancers (). Treatment for thyroid cancer includes surgical resection, radiation therapy, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression, radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, total thyroidectomy, and palliative care management for untreatable thyroid cancer. In addition to traditional treatment, diet, supplements, and lifestyle modifications may enhance treatment outcomes and improve quality of life in people with thyroid cancer. Some animal and test-tube research suggests that omega-3 fats, , L-carnitine, quercetin, melatonin, resveratrol, selenium, inositol, zinc, and vitamins C, E, A, and D may benefit those with thyroid cancer (, , ). Additionally, low iodine intake is linked to an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and research suggests that correcting iodine deficiency can help protect against the development of more aggressive forms of thyroid cancer (). However, although many of these nutrients, including vitamin D and selenium, are known to have anticancer effects, there’s currently a lack of human studies investigating the effects of these dietary supplements in people with thyroid cancer (, ). Therefore, more studies are needed before these supplements can be routinely recommended for people with thyroid cancer (, ). The best way to determine the best supplement regimen for your specific needs is to consult your healthcare provider. Oftentimes, either your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian that specializes in oncology nutrition will recommend supplements depending on your diet, overall health, and what treatments you’re currently undergoing for thyroid cancer. Although research suggests that some supplements may benefit people with thyroid cancer, human research is lacking. To ensure your safety, it’s best to check with your medical provider before taking any supplements. As mentioned above, it’s best to avoid thyroid-specific supplement blends unless they’re specifically recommended by your healthcare provider. Taking these supplements can harm your thyroid and lead to a thyroid condition (, , , ). Still, there are many vitamins, minerals, and other dietary supplements that have been shown to improve thyroid function, reduce disease symptoms, and improve overall quality of life in people with thyroid disease. For people who have Hashimoto’s disease, Graves’ disease, thyroid cancer, or other condition that affects the thyroid gland, it’s best to work with a qualified healthcare provider who specializes in thyroid conditions. This is especially important if you’re currently taking medications. Many supplements, especially herbal products, have the potential to interact with commonly prescribed medications and may lead to dangerous side effects. Lastly, it’s important to always purchase supplements from trusted brands that independently test their products for quality and purity using organizations like and . If you’re interested in taking supplements to treat a thyroid condition, it’s important to work with a qualified healthcare provider. They can help you choose supplements based on your specific needs and health status. Research shows that some vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients may benefit people with certain thyroid conditions.

This is a bit of a pointless post so feel free to skip lol but I posted recently and gave two lots of my blood results for opinions (there were loads of helpful replies). Having only tested for TCH and fT4 I was recommended to try a private test. I finally built up the courage (I’m such a wimp) to stab myself with the lancet this morning (phew!!) and results go in the post today for thyroid + vits (Medicheck) so when these are through I’ll post for advice. In the meantime I’ve had my thyroid function tests back from the gp and these are now within ‘normal’ range. No further action required apparently. I was originally diagnosed as hyper and told I have Graves. Given carbimazole and sent in my way. I complained my symptoms were more hypo than hyper but was told to carry on. I reduced then stopped taking the carbimazole as it was making me feel awful and I’ve been off it for a few months and it would appear my results have stabilised? Would you agree? I now wonder if I ever had a thyroid problem in the first place. I was suffering from tachycardia (other heart issues rules out) but nothing much else. My bloods don’t look like the hypo results I’ve seen on here either. I am awaiting the results from Medicheck as this will show antibodies and any vitamin deficiencies (struggled with B12 in the past) -and hopefully give more answers. I suspect that if I have anything it’s hashi’s but I’m fairly convinced now I’m not hyper. I put on a stone in a month and have a host of other hypo symptoms now but maybe it’s not related at all and I’m just getting older! I'm getting the feeling, reading your post, that you may be yet another member who was given Carbimazole without having TSI/TRAb antibodies tested which are the antibodies for Graves (one cause of hyperthyroidism). There are a few thoughts going on in my head but I wont elaborate on them until you post your Medichecks results as I may be on the wrong track. Make a new post when you get your results back. If you've not already posted your sample, my advice would be to hand your envelope over the Post Office counter and pay for Special Delivery Guaranteed by 1pm Next Day and keep hold of your receipt as it has the tracking number on it and you can check when it is delivered. That should then be delivered to the lab by 9am tomorrow and you should get your results on Thursday. If you've asked for Doctor's Comments it may take an extra day. Please include the reference ranges with the results in your new post and either link back to this post or include some background again so members understand what's been going on before commenting.

Thyroid disorders are very common in the general U.S. population, affecting up to 27 million Americans, although half that number remains undiagnosed. It is second only to as the most common condition to affect the endocrine system — a group of glands that secrete hormones that help regulate growth, reproduction, and nutrient use by cells. As a result, it is common for an individual to be affected by both thyroid disease and diabetes. Since the thyroid gland plays a central role in the regulation of metabolism, abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on the control of diabetes. In addition, untreated thyroid disorder can increase the risk of certain and can aggravate many diabetes symptoms. Luckily, abnormal thyroid function can easily be diagnosed by simple blood tests, and effective treatment is available. For all of these reasons, periodic screening for thyroid disorder should be considered in all people with diabetes. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck, just below the Adam’s apple and above the collarbone. It produces two hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which enter the bloodstream and affect the metabolism of the , liver, muscles, and other organs. The thyroid gland operates as part of a feedback mechanism involving the hypothalamus, an area of the brain, and the pituitary gland, which is located within the brain. First, the hypothalamus sends a signal to the pituitary through a hormone called TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone). When the pituitary gland receives this signal, it releases TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to the thyroid gland. Upon receiving TSH, the thyroid responds by producing and releasing the two thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). The pituitary gland “monitors” the level of thyroid hormone in the blood and increases or decreases the amount of TSH released, which in turns regulates the amount of thyroid hormone produced. Thyroid hormone regulates the way the body uses energy. It works by attaching to specific proteins called receptors that are present in cells throughout the human body. Therefore, thyroid hormone exerts wide-ranging effects in regulating the function of virtually every organ. Consequently, any changes in the blood level of thyroid hormone can affect many body systems and cause a wide range of symptoms. The extent to which each organ is affected varies widely between individuals, which is why thyroid dysfunction causes very different symptoms in different people. In general, the severity of symptoms of abnormal thyroid function depends on the severity of the actual condition, the length of time it has been present, and the person’s age. As a result, it is difficult to correctly diagnose thyroid disorder based only on symptoms. Fortunately, precise measurement of thyroid function is now possible with the TSH blood test, a test that directly measures the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. There are two basic disorders of the thyroid: hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, and hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. The most common disorder of the thyroid is an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism. Some studies have shown that up to 10% of women and 3% of men in the United States have hypothyroidism and receive thyroxine replacement therapy. Although hypothyroidism can occur at any age and in either sex, it is most common in older women. It is estimated that up to 1 in 5 women over the age of 65 may have hypothyroidism. At the other end of the age range, 1 out of every 4,000 babies in the United States is born without a properly functioning thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). (For more information about populations in which thyroid disorders are more likely, see ) The symptoms and effects of hypothyroidism can vary greatly depending on the age and sex of the affected individual. The lack of thyroid hormone in an infant with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may cause cretinism, a condition resulting in severe growth delay and mental retardation. Routine screening for hypothyroidism in all newborns by a heel prick blood test has decreased the incidence of cretinism. In older children, signs of hypothyroidism can include unexplained daytime fatigue, changes in school grades, difficulty concentrating, and inattentiveness in school. Sometimes, however, an unexplained change in growth rate is the only evidence of thyroid failure in children. In women of reproductive age, hypothyroidism can impair fertility and increase the risk of miscarriage during the second trimester. Other symptoms may include a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland), fatigue, weight gain, mood swings, , dry skin, brittle hair, fluid retention, muscle weakness, and constipation. In the elderly, the symptoms can be very vague and are often mistaken for depression or dementia, since thyroid failure can cause sleep disturbance and poor memory. Worldwide, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is dietary iodine deficiency. However, since iodine has been added to salt and other foods in the United States, hypothyrodism caused by iodine deficiency is very rare among Americans. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is an inherited autoimmune condition called Hashimoto thyroiditis, which affects up to 14 million people. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. These natural defenses use proteins called antibodies. Hashimoto thyroiditis produces antibodies that damage the thyroid tissue, resulting in thyroid failure. Other common causes of hypothyroidism include the surgical removal of the thyroid, exposure to radiation such as radioactive iodine therapy, or external radiation used to treat some forms of cancer. Certain drugs such as lithium carbonate (for treatment of bipolar disorder) and amiodarone (brand names Cordarone, Nexterone, Pacerone, a drug prescribed for certain heart conditions) can cause hypothyroidism. Rarely, abnormalities of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland may result in hypothyroidism. Overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism, is less common than hypothyroidism. It tends to affect all age groups equally, but it is nine times more common in women. Like hypothyroidism, the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are varied and can be vague, particularly if the disease progresses slowly over a prolonged period. In children, it can result in accelerated growth, hyperactivity, loss of concentration, poor handwriting, and short-term memory loss. In young women, it may result in absent or irregular periods, recurrent miscarriages, and infertility. In older women, hyperthyroidism can cause hot flashes, mood swings, sweating, and weight changes, symptoms that may be confused with signs of menopause. Other typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism include irritability, fast heart rate, weight loss despite increased appetite, frequent bowel movements, insomnia, decreased energy level, and shaky hands. In addition, a goiter may be present. (To learn more about symptoms of thyroid disorders, see ) The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in people under age 40 is Graves disease, a type of autoimmune thyroid disease. In this case, the antibodies stimulate the thyroid to enlarge and overproduce thyroid hormone. Some people with Graves disease develop eye problems that can cause the eyes to protrude and that may threaten vision. Other causes of hyperthyroidism include thyroid nodules, which are overactive (usually noncancerous) growths in an otherwise normal thyroid gland, and thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid gland. (See for more information about thyroid disorders.) People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing thyroid disorder. In the general population, approximately 6% of people have some form of thyroid disorder. However, the prevalence of thyroid disorder increases to over 10% in people with diabetes. Since people with one form of autoimmune disorder have an increased chance of developing other autoimmune disorders, people with Type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of autoimmune thyroid disorder. Up to 30% of women with Type 1 diabetes have some form of autoimmune thyroid disease. Postpartum thyroiditis, a form of autoimmune thyroid disease that causes thyroid dysfunction within a few months after delivery of a child, is three times more common in women with diabetes. Although Type 2 diabetes is not an autoimmune disorder, there have been many reports showing a higher occurrence of thyroid diseases, particularly hypothyroidism, among people with Type 2 diabetes. The association between Type 2 diabetes and thyroid disorder, however, remains unexplained. Since normal thyroid function is essential to regulate energy metabolism, abnormal thyroid function may have profound effects on blood glucose control in diabetes. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can affect the course of diabetes, but their effects are somewhat different. Hyperthyroidism is typically associated with worsening blood glucose control and increased insulin requirements. The excessive thyroid hormone causes increased glucose production in the liver, rapid absorption of glucose through the intestines, and increased (a condition in which the body does not use insulin efficiently). It may be important to consider underlying thyroid disorder if a person has unexplained weight loss, deterioration in blood glucose control, or increased requirements. Sometimes hyperthyroidism may even unmask latent diabetes. Having diabetes increases a person’s risk for heart disease, and many people with diabetes have a heart condition such as coronary heart disease or heart failure. Since hyperthyroidism causes rapid heart rate and increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythm, it may also bring on angina (chest pain), worsen heart failure or interfere with the treatment of heart failure, as well as further increase the risk of other heart problems. Prolonged, untreated hyperthyroidism can cause excessive bone loss, leading to , or bone thinning. Osteoporosis raises the risk of bone fractures, making falling much more dangerous. People with diabetes who have peripheral are at an increased risk for falls due to poor foot sensation and sometimes loss of or loss of the stimuli that tell the brain where a body part is in space, in relation to other objects. Therefore, the combination of hyperthyroidism and diabetes, particularly when neuropathy is present, increases the risk of fractures that may result in disability, especially in the elderly. Hypothyroidism rarely causes significant changes in blood glucose control, although it can reduce the clearance of insulin from the bloodstream, so the dose of insulin may be reduced. More important, hypothyroidism is accompanied by a variety of abnormalities in blood lipid levels. This includes increased total and LDL (low-density lipoprotein or “bad”) cholesterol levels, and increased levels. The abnormal lipid pattern typical of Type 2 diabetes (low HDL, or “good” cholesterol; high triglycerides; and a high proportion of small, dense LDL particles) is usually worsened by hypothyroidism. These changes further raise the already high risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and among people with diabetes. Pregnancy-related thyroid dysfunction is three times more common in women with diabetes and should be anticipated in every pregnant woman with Type 1 diabetes. Postpartum thyroiditis may cause fluctuating thyroid hormone levels in the months following delivery. In addition to symptoms such as fatigue, depression (the “baby blues”), irritability, and heart palpitations, blood glucose control and insulin requirements may be affected during this period of thyroid dysfunction and profound reproductive hormonal changes. Continued monitoring of thyroid function is necessary in all women who experience postpartum thyroiditis, since roughly one-third will develop permanent hypothyroidism within three to four years and will require thyroxine replacement. Women who have diagnosed hypothyroidism and already take thyroxine before pregnancy often need to increase the dose of thyroxine during pregnancy. Adequate thyroxine replacement is vital for the baby’s neurological development. Women with active Graves disease may enter a period of remission during pregnancy, when the disease becomes less active, but they can expect a recurrence following delivery. If hyperthyroidism is poorly controlled during pregnancy, the risk of maternal complications such as preeclampsia (a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure) and fetal problems such as prematurity increases. The maintenance of normal thyroid function and is therefore of utmost importance during pregnancy to ensure a successful outcome. As mentioned earlier, the diagnosis of abnormal thyroid function based solely on symptoms can be difficult. In people with diabetes, it may be even more difficult because of the complex interrelationships of thyroid function and diabetes. Both chronically high blood glucose and hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss despite good appetite, weakness, and fatigue. Likewise, severe can produce symptoms such as swelling, weight gain, and hypertension, which may be confused with hypothyroidism. The most reliable method used to diagnose thyroid disease is the simple, relatively inexpensive, yet highly sensitive TSH blood test. This test measures directly the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. Since the pituitary is the first organ to recognize abnormal thyroid function, testing its function is the most sensitive way to monitor thyroid function. In addition to diagnosis, the TSH test is also used to monitor and adjust the dosage of thyroxine therapy. Before the introduction of the TSH test in the late 1960s, blood tests for thyroid function measured only the levels of the thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. However, these hormone levels can appear relatively normal even when the thyroid is not functioning normally, because the pituitary gland will compensate for thyroid dysfunction. When the thyroid starts to fail (a sign of early hypothyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing higher levels of TSH to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones, thereby maintaining normal circulating T3 and T4 levels. Conversely, when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (a sign of early hyperthyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing less TSH, thereby reducing T3 and T4 production from the thyroid. Therefore, prior to any changes in the thyroid hormone levels, there is a detectable change in the TSH level, which indicates abnormal thyroid function. A normal TSH level ranges from 0.4 mU/ml to 4.0 mU/ml (microunits per milliliter). A below-normal TSH level indicates hyperthyroidism, and an above-normal TSH level indicates hypothyroidism. An elevated TSH level accompanied by normal thyroid hormone levels is known as subclinical hypothyroidism. People with subclinical hypothyroidism often do not have any symptoms. However, they do face the increased risks of cardiovascular disease associated with hypothyroidism, due to the abnormalities in blood lipid levels. Some doctors have even suggested that a TSH level in the upper-normal range (2.5–4.0 mU/ml) should be considered as evolving thyroid failure. Thyroid antibodies that are produced in autoimmune thyroid diseases can also be measured by blood testing. The presence of these antibodies can help determine the underlying cause of thyroid disorder. The most specific antibody test is called the anti-TPO antibody test. Nearly all thyroid diseases are treatable. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism often require long-term or lifelong treatment, depending on the specifics of the diagnosis. The treatment for hypothyroidism is to replace the missing thyroid hormone. The most common form of thyroid hormone is a synthetic derivative, levothyroxine, which is usually taken as one pill daily. This is a simple yet very effective treatment of hypothyroidism. Once the treatment is started, TSH testing every two or three months is necessary to adjust to the correct dose. When a stable dose is achieved, annual TSH testing is generally adequate for monitoring purposes. The symptoms of hypothyroidism may take several months of therapy to resolve. Often, lifelong treatment is necessary. Natural thyroid extract derived from animal sources is a less commonly used form of thyroid replacement and has the disadvantage of inconsistent dosage that varies from one batch of pills to another. Certain supplements, including supplements, calcium supplements, and that contain iron or calcium, can interfere with the absorption of thyroxine. For this reason, these pills should be taken at least two hours apart from thyroxine. In addition, it’s a good idea to let your physician know of any supplements or other medicines you take in addition to levothyroxine. There are several options for treatment of hyperthyroidism, with the choice dependent on the cause of the disorder; it must be individually determined. Long-term oral antithyroid medicines such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are effective in controlling the production of thyroid hormone. Regular blood test monitoring is necessary throughout the course of treatment. Radioactive iodine therapy is the most common treatment used in the United States for hyperthyroidism. It has a very high cure rate but often results in permanent hypothyroidism. Surgery offers an alternative, particularly in people with very large goiters. All these treatments are effective in controlling or curing hyperthyroidism. Abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on diabetes control and increase a person’s risk of developing diabetic complications. Because of the complications that can result from untreated thyroid disorder, regular screening is recommended to allow early detection and treatment. For people with Type 1 diabetes, annual screening is advisable. For people with Type 2 diabetes, screening should be done at the time of diagnosis and then repeated every five years thereafter. The frequency of screening should increase with advancing age, since the incidence of thyroid disorder increases with age. For people over the age of 60, annual screening is recommended.

Thyroid disorders are very common in the general U.S. population, affecting up to 27 million Americans, although half that number remains undiagnosed. It is second only to as the most common condition to affect the endocrine system — a group of glands that secrete hormones that help regulate growth, reproduction, and nutrient use by cells. As a result, it is common for an individual to be affected by both thyroid disease and diabetes. Since the thyroid gland plays a central role in the regulation of metabolism, abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on the control of diabetes. In addition, untreated thyroid disorder can increase the risk of certain and can aggravate many diabetes symptoms. Luckily, abnormal thyroid function can easily be diagnosed by simple blood tests, and effective treatment is available. For all of these reasons, periodic screening for thyroid disorder should be considered in all people with diabetes. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck, just below the Adam’s apple and above the collarbone. It produces two hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which enter the bloodstream and affect the metabolism of the , liver, muscles, and other organs. The thyroid gland operates as part of a feedback mechanism involving the hypothalamus, an area of the brain, and the pituitary gland, which is located within the brain. First, the hypothalamus sends a signal to the pituitary through a hormone called TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone). When the pituitary gland receives this signal, it releases TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to the thyroid gland. Upon receiving TSH, the thyroid responds by producing and releasing the two thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). The pituitary gland “monitors” the level of thyroid hormone in the blood and increases or decreases the amount of TSH released, which in turns regulates the amount of thyroid hormone produced. Thyroid hormone regulates the way the body uses energy. It works by attaching to specific proteins called receptors that are present in cells throughout the human body. Therefore, thyroid hormone exerts wide-ranging effects in regulating the function of virtually every organ. Consequently, any changes in the blood level of thyroid hormone can affect many body systems and cause a wide range of symptoms. The extent to which each organ is affected varies widely between individuals, which is why thyroid dysfunction causes very different symptoms in different people. In general, the severity of symptoms of abnormal thyroid function depends on the severity of the actual condition, the length of time it has been present, and the person’s age. As a result, it is difficult to correctly diagnose thyroid disorder based only on symptoms. Fortunately, precise measurement of thyroid function is now possible with the TSH blood test, a test that directly measures the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. There are two basic disorders of the thyroid: hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, and hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. The most common disorder of the thyroid is an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism. Some studies have shown that up to 10% of women and 3% of men in the United States have hypothyroidism and receive thyroxine replacement therapy. Although hypothyroidism can occur at any age and in either sex, it is most common in older women. It is estimated that up to 1 in 5 women over the age of 65 may have hypothyroidism. At the other end of the age range, 1 out of every 4,000 babies in the United States is born without a properly functioning thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). (For more information about populations in which thyroid disorders are more likely, see ) The symptoms and effects of hypothyroidism can vary greatly depending on the age and sex of the affected individual. The lack of thyroid hormone in an infant with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may cause cretinism, a condition resulting in severe growth delay and mental retardation. Routine screening for hypothyroidism in all newborns by a heel prick blood test has decreased the incidence of cretinism. In older children, signs of hypothyroidism can include unexplained daytime fatigue, changes in school grades, difficulty concentrating, and inattentiveness in school. Sometimes, however, an unexplained change in growth rate is the only evidence of thyroid failure in children. In women of reproductive age, hypothyroidism can impair fertility and increase the risk of miscarriage during the second trimester. Other symptoms may include a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland), fatigue, weight gain, mood swings, , dry skin, brittle hair, fluid retention, muscle weakness, and constipation. In the elderly, the symptoms can be very vague and are often mistaken for depression or dementia, since thyroid failure can cause sleep disturbance and poor memory. Worldwide, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is dietary iodine deficiency. However, since iodine has been added to salt and other foods in the United States, hypothyrodism caused by iodine deficiency is very rare among Americans.

a045dbc4-07a2-46e7-ae3c-5d51b63a7947,"— The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped, hormone-secreting gland located in the front of the neck. Thyroid hormones play an important role in: Several conditions can cause a thyroid hormone imbalance. The most common are autoimmune diseases and . If your doctor suspects that you have a thyroid disorder, they may recommend one or several that are part of a thyroid function panel. These tests measure thyroid hormone levels in the blood and can help determine how your thyroid gland is functioning. In some cases, your doctor may also perform the following tests: The TSH test is sometimes given on its own as a preliminary screening test. TSH is produced in the pituitary gland. It stimulates the thyroid to produce triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). An imbalance in TSH provides information about your thyroid and its ability to produce and secrete thyroid hormones. It’s often the most sensitive indicator that a thyroid problem is present. The normal range of TSH levels in adults is between 0.4 to 4.0 mIU/L (milli-international units per liter). that this range should actually be more like 0.45 to 2.5 mIU/L. The TSH range may also vary slightly based on the testing facility where your blood is being analyzed. , and pregnant women can fall outside of the normal range for adults. If you’re already being treated for a thyroid disorder, your doctor will probably consider your TSH level to be normal if it’s somewhere between 0.5 to 3.0 mIU/L. This may vary based upon your age and gender. TSH levels are only one indicator of how your thyroid is functioning. They vary by gender, age, and other factors. In general, normal, low, and high TSH levels are: Thyroid hormones can affect brain and nervous system development of the baby, especially during the first trimester. At around 12 weeks, the baby will start to produce thyroid hormones of its own. Until then, the baby is entirely dependent on the transfer of thyroid hormones from the mother. Both and can occur during pregnancy. You may also have one of these conditions prior to getting pregnant and not know it. Untreated thyroid disease can cause , , or low birth weight. It can also cause . Having an underactive thyroid during pregnancy can also affect the baby’s growth and brain development. It’s important to have your TSH levels checked during pregnancy to make sure that both you and your baby remain healthy. Hormones secreted during pregnancy can affect TSH levels, altering them from your typical numbers. This chart provides an overview of normal, low, and high TSH levels for pregnant women who are between 18 and 45 years old: Talk to your doctor about your TSH levels during pregnancy. Your doctor can determine if you need thyroid medication or if your existing thyroid medication needs to be adjusted based on the desired TSH levels for the different stages of pregnancy. If your TSH level is lower than it should be, you may have hyperthyroidism. This occurs when the pituitary gland senses thyroid hormone levels that are too high and compensates by decreasing TSH production. eye bulging or trouble with vision (more likely to occur if your overactive thyroid is associated with ) Many symptoms of hyperthyroidism are also caused by other conditions. A doctor can determine if the symptoms you’re experiencing are caused by low TSH levels or something else. Older adults may have little to no symptoms. change in bowel movements, especially greater rates of frequency An overactive thyroid can be caused by several conditions, including: If your TSH level is higher than it should be, you may have hypothyroidism. This occurs when the pituitary gland overcompensates for low amounts of thyroid hormone by pumping out more TSH. This condition is most common in older women, but it can occur in any gender at any age. Infants with congenital hypothyroidism can also be born with high TSH levels. The risks and complications of underactive thyroid vary based on age. If left untreated, risks and complications of hypothyroidism in adults can include: If left untreated, risks and complications in infants include: poor muscle tone, which can escalate and cause physical disability If left untreated, risks and complications in children and teenagers include: developmental delays and reduced cognitive ability Hypothyroidism can be asymptomatic in its early stages. As it progresses, you may experience some or all of these symptoms below. Many of the symptoms are nonspecific and can be seen in other conditions as well. So, it’s important to have your thyroid hormones tested if you experience any of the following: (autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland) certain medications, like and lithium Having a doctor monitor your thyroid gland and its production of thyroid hormones is the only way to comprehensively determine thyroid health. The thyroid is one of several glands and structures that make up the body’s . It works in partnership with the pituitary and hypothalamus glands. These glands stimulate the thyroid to secrete two hormones, which are then released into the bloodstream: T4 and T3. If your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough T3 or T4, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) can result. If your thyroid gland produces too much T4, hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) can result. It’s important to note that there’s some controversy about what TSH levels are normal. For this reason, it’s important to talk to your doctor about any symptoms you’re experiencing. You should also let them know about other medical conditions you have and any medications you’re taking. A doctor will diagnose a thyroid disorder by reviewing your medical history, conducting a physical examination, and doing multiple tests, including a blood test. In some, but not all, instances, you may need a or . Treatments for hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can change over time, based on the severity of the condition and your response to medication. Hypothyroidism is treated with , a synthetic thyroid hormone. Levothyroxine is an oral medication that’s taken daily on an empty stomach. Your dosage may change over time and is usually adjusted based on blood levels. Hyperthyroidism may be treated several ways. Your age, the severity of the condition, the underlying cause, and your overall health will be taken into account. Treatments include: These oral medications stop your thyroid from producing too much hormone. The most commonly prescribed medication for this condition is methimazole (Tapazole). This is a pill, taken orally, which is designed to destroy some or all of the thyroid. It’s usually needed only once, although some people may need more than one treatment. Eventually, you may need to take daily thyroid replacement medication. This removes most of your thyroid gland. It’s followed up with daily thyroid hormone replacement medication. Thyroid level tests, including the TSH test, can determine if your thyroid is producing too much or too little thyroid hormone. If your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough T3 or T4, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) can result. If your thyroid gland produces too much T4, hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) can result.

Thyroid hormone therapy is the use of man-made thyroid hormones to raise low levels of natural thyroid hormones in the body. Thyroid hormone is usually given in pill form. It's often used to treat an underactive thyroid. This is a thyroid that secretes little or no thyroid hormones. The most commonly prescribed thyroid hormone replacement is pure synthetic thyroxine (T4). Thyroid hormone therapy is prescribed when your thyroid doesn't make enough thyroid hormone naturally. This is a condition referred to as hypothyroidism. It's the most common reason people need hormone therapy. Other reasons for using thyroid hormone therapy may rarely include: To control the growth of the enlarged thyroid gland (also called goiter) To control the growth of nodules on the thyroid gland Treatment after the removal of the thyroid for cancerous or noncancerous disease After treatment of hyperthyroidism by radioactive iodine ablation How is thyroid hormone replacement therapy dosage determined? Healthcare providers do careful blood testing to find the best dose of hormone replacement therapy for each person. The blood tests show levels of thyroid hormones in the blood, as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) released by the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland plays a key role in how the thyroid gland works. It controls how much thyroid hormone is released by making TSH to ""stimulate"" the thyroid. Increased levels of TSH may mean that you have an underactive thyroid or that thyroid hormone replacement needs to be increased.  You will have lab tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones and TSH. Hypothyroidism can get worse over time. This means the dose may need to be increased over time. People over age 60 usually start thyroid hormone at lower dose to be sure they can handle the medicine. To make sure that your thyroid hormone replacement works, consider the following: Have routine visits with your healthcare provider. Take your thyroid medicine at least 1 hour before breakfast and any calcium or iron medicines you may take. Or take at bedtime, or at least 3 hours after eating or taking any calcium or iron medicines. Tell your healthcare provider of your thyroid hormone treatment before starting treatment for any other disease. Some treatments for other conditions or diseases can affect the dosage of thyroid hormone therapy. Let your healthcare provider know if you become pregnant. Tell your healthcare provider of any new symptoms that may arise. Tell all healthcare providers of your thyroid condition and medicine dosage.",123,hypothyroidism symptoms,-11.149887084960938,114

6d5f6637-9d83-4a0b-822a-bee46abd888d,"Overview Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Outlook / Prognosis Living With The thyroid gland is a small organ that’s located in the front of the neck, wrapped around the windpipe (trachea). It’s shaped like a butterfly, smaller in the middle with two wide wings that extend around the side of your throat. The thyroid is a gland. You have glands throughout your body, where they create and release substances that help your body do a specific thing. Your thyroid makes hormones that help control many vital functions of your body. When your thyroid doesn’t work properly, it can impact your entire body. If your body makes too much thyroid hormone, you can develop a condition called . If your body makes too little thyroid hormone, it’s called . Both conditions are serious and need to be treated by your healthcare provider. Your thyroid has an important job to do within your body — releasing and controlling thyroid hormones that control metabolism. Metabolism is a process where the food you take into your body is transformed into energy. This energy is used throughout your entire body to keep many of your body’s systems working correctly. Think of your metabolism as a generator. It takes in raw energy and uses it to power something bigger. The thyroid controls your metabolism with a few specific hormones — T4 (thyroxine, contains four iodide atoms) and T3 (triiodothyronine, contains three iodide atoms). These two hormones are created by the thyroid and they tell the body’s cells how much energy to use. When your thyroid works properly, it will maintain the right amount of hormones to keep your metabolism working at the right rate. As the hormones are used, the thyroid creates replacements. This is all supervised by something called the . Located in the center of the skull, below your brain, the pituitary gland monitors and controls the amount of thyroid hormones in your bloodstream. When the pituitary gland senses a lack of thyroid hormones or a high level of hormones in your body, it will adjust the amounts with its own hormone. This hormone is called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The TSH will be sent to the thyroid and it will tell the thyroid what needs to be done to get the body back to normal. Thyroid disease is a general term for a medical condition that keeps your thyroid from making the right amount of hormones. Your thyroid typically makes hormones that keep your body functioning normally. When the thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone, your body uses energy too quickly. This is called hyperthyroidism. Using energy too quickly will do more than make you tired — it can make your heart beat faster, cause you to lose weight without trying and even make you feel nervous. On the flip-side of this, your thyroid can make too little thyroid hormone. This is called hypothyroidism. When you have too little thyroid hormone in your body, it can make you feel tired, you might gain weight and you may even be unable to tolerate cold temperatures. These two main disorders can be caused by a variety of conditions. They can also be passed down through families (inherited). Thyroid disease can affect anyone — men, women, infants, teenagers and the elderly. It can be present at birth (typically hypothyroidism) and it can develop as you age (often after menopause in women). Thyroid disease is very common, with an estimated 20 million people in the Unites States having some type of thyroid disorder. A woman is about five to eight times more likely to be diagnosed with a thyroid condition than a man. You may be at a higher risk of developing a thyroid disease if you: Have a medical condition (these can include pernicious anemia, type 1 diabetes, primary adrenal insufficiency, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome and Turner syndrome). Take a medication that’s high in iodine (amiodarone). Have had treatment for a past thyroid condition or cancer (thyroidectomy or radiation). The two main types of thyroid disease are hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Both conditions can be caused by other diseases that impact the way the thyroid gland works. Conditions that can cause hypothyroidism include: : This condition is an inflammation (swelling) of the thyroid gland. Thyroiditis can lower the amount of hormones your thyroid produces. : A painless disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition where the body’s cells attack and damage the thyroid. This is an inherited condition. : This condition occurs in 5% to 9% of women after childbirth. It’s usually a temporary condition. : Iodine is used by the thyroid to produce hormones. An iodine deficiency is an issue that affects several million people around the world.. : Sometimes, the thyroid gland doesn’t work correctly from birth. This affects about 1 in 4,000 newborns. If left untreated, the child could have both physical and mental issues in the future. All newborns are given a screening blood test in the hospital to check their thyroid function. Conditions that can cause hyperthyroidism include: : In this condition the entire thyroid gland might be overactive and produce too much hormone. This problem is also called diffuse toxic goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). : Hyperthyroidism can be caused by nodules that are overactive within the thyroid. A single nodule is called toxic autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, while a gland with several nodules is called a toxic multi-nodular goiter. : This disorder can be either painful or not felt at all. In thyroiditis, the thyroid releases hormones that were stored there. This can last for a few weeks or months. : When you have too much iodine (the mineral that is used to make thyroid hormones) in your body, the thyroid makes more thyroid hormones than it needs. Excessive iodine can be found in some medications (amiodarone, a heart medication) and cough syrups. Is there a higher risk of developing thyroid disease if I have diabetes? If you have , you’re at a higher risk of developing a thyroid disease than people without diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder. If you already have one autoimmune disorder, you are more likely to develop another one. For people with type 2 diabetes, the risk is lower, but still there. If you have type 2 diabetes, you’re more likely to develop a thyroid disease later in life. Regular testing is recommended to check for thyroid issues. Those with type 1 diabetes may be tested more often — immediately after diagnosis and then every year or so — than people with type 2 diabetes. There isn’t a regular schedule for testing if you have type 2 diabetes, however your healthcare provider may suggest a schedule for testing over time. If you have diabetes and get a positive thyroid test, there are a few things to you can do to help feel the best possible. These tips include: Getting tested regularly as directed by your healthcare provider. What common symptoms can happen with thyroid disease? There are a variety of symptoms you could experience if you have a thyroid disease. Unfortunately, symptoms of a thyroid condition are often very similar to the signs of other medical conditions and stages of life. This can make it difficult to know if your symptoms are related to a thyroid issue or something else entirely. For the most part, the symptoms of thyroid disease can be divided into two groups — those related to having too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) and those related to having too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism). Symptoms of an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) can include: Experiencing anxiety, irritability and nervousness. Experiencing irregular menstrual periods or having your menstrual cycle stop. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can include: Hair loss is a symptom of thyroid disease, particularly hypothyroidism. If you start to experience hair loss and are concerned about it, talk to your healthcare provider. In most cases, thyroid issues don’t cause seizures. However, if you have a very severe cases of hypothyroidism that hasn’t been diagnosed or treated, your risk of developing low serum sodium goes up. This could lead to seizures. Sometimes, thyroid disease can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are easily confused with those of other conditions. You may experience similar symptoms when you are pregnant or aging and you would when developing a thyroid disease. Fortunately, there are tests that can help determine if your symptoms are being caused by a thyroid issue. These tests include: One of the most definitive ways to diagnose a thyroid problem is through blood tests. Thyroid blood tests are used to tell if your thyroid gland is functioning properly by measuring the amount of thyroid hormones in your blood. These tests are done by taking blood from a vein in your arm. Thyroid blood tests are used to see if you have: Thyroid blood tests are used to diagnose thyroid disorders associated with hyper- or hypothyroidism. These include: The specific blood tests that will be done to test your thyroid can include: is produced in the pituitary gland and regulates the balance of thyroid hormones — including T4 and T3 — in the bloodstream. This is usually the first test your provider will do to check for thyroid hormone imbalance. Most of the time, thyroid hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism) is associated with an elevated TSH level, while thyroid hormone excess (hyperthyroidism) is associated with a low TSH level. If TSH is abnormal, measurement of thyroid hormones directly, including thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) may be done to further evaluate the problem. Normal TSH range for an adult: 0.40 - 4.50 mIU/mL (milli-international units per liter of blood). tests for hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and used to monitor treatment of thyroid disorders. Low T4 is seen with hypothyroidism, whereas high T4 levels may indicate hyperthyroidism. Normal T4 range for an adult: 5.0 – 11.0 ug/dL (micrograms per deciliter of blood). is a method of measuring T4 that eliminates the effect of proteins that naturally bind T4 and may prevent accurate measurement. Normal FT4 range for an adult: 0.9 - 1.7 ng/dL (nanograms per deciliter of blood) tests help diagnose hyperthyroidism or to show the severity of hyperthyroidism. Low T3 levels can be observed in hypothyroidism, but more often this test is useful in the diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism, where T3 levels are elevated. Normal T3 range: 100 - 200 ng/dL (nanograms per deciliter of blood). is a method of measuring T3 that eliminates the effect of proteins that naturally bind T3 and may prevent accurate measurement. Normal FT3 range: 2.3 - 4.1 pg/mL (picograms per milliliter of blood) These tests alone aren’t meant to diagnose any illness but may prompt your healthcare provider to do additional testing to evaluate for a possible thyroid disorder. : These tests help identify different types of autoimmune thyroid conditions. Common thyroid antibody tests include (also known as or ), (also known as ), and (includes and ). : This test is used to diagnose C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer, both of which are rare thyroid disorders. : This test is used to diagnose thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) and to monitor treatment of thyroid cancer. Talk to your healthcare provider about the ranges for these thyroid blood tests. Your ranges might not be the same as someone else’s. That’s often alright. If you have any concerns or worries about your blood test results, talk to your provider. In many cases, taking a look at the thyroid itself can answer a lot of questions. Your healthcare provider might do an imaging test called a thyroid scan. This allows your provider to look at your thyroid to check for an increased size, shape or growths (nodules). Your provider could also use an imaging test called an . This is a diagnostic procedure that transmits high-frequency sound waves, inaudible to the human ear, through body tissues. The echoes are recorded and transformed into video or photographic images. You may think of ultrasounds related to pregnancy, but they are used to diagnose many different issues within your body. Unlike X-rays, ultrasounds do not use radiation. There’s typically little or no preparation before your ultrasound. You don’t need to change your diet beforehand or fast. During the test, you’ll lie flat on a padded examining table with your head positioned on a pillow so that your head is tilted back. A warm, water-soluble gel is applied to the skin over the area that’s being examined. This gel won’t hurt your skin or stain your clothes. Your healthcare provider will then apply a probe to your neck and gently move it around to see all parts of the thyroid. An ultrasound typically takes about 20 to 30 minutes. Another way to quickly check the thyroid is with a physical exam in your healthcare provider’s office. This is a very simple and painless test where your provider feels your neck for any growths or enlargement of the thyroid. Your healthcare provider’s goal is to return your thyroid hormone levels to normal. This can be done in a variety of ways and each specific treatment will depend on the cause of your thyroid condition. If you have high levels of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism), treatment options can include: Anti-thyroid drugs (methimazole and propylthioracil): These are medications that stop your thyroid from making hormones. : This treatment damages the cells of your thyroid, preventing it from making high levels of thyroid hormones. : These medications don’t change the amount of hormones in your body, but they help control your symptoms. : A more permanent form of treatment, your healthcare provider may surgically remove your thyroid (). This will stop it from creating hormones. However, you will need to take thyroid replacement hormones for the rest of your life. If you have low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism), the main treatment option is: Thyroid replacement medication: This drug is a synthetic (man-made) way to add thyroid hormones back into your body. One drug that’s commonly used is called levothyroxine. By using a medication, you can control thyroid disease and live a normal life. Are there different types of thyroid removal surgery? If your healthcare provider determines that your thyroid needs to be removed, there are a couple of ways that can be done. Your thyroid may need to be completely removed or just partially. This will depend on the severity of your condition. Also, if your thyroid is very big (enlarged) or has a lot of growths on it, that could prevent you from being eligible for some types of surgery. The surgery to remove your thyroid is called a thyroidectomy. There are two main ways this surgery can be done: The incision on the front of your neck is more of the traditional version of a thyroidectomy. It allows your surgeon to go straight in and remove the thyroid. In many cases, this might be your best option. You may need this approach if your thyroid is particularly big or has a lot of larger nodules. Alternatively, there is a version of the thyroid removal surgery where your surgeon makes an incision in your armpit and then creates a tunnel to your thyroid. This tunnel is made with a special tool called an elevated retractor. It creates an opening that connects the incision in your armpit with your neck. The surgeon will use a robotic arm that will move through the tunnel to get to the thyroid. Once there, it can remove the thyroid back through the tunnel and out of the incision in your armpit. This procedure is often called scarless because the incision is under your armpit and out of sight. However, it’s more complicated for the surgeon and the tunnel is more invasive for you. You may not be a candidate for this type of thyroid removal if you: Have a condition like thyroiditis or Graves’s disease. Talk to your about all of your treatment options and the best type of surgery for you. How long does it take to recover from thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy)? It will take your body a few weeks to recover after your thyroid is surgically removed (thyroidectomy). During this time you should avoid a few things, including: This generally lasts for about two weeks. After that, you can return to your normal activities. How long after my thyroid is removed will my tiredness go away? Typically, you will be given medication to help with your symptoms right after surgery. Your body actually has thyroid hormone still circulating throughout it, even after the thyroid has been removed. The hormones can still be in your body for two to three weeks. Medication will reintroduce new hormones into your body after the thyroid has been removed. If you are still feeling tired after surgery, remember that this can be a normal part of recovering from any type of surgery. It takes time for your body to heal. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are still experiencing fatigue and other symptoms of thyroid disease after surgery. If part of my thyroid is surgically removed, will the other part be able to make enough thyroid hormones to keep me off of medication? Sometimes, your surgeon may be able to remove part of your thyroid and leave the other part so that it can continue to create and release thyroid hormones. This is most likely in situations where you have a nodule that’s causing your thyroid problem. About 75% of people who have only one side of the thyroid removed are able to make enough thyroid hormone after surgery without hormone replacement therapy. You can do a quick and easy self-exam of your thyroid at home. The only tools you need to do this self-exam are a mirror and a glass of water. Start by identifying where your thyroid is located. Generally, you’ll find the thyroid on the front of your neck, between your collar bone and Adam’s apple. In men, the Adam’s apple is much easier to see. For women, it’s usually easiest to look from the collar bone up. Tip your head back while looking in a mirror. Look at your neck and try to hone in on the space you will be looking once you start the exam. Once you’re ready, take a drink of water while your head is tilted back. Watch your thyroid as you swallow. During this test, you’re looking for lumps or bumps. You may be able to see them when you swallow the water. Repeat this test a few times to get a good look at your thyroid. If you see any lumps or bumps, reach out to your healthcare provider. Regular is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. You do not need to change your exercise routine if you have a thyroid disease. Exercise does not drain your body’s thyroid hormones and it shouldn’t hurt you to exercise. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider before you start a new exercise routine to make sure that it’s a good fit for you. A thyroid disease is often a life-long medical condition that you will need to manage constantly. This often involves a daily medication. Your healthcare provider will monitor your treatments and make adjustments over time. However, you can usually live a normal life with a thyroid disease. It may take some time to find the right treatment option for you and control your hormone levels, but then people with these types of conditions can usually live life without many restrictions.

Thyroid disease is very common, with an estimated 20 million people in the Unites States having some type of thyroid disorder. A woman is about five to eight times more likely to be diagnosed with a thyroid condition than a man. You may be at a higher risk of developing a thyroid disease if you: Have a medical condition (these can include pernicious anemia, type 1 diabetes, primary adrenal insufficiency, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome and Turner syndrome). Take a medication that’s high in iodine (amiodarone). Have had treatment for a past thyroid condition or cancer (thyroidectomy or radiation). The two main types of thyroid disease are hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Both conditions can be caused by other diseases that impact the way the thyroid gland works. Conditions that can cause hypothyroidism include: : This condition is an inflammation (swelling) of the thyroid gland. Thyroiditis can lower the amount of hormones your thyroid produces. : A painless disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition where the body’s cells attack and damage the thyroid. This is an inherited condition. : This condition occurs in 5% to 9% of women after childbirth. It’s usually a temporary condition. : Iodine is used by the thyroid to produce hormones. An iodine deficiency is an issue that affects several million people around the world.. : Sometimes, the thyroid gland doesn’t work correctly from birth. This affects about 1 in 4,000 newborns. If left untreated, the child could have both physical and mental issues in the future. All newborns are given a screening blood test in the hospital to check their thyroid function. Conditions that can cause hyperthyroidism include: : In this condition the entire thyroid gland might be overactive and produce too much hormone. This problem is also called diffuse toxic goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). : Hyperthyroidism can be caused by nodules that are overactive within the thyroid. A single nodule is called toxic autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, while a gland with several nodules is called a toxic multi-nodular goiter. : This disorder can be either painful or not felt at all. In thyroiditis, the thyroid releases hormones that were stored there. This can last for a few weeks or months. : When you have too much iodine (the mineral that is used to make thyroid hormones) in your body, the thyroid makes more thyroid hormones than it needs. Excessive iodine can be found in some medications (amiodarone, a heart medication) and cough syrups. Is there a higher risk of developing thyroid disease if I have diabetes? If you have , you’re at a higher risk of developing a thyroid disease than people without diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder. If you already have one autoimmune disorder, you are more likely to develop another one. For people with type 2 diabetes, the risk is lower, but still there. If you have type 2 diabetes, you’re more likely to develop a thyroid disease later in life. Regular testing is recommended to check for thyroid issues. Those with type 1 diabetes may be tested more often — immediately after diagnosis and then every year or so — than people with type 2 diabetes. There isn’t a regular schedule for testing if you have type 2 diabetes, however your healthcare provider may suggest a schedule for testing over time. If you have diabetes and get a positive thyroid test, there are a few things to you can do to help feel the best possible. These tips include: Getting tested regularly as directed by your healthcare provider. What common symptoms can happen with thyroid disease? There are a variety of symptoms you could experience if you have a thyroid disease. Unfortunately, symptoms of a thyroid condition are often very similar to the signs of other medical conditions and stages of life. This can make it difficult to know if your symptoms are related to a thyroid issue or something else entirely. For the most part, the symptoms of thyroid disease can be divided into two groups — those related to having too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) and those related to having too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism). Symptoms of an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) can include: Experiencing anxiety, irritability and nervousness. Experiencing irregular menstrual periods or having your menstrual cycle stop. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can include: Hair loss is a symptom of thyroid disease, particularly hypothyroidism. If you start to experience hair loss and are concerned about it, talk to your healthcare provider. In most cases, thyroid issues don’t cause seizures. However, if you have a very severe cases of hypothyroidism that hasn’t been diagnosed or treated, your risk of developing low serum sodium goes up. This could lead to seizures.

65305d90-a192-429b-94da-d4e0253d956c,"— TestNearly 25 years ago, it was the sleepiness and crackly, dry skin that first alerted me something was wrong. Not diabetes, as I’d already been living with type 1 for close to a decade at that time. I had a visibly enlarged gland on the side of my neck, so swollen that it hurt when I turned my head. The dry skin was coarse and almost scaly, so severe that lotions or moisturizers were useless. And I suffered from constant fatigue, the kind of stuck-in-molasses tiredness that comes when your blood sugar is super-high — even when it wasn’t. I felt exhausted from the moment I woke up in the morning, and I felt I couldn’t function throughout the day without a nap or concentrate on simple tasks. Frankly, it was all a bit scary, because I couldn’t put my finger on how all these seemingly unrelated symptoms might tie together. As it turned out, all were signs that the little thyroid gland in my neck was not working properly — which causes an array of symptoms that are easily overlooked or worse, mistaken for other ailments. Thankfully, what came next for me was a correct diagnosis of , which in layman’s terms meant that my gland wasn’t producing enough of the thyroid hormone that controls metabolism. This all happened when I was about 15. Not a great time for additional hormone issues — although I guess there’s never a great time for any type of diagnosis, right? January is actually National , so that’s why I’m revisiting my teen experiences today. It’s a good time for a refresher on this little gland with a big job to do.  The thyroid is a little butterfly-shaped gland that lives in the middle of your neck, and it’s part of the body’s , where diabetes also dwells. This system controls your body’s metabolism. One of the thyroid’s primary responsibilities is to manage your metabolism by producing two thyroid hormones: T3 and T4. An overactive thyroid can cause weight loss, a quick heartbeat, and other signs that your body is “on the go” a little too much. The opposite, an underactive thyroid, leaves people feeling sluggish, and causes weight gain and slow heartbeat. Essentially, your body’s normal equilibrium slows down. Turns out, thyroid issues are incredibly common. According to , up to 59 million Americans have a thyroid problem and a majority don’t know it (kind of like the whole ). This ailment is so widespread, in fact, that a few years ago. Those of us in the Diabetes Community are more prone to thyroid issues (probably related to our metabolic systems already being whacked out). Women are more prone than men, but that doesn’t exclude guys like me. Note that “thyroid disease” is actually an umbrella term for that can affect this gland, including: autoimmune thyroid disease, which includes Graves’ Disease and Hashimoto’s Disease As you can imagine, none of these are good news for your body. There are a whole host of for thyroid disease, and you guessed it, diabetes is one of them! Experts estimate that about 30% of people with diabetes will be affected with some kind of thyroid disease, so it’s a big one for us. Diabetes itself does not cause thyroid issues, but those with an autoimmune condition are automatically at an increased risk for other conditions. In the case of thyroid disease, PWDs (people with diabetes) are at risk for the two autoimmune-type of thyroid diseases: Graves’ Disease (hyperactive thyroid) or Hashimoto’s Disease (underactive thyroid). Approximately 10% of PWDs with type 1 diabetes (the autoimmune kind) will have a thyroid condition. Although type 2 diabetes is not an autoimmune disorder, there’s also an increased incidence in thyroid diseases, but for reasons that researchers can’t explain. One theory is that thyroid disease and type 2 diabetes both affect the elderly, although we’ve learned that’s not 100% true in all cases. The symptoms of hyperthyroid and hypothyroid are starkly different, but it can be difficult to tell there’s an issue at all because symptoms can develop very slowly. They also often match symptoms for a whole list of other conditions, so it can be tricky to figure out the culprit. This is why regular thyroid screenings are important. Hyperthyroidism symptoms include: quick pulse and pounding heart, weight loss despite an increased appetite, shortness of breath when exercising, muscle weakness or tremors, and trouble concentrating. As you can probably guess, hypothyroidism symptoms are the polar opposite: fatigue and sleepiness, persistent feeling of being cold, dry skin, brittle hair, weight gain despite no change in diet, low blood pressure or a slow pulse. Hypothyroidism can also affect fertility in women. Yikes! Symptoms of thyroid conditions can sometimes be confused with symptoms of diabetes, or attributed to other circumstances. Take the late veteran diabetes journalist David Mendosa, who with hypothyroidism a number of years ago: “My feet were cold most of the time. Even when I wore thick woolen socks to be,  my feet were often so uncomfortable that they interfered with my sleep. Since I have diabetes, I assumed that my problem was that I had one of the most common complications of our condition, peripheral neuropathy. So I focused all the more on controlling my blood glucose levels in hopes of reversing my problem some day. Good strategy in general. But worse than useless when the assumption is faulty. My problem was hypothyroidism.” One thing to note is that although hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism do not directly affect blood sugar levels, treating thyroid disease can cause your blood sugars due to the effects the symptoms have on how your body metabolizes glucose and insulin. For instance, with hyperthyroidism, insulin “clears” through your body faster, leaving you with higher blood sugars. Hyperthyroidism can cause rapid heart rate and increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythm, so it increases the risk of heart problems, compounding . Hypothyroidism can cause insulin to move through your body much slower, which could leave you with lower blood sugars, because the insulin “sticks around” longer. Hypothyroidism can also cause an increase in cholesterol and LDL levels, and an increase levels, which adds to the danger of high cholesterol with diabetes. So clearly it’s all bad news if you don’t catch the thyroid problem quickly! In fact, the screening for thyroid problems soon after a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, with a standard TSH blood test (which is in fact controversial, details below). The ADA currently has no specific screening guidelines for people with type 2 diabetes. If you’re experiencing any of the symptoms described, you’ll want to see your endocrinologist or primary care physician ASAP. You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in thyroid issues (as opposed to diabetes), but your endocrinologist will know exactly how to diagnosis you. The thyroid disease is something called a , which checks the amount of thyroid-stimulating hormone in your system. It’s a very easy and inexpensive blood test, so don’t delay if you think you have symptoms! However, sometimes the test will come back false-normal, so testing for antibodies or having a can also turn up things that the TSH test might leave out. Autoimmune thyroid diseases, like , are usually much easier to manage than diabetes. The hormone replacement treatment comes in pill form, so taking the medication is easy-peasey. But some patients have difficulty finding the right type of thyroid replacement pill. While there are two types of natural thyroid hormones, called T3 and T4, only T4 is found in the common thyroid replacements. For many people, this doesn’t work well. In theory, T4 medication would also convert to T3, but always happen. You’ll want to do your homework and make sure you get on the right treatment for you! Patient Lindsay O’Rourke writes on the : “I went on my generic prescription, levothroid, and even at a very low dose it was an extreme difference. I felt back to normal. My energy was back, and a slew of other symptoms went away.” Hyperthyroidism can be treated with anti-thyroid medicines such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU), but the most common way of treating hyperthyroidsim is radioactive iodine therapy. Weirdly, it kills off the thyroid, causing permanent hypothyroidism. So you’re really just trading one problem for another. Because of the common problems with misdiagnosis and mistreatments, there’s a whole , both in the U.S. and . from offers tips for the newly diagnosed and outlines the big controversy: “There is a great divide in treatment and you will need to be aware of the seeming conspiracy to only run certain tests, to only prescribe certain meds and to minimize the devastating health issues we suffer!” The essential issue is that the “gold standard” and lab errors and misinterpretation can lead to over or undertreatment. In recent years, patients have begun to push back on traditional advice and advocate for treatment that increases their quality of life. Mary Shomon, founder of and author of best-seller “The Thyroid Diet Revolution: Manage Your Metabolism for Lasting Weight Loss” writes: “Even a ‘normal’ TSH may be abnormal for you… If your TSH levels don’t seem to reflect how you are feeling, speak up!” Also note that a group called has a long-running called “Patients with Thyroid Dysfunction Demand Better Care,” which calls on the International Society of Endocrinology to adopt two core changes going forward: Doctors must demonstrate proficiency in diagnosis of and treatments in thyroid disorders BEFORE receiving his/her board certification in Endocrinology. Board-certified endocrinologists who treat thyroid disorder must keep up-to-date on current thyroid disorder treatments. These demands seem like no-brainers, but apparently thyroid care has traditionally been haphazard and inconsistent. Perhaps as a counter to this kind of distrust, a few years ago, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) set up a , with advice for patients. It emphasizes the importance of taking the same dosage of the same medication at the same time every day: “Even the slightest variance in the manufacturer of the prescription (whether generic or brand name), the time of days meds are taken or the medication dosage can interfere with the delicate balance thyroid medications are designed to achieve, sending the body into a tailspin and resulting in a host of side effects that can range from mildly uncomfortable to severe.“ Also, back in 2012, the AACE determined that a would be the new universal symbol of thyroid disease awareness and advocacy. They say paisley was chosen “because of its resemblance to a cross-section of thyroid follicles, the tiny spheres that the thyroid gland is made of.” Nice idea, but if you think about the struggle the Diabetes Community has had gaining recognition for the , you can pretty much figure the Paisley Ribbon’s gonna be an uphill battle. What we find encouraging, however, is lots of online activity and awareness-building among this burgeoning patient community. Patient empowerment at its best! Personally, I’ve been taking the generic form of  to treat my thyroid for years, despite the fact that it also became at one point. When I go a few days without taking my daily pill, I definitely feel myself getting sleepy more often and becoming unfocused, so I’m glad to have it in my arsenal. What about you all?

e51528f8-07a8-46b2-b4b7-209ea5e8ad19,"Thyroiditis : About two months ago i was... - Thyroid UK About two months ago i was diagnosed with thyroiditis. The lady who give my blood at the clinic i go to said my thyroid goes up down. I have an appointment with a thyroid specialist this coming Monday am so glad cause i am so sick and tired of the way im feeling. I am tired all the time and no energy, muscle aches and pains, especially get leg cramps. I also have a balance problem which i believe is because of my thyroid messing up. Will be so glad when i finally get back to my old self. Does anyone else have some of these symptoms. When you say your thyroid goes up and down, do you mean it swells ( like a goitre) then reduces? Mine does the same and neither GP nor Endo were interested in it ( after determining it wasn't cancerous) I'd be interested in following what treatment you receive. Those symptoms are common,poor balance can have a number of causes. You should post your thyroid blood test results with ranges for advice. You will be surprised by the number of clinical symptoms there are. It is a pity most doctors or endocrinologists know few of them. Most appear to treat a 'blood test result' rather than the symptoms we have. These are symptoms: There can be fluctuations in our tests every time we have a test. The following is recommended so that we get the best possible result in order to prevent a doctor or endo adjusting our medications - they do so commonly as they only appear to look at the TSH alone - maybe the T4 but nothing else. We take levothyroxine, usually first thing, with one full glass of water and wait an hour before eating. Food and caffeine interfere with the uptake of the hormones. All tests have to be the very earliest possible, fasting (you can drink water) and allow a 24 hour gap between last dose and test and take afterwards. This helps keep the TSH at its highest as it drops throughout the day and may be a reduction in our dose. Always get a print-out from the surgery, of the results with the ranges. Ranges are important for members to respond. You also need B12, Vit D, iron, ferritin and folate to be tested. Deficiencies also cause symptoms. The aim is a TSH of 1 or lower - many doctors think 'somewhere' in the range is fine - even 5 so read and learn from members posts and you will soon know more than the medical professionals I am sorry to say. You should have been started on 50mcg of levo with a 25mcg increase every six weeks until TSH is around 1 or lower. The following are clinical symptoms. Thyroiduk.org.uk/tuk/about_the_thyroid/hypothyroidism_signs_symptoms.html If you have thyroid antibodies in your blood you will have an Autoimmune Thyroid Disease called Hashimoto's or hashi's and going gluten-free can help reduce the attacks of the antibodies on your thyroid gland. Treatment is the same as for hypothyroidism. Always get a print-out of your results with the ranges for your own records and post if you have a query. Sadly, when people in clinics say things like ""your thyroid goes up and down"" they actually means that your TSH levels rise and fall (TSH is not a thyroid hormone) suggesting that you have autoimmune thyroid disease (aka Hashimotos). You need to post the following results for advice: Those are the main tests you need to know if you have a thyroid problem. Balance is often due to low B12 When I go for my appointment Monday I will get my lab results from the specialist and post them on here. I hope its not Hashimotos. I had read online that thyroid problems usually runs in the family. The other day my aunt told me she has thyroid problems and I didn't even know. She said she has Hashimotos. Since my tsh levels rise and fall does that mean I go back and forth between being hypothyroid and hyperthyroid. No, not really. If you have hashis, an attack destroys some of the thyroid, flooding the blood with thyroid hormones so you have temporary high T4 and T3 and low TSH, which looks a bit like overactive, but then you become more hypo. It's teh free T4 and free T3 levels that tell you if you are over or underactive, not the TSH, which si not produced by teh thyroid and often doesn't reflect your thyroid hormone levrls accurately (in spite of what your doctor might say) Hi I was also told that my thyroid swells up and down by the consultant sonographer, I did ask why, he said if you have hashi or graves it can do this and your levels can change the size of your thyroid, I can always tell when mine swells up as my throat and neck feel Like there's pressure there and breathless. I hope you get the answers you need at your appointment but sadly I'm on my 3rd Endo has they are not known for their empathy and compassion or knowledge of the thyroid- I would say look after yourself and gain knowledge from this site, oh and always get copy bloods for your info.

Medical Author: Medical Editor: Thyroid medications treat a variety of thyroid problems The thyroid gland is located on the front part of the neck below the thyroid cartilage (). This gland produces thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism. Thyroid hormones regulate the body's energy, use of other hormones and , and the growth and maturation of body tissues. (too much production), (too little thyroid hormone production), Many thyroid medications can be used to treat various . This article will review the following therapies: Thyroid hormone replacement to treat hypothyroidism (not enough thyroid hormone) or thyroid Medicines to treat hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) There is one purpose for taking thyroid hormone: to replace the thyroid hormone levels when your thyroid is underactive (hypothyroidism). L-thyroxine is the most commonly used form of thyroid hormone replacement. This medicine contains the synthetic form of a thyroid hormone L-thyroxine as medication is identical to the L-thyroxine, which is the major hormone made by the thyroid gland L-thyroxine is the most commonly prescribed form of thyroid hormone replacement The initial dose of LT4 is based on age, weight, and medical history. Current brands include: (, , Levoxyl, ) Multiple generic forms of L-thyroxine including but not limited to Physicians should be aware of the following conditions that their patients may also have when prescribing L-thyroxine: or () Stable blood levels of thyroid hormone are achieved when L-thyroxine is taken at approximately the same time each day, ideally the first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Avoid taking food within 1 hour and avoid calcium, iron , aluminum-containing antacid, and multivitamins within 2 hours before or after the dose. If a dose is skipped, two doses may be taken the following day. Blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) should be checked approximately 4-6 weeks following each adjustment of LT4 dose. L-thyroxine comes in oral forms, for patients to use at home, and intravenous forms used in a hospital setting. The dose of L-thyroxine often must be increased during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. TSH testing is recommended immediately after pregnancy is confirmed. Side effects that your physician should be aware of when taking thyroid hormone replacement include: Many other medications can affect the way L-thyroxine is absorbed from the gut. Notify your physician if you take L-thyroxine and any of the following medications: [(, , , , ) or other iron ] [(, Amitone, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ) or other ] (, , , , , ) sucralfate () or (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ) Estrogens can increase L-thyroxine requirements due to an increase in thyroid hormone binding proteins in the blood. L-thyroxine can interfere with maintaining adequate blood levels of other medications. Notify your physician if you take L-thyroxine and any of the following medications: (, , , , , ) and -containing agents Also known as T3 [( ()] T3 has a very short half-life and must be given two to three times each day T3 is responsible for most of the functions of thyroid hormone. Most of T3 comes from the conversion T4 (either from the thyroid gland or from L-thyroxine administration) to T3 However, T3 is seldom used alone for the treatment of hypothyroidism T3 is rarely used in combination with LT4 for the treatment of hypothyroidism, but carefully controlled studies in the United States have not shown any benefit from this combined therapy T3 is used for short term therapy during the preparation of patients with thyroid for diagnostic imaging or radioactive iodine treatment Desiccated animal (pig) ""natural"" thyroid extract [(thyroid (desiccated) (, )] Contains both T3 and T4, though not in the same proportions as the human thyroid gland; this extract contains excess T3 compared to the amount of T4 for human physiology The proportions of T3 and T4 may vary from bottle to bottle of Armour thyroid Extract should not be prescribed for the treatment of hypothyroidism There is no current practical use for extract in thyroid care These medicines are used to treat an overactive thyroid gland by decreasing the output of thyroid hormone from the thyroid. PTU blocks the production of thyroid hormone inside the thyroid gland PTU is usually given in divided doses, 2 to 3 times a day Blood levels of thyroid hormone do not drop until the stores of thyroid hormone in the thyroid are depleted, typically after 2-4 weeks Thyroid hormone levels may take 1 to 4 months to normalize Mild side effects include , low grade fevers, and itchiness Rare but serious side effects include a reduction in white blood cells, which can prevent the body from fighting off an infection, and ( damage). Recent studies have shown there is more liver toxicity with PTU and so now, is usually the drug of choice. PTU is still preferred by some in pregnancy even though there are more minor birth defects seen with it. Blood levels of thyroid hormones should be checked every 4 to 6 weeks until hormone levels stabilize Beta-blockers (propranolol, Inderal, Inderal LA, InnoPran XL) This medicine can help block the body's reaction to hyperthyroidism It can control heart-related symptoms, such as palpitations, , and agitation (Lugol's solution, Strong iodine, super-saturated or SSKI) Usually given as drops of liquid medicine, iodide solutions can prevent the release of hormone from an overactive thyroid gland.

Explore the benefits of homeopathy Myths and Facts about Underactive Thyroid (Hypothyroidism) Not really. Homeopathy is much more than herbal medicine. It has medicines sourced from herbs, minerals, chemicals, animal products, organisms, etc. And, very importantly, it is backed by a sophisticated method of medicine preparation, sound scientific principles and deep philosophy. No system of medicine can cure all the diseases. Homeopathy is a proven therapy, used successfully for last 200 years in over 170 countries; supported by scientific studies. It shows once ignorance if one believes that homeopathy is placebo. Homeopathy increases the disease before curing. Not really. Only some disease such as eczema might worsen, that too in less than 5% of cases if medicines are not professionally prescribed. The whole idea of the increase of disease before the cure is exaggerated. Homeopathic medicines contain steroid or cortisone! It is absurd to even think that homeopathy may contain cortisone. Homeopathy is little slower than the conventional medicines; but not very slow. Since it deals with chronic and difficult diseases, the course of treatment may seem slow and long. Homeopathic medicines cannot be taken with the conventional (allopathic) medicines. Conventional medicines and homeopathic medicines can safely be taken together, with advantage, without any harm. It is not even very fast. It all depends on the nature of the disease that is under treatment. Not always, to be honest. Homeopathy gives lasting results for sure. The word permanent is theoretical, which cannot be promised for, in difficult diseases. Coffee and onion cannot be taken during homeopathic treatment. Can be taken, keeping a gap of about half an hour. Homeopathy can cure cancer, mental retardation, heart blocks, baldness (MPB), all surgical diseases, cataract, hernia, hydrocele, etc. Investigations such as x-ray, blood test, MRI, etc. are not required for homeopathic treatment. All sort of investigations are required and useful for better and effective homeopathic treatment. Diagnosis is not required for homeopathic treatment. Diagnosis helps to make better prescription of homeopathic medicines. Homeopathic medicines are prescribed only for the mental symptoms of the patient. Not correct. Study of disease, diagnosis, and mental attributes are studied in homeopathy. Vitamins, iron-tonic, etc. should not be taken during homeopathic treatment. Can be taken. Tonics and supplements are part of homeopathic treatment! Not really. Surgery is a part of homeopathy.

Get results your body can count on all year long: Use code 2021 for 15% off this test. Valid through 1/31. This test measures 3 main thyroid hormones plus thyroid peroxidase antibodies Your test results will measure your levels of three main thyroid hormones plus thyroid peroxidase antibodies. These circulating thyroid hormones have an impact on many functions of the body. By measuring your levels of each, you can understand if you may be experiencing thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH, is the hormone responsible for controlling hormone production by the thyroid gland. The hormone TSH is considered the most sensitive marker for screening for thyroid diseases and conditions. Our thyroid panel is ideal for TSH testing at home and will tell you how your levels compare to normal TSH levels. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are antibodies that can bind to thyroid enzymes, suppressing thyroid function. They are elevated in a condition called Hashimoto's disease, which is the most common type of hypothyroidism in the USA. Free T3 is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Levels of this fluctuate when individuals have an under or overactive thyroid gland. Free T4 is the predominant hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Levels fluctuate when individuals have an under or overactive thyroid gland. Testing your free T4 with this thyroid function test lets you see if your thyroid hormone production is at a normal level. Each lab we work with is CLIA-certified (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments). This means they have to meet high standards to obtain both state and federal certifications and submit themselves to regular inspections. Everlywell tests are reviewed and approved by an independent board-certified physician within your state. This ensures that any test ordered is relevant to your health and wellness.

We use state-of-the-art, bank-grade encryption to ensure your data is stored securely, and under no circumstance do we ever sell your data. Though a part of the body that many people know little about, the thyroid plays a major part in daily wellness. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism -- too much thyroid activity and too little thyroid activity, respectively -- are cause for concern. Because your thyroid controls much of your metabolism, which plays a vital role in your overall health, it’s important to monitor thyroid function, as it is estimated that up to twelve percent of the population in the United States will develop thyroid disease during their lifetime. That’s almost fifteen million people who have thyroid problems that affect their metabolism and are unaware. Anybody can experience thyroid issues but some people are more susceptible than others: Women (up to 10 times more likely than men to have thyroid disorders) Women who have been pregnant within the past 6 months People being treated with lithium for six months or more People who have been exposed to radiation therapy, especially around the neck Our at-home thyroid blood test is quick, easy, and convenient—allowing you to check your levels of the 3 main thyroid hormones without leaving your home. Working with certified and experienced labs, our thyroid panel uses samples from your blood test to accurately measure various thyroid-specific hormones and compare those thyroid levels to common ranges. The at-home thyroid test measures free T4, free T3, TSH, and TPO from a small blood spot sample taken with your kit. TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) controls thyroid function in its production of active thyroid hormones, free T4, and free T3, which together control the rate at which your body uses energy. The test also measures TPO antibodies, which are antibodies that your body may make that can suppress thyroid function. By measuring your levels of each, you can understand if you may be experiencing thyroid dysfunction. Everlywell will provide detailed information of what a high or low level of TPO, free T4, free T3, or TSH means for your health. At-home thyroid blood tests are a convenient starting point for determining whether you may have a thyroid condition and will give you indication of what you should do next. Stay on top of your health from the convenience of your home with our at-home thyroid test. Our tests provide personalized information and education; they are not intended to diagnose any disease or condition or to substitute for professional medical advice or treatment. You should always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health care provider with any questions you have regarding your medical care. If your thyroid gland isn’t working correctly, it may be because you have an: – This means the thyroid is not producing enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms of hypothyroidism can include weight gain, fatigue, sensitivity to cold, muscle aches, and more. – This means the thyroid is producing too much thyroxine (or T4). Symptoms of hyperthyroidism can include unexpected weight loss, nervousness and anxiousness, frequent sweating, heat insensitivity, and more. If your thyroid is under-producing, you may experience ongoing symptoms including: If your thyroid is overactive you may experience symptoms like: Thyroid tests use a blood sample to measure various hormone levels. , for example, is often measured to indirectly check if your thyroid gland is producing enough thyroid hormones. TSH levels are usually higher than normal if you have an (a condition known as hypothyroidism). Thyroid function tests can also measure thyroid hormones like thyroxine to provide a better understanding of how low – or how high – your thyroid hormone levels are. The Everlywell at-home thyroid test can tell you if your thyroid hormone levels suggest hypothyroidism. This test requires only a few drops of blood as a sample. After getting your online test results, you can easily see your levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3 and T4, and TPO antibodies. High TSH and/or low T3 and T4 can indicate hypothyroidism. You can also take our thyroid test at home to check your hormones for indications of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism means your thyroid gland is overactive: it’s producing too many hormones. Low levels of TSH and/or high T3 and T4 can suggest hyperthyroidism. Checking Your Thyroid Hormone Levels by Taking a Thyroid Test at Home The thyroid is a small gland that sits at the front of your neck. It’s responsible for controlling many of the body’s key activities – such as metabolism. It does this by releasing specific hormones into the bloodstream. A hormone is small chemical messenger that allows different parts of your body to “talk” with each other. The thyroid makes two kinds of hormones: thyroxine (or T4) and triiodothyronine (or T3). These hormones circulate in your blood, allowing the thyroid gland to regulate many of the body’s important functions, such as: Metabolism – Thyroid hormones tell the body when to burn fat, which gives you more energy. Thyroid hormones can also trigger the production of glucose – a sugar formed from carbohydrates – to provide your body with more energy. Heart rate – Thyroid hormones can affect your resting heart rate (the number of times your heart beats in a minute when you’re at rest). Internal body temperature – Thyroid hormones are involved in regulating your body’s internal temperature – so the thyroid gland acts a bit like a thermostat that helps make sure your body doesn’t get too cool or too hot. What’s more, thyroid hormones can contribute to more wakefulness and alertness because of how they affect the nervous system. In short, your body requires the right balance of thyroid hormone levels in order to effectively carry out many of its functions. While the thyroid gland helps regulate many processes in the body, another gland (the pituitary) is in charge of controlling the thyroid’s activity. The pituitary gland does this by releasing a hormone of its own – thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH – into the bloodstream, which carries TSH to the thyroid gland. TSH tells the thyroid to pump out more thyroid hormones. So when your body needs more thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland will increase the amount of TSH in your blood. Thus, if a thyroid test shows you have a high level of TSH, this can mean that your thyroid is underactive: it’s not making enough hormones. It can also mean that more TSH is required to keep thyroid hormone levels normal, which may indicate an evolving problem with the thyroid gland itself. A full thyroid panel usually checks , , and levels. In some cases, a blood test for thyroid function will also check your blood’s level of . If you have abnormal thyroid hormone levels, high levels of TPO antibodies can point to an autoimmune thyroid disease as a possible reason for those abnormal levels. It’s important to note that there is no hypothyroidism test that can check thyroid hormones and—based only on those test results—conclusively determine if someone has hypothyroidism. That’s because both thyroid hormone testing and a physician’s evaluation of symptoms and medical history is required for a diagnosis. A blood test for hypothyroidism is based on your levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Because TSH signals the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones, unusually high levels of TSH can mean that your thyroid isn’t making enough hormones. A thyroid lab test might also measure T3 and T4 to reveal just how low your thyroid hormone levels are, which can help your healthcare provider decide on a treatment strategy. A blood test for hyperthyroidism evaluates your levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Because TSH signals the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones, unusually low levels of TSH can mean that your thyroid is making too many hormones. T3 and T4 measurements can also reveal just how high your thyroid hormone levels are, which can help your healthcare provider decide on a treatment strategy. Thyroid nodules are small bumps that can form inside the thyroid gland. Approximately 90% of thyroid nodules are non-cancerous; however, in some cases, these nodules may suggest the presence of thyroid cancer. Also, thyroid nodules can sometimes alter thyroid hormone levels, resulting in either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Women are about 4 times more likely than men to have thyroid nodules. And older age, a history of thyroid radiation, and iron deficiency are all linked with a greater likelihood of having thyroid nodules. Missing periods lately?

In the term neonate, laboratory tests best reflect true thyroid function when performed in infants older than 24 hours. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration remains the most sensitive screening test for hypothyroidism and for establishing the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. The sample can be obtained at any time of day. A value within the reference range does not exclude TSH deficiency or TRH deficiency. A physiologic surge of TSH occurs within the first 30 minutes of life and appears to be related to the stress of delivery and exposure to the cold temperature of the extrauterine environment. Serum TSH levels peak at levels as much as 70 mIU/L within the first 24 hours of life and then rapidly drop to less than 10 mIU/L within the first 3 days of life. Beyond the neonatal period, healthy serum levels of TSH are less than 6 mIU/L. Serum TSH levels are elevated in primary hypothyroidism or compensated hypothyroidism and should be low or within the reference range in cases of pituitary (TSH deficiency) or hypothalamic (TRH deficiency) etiologies. Isolated TSH deficiency is far less common than multiple anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies. Serum TSH is the optimal parameter to guide dosing of thyroid hormone replacement, except in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism. In these patients, measuring serum free T4 by means of equilibrium dialysis is the superior testing method. Adequate thyroid hormone replacement results in normalization of serum TSH. In the rare syndromes of thyroid hormone resistance, serum TSH levels are elevated in the presence of normal-to-high serum total T4 concentration. Serum TSH levels are often mildly abnormal (≤ 7 mIU/L) in children and adolescents who are morbidly obese (>20 lb overweight). If the serum free T4 level is normal, the growth velocity has been normal for at least 6 months, the serum TSH level remains stable (not rising) over at least 3 months, and no other signs of hypothyroidism are present, these children and adolescents do not require routine T4 therapy. T4 is present in both the free state and bound to TBG. Total T4 assays measure T4 in both states and are useful to establish the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism and to assess response to treatment. Free T4 should be directly measured with the equilibrium dialysis method. Many laboratories report a calculated value termed the free T4 index, which is an estimate of the free T4 concentration, not a measurement. The free T4 index is calculated by multiplying the T4 by the T3 resin uptake. Serum free T4 by equilibrium dialysis should be measured when secondary hypothyroidism (pituitary TSH deficiency) or tertiary hypothyroidism (hypothalamic TRH deficiency) is suggested. Measurement of serum T3 concentration, free or total, is not required to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism includes the following: Required by US law in all 50 states, these programs measure total T4 levels using a filter paper–based assay. In those neonates whose serum T4 level falls within the lowest 10th percentile for newborns screened that day by the program, T4 is reassayed, and TSH is simultaneously determined. Remember that, even with the best screening programs, infants with hypothyroidism can be missed. Therefore, the occurrence of a normal screening result must not preclude thyroid function testing in any infant with signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism. Infants with abnormal or borderline screening results should have total T4 and TSH obtained for definitive testing. Thyroid hormone replacement may be empirically initiated while awaiting the confirmatory studies. In infants, if the serum total T4 is less than 85 nmol/L (< 7 mg/dL), with TSH more than 40 mIU/L, congenital hypothyroidism is likely. If total T4 is low, and serum TSH is not elevated, TBG deficiency, central hypothyroidism, or euthyroid sick syndrome should be considered, and repeat testing may be needed.Serum free T4 concentration is normal in TBG deficiency. Normal TSH (< 20 mIU/L) in the presence of low total T4 and free T4 concentrations suggest secondary or tertiary causes of hypothyroidism. In the latter, signs of associated hypopituitarism (eg, poor feeding, ) and physical findings (eg, midline defects, ) support the diagnosis. All such infants should be screened for other pituitary hormone deficiencies (see ). Serum antithyroid antibody test findings do not facilitate the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and only serve to establish a diagnosis of CLT and indicate the risk of subsequent development of hypothyroidism. Antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibody titers are elevated in 90-95% of children with CLT. A small proportion of children with test results that are initially negative become positive later. As many as 20% of individuals who have antibody-positive test results do not develop hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Serum total T4 levels and serum free T4 levels are both low in patients with hypothyroidism. In compensated hypothyroidism, total T4 may remain within the reference range in the presence of elevated TSH. Newborns with an elevated TSH should be treated empirically with thyroid hormone replacement until they are aged 2 years to eliminate any possibility of permanent cognitive deficits as a result of hypothyroidism. Low or low-normal serum total T4 levels in the setting of a serum TSH within the reference range suggests TBG deficiency. This congenital disorder causes no pathologic consequence; however, it should be recognized to avoid unnecessary thyroid hormone administration. TBG deficiency affects 1 individual per 3000 population; therefore, occurrence is nearly as frequent as that in congenital hypothyroidism. TBG deficiency results in low serum total T4; however, serum TSH and serum free T4 concentrations are normal. Assessment of the serum TBG concentration, preferably with simultaneous serum free and serum total T4 concentrations, confirms the diagnosis. In vivo radionucleotide studies: The iodide-trapping or concentrating mechanism of normal thyroid tissue can be evaluated by radioisotope (iodine-123 or technetium-99m pertechnetate). In children, technetium-99m is a useful radioisotope because it is trapped by the thyroid but not organified; thus, the child is exposed to lower amounts of radiation. In congenital organification defects and lymphocytic thyroiditis, the amount of radioisotope uptake is within reference range; however, the half-life of the radioisotope within the thyroid is decreased because of the lack of organification. This can be demonstrated by means of a perchlorate washout study. Radioisotope-based thyroid scanning is useful to detect the absence or ectopic location of healthy thyroid tissue in congenital hypothyroidism. Iodine-123 scanning of the thyroid can be used to identify ectopic thyroid tissue, such as lingual thyroid. Absence of a signal on this study confirms athyreosis.  X-ray of the knee can provide useful information regarding degree of severity of intrauterine hypothyroidism by the presence or absence of femoral and tibial epiphyses. Fine-needle aspiration is generally not necessary in children with hypothyroidism. This study, which is designed to evaluate a thyroid nodule, should only be performed by a physician experienced with this procedure. This procedure is most strongly indicated in adolescents or young adults who have a single cold nodule detected by means of iodine-123 scanning. The histologic appearance of CLT includes lymphocytic infiltration, formation of lymphoid follicles, and follicular cell hyperplasia.

The goal of Iodine Deficiency treatment is the prevention of hypothyroidism and goiter. Iodine is used to prevent iodine deficiency and its consequences including goiter. a. treating a skin disease caused by a fungus (cutaneous sporotrichosis); c. preventing breast cancer, eye disease, diabetes, and heart disease and stroke; Iodine is also used in the form of potassium iodide for radiation emergencies to protect the thyroid gland against radioactive iodides. Eat foods rich in calcium like yogurt, cheese, milk, and dark green vegetables. Eat foods rich in Vitamin D, like eggs, fatty fish, cereal, and fortified milk. Eat food rich in Vitamins B and C such as green vegetables and fruits It is best to do weight-bearing exercise such as walking, jogging, stair climbing, dancing, or lifting weights for 21⁄2 hours a week. One way to do this is to be active 30 minutes a day at least 5 days a week. Begin slowly especially if a person has not been active. 6. Do not drink more than 2 alcohol drinks a day for a man or 1 alcohol drink a day for a woman. Alcohol use also increases the chance of falling and breaking a bone. Iodine is an essential component of the thyroid hormones which regulates metabolic rate, growth and promote protein synthesis. Iodine a trace mineral is required by the body for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). When one of the iodine atoms is stripped off of T4, it becomes T3 with 3 iodine atoms remaining. Under normal circumstances the body contains approximately 20 to 30 mg of iodine, most of which is stored in the thyroid gland located in the front of the neck just under the voice box. Smaller amounts of iodine are also found in lactating mammary glands, the stomach lining, salivary glands and in the blood. As a component of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), iodine is essential to human life. Without sufficient iodine, the body is unable to synthesize these hormones and because the thyroid hormones regulate metabolism in every cell of the body and play a role in virtually all physiological functions, an iodine deficiency can have a devastating impact on the health and well-being.

Medical doctor since 1972.Started Kee Clinic in 1974 at 15 Holland Dr #03-102, relocated to 36 Holland Dr #01-10 in 2009.Did my M.Sc (Health Management ) in 1991 and Ph.D (Healthcare Administration) in 1993.Dr Kenneth Kee is still working as a family doctor at the age of 70.However he has reduced his consultation hours to 3 hours in the morning and 2 hours inthe afternoon.He first started writing free blogs on medical disorders seen in the clinic in 2007 on http://kennethkee.blogspot.com.His purpose in writing these simple guides was for the health education of his patients which is also his dissertation for his Ph.D (Healthcare Administration). He then wrote an autobiography account of his journey as a medical student to family doctor on his other blog http://afamilydoctorstale.blogspot.comThis autobiography account “A Family Doctor’s Tale” was combined with his early “A Simple Guide to Medical Disorders” into a new Wordpress Blog “A Family Doctor’s Tale” on http://ken-med.com.From which many free articles from the blog was taken and put together into 1000 eBooks.He apologized for typos and spelling mistakes in his earlier books.He will endeavor to improve the writing in futures.Some people have complained that the simple guides are too simple.For their information they are made simple in order to educate the patients.The later books go into more details of medical disorders.He has published 1000 eBooks on various subjects on health, 1 autobiography of his medical journey, another on the autobiography of a Cancer survivor, 2 children stories and one how to study for his nephew and grand-daughter.The purpose of these simple guides is to educate patient on health disorders and not meant as textbooks.He does not do any night duty since 2000 ever since Dr Tan had his second stroke.His clinic is now relocated to the Buona Vista Community Centre.The 2 units of his original clinic are being demolished to make way for a new Shopping Mall.He is now doing some blogging and internet surfing (bulletin boards since the 1980's) startingwith the Apple computer and going to PC.The entire PC is upgraded by himself from XT to the present Pentium duo core.The present Intel i7 CPU is out of reach at the moment because the CPU is still expensive.He is also into DIY changing his own toilet cistern and other electric appliance.His hunger for knowledge has not abated and he is a lifelong learner.The children have all grown up and there are 2 grandchildren who are even more technically advanced than the grandfather where mobile phones are concerned.This book is taken from some of the many articles in his blog (now with 740

fa6a23ac-e6ca-48c8-92b9-006f5702e9dd,"Frustrated! Hashimoto's low T3: I was feeling... - Thyroid UK I was feeling sooo bad I went to the Dr last August. Most of my female immediate family members have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism. My tsh was high 6.15. I go back and had to argue to get my tpo antibodies tested. My t4 was within range 1.1 and my tsh was now 4.15 but my antibodies were 1047. I would've never known if I didn't educate and advocate for myself! They refuse to diagnose Hashimoto's. Calling me subclinical Hypo. And this is a resident, I have been dealing with. She wanted to blame my symptoms on other possible causes and refused to blame my thyroid. I fought to be put on 25 mcg of t4 meds. No one told me about selenium or important vitamins to lower my extremely high antibodies. I don't have health insurance til April so I can't afford to see an Endo so I still haven't. I researched Hashimoto's and immediately became proactive. Gluten free, refined sugar free, non gmo, no grains, no soy, I was already pescatarian, and I joined a gym and go 6-7 days a week, low calorie and low carb etc. I have been super diligent and strict health wise. I even attended a seminar on root causes of the underlying issue of inflammation, by a respected Ravens team physician and learned a lot. So I lost over 30lbs. But now, despite still doing the same healthy lifestyle 6 weeks, no weight loss and I gained 3-4 lbs plus my energy is sapped more than normal as tiredness is constant as you know. This is NOT a plateau. I ordered my own bloodwork online and got tests I need but never were given because all Dr.'s. do are tsh and Ft4. I did RT3 T3 uptake T7 Total T4 FT4 FT3 and both antibodies. No issues except my Tpo antibodies were still high but down significantly from 1047-110 I attribute to selenium and my diet/exercise. My tsh reduced to 2.85, much better. But now my FT3 is low 2.1, range 2.4-4.8. I have no absorption issues as I tested this and low T3 would account for my symptoms. So I call the clinic and send this to them hoping to start low dose T3. I am told my labs look fine, my tsh is fine and FT3 is an unreliable test! That my symptoms are NOT from my Thyroid and I need to be checked for something else. I tried an online Dr and I was told virtually the same thing and that the Antibodies mean nothing. That u need to relax and meditate! No joke. How are they so dumb? How do I know more than them? How, when my mom, 2 sisters, grandma and now my niece all have this disease do they still refuse to call it Hashimoto's?! I share to help you and myself. I need help but no insurance makes it difficult. No one is listening or cares. They are so ignorant and uneducated about this. Their treatment is antiquated. It's my body, I have to function in it and apparently you are just crazy. Oh and I was told that I shouldn't read and educate myself by the Resident internal med. Dr. Seriously! Thoughts are much appreciated! Some people don't really want to know they have an autoimmune condition, one which will render them hypothyroid sooner or later. You are the wise one. You have an Autoimmune Thyroid Hormone Disease called Hashimotos. This is also another site which may be helpful although, of course, it isn't a forum like this one:- I am hypothyroid but I believe that with Hashi's that your antibodies wax and wane (sometimes too much and other much less) so that's maybe why you are feeling slightly hypo, I assume. Hi Fiara, you've continued to accumulate symptoms in spite of a lower TSH but these ignorant people must live in an alternate universe. So, let's just disregard anything else they say. Order your own natural desiccated thyroid hormone unless you want to undergo working on your autoimmune condition. You will continue to do harm by leaving yourself in this condition. It's very hard on your adrenal glands to coordinate your low metabolism which in turn affects whichever areas are not receiving enough T3. Something has to give. There are many people here doing the same thing or perhaps your own relatives can advise. You need a prescription for NDT. They refuse to do anything about my meds. There are places to order NDT without prescription. You have to ask for a private message for sources. Plus, they are very reasonably priced. Many people on this forum get their own hormone. Are you in the UK? I hope you look into it. I live in the US. I've looked into it but never found it without the need for a prescription. I would def appreciate a private message with info on where and how. Fiara, sorry to hear of your plight. I too had a PCP that said T3 wasn't necessary to test and that it made no difference in the scheme of things. When I visited with her about this last Summer I told her I wanted to know why then I was feeling the way I did. After 20 years all those hypo symptoms came back along with others. We had a very intense discussion on the subject. She finally referred me to an Endo. I can honestly say it has been a real game changer for me. My T3 was on the low end of range and after having tested twice in about five months she added T3 to my Synthroid medication. I have been on this now for almost 3 months. I have seen a dramatic difference. I have not only lost 19 pounds but I don't have the heaviness in my chest when walking-it is much easier to take hills and such as before I was winded. The utter exhaustion has gone away, I am not cold all the time and my aches an pains are pretty much gone too. I have been taking supplements since last July and I do think they have helped immensely. I will be very interested in seeing what kind of difference this medication has made in numbers although it should be based on how one feels too. I still think I might need just a bit more T3 but we will see. You need someone who will actually listen. I think they are a rare breed unfortunately. We are not crazy we just want to be heard and believed! Good luck and here's hoping you find that one that will listen and help! Hashimotos need not be a permanent condition and all autoimmune disease can be healed by healing the immune system..according to functional medicine. I am working on that now. Not all autoimmune diseases can be cured or completely healed. I do believe we can keep it in check but that is a life long effort. Some are genetic and there are genes implicated by science. Mine has been in my family for at least 4 generations. Diet and toxins can cause some peoples autoimmune diseases and exacerbate one's caused by genetics. Yes..Hashimotos IS curable and yes leaky gut/poor immune systems can run in families, but can be gotten rid of. My family is full of autoimmune disease and not one has done anything other than mainstream medicine. Let me clarify. What I'm saying is that genetic autoimmune disease cannot be cured. It can only be put into remission by controlling the triggers of the autoimmune inflammatory response. It requires lifelong dedication, vigilance, and monitoring. But as it is genetic, uncontrollable stress/illness can cause flare ups beyond anyone's control, no matter that the ""controllable elements"" have been eliminated. Autoimmune disease caused by diet and other toxins can be a temporary reaction caused by those things. Yet the hypothyroid element cannot be reversed if too much damage has been done to the gland. It's like diabetes. Some is genetic, some is caused by lifestyle. You can assist your genetic condition but it will always remain. But you can cure non-genetic diabetes by eliminating the causes from your lifestyle....if you're not so far gone, and haven't damaged your body's natural mechanisms. I am going to work on reversing the Hashimotos. I haven't felt normal, since i developed it. I forgot to mention in genetic cases, that antibodies cannot in all cases, fully be eliminated even when you are doing all the proper things. Genetic Hashimoto's creates these antibodies all by its lonesome i was told to relax and meditate too with my hashi's! Are you in the US? The antibodies are autoimmune disease, the problem is NOT with your thyroid, but with your immune system attacking it. info on functional medicine, by a Dr. who has gotten rid of her hashimotos.. WHY THYROID PATIENTS NEED TO WORK WITH A FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE PRACTITIONER For those of you not familiar with Functional Medicine, according to , “Functional medicine addresses the underlying causes of disease, using a systems-oriented approach and engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership”. That’s right, a whole medical specialty dedicated to finding and treating underlying causes and prevention of serious chronic disease rather than disease symptoms. I was tickled pink when all of the presenters were talking about treating the root cause of diseases! When I first set off to treat myself with a systems perspective and to find the root cause of my condition, I did not realize that I was using a functional medicine approach, I just believed in cause and effect. The basic theory behind functional medicine is as follows: Food is information. Beyond calories, the type of food you will eat will help determine if you are going to be healthy or sick. Functional medicine practitioners realize the value of a whole foods based diet as well as the role that inflammatory foods and food sensitivities can play in chronic disease. Stress is a precursor to disease and weakens our body causing it to break down and makes us more susceptible to chronic infections. Here is a glimpse of the information the attendees learned in the GI module: If you work with the gut 60-70% of any disease will get better The best way to give your patients the right treatment and diagnosis is through listening to them (I love that one!) Treat the gut before attempting detoxification, as the gut is a main elimination organ, detoxification first may result in toxins circulating when gut function is impaired. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a precursor to autoimmunity and chronic disease. This last one really resonated with me, as I was diagnosed with IBS in 2002, Hashimoto's in 2009. Many of you may have never been diagnosed, but have had many of the symptoms. My IBS and GERD helped me connect the many dots to get to my root cause. If we can catch IBS in the early stages, perhaps we can prevent thyroid and other autoimmune conditions. Additionally, since we understand that IBS is a precursor for the thyroid condition, treating the root cause of IBS will often result in remission of the autoimmune condition. During the conference, three cases of IBS were presented, the root causes of these cases of IBS included: Case #2: pancreatic enzyme deficiency, gluten sensitivity, overactive stress response Case #3: low stomach acid, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth have hashimotos (anti - tpo 1,300+) but TSH fluctuates between 1.8 - 4.2 on the numerous tests I've... If the problem is T4 -> T3, NOT Hashimotos.. Can using T3 work? hypothyroid or not. TSH and FT4 are normal.

5ac57841-d732-438c-b670-3a462534d35b,"by | | Let’s discuss how to keep your thyroid healthy, what’s important to remember is the body is a complete system and nothing is separate. As an exmaple, I wouldn’t do something for my heart that wouldn’t also effect my kidneys because they all work together; the heart, kidney’s, lungs, blood vessels, etc. They are all working together because they live in the same biochemical pool and the same biochemistry. So, If a person is constipated and absorbing excess poisons, it’s going to effect every part of their body. It may not be as obvious in every case but it is effecting every part of the body.  So the question, how to keep your thyroid healthy is a simpe one to answer, keep your body healthy. The thyroid is a mechanism to deliver iodine to the cells. Iodine is essential for mitochondrial function. The mitochondria are the parts of the cell that are responsible for energy production. They take glucose and oxygen and they produce energy. Small organisms is the ocean where they have lots of iodine around them, they don’t need to have a thyroid. As we get into higher organisms where we have all these different cells, we needed to have a mechanism to deliver iodine to the cells. Iodine is an essential element for life. This is especially true in higher forms in cells that have mitochondria. Now, for someone that has a low functioning thyroid or a hypo thyroid, their energy is very low. They sleep alot, they gain weight, they can’t lose weight and their thinking becomes dull. What does this mean? It means that the mitochondria are not getting enough energy. Dr. Lodi Explains How To Keep Your Thyroid Healthy In Depth Conversely, if someone has a hyper thyroid, they have too much energy. They talk really fast and move fast and they can’t seem to calm down. And then of course, there are people that are right in the middle and their thyroid is functioning appropriately. One of the easiest ways to know whether your throid is functioning properly is by your body temperature. When you get up in the morning and before you get out of bed, put a thermometer under your arm and try to use an old fashioned one where the mercury rises and falls, stay away from the digital kind. Leave the thermometer there for 5 minutes for do this every day for 5 to 6 days and take your temperature each day. Then, take the average of those days. If your average is less than 97.8 degrees than you are sub clinically hypo thyroid. This happens to be true for most of us today where we are hypo thyroid and the reason for this is because iodine is in the same class of chemicals as flouride, chloride and bromide all of whch are throughout our environment. Bromide is in baked goods, chloride is in your water and flouride is in both your toothpaste and your water. These chemicals take the place of iodine and if you consider the fact that we don’t have enough iodine in our food because we don’t eat sea vegetables. Even though our blood tests may come out normal, doesn’t mena you have a normal functioning thyroid. The reason for that is even though your blood test shows that you have t4 and t3 , what it’s not showing you is that it’s not a functional t4 and t3. Instead of having 4 iodines, you have maybe one bromide, one chloride, and only 2 iodines, that’s not functional and it won’t work. Again, use the thermometer method to find out where you stand. Make you you take iodine and there’s different methods of filling up your tank so to speak, one is Lugol’s solution. Eating sea vegetables is a perfect way to maintain your proper iodine levels. Also, miso soup is able to concentrate iodine from the ocean three thousand times greater than in the surrounding water and this means that’s it’s an incredible source of bio available iodine.

When hormone levels are too high or low, the symptoms and side effects can cause poor health and impact your quality of life. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is used to measure the amount of TSH in the blood. The test results are used to figure out what might be causing thyroid hormone levels to be too low or high. The test measures how well the thyroid is functioning and is used to help diagnose thyroid disorders. A blood sample is taken from a vein in the inner elbow. The sample is sent to a lab. The lab may take a few days to analyze your test. Your healthcare provider will talk with you about your test results and what they mean.

Your provider may decide to order a TSH test, if you have an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), or if you are showing symptoms of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). You may also get TSH tests if you are currently being treated for a known thyroid issue. Less common reasons for TSH testing include screening newborns for underactive thyroid, diagnosing infertility issues, and examining the function of the pituitary gland.

8e351f03-733d-4923-bd2f-6a2e0107c8d2,"Changed from hypothyroid to hyperthyroid - Thyroid UK I have been suffering from chronic hives everyday for 8 weeks. GP did blood tests and my thyroid antibodies are high and TSH is very surpressed (Sorry she did not give me the exact levels). I have been taking 50mg levothyroxine for the past 3 years. Dr thinks I might now be hyperthyroid rather than hypothyroid and has told me to stop taking thyroxine tablets and she will repreat blood tests in 2 months. Has anyone else stopped their thyroxine tablets and how did you feel? You have Hashimoto's (as confirmed by raised antibodies), you are hypothyroid, you can't possibly change from underactive thyroid to overactive thyroid. What can happen, and does, is that you can be overmedicated. But the Hashi's causes fluctuations in antibodies and in turn causes fluctuations in test results. You are having a Hashi's ""hyper swing"", you have not suddenly developed an overactive thyroid, it's impossible. When the antibodies attack, the dying cells dump a load of thyroid hormone into the blood and this can cause TSH to become suppressed and Free T4 and Free T3 to be very high or over range. These are called 'Hashi's flares' or more accurately 'hyper-swings'. You may get symptoms of being overmedicated (hyper type symptoms) to go along with these results that look as though you are overmedicated. Unless a GP knows about Hashi's and these hyper type swings, then they panic and reduce or stop your thyroid meds. The hyper swings are temporary, and eventually things go back to normal. Test results settle back down and hypo symptoms may return. Thyroid meds should then be adjusted again, increased until you are stable again. What are your current results that has caused your GP to say this and stop your Levo? If you don't already have them, just ask at your surgery for a print out, then post them on th forum, along with reference ranges, for members to comment. Most doctors dismiss antibodies as being of no importance and know little or nothing about Hashi's and how it affects the patient, test results and symptoms. You need to read, learn, understand and help yourself where Hashi's is concerned. You can help reduce the antibodies by adopting a strict gluten free diet which has helped many members here. Gluten contains gliadin (a protein) which is thought to trigger autoimmune attacks so eliminating gluten can help reduce these attacks. You don't need to be gluten sensitive or have Coeliac disease for a gluten free diet to help. Gluten/thyroid connection: Supplementing with selenium l-selenomethionine 200mcg daily can also help reduce the antibodies, as can keeping TSH suppressed. Hashi's and gut absorption problems tend to go hand in hand and can very often result in low nutrient levels or deficiencies. It's essential to have the following tested: Thanks for the prompt reply. I will try to get hold of my actual results. Getting more blood tests done next week as my white blood cell count also elevated and red blood cells are small. GP quering whether I am anaemic. Poor you. I suffered over dosing of levothyroxine. I know those symptoms you describe so well! Shaws has given you a great reply. I do agree with what she said, because this forum helped me, whereby my (previous) GP, failed me, totally. I suffered, for a further 2 months, after dermatologist (sorting out my acute skin issues), informed me, I was taking too much levothyroxine. The two month delay, getting levothyroxine dose reduced, was due to my GP being on extended holiday, and her colleague telling me, she didn't want to step on GP toes by altering the dose!! (I know! Beggars belief doesn't it?!). Furthermore, I was totally ignorant regarding thyroid dos n donts, before joining HU Thyroid UK. I will just add, that I had taken 125mcg of levothyroxine daily for at least 15 years (diagnosed hypothyroidism 25 yrs), however, I had no clue regarding other prescription med interactions. Clearly, neither did my GP! I had been prescribed numerous meds for prolapse discs and sciatica pain whilst waiting for MRI and physio appointment. I later found out that those meds caused levothyroxine to dump into my blood. Thus, causing my thyroid crises. So, on reflection, your GP was better than mine, as she did thyroid blood test; mine did not, despite my constant request and visits, documenting awful symptoms, before she went away! Now, you know though, you will always get the best up-to-date advice, here on this forum. Best wishes, and no, we can't just stop levothyroxine. Following dietary advice, including vits and minerals here, has really helped me. And, changing my GP practice, of course! Lol It's EXTREMELY common to have low vitamin levels with autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's), especially if been under medicated Low vitamin levels often result in low TSH, which is all poorly trained GP is looking at. You are possibly very hypothyroid. 50mcg Levothyroxine is only a starter dose. NHS guidelines saying standard is 50mcgs and most patients eventually need somewhere between 100mcg and 200mcg For full Thyroid evaluation you need TSH, FT4, FT3 plus TPO and TG thyroid antibodies and also very important to test vitamin D, folate, ferritin and B12 Private tests are available. Thousands on here forced to do this as NHS often refuses to test FT3 or antibodies or vitamins Medichecks Thyroid plus ultra vitamin or Blue Horizon Thyroid plus eleven are the most popular choice. DIY finger prick test or option to pay extra for private blood draw. Both companies often have money off offers. All thyroid tests should ideally be done as early as possible in morning and fasting. When on Levothyroxine, don't take in the 24 hours prior to test, delay and take straight after test. This gives highest TSH, lowest FT4 and most consistent results. (Patient to patient tip, GP will be unaware) My hives improved enourmously by cutting all sugar and sugary foods, I also reduced fruit to a minimum, eventually realised that I am fructose sensitive, serious hives appear the next day after eating sweet fruits or anything containing fructose eg honey. With sugar/sugary foods too but not so bad. I have found dabbing with white wine vinegar is emergency remedy to stop the itching, also washing with aloe vera soap and applying 100% aloe vera gel and talcum powder helped me when it was bad.

My daughter was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism when she was just 15 years old. About 2 years after diagnosis, we started her on homeopathic treatment. Within few months her thyroid levels began to improve and we could taper off her thyroid supplements to a good extent. Her dependency on thyroid supplements came down and she felt much better with most of her complaints now. I am glad that we opted for Homeopathy at the right time. Today she is much better with most of her physical complaints, thanks to Homeopathy. I am on your on-line treatment and have observed 80% to 100% results in different parts of my system. I am glad that I found you. Thank you for being so kind.  have observed positive result during the course of the homeopathic medication. The repigmentation ranged 70%. I am happy about it. Your treatment has been very effective. Most of my urticaria has vanished. Slowly, I have stopped all antihistaminic medicines. I was skeptical to begin with, as I never tried treating myself on-line. I am very much pleased with the results of the medicine that you sent me.

An overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism, is a condition in which your thyroid produces too much of the thyroid hormones (1).  Briefly, the thyroid is a small gland positioned in front of your windpipe. It creates hormones that control the energy supply to your organs, and regulate your heartbeat, digestive system and many other bodily functions. The hormones are called triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and with too much of these, your body overworks itself.  For more information, visit our comprehensive . An overactive thyroid can occur in both men and women at any age but is more common in women between 20 and 40 years old. Some of the possible causes of hyperthyroidism are:  Graves’ disease – this is a condition in which your immune system attacks and damages the thyroid. Thyroiditis – this is an inflammation of the thyroid gland.  Incorrect medicine dosages – if people overmedicate with thyroid hormone replacement, it can cause hyperthyroidism. Lumps on the thyroid – extra tissue can also produce the thyroid hormones, creating higher levels. An overactive thyroid causes an increase in the body’s metabolism, which can cause many symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms are subtle and go unnoticed, but in others, they come on very quickly and severely. Doctors can diagnose this condition with a short physical examination or blood tests.  Your doctor will talk to you about any symptoms you are having, and in some cases, may perform an ultrasound scan of your thyroid gland.  A blood test is a very accurate method of diagnosing an overactive thyroid. In most people with this condition, this will show low levels of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and high levels of thyroxine (T4). If you are diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, another blood test is used to measure your TSH receptor antibodies to establish whether it is being caused by Graves’ disease (2). A may also be used as low levels indicate an elevated metabolic rate. Check out Medichecks’ range of or read if you need help choosing which test is most suitable for you.    An overactive thyroid is treatable; your doctor’s approach will depend on which type of hyperthyroidism you have and how severe it is. Some treatments are: Beta-blockers – this medication is prescribed to treat very mild cases of hyperthyroidism as it helps to relieve some of the symptoms. Medication – antithyroid medicines are usually the first response to hyperthyroidism, particularly for children and pregnant women. They are used to stop your thyroid producing high levels of hormones. The tablets should be taken daily and only stopped if advised to do so by a doctor. Radioiodine – radiotherapy is used to destroy cells in the thyroid, which reduces its ability to produce thyroid hormones. Radioiodine is very effective, safe and has minimal side-effects. Surgery – your thyroid gland can be partially or entirely removed during an operation. This option is usually considered if medication does not work or if your thyroid gland is swollen. After surgery, you will need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life (3).  A balanced diet, along with a few specific foods, can aid in treating or preventing the effects of hyperthyroidism. The condition can cause your bones to weaken and thin, so having sufficient amounts of calcium is beneficial. These are in foods such as cheese, yoghurt, spinach, soybeans, and nuts (especially almonds). Taking vitamin D and calcium supplements during treatment can strengthen your bones (4). Visit for a comprehensive overview of the thyroid diet or speak to a doctor about the best regime for you.  An overactive thyroid can cause complications if it is not treated appropriately or early enough. Some of the related health risks are:  Eye problems – the body’s immune system can attack the tissues around the eyes and cause issues such as irritation, double vision and bulging eyes. Heart problems – the heart can develop an irregular rhythm and struggle to pump efficiently if hyperthyroidism is not treated. Mental health problems – hyperthyroidism can cause anxiety and hyperactivity. Weight loss and loss of bone – the increase in metabolic rate increases the energy requirements of the body, which responds by using energy stored in body fat. The calcium stored in bones can also decrease, resulting in osteoporosis. Pregnancy complications – untreated hyperthyroidism can cause preeclampsia, premature birth and miscarriage.  A thyroid storm – this is the term given to a sudden and life-threatening flare-up of symptoms (5). If you are planning a pregnancy and have an overactive thyroid, it is important to check that your hormone levels are normal. As soon as you are pregnant, you should have a thyroid function test. Your doctor will likely adjust your medication and recommend more frequent blood tests.  If you have any concerns or are experiencing any symptoms related to an overactive thyroid, visit your doctor.

Integration of Homeopathy with Conventional medicine Research for revolution in the treatment of chronic diseases Patients from Alaska to Zambia; from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.. Dr Shah’s research based molecules have US, Europe, Australia, Asia patents Research for revolution in the treatment of chronic diseases   Dr Rajesh Shah and his team have answered over million queries from patients across the globe Slowing down ort sluggish activity of the thyroid gland produces a low quantity of thyroid hormones. This condition is called Under Active Thyroid or Hypothyroid. Supplement the body with external thyroid hormone. Administer medicine that could stimulate the thyroid gland The conventional method is to supplement the hormone, which is not wrong. But, the problem here is that the body gets used to it and stops producing its own hormone in the desired quantity. In the case of the homeopathic treatment, the second option, it tries to stimulate the gland to make it produce a normal production of the hormone. This works as long as the gland is in position to get stimulated. If it is not, then homeopathic medicine wouldn't work. At Life Force, we work on examining the later option in those suitable cases, especially in the early stages up to about two years. The success is not 100%. But, it is worth a strategic try, because when it works, one may not need a lifelong dependency on hormone pills. We do not promise success in every case, please note.

Controlled by TSH Thyroid hormone (T3): Physiological functions - in the young Essential for normal growth (protein synthesis) - hypothyroid children: short staturePlays crucial role in normal development of nervous system - hypothyroid postnatal can lead to mental retardation Thyroid hormone (T3): Physiological functions - In older people - 1 Main determinant of basal metabolic rate set point and body temperature (i.e calorigenic -- increases oxygen consumption) - Hyperthyroid patients tend to be lean (obesity resistant) and hot - Hypothyroid tend to be obese prone and cold Thyroid hormone (T3): Physiological functions - In older people - 2 Increases target-cell responsiveness to catecholamines by increasing the # of adrenergic receptors - Increases heart rate and force of contraction (Induces palpitations in excess) Thyroid hormone facts: 1. Two components of active thyroid hormones** 2. Biological potency of T3 and T43. What % is T3/T4? 1. Active thyroid hormones consist of iodinated tyrosines (mono- or di-iodo) that are coupled to form T3 or T4** 2. The biological potency on target tissues is T4 <<< T3 (by 5 times) 3. ~90% of TH secreted from the thyroid is T4 Thyroid hormone facts: **4. How T3/T4 released to bloodstream? 5. TBG has a 10-fold higher affinity for T4 vs. T3.6. % of T4 / T3 released in free form ** 4. T3 and T4 are released into the bloodstream and circulate bound to thyroid binding globulin (80%) and albumin (minority) 5. TBG has a 10-fold higher affinity for T4 vs T3.6. 0.05% of T4 and 0.5% of T3 are in the unbound, active state. Thyroid hormone facts: ** 7. How T4 converted to active T3? 8. Iodine/Iodide9. Where does iodide concentrate? ** 7. Conversion of T4 to active T3 occurs mainly at the target tissue by 5' deiodinase enzymes.8. Iodine ingested reaches circulation as iodide and is usually about 20 nM9. Thyroid gland concentrates iodide selectively over every other body tissue. Normal T4 levelsNormal Free T4 levelsNormal TSH levels Normal T4 levels are 4.5-12.5 mcg/dL. Free T4 levels are 0.8-1.5 ng/dL or 10-23 picomol/L. TSH levels are normally 0.5-4.7 mU/mL Serum TSH is the most reliable and sensitive thyroid function test to diagnose thyroid disease Serum Free T4 (FT4)Recommended to confirm suspicion of hypothalamic or pituitary diseaseIn practice, commonly checked with TSH The vast majority of T4 is converted via liver and other targets to T3 via deiodinases (D1, D2, D3). All newborn childrenAll adults > 35 years of age every 5 yearsMore frequent screening in high risk patients--""Evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for thyroid disease in adults."" How long is T4/T3 in thhyroid gland sufficient for in a euthyroid patient? 1. Iodide (I-) enters follicle cell from bloodstream via the Na/I- symporter. Specific ! 2. Iodide is transported from follicular cell to follicle colloid and oxidized to Iodine (TPO).3. Iodine reacts with tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin protein. (TPO catalyzed)4. Mono-iodinated tyrosine and Di-iodinated tyrosine residues are conjugated to form either Tri-iodothyronine (T3) or Thyroxine (4 iodinations). (TPO catalyzed)5. Lysosomal proteolysis releases T3 and T4 from TBD and they are secreted into the bloodstream. Iodide is transported from follicular cell to follicle colloid and oxidized to Iodine (TPO).Iodine reacts with tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin protein. (TPO catalyzed)Mono-iodinated tyrosine and Di-iodinated tyrosine residues are conjugated to form either Tri-iodothyronine (T3) or Thyroxine (4 iodinations). (TPO catalyzed) Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) signals in follicular cells via G-protein coupled TSH receptor and cAMP All steps in T3 / T4 synthesis and release are stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) TSH is also the most important positive regulator of thyroid size (cell number) Any kind of feedback that causes extra release of TSH is going to cause goiter and vice versa. Whenever you overexpress TSH, you're going to have a positive effect on thyroid gland size. How does T3 regulate: metabolic rate / thermogenesis? sympathetic nervous system responsiveness? Answer: Almost completely through its transcriptional control over gene expression.Remember: T3 increases the sympathetic nervous system responsiveness by acting as a transcription factor. Thyroid hormone is not itself a TF. The thyroid hormone sensitive TF is thyroid hormone receptor. The thyroid hormone binds to its receptor, dimerizes, they translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and regulate the genes that are thyroid hormone receptive genes that regulate metabolism. Q: repetity with which changing thyroid hormone levels. Patient injected levothyroxine. The5ty had a response within an hour of some type - was that due to the gene expression mediated by thyroid hormone or something else? A: something else. Cuz the mRNA synthesis, etc takes about 3-6 hours. Thyroid hormone receptors are near ubiquitously expressed intracellular transcription factors Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor is only on thyroid. Thyroid hormone receptor is in almost all cells. Know: thyroid hormone receptors bind DNA via a specific binding motif on the receptor. Also bind ligand. Know those 2 regions in the receptor to remember that these thyroid receptors all have. T4 enters the cell via passive diffusion - it's intracellularly bound. TSH doesn't enter follicular cell via GPCR - it only binds to it. Thyroid hormone response element is a specific DNA sequence that is recognized by THR and TH. Upregulates the expression of that gene. Thyroid hormone receptor complexes (T3 bound to receptor) can bind as monomers, as dimers, and as heterodimers with other proteins in the class. Retinoic acid receptors with retinoic acid. T3 responsive genes number in the thousands!!Most are metabolic regulatory genes--adrenergic receptors (alpha and beta 1,2,3 receptors)--mitochondrial metabolic proteins : electron transport proteins : uncoupling proteins (thermogenic) Main effect of taking stimulants is in terms of catecholamine release are increased catecholamine release. Someone who's subclinically hyperthyroid will become more susceptible to the effects of amphetamines, such as hyperthermia. Hyperthyroid patients are heat-intolerant. 1. Hyper- and Hypo-thyroidism 2.

I have an underactive thyroid and I just recently had my results back for Testosterone, they are 11.6 (range 7.6 to 31.4, I think) I am only 23, shouldn't my Testosterone be higher? Hope someone can help you but have you also tried Facebook group for this? I hope some of our men can assist you, as you may realiseits more women than males who develop hypothyroidism. Have you had a test for your thyroid hormones recently. If not request one and have the earliest and fast (you can drink water). If you are on thyroid hormones leave about 24 hours before the test and take levo afterwards. Women/men who might be able to assist you with your question above will also respond. Bremner92, Gynecomastia is due to an imbalance between testosterone and oestrogen. Have you been referred to endocrinology to check whether other sex and growth hormones are okay? I was referred to an endocrinologist. I vaguely remember him just saying ""everything seems fine"". I'm confused. Bremner92, I guess they checked everything out then. I'm sorry I can't help re the testosterone level, I've no idea whether there is an optimal level. Bremner, how's your cholesterol? If it's too low, that could be the cause. I wouldn't have a clue to be honest, I also forgot to mention I have an underactive thyroid which I'm sure isn't medicated properly. Do you have lab results for your thyroid? If your thyroid hormones are low, that might have something to do with it, because all hormones are linked. I'm waiting to order a full blood test for Thyroid. I'm not sure where you're from but where I'm from, Scotland, they only test for T4 and TSH, and that's it. I'm led to believe that there's much more to the thyroid than those 2 tests. Well, there's T3 and antibodies. T3 is the most important number, actually. But if your TSH is high, then your T3 is likely to be low. Antibodies, it's usefull to know if you have Hashi's. I'm in France, and Don't have any trouble getting thyroid bloods done (if I care to go see my doctor, which I Don't!) but I know it's difficult in the UK. Where I had problems was getting nutrients tested - but then my doctor was a real lunk-head! Maybe you've had those done? There's a link between hormones and nutrients, so it's Worth investigating those. Nah, I was definitely not tested for vitamins and stuff. I'll need to wait until I can get access to my blood tests. I'm ordering a full thyroid check though including all the antibodies, T3 etc etc. That's good. Let us know the results and we might be able to help you a bit more. No problem, I will. The place that took my testosterone recommend I do an Andropause Profile too, so I may do that as well. A member on PAS (Pernicious Anemia Society) on Health Unlocked) called Knackersyard gave me some good advice on ideal levels of testosterone for men, slightly higher than what Doctors in UK recommend. Do try and contact him. If you cannot get hold of him, come back to me and I will PM his Post onto you. Hi Bremner. An endocrinologist who examines a 23 year old male with gynaecomastia and no facial hair and concludes ""everything seems fine"" is probably incapable of helping you much. I would take anything he says with a pinch of salt. After being diagnosed hypothyroid aged 34, I was prescribed thyroxine: I then gradually experienced a resurgence of gynaecomastia, a problem I had as a teenager. My although my testosterone was in range, as is yours, my level of estradiol E2 was above the normal range (YOU NEED TO GET YOURS TESTED). I was then tested for Klinefelter syndrome: when this came back negative, no further action was deemed necessary by my endo. This forced me down the road of doing a bit of research and self medicating with anything I thought might help. By trial and error, I have found the following to be of benefit: Tribulis terristris - boosts the body's own testosterone production. Danazol, anastrazole, letrozole - inhibit conversion of testosterone to oestrogen. Bear in mind that if you are offered testosterone injections, patches or gel, that EXOGENOUS testosterone can reduce your body's own production, and can lead to infertility. As far as I know, this is why specialists are more likely to prescribe mesterelone(Proviron) to younger men. Feel free to browse my replies to previous questions, and don't hesitate to ask me anything: ALTHOUGH I'M NOT MEDICALLY TRAINED, I'll do my best to help. It's a little video, less than 4 minutes long, that explains the route the body takes to produce several different hormones, including cortisol and testosterone. It might give you some ideas for research and self-help. Hashimoto's & low T - Why would bottoming out TSH bring libido back? past 3 years now.

This hormone plays a role in several of your body’s functions, including growth and . Some of your T4 exists as free T4. This means it hasn’t bonded to protein in your blood. This is the type available for use by your body and tissues. However, most of the T4 in your bloodstream is . Because T4 exists in two forms in your body, there are two kinds of T4 tests: a total T4 test and a free T4 test. A total T4 test measures the T4 that’s bonded to protein along with any free T4. A free T4 test measures only the free T4 in your blood. Because free T4 is what’s available to your body for use, a free T4 test is often preferred over a total T4 test. Your doctor may order a T4 test if a has come back with abnormal results. A T4 test will help your doctor determine what type of problem is affecting your thyroid. Some disorders that affect thyroid function include: Your doctor may suspect that one of these conditions is present if you have symptoms such as: , like , irritation, , and You may also experience more general symptoms, such as: Sometimes, your doctor may also order other thyroid tests (like T3 or TSH) after you have a T4 test. TSH, or thyroid-stimulating hormone, comes from the . It stimulates your thyroid to release both T3 and T4. Performing one or both of these other tests may help your doctor gain a better understanding of your thyroid problem. In some cases, your doctor may perform one or more of these tests to help assess whether a known thyroid issue is improving. A number of drugs can interfere with your T4 levels, especially total T4, so it’s important to tell your doctor what medications you’re taking. You may need to temporarily stop taking certain drugs before the test to help ensure accurate results. It’s also important to let your doctor know if you may be pregnant. Medications that can affect your T4 levels include: drugs that contain hormones, such as androgen, estrogen, and drugs designed to affect your thyroid or treat thyroid conditions These aren’t the only drugs that can affect your results. Make sure to tell your doctor about all medications, as well as any herbal supplements, you use. A healthcare provider will collect your blood into a tube or vial and send it to a lab for testing. Typical results for the total T4 test in adults generally range from . Results for children vary based on age. Talk to your doctor about the normal ranges expected for your child. There may also be some variation between labs. Typical results in adults for the free T4 test generally range from . Like total T4 in adults, free T4 also varies in children according to age. As with any test result, if it falls outside the expected range, talk to your doctor about what the results may mean in regards to your own personal health condition. Because T4 isn’t the only hormone involved in thyroid function, a normal result on this test could still mean there’s a thyroid problem. For example, your T4 results could fall into a normal range, but your T3 results could be abnormal. This can be particularly true in cases of an overactive thyroid. An abnormal result on the T4 test alone may not give your doctor enough information to fully understand or diagnose your condition. They may also need to consider the results of T3 and TSH levels for a more complete picture. can also affect your T4 levels.

Some doctors may be resistant to a thyroid diagnosis, although the American Associated of Clinical Endocrinologists narrowed the TSH range for acceptable thyroid function from 0.5-5.0 to 0.3-3.04 in 2003. That means more women fall into a range that can be treated. “Find a doctor who treats the person, not just the lab tests,” says Dr. Miller. “If you’re feeling better at a certain dosage—that should carry just as much weight as the lab results.” To get our top stories delivered to your inbox, sign up for the of Replay gallery By Anne Krueger A thyroid disorder epidemic?

How the thyroid gland, hormones and antibodies work In order to understand how blood tests help to identify thyroid disorders, it’s important to know a little bit about the thyroid and the specific substances these thyroid tests commonly measure. Shaped a bit like a butterfly and located in your neck, the thyroid is an endocrine gland that secretes hormones into the bloodstream. It serves a number of different functions, most notably regulating your metabolic rate. When ordering a thyroid test, you will come across a lot of terminology that can be confusing. Here is a breakdown of the common cast of characters in these tests, along with some explanation. T4 is the main hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It is called “T4”, by the way, because thyroxine contains 4 iodine atoms. In our bodies, T4 plays in the health of our heart, digestive system, brain, bones, and metabolism. In our bodies, blood carries T4 to various organs – such as the liver, brain and kidneys, to name a few – where the actions of T4 strip it of an iodine atom, converting the T4 to T3 (triiodothyronine). Though the thyroid gland produces a small amount of T3, the vast majority of our T3 is produced via the conversion from T4 elsewhere in the body. You may wonder how a healthy thyroid knows when to produce T4. This is where TSH enters the picture. When T4 levels in the blood drop low enough, our pituitary gland secretes TSH in order to signal to the thyroid that it’s time to produce more T4. It’s important for a thyroid blood test to measure “free T4” (sometimes written as FT4 or FTI/T7). Free T4 is the thyroxine that is not bound to proteins and can act on body tissues. It is more useful to measure free T4 – rather than only total T4 – along with TSH in order to detect that a thyroid disorder is present. When attacking a dangerous substance like bacteria, for instance, your body’s immune system uses antibodies. But in the case of an autoimmune disorder, our body is unleashing those antibodies on some aspect of itself. In this case, there are autoimmune disorders that attack the thyroid gland. Two common antibodies in this scenario are thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO/TPEX) and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb). What controls the pituitary gland’s release of TSH? That would be the hypothalamus and its production of TRH. When the hypothalamus produces TRH, the pituitary gland then produces TSH. Knowing the nature of these different substances reveals why thyroid blood tests are a powerful tool in identifying disorders. You could think of the hormonal regulation of a healthy thyroid as being a little like a thermostat. When a room gets too hot, the thermostat signals to the radiator to stop producing heat. When a room gets too cold, the thermostat signals to the radiator to produce more heat. This constant signaling and responding keeps the room at a stable temperature. Similarly, based on how much T4 is already present in the bloodstream, hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland signal to the thyroid that it needs to produce more or less T4, in order to keep the organs and systems of our body stable. But what happens when the thermostat or radiator don’t function properly? Abnormal levels of TSH, T3, and/or T4 indicate that the finely tuned system is out of balance. Problems with the thyroid usually result in the overproduction or underproduction of thyroid hormones and/or TSH. The overproduction of thyroid hormones, known as hyperthyroidism, can be caused by conditions such as: Graves’ disease (an autoimmune disease, and the most common cause of hyperthyroidism) Toxic adenomas (nodules developing in the gland which secrete extra thyroid hormones) Subacute thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid that results in the leaking of extra hormones) Dysfunction of the pituitary gland as it regulates the action of the thyroid, causing excess production of thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism is the underproduction of thyroid hormones. This can be caused by: Conditions arise when the thyroid is either overactive in its hormone production, or is underactive and producing too little. Overactive thyroid glands create a condition called hyperthyroidism, while an underactive thyroid gland results in hypothyroidism. Thyroid tests such as the at-home test kits in this guide use blood to measure the amount of thyroid hormones circulating in the body. These can be used alongside other tests to get more detailed information about an underlying disorder. The TSH level is a very important measurement – often the first hormone measured – when investigating a potential thyroid problem. High levels of TSH may suggest that the thyroid is underactive as a result of a problem affecting the gland directly. Conversely, low levels of TSH suggest that the thyroid is overactive. But this may be due to a problem affecting the thyroid directly or a problem affecting the function of the pituitary gland, which in turn is affecting the thyroid. There is quite a bit of important insight that a TSH measurement alone cannot provide. For example, the TSH blood test does not give any information on the amount of T4 being converted into T3, or if T3 receptors are resistant to the T3 hormone. A TSH blood test alone also can’t tell us if the thyroid is being attacked by the immune system, or if the body is deficient in minerals and vitamins needed for thyroid health. Additionally measuring the T4 and T3 values in a thyroid panel will give doctors much more information that can help you arrive at a quicker diagnosis. The three values together – TSH, T4 and T3 – provide a baseline for understanding whether a thyroid disorder may be present. The thyroid hormone T4 (thyroxine) circulates in the blood in two forms: Bound to proteins and consequently prevented from entering cells Measuring free T4 (FT4) together with TSH is most useful when assessing the function of the thyroid. Low FT4 alongside high TSH could signal (an underperforming thyroid gland). This type of test result suggests that the pituitary gland is evidently producing more TSH in order to signal to your thyroid gland that it ought to make more T4. Yet, in spite of this, the thyroid is not producing enough T4 to reach normal levels. Meanwhile, if your TSH level is elevated but your levels of T4 and T3 are normal, you might have what is known as . If your T4 and T3 levels are above normal, while your TSH level is low, then you may have (overactive thyroid). In this case, your pituitary gland is not telling the thyroid to produce more T4, and yet the thyroid is evidently producing excessive amounts of it. T3 testing is usually used in combination with the above tests to determine the severity of hyperthyroidism. The higher the levels are, the worse the thyroid is functioning. It is rarely helpful in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, as the levels of T3 are often normal in that condition. When a blood test of TSH, free T4 and T3 produces results that suggest a disorder, the next step is a further diagnostic work-up to identify the cause. This often includes using a blood sample to measure common thyroid antibodies such as TPO/TPEX and TgAb, in addition to other exams. The measurement of thyroid antibodies can determine if the thyroid is under attack from the immune system. Your immune system protects your body against foreign invaders such as bacteria by sending antibodies to destroy them. These antibodies are produced by white blood cells known as lymphocytes and sometimes target the thyroid. In individuals with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, lymphocytes are often producing antibodies that stimulate or damage the thyroid. – also called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis – is an autoimmune disease in which your own body’s immune system attacks your thyroid, leading to hypothyroidism. Here, the TPO/TPEX and TgAb antibodies may be detected alongside low free T4 and elevated TSH. is another autoimmune disease that causes hyperthyroidism (in which the thyroid produces too much T4). With Graves’ disease, TPO/TPEX will often be detected in the blood, in addition to the other signs of hyperthyroidism presented by TSH, T4 and T3 levels. Thyroid tests that measure TSH, free T4, T3 and also thyroid antibodies provide an excellent window into the functioning of the thyroid gland and the potential underlying causes of abnormal test results. At-home thyroid tests are very reliable and accurate. The top testing companies – which includes all of the companies we compare in this guide – partner only with certified labs of the caliber that health centers use for analysis. For thyroid testing, these companies rely on proven blood sampling methods to deliver accurate results. The instructions for this kind of test thankfully are straightforward, and your kit will include all of the information and materials that you’ll need to administer it correctly. As long as you follow the instructions in your at-home test kit, your lab tests should be as accurate as if you were to have a test administered in an office setting. Challenges associated with testing thyroid function The perfect thyroid test would analyze the levels of thyroid hormones in all of the body’s cells. Unfortunately, this is not possible. Instead, information about the levels of the hormones in the cells must be interpreted by measuring the levels in the blood. The difficulties with thyroid testing are often a result of this indirect measuring not being effective at communicating complex interactions and processes at a cellular level. For example, the cells of the body might not be actively taking in the hormones, as the receptors have become resistant. This would mean the blood levels of the hormone would appear normal but may still cause unpleasant or dangerous symptoms. If you suspect you might have a problem with your thyroid, a doctor will investigate by recording your symptoms and examining your neck to feel if your thyroid might be enlarged. This can be a good indicator of thyroid disease. Usually, blood tests are taken to analyze the amount of thyroid hormones in circulation. The interpretation of thyroid blood tests can also be problematic. Reference ranges are used to determine low, normal, or high levels of thyroid hormones. While these are based on a wide range of studies, what is “normal” to the population is not necessarily “normal” to the individual. Each person has a different hormonal and chemical composition, and deviations from normal references may be normal for the individual. Additionally, because these references have been calculated using statistics and are based on averages, the closer the test results are to either the lower or higher limit, the greater the uncertainty whether the patient has thyroid disease. Likewise, if results are within the reference range but close to the limits, symptoms may still be present. For these reasons, blood tests should be seen as a way to confirm a diagnosis made based on the wide clinical picture, including symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and imaging (e.g., ultrasound of the thyroid gland). Blood testing results should not be dismissed as normal without consideration of other factors. We customize our evaluation criteria depending on the type and nature of the test. For most health-related tests, we have five areas that we use for our evaluations, including: Do the testing companies use the latest and most accurate testing technologies available? How accurate are the tests compared to alternatives? Are you getting your money’s worth? Are there any hidden costs or charges? Does the test provider offer discounts to our readers? How well does the testing company help you choose the best test? How clearly are the results presented? How well does the testing company help you understand results and get treatment if necessary? Are all test kits sent in discreet packaging? Will your data be stored securely? Could your data ever be shared without your permission?

I was over active 8 years ago then had iodine treatment for graves I'm now underactive have been for about 5 years. I can honestly say I don't feel much different to what I was when I was over active . Put on weight tired pins and needles sore joints I'm at the point where I'm fed up going to the doctor as they just seem to fob me off with oh it's your thyroid I take 75mcg of levothyroxine daily. I'm hoping someone has or is experiencing what I am and may be able to share what has worked for them. 😊Thanks You need to get a copy of your results and post them on here, 75mcg is a small dose so more than likely you need an increase. Hi bantam 12 ,My doctor won't increase the dose as they feel it takes a long time for my body to get used to levothyroxine years In my case which I keep explaining that surely years can't be right I'm at the point where I feel blood tests are a pointless exercise .. Dose should be increased every 6-8 weeks until levels are good and you are symptom free, a change of doctor would seem a good move, find one who knows how to treat you correctly. Sounds like you also have nutritional deficiencies - very common when hypo. So, ask your doctor to test vit D, vit B12, folate and ferritin. Hi grey goose, do I have to ask for this to be tested or is it included in the test ? Thank you Oh, you have to ask. And maybe even insist. Doctors do not understand the importance of nutrients. Graves is an autoimmune disease and as such, it's for life, it's in our blood, and DNA. Drinking the drink, complicates all your blood test results, but no doctor appears to understand this - in fact in my experience, no doctor knows what to do with you. After medical intervention, either by surgery or rai you have lost the thyroid and it is a major gland that is the main conductor of all your bodily parts. A fully functioning thyroid would give you approximately 100 T4 + 10 T3 daily. I believe therefore that it is necessary to have the option of replenishing both these vital hormones. With Graves we have TSI/TRab antibodies controlling our TSH readings. That is why we went "" overactive "" in the first instance. Our pilot light, our TSH, was out of control. Imagine a pilot light that doesn't cut out. So now, our feedback is "" broken "" through medical intervention, and our pilot light ???? It is not appropriate to monitor and treat Graves patients on their TSH because it's now not a measure of anything. All thyroid blood tests need the parameters of a T3 and a T4 measure and medicated to get both these hormones into the upper quadrants of their relevant ranges. You may find difficulty getting these tests along with the necessary vitamins and minerals that are detailed on this website, from your doctor. You may need to get them done privately - once with the results, post them on here for people more able than me to offer expert guidance.

I am assuming your doctor's 6.4 was your TSH result. What you have to do is go to the surgery each time you have a blood test, and request a print-out of your most recent results. That way, you will have a record and post on here if it is regarding your thyroid hormones. Get a print-out of your most recent one and put it on a new question. Always quote the result and the ranges. Ranges are in brackets after the results and labs differ and that's why they're important. If we were abroad, if our TSH was 3+ we'd be given levothyroxine. I have no idea what Committee, if in their right minds, could possibly state that our TSH has to reach 10 (in Uk) before we're diagnosed. If they cannot diagnose a person who has a TSH of 100 and had to diagnose themself - doctors cannot be trusted at all. All doctors used to know clinical symptoms and treated the patients accordingly, that's before the blood tests were introduced and dotors now know little. These are clinical symptoms and tick off the ones you have, and also print-out the following and show to your GP. You should be treated for disabling clinical symptoms and given 50mcg of levo to start with a blood test every six weeks with a 25mcg increase. All blood tests have to be at the very earliest possible, fasting (you can drink water) and allow a gap of 24 hours between last dose of levothyroxine and the test and take afterwards. Ask GP to test TSH, T4 T3, Free T4, Free T3 and thyroid antibodies. Antibodies are important because if you have them, regardless of our TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) you should be prescribed. We come to realise that doctors and endocrinologists know little about anything to do with the thyroid gland so we have to read, learn and ask questions especially if we don't feel well. If you didn't have your blood test at the very earliest time (they appear not to know that the TSH is highest early a.m. and drops throughout the day, ask for another or you can get one privately, they are home pin-prick tests but will be for all the hormones the NHS wont do. i.e. TSH, T4, T3, Free T4, Free T3 and thyroid antibodies. GP should test B12, Vit D, iron, ferritin and folate. NICE guidelines state that if you have symptoms of an underactive thyroid and your TSH is over 4, doctors can prescribe a trial of Levothyroxine (LT4). I would go back to your GP and show her this extract from the NICE guidelines: 'If TSH is between 4 and 10 mU/L and FT4 is within the normal range In people aged less than 65 years with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, consider a trial of LT4 and assess response to treatment 3–4 months after TSH stabilises within the reference range — see the section on Prescribing information for further information on initiation and titration of LT4. If there is no improvement in symptoms, stop LT4.' Don't be fobbed off. Lots of doctors know very little about the proper treatment of an underactive thyroid. It's standard practice to not start treatment on basis of just one high test result, incase you have temporary blip in blood tests. Usually bloods are rerun in 2-3 months to reassess, if first test is high For full Thyroid evaluation you need TSH, FT4, FT3 plus TPO and TG thyroid antibodies and also very important to test vitamin D, folate, ferritin and B12 Private tests are available. Thousands on here forced to do this as NHS often refuses to test FT3 or antibodies Medichecks Thyroid plus ultra vitamin or Blue Horizon Thyroid plus eleven are the most popular choice. DIY finger prick test or option to pay extra for private blood draw. Both companies often have money off offers. All thyroid tests should ideally be done as early as possible in morning and fasting. This gives highest TSH, lowest FT4 and most consistent results. (Patient to patient tip, GP will be unaware) You're right, most health professionals are unaware.

The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped endocrine (hormone secreting) gland in the neck that is found on both sides of the trachea (windpipe). It secretes the hormone Thyroxine which controls the rate of metabolism. The thyroid gland is one of the many endocrine glands such as adrenal, pituitary, pancreas, testes, etc. The thyroid weighs about 20-25 gms in an adult. It is butterfly shaped and it consists of two lobes which are connected together by a median isthmus as shown in the picture. It is located in the front of the neck and is situated just below the larynx or Adam's apple. The function of the thyroid gland is to take up iodine from the foods that we eat and to convert it into thyroid hormones namely Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) and Calcitonin (which is involved in calcium metabolism). The cells of this gland combine iodine and the amino acid tyrosine to make T3 and T4. Later T3 and T4 are then released into the bloodstream and are transported throughout the body where they control the general metabolism (conversion of oxygen and calories to energy). The regulation of the metabolism of every cell in the body requires thyroid hormones. The ratio of production of T4 and T3 is 80:20. However, T3 is about 4 times more potent than T4. The production of thyroid hormones is under the direct control of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is an endocrine gland which is situated at the base of the brain and it secretes certain vital hormones which include TSH (Thyroid stimulating hormone) or Thyrotropin, besides others. When the level of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) falls below the required amount, the pituitary gland secretes TSH which stimulates increased production of T3 and T4. As the levels of T3 and T4 keep rising in the blood, the pituitary senses this and reduces TSH production. The hypothalamus is that part of the brain which produces TRH (Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone). TRH regulates the production of TSH by the pituitary, i.e. it has regulatory control over the pituitary gland. Our Homeopathy treatment is now just a few clicks away.

e3a5dbf8-351f-47a8-adae-7025db06a5ba,"Underactive thyroid and Gluten free: Hi I have... - Thyroid UK I have been diagnosed with underactive thyroid. I have no idea what this means and was given no explanation from GP except the clinical one he read from the screen twice. I’m now reading things from the internet and getting in a right muddle. One thing I would like to know is ‘What is the connection between a Gluten Free diet and U/A thyroid’. My GP gave me levothyroxine 25 mg to take once a day and go back in a month which I am doing. I have joined the British thyroid society. If anybody has any suggestions or reading material that would be useful to a completely confused tired novice in this field it would be very much appreciated. The first thing to do is get a copy of your thyroid blood test results and make sure the printout includes the laboratory ranges. You need the ranges to interpret results. You can get a copy via GP reception or register online for patient access to blood tests, again via GP reception. Always get and keep a copy of all results. Thyroid UK who are the parent organisation to this forum have lots of great information. When you get a copy o your results then post here and we can help you understand them. According to NHS guidelines, a starting dose of Levothyroxine should be 50 mcg unless you are very old, very, young, infirm or have a heart condition. You are likely to feel worse on 25mcg as it's not enough to replace missing hormones and just enough to knock out what you've got. Thanks for reply I will get a copy of results didn’t think to do that, wasn’t aware there were going to be anymore to compare with but as I read more it seems blood tests play an important part and are going to be ongoing and regular to keep track of levels. There is a huge amount of info on here that I have seen already today. And I’m 55 which I don’t class as too old just yet but I sure don’t feel it at the moment it’s awful at the moment and your right I actually do feel worse I was going to go back end of next week to GP to ask him what the hell is going on. From NHS viewpoint , when aged over 50 the starting dose is 25mcg That said, low dose can make you feel worse, but stick at it, get bloods retested after 6-8 weeks and dose will be increased slowly over coming months in 25mcg steps until TSH is around one and FT4 towards top of range and FT3 at least half way in range As others have said it's extremely important to get copies of your blood test results and ranges. Keep good record of how you feel at each test and exactly what dose on etc For full Thyroid evaluation you need TSH, FT4, FT3 and also very important to test vitamin D, folate, ferritin and B12 If antibodies are high this is Hashimoto's, (also known by medics here in UK more commonly as autoimmune thyroid disease). About 90% of all hypothyroidism in Uk is due to Hashimoto's. Low vitamins are especially common with Hashimoto's. Food intolerances are very common too, especially gluten. So it's important to get TPO and TG thyroid antibodies tested at least once . Hashimoto's affects the gut and leads to low stomach acid and then low vitamin levels. Low vitamin levels affect Thyroid hormone working Poor gut function can lead leaky gut (literally holes in gut wall) this can cause food intolerances. Most common by far is gluten. According to Izabella Wentz the Thyroid Pharmacist approx 5% with Hashimoto's are coeliac, but over 80% find gluten free diet helps significantly. Either due to direct gluten intolerance (no test available) or due to leaky gut and gluten causing molecular mimicry (see Amy Myers link) Changing to a strictly gluten free diet may help reduce symptoms, help gut heal and slowly lower TPO antibodies All thyroid tests should be done as early as possible in morning and fasting and don't take Levo in the 24 hours prior to test, delay and take straight after. This gives highest TSH, lowest FT4 and most consistent results. (Patient to patient tip, GP will be unaware) Thank you very much SlowDragon for the information and all the links. I am very grateful for your knowledge and help. Makes me feel at ease. Thanks I’m going to try and make sense of these with the web links you gave me. I had an awful day yesterday just so so tired I just slept most of the day which is very unlike me. But better today. Once again thanks again SlowDragon thanks for your weblinks really really useful. So these results are, I assume, from before starting on Levothyroxine Your FT4 was right at bottom of range. So very low. Bu you were fortunate that GP tested antibodies (many don't). TPO antibodies are above range confirms that you have autoimmune thyroid disease also called Hashimoto's Ferritin Ok, but not brilliant. Eating liver or liver pate once a week, or other iron ruch food should help improve The aim of Levothyroxine is to increase dose slowly in 25mcg steps until TSH is around one (or just under) and FT4 is towards top of range and FT3 at least half way in range Levo is T4 and an inactive hormone that must be converted within the body to T3 Getting vitamins optimal helps conversion of FT4 to FT3 Well as you're only 55 and no other health problems ask for a dose increase. Doctors don't seem to know they should start patients on 50mcg. You should retest 6 weeks after the dose increase and adjust dose and then retest in 6 week's and so on until TSH is around 1, not just anywhere in range. Ensure you take Levothyroxine on an empty stomach and leave 1 hour before eating or drinking anything except water. Blood tests should be first thing in the morning, fasting and take Levothyroxine after blood test, not before. This is a a patient to patient tip. Not something we discuss with doctors. Also important to have optimal levels of B12 - Folate - Ferritin - VitD - for your thyroid hormones to work well and for you to feel good. B12 needs to be around 500 plus - Folate and Ferritin at mid-range and VitD at 100 plus .. your GP will not be aware and will declare you normal when just in range. This is why it is so important to have copies of all your results with ranges to help with posting here ... The above website is the website of this forum and will explain everything Thyroid.

82d967a4-29e6-4f52-8d6d-50c035c34aae,"Cushings or Addisons Disease: A few years ago I... - Thyroid UK A few years ago I started to become ill with what looked like symptoms of underactive thyroid. The doctor did a blood test and said yes it is and gave me thyroxine. But since then and before I have had other symptoms come and go, frequently urination for a day or so, feeling very cold, back aches, headaches, no motivation, etc. A few months ago I bent over and my back went woosh and could hardly move for hours, terrible pain. Also found I had a fatty deposit lower back - called a back mouse. Now know this can be because of Cushings Disease, just as I also now know that pepole with adrenal fatigue or adrenal problems can have their back suddenly go much easier than another person can. I feel very poorly physically and mentally. A month or so ago I had an asthma attack - asthma is another illness which many say is caused by the adrenal glands not working right - I had to take steroids for six days, when I stopped taking them I went down hill with much worse back ache, I then took some painkillers and it got even worse! I have since found out that the steroids and the painkillers should not really be taken if you have adrenal fatigue type problems. Yet my research tells me that doctors might put me on steroids for life. I wonder if this is a case of - a bit similar to thyroxine. If you need it then it helps you, but if you dont need it you get ill. Likewise if you need steroids they help you but if you dont need them or you stop taking them you get ill. My doctor told me years ago to avoid steroids whenever possible as they can cause all sorts of problems. I often had to take them because I kept getting sinus infections. I never had a problem with them then. My research tells me if it is not treated it gets worse and can lead to other problems. Have ordered ashwagandha to balance the adrenal glands and see if that helps. More research tells me that people with adrenal fatigue can lead to underactive thyroid so many this is what happened. I just wrote you a long reply, then accidentally erased it. In a nutshell: I just learned I have parasites. Everything you're describing is probably parasites. I was given wormwood tea, googled it & saw parasites. I've been eating diatomaceous earth (DE) (foodgrade, DO NOT breath), three drops oregano oil in a glass of water every day, & a few days ago I saw dea worms in my stool. I bought a neti pot & used pink sea salt only to find dead pink parasites (from the sea salt that dehydrated/killed them) in the paper I blew into afterwards. I use the neti pot now three times in a row, three times a day, & put coconut oil in my ears. I'll keep doing all this until a parasite cleanse I ordered from humaworm.com arrives (will continue the net pot). Asthma, sinus, fatty deposits, cancer (I didn't need to lose my breasts/lymph nodes) are all parasites (don't scoff, remember it was recently discovered that ulcers were from parasites). My pounding headaches, tinnitus, etc., all are better since I stopped ozone therapy which was causing too much die-off of the parasites (when they die they leave toxic waste behind which messes us up until our body can clear it out). It's been a week snce I've been doing these things & my sleep has improved from 1.5 hours at a time for 3-6 hours to four hours at a clip + one extra hour (last two nights). I'm really looking forward to the humacleanse, these parasites eat holes in our guts/capillaries, etc., they cause brain fog (I have toxoplasmosis, feline leukemia, etc., from thirty years ago working with animals but the chemo messed me up so much they're taking over). This is gross, but multiple antibiotics from the docs will only make things worse, and you're right steroids will kill you & will only mask with a bandaid what's really wrong. Google it all, try some essential oils or DE or something simple if you need to be convinced (try these things on an empty stomach, the parasites will be hungry & will eat the poison & you'll get a headache, etc. from the die-off). If you do have parasites, there are may websites with instructions on how to get rid of the (humaworm kills parasites + eggs of over 100 parasites, better than the dangerous antibiotics. Also helps clean your blood of the toxins from die-off). Let me know what hapens, whether you try this or not. Good luck. Some people need steroids or they die. But I understand where you are coming from.But I do not have parasites. My symptoms tie in perfectly with a see saw of addisons and cushings and it also explains why the underactive thyroid followed. you need testing. You can't guess about these diseases. The fat hump is between the shoulder blades at the base of the neck. My daughters friend has cushings. They are totally opposite conditions..Addisons is low cortisol and cushings is high or cyclical...excuse the lack of caps. Hi. Yes I know addisons is low - and very rare - cushings is high and common. I also know that all of my symptoms fit with it going back and forth between the two and with nothing else. I also know that either of these can lead to thyroid which I have, it all fits. You can get fat deposits around the waist with it, which I suddenly got, I also got a phrase where I just bent over and suddenly woosh an awful back ache and barely able to stand up or sit for days. This happens when the adrenal glands are fatigued. I have done a lot of research on it. All fit with low thyroid and weight gain, from myxedema. Either way if you have Hashimotos, then you have autoimmune disease and that needs to be addressed. When you get 1 disease, you get more. There are ways to get rid of them. What are you doing about these symptoms? Are doctors testing you? Do you have Hashis? How do you get tested for Addisons or cushing or graves is it anything to do with the adrenalin glands thanks I will be on this steroid medication for life. I’m not happy about taking steroids but just want to... very ill with suspected Glandular Fever, I had the blood tests done and the mono test came back... my other problems. I came off my meds recently (for unrelated reasons, long story) and had some... group. As I am also hypothyroid I dare say I may be back here continuing to optimise my treatment... pigmentation issues only occurred 2 years ago, prior to this I had extreme pallor) I think I go...

The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland that site in the neck under the Adam's apple. It regulates the body's metabolism by sending thyroid hormone to the organs through the blood. Two conditions, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) and an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) can result when the thyroid isn't working right. An overactive thyroid gland generates too much thyroid hormone, which speeds up metabolism. Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: The first line of treatment for an overactive thyroid gland is drug therapy. If that doesn't resolve the problem, a dose of radioactive iodine may fix the problem by destroying thyroid cells. Sometimes the treatment damages so much of the gland that it can't produce enough thyroid hormone and it becomes necessary to take thyroid hormone. Surgery to remove some of the thyroid gland can be an option when other treatments don't work or aren't advisable. An underactive thyroid gland doesn't generate enough thyroid hormone. This condition, which slows metabolism, is increasingly common with age. It can also be caused by Hashimoto's disease, a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the thyroid gland, or by thyroiditis, an inflammation of the gland. Hypothyroidism is usually treated by taking thyroid hormone. Located at the base of the throat, the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland releases hormones that affect every organ in the body—especially the heart. Too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) slows the heart rate and may boost blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) can cause the heart to beat harder and faster and may trigger abnormal heart rhythms and high blood pressure. A simple blood test can diagnose thyroid problems, and treatment may improve heart-related problems. Low thyroid hormone production, or hypothyroidism, can bring on a range of symptoms that may easily be confused with aging. A guide to hypothyroidism and how to treat it. Sluggishness, fuzzy thinking, and unexplained weight gain are often missed as symptoms of an underactive thyroid. Harvard experts say it’s because the symptoms are often nonspecific, and since older adults generally have more of these nonspecific symptoms, they are even more likely to miss the problem. An underactive thyroid is diagnosed by measuring the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood. The condition is treated with synthetic thyroid hormones called levothyroxine sodium (Synthroid, Levoxyl).   Many older women have an underactive or overactive thyroid gland that doesn’t quite meet the criteria for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. This is called a subclinical thyroid problem. A simple blood test can reveal a subclinical thyroid problem. Subclinical hypothyroidism often does not need to be treated. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is often treated to prevent bone loss and heart problems.   Ask the doctor: How should I treat hyperthyroidism? Treatment with radioactive iodine is one way to treat an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), but other medications can work, too. Treating an underactive thyroid gland may improve mood. When someone develops depression, the brain usually becomes the focus of attention. But other organs can be the source of the problem. A common example is when the thyroid gland produces too little hormone — a condition known as hypothyroidism. Nearly 10 million Americans suffer from hypothyroidism. The condition is much more common in women than in men, and becomes more prevalent with age. As many as one in five women will develop hypothyroidism by age 60. Although researchers aren't entirely sure why there is a link between hypothyroidism and depression, it is likely that some people are taking antidepressants when they should really be taking thyroid medication. Here is a brief review of when clinicians and patients should consider hypothyroidism as a possible cause of low mood — and what to do next. Researchers are exploring a potential link between thyroid deficiency and mental health problems. Though the findings are inconsistent, there is evidence that thyroid medication can help those with depression, even if their thyroid function is normal. For decades, Levothyroxine sodium, the most popular thyroid hormone for replacement therapy, had not been required to go through the Food and Drug Administration's approval process. But in 1997, the FDA reclassified all oral levothyroxine products as ""new drugs,"" obligating the manufacturers to meet approved New Drug Applications (NDAs) before August 14, 2001. A history of potency and stability problems with orally administered levothyroxine sodium products resulted in the agency's decision.Two levothyroxine sodium products, Unithroid and Levoxyl, have recently been approved by the FDA to treat hypothyroidism. And now the FDA is issuing guidance regarding the transition of patients from unapproved to these approved products, and the handling of those products being marketed without an approved application. The FDA will gradually do away with the unapproved products to allow manufacturers of approved products to expand to meet demand and to give patients and health care providers enough time for a clean transition.Two of the most common formulations that are being phased out are Synthroid and Levothroid. Manufacturers of unapproved oral levothyroxine sodium drug products without an NDA pending with the FDA must cease distribution by August 14, 2001.August 2001 Update Back to Top Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, an overactivity of the thyroid gland that results in too much thyroid hormone circulating through the body. The high thyroid level raises the body's metabolism, causing frequent bowel movements, increased heart rate, irritability, and anxiety, as well as an increased appetite partnered with weight loss. In addition, about one in five people with Graves' disease has bulging eyes. The condition is most common in young to middle-aged women.Doctors usually treat Graves' disease with antithyroid medicines, radioactive iodine treatment, or surgery. The goal of treatment is to induce long-term remission, that is, to permanently reduce the amount of hormone the thyroid gland produces. Most often, patients find antithyroid medicines effective while they are on them, but hyperthyroidism often returns once the drugs are stopped. Radioactive iodine and surgery, on the other hand, destroy or remove so much of the thyroid gland that it no longer produces enough thyroid hormone. As a result, patients need to take thyroid pills for the rest of their lives. Until now, it has been difficult for physicians to predict which treatment will be more effective for which patients.A new study, published in the March 2000 The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, shows that patients under 40 and men do not respond as well to antithyroid medicines, and that men are less likely to be successfully treated with only one dose of radioiodine therapy. The researchers followed 423 patients for six months after they completed therapy. Of the patients, 314 received antithyroid medicines (usually an 18-month course of carbimazole) and 109 received radioiodine therapy.Of the patients taking antithyroid medicines, only 37% remained in remission six months after treatment. Of those, men were significantly less likely than women (20% vs. 40%) to remain in remission, and patients younger than 40 were significantly less likely than patients over 40 (33% vs. 48%) to stay in remission. Men were also significantly less likely than women (47% vs. 74%) to enter remission after one dose of radioiodine therapy.In response to these findings, the researchers proposed that men and patients younger than 40 receive early treatment with radioiodine therapy or surgery, since antithyroid medicines are unlikely to lead to remission. In addition, they suggest further research to investigate whether higher initial doses of radioiodine may be appropriate for male patients.To learn more about Graves' disease, see page 844 of the Family Health Guide.

fa615f54-1db4-4af2-8a7f-b2638a7d9020,"Author: Sunil Kumar Sinha, MD; Chief Editor: Sasigarn A Bowden, MD  The fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system develops independently of the mother's pituitary-thyroid axis. During embryogenesis, primordial thyroid cells arise from epithelial cells on the pharyngeal floor; they then migrate caudally to fuse with the ventral aspect of the fourth pharyngeal pouch by 4 weeks' gestation. The thyroid continues to develop anteriorly to the third tracheal cartilage. Thyroglobulin is produced by 8 weeks' gestation. Trapping of iodine occurs by 10-12 weeks' gestation, followed by the synthesis of iodothyronines. Colloid formation and pituitary secretion of thyrotropin, also termed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), occur by the 12 weeks' gestation. The primary function of the thyroid gland is synthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Pituitary thyrotropin regulates thyroid hormone production. TSH synthesis and secretion are stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is synthesized by the hypothalamus and is secreted into the hypophyseal portal vasculature for transport to the anterior pituitary gland. Serum T4 concentration modulates secretion of both TRH and TSH by means of a classic negative feedback loop. Circulating T4 is predominantly bound to T4-binding globulin (TBG). T4 is deiodinated in peripheral tissue to T3, the more bioactive thyroid hormone. T3 carries 3-4 times the metabolic potency of T4, freely enters cells, and binds to receptors of the hormone into the cell nucleus. Thyroid hormone exerts profound effects on the regulation of gene transcription. Some major clinical phenomena of thyroid hormone action include differentiation of the CNS and maintenance of muscle mass. Thyroid hormone also controls skeletal growth and differentiation and metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and vitamins. Thyroid hormone synthesis absolutely requires iodine. Dietary iodine deficiency is endemic in several areas of the world, particularly high mountain plateaus. In the United States, supplementation of salt with iodine has nearly eliminated dietary deficiency of this essential element. The recommended dietary allowance of iodine is 40-50 mcg daily in infants, 70-120 mcg daily for children, and 150 mcg daily for adolescents and adults. The daily intake in North America varies from 240 mcg to more than 700 mcg. In the thyroid gland, iodide is trapped, transported, and concentrated in the follicular lumen for thyroid hormone synthesis. Before trapped iodide can react with tyrosine residues, it must be oxidized by thyroidal peroxidase. Iodination of tyrosine forms mono-iodotyrosine and di-iodotyrosine. Two molecules of di-iodotyrosine combine to form T4, and one molecule of mono-iodotyrosine combines with one molecule of di-iodotyrosine to form T3. Formed thyroid hormones are stored within thyroglobulin in the lumen of the thyroid follicle until release. TSH stimulates uptake and organification of iodide as well as liberation of T4 and T3 from thyroglobulin. Hypothyroidism is among the most common endocrine diseases. Congenital hypothyroidism most commonly results from agenesis, dysplasia, or ectopy of the thyroid; however, it is also caused by autosomal recessive defects in the organification of iodine (thyroid hormone synthesis) and defects in other enzymatic steps in T4 synthesis and release. In older children and adults, acquired hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by autoimmune destruction (Hashimoto thyroiditis).[1] Congenital hypothyroidism has a frequency of 1 case per 1500-3000 live births.[2] Hypothyroidism can be congenital. Thyroid dysgenesis affects 1 per 4000 newborns worldwide. Hypothalamic or pituitary insufficiency, which results in secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, respectively, affects 1 per 60,000-140,000 newborns worldwide. Hypothyroidism can be acquired. Depending on the criteria used for diagnosis, as many as 10% of young females are estimated to have some signs of autoimmune thyroid disease, usually chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT). Not all cases progress to frank hypothyroidism; however, these patients remain at an increased risk compared with the general population. Untreated congenital hypothyroidism in early infancy results in profound growth failure and disrupted development of the CNS, leading to developmental cognitive delay (cretinism). Untreated hypothyroidism in older children leads to growth failure as well as slowed metabolism and impaired memory. In descending order, thyroid dysgenesis occurs more frequently in Hispanics than in whites, followed by blacks. Thyroid dysgenesis occurs more frequently in females than in males, with a female-to-male ratio of 2:1. CLT also has a 4:1 female-to-male preponderance in childhood. Congenital hypothyroidism can present with goiter at birth or with the gradual development of symptoms over the first several months of life.[3] The age of symptom onset is unpredictable in a child who has thyroid dysgenesis with a hypoplastic and/or ectopic thyroid gland because initial increases in TSH may be able to initially overcome the relative insufficiency of the thyroid gland. CLT typically presents during adolescence; however, it may present any time in life. The history depends on the age at presentation.[4] Most infants with congenital hypothyroidism are asymptomatic during the neonatal period or display subtle and nonspecific symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency. The lack of symptoms initially may result, in part, from an ectopic thyroid gland with clinically significant reserve function, partial defects in thyroid hormone synthesis, or to the moderate amount of maternal T4 that crosses the placenta and is able to boost fetal levels within 25-50% of normal levels observed at birth. Detection of congenital hypothyroidism based on signs and symptoms alone may be delayed until age 6-12 weeks or older because of the protean clinical presentation and requires a high index of suspicion by the health care provider. Only about 5% of infants with hypothyroidism are detected by clinical criteria before the biochemical screen alerts the clinician to confirm the diagnosis. The following are among the earliest signs of hypothyroidism: The clinical features of acquired hypothyroidism are typically insidious in onset. Goiter: Patients with CLT (ie, Hashimoto thyroiditis) most commonly present with an asymptomatic goiter. Parents may report that their child's neck looks ""full"" or ""swollen."" Children may complain of local symptoms of dysphagia, hoarseness, or of a pressure sensation in their neck and/or throat. A patient with other causes of hypothyroidism may have an enlarged thyroid gland. Slow growth, delayed osseous maturation, and increased weight: Mild weight gain despite decreased appetite is characteristic of the child who has a hypothyroid condition. Moderate-to-severe obesity in children is not typical for hypothyroidism. Furthermore, children with hypothyroidism manifest a decreased growth rate, a more constant finding than weight gain. In contrast, children with exogenous obesity typically have an increased growth velocity. Sleep disturbance, typically obstructive sleep apnea Heat intolerance, weight loss, and tremors: These are typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. However, approximately 5-10% of children with CLT initially present with symptoms of toxic thyroiditis. This clinical picture may suggest a diagnosis of Graves disease. The thyrotoxic phase of CLT can be differentiated from Graves disease in that CLT is transient, is not associated with exophthalmos, and is usually associated with a decreased and nonuniform uptake of radioactive iodine. This hashitoxicosis phase is usually followed by the more characteristic hypothyroid phase. Parents may bring their child in for evaluation secondary to concern about testicular enlargement in boys or early breast development or onset of vaginal bleeding in girls. The exact mechanism of sexual pseudoprecocity is not fully understood; however, TRH-induced TSH excess is thought to be the common stimulator of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor. Serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels are elevated into the pubertal range. Mounting evidence suggests that increased serum levels of prolactin produce resistance to LH stimulation of the gonads, perhaps leading to hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) production and stimulation of pituitary LH and FSH release. The short stature and delayed bone age observed in children with hypothyroidism help distinguish sexual pseudoprecocity from true precocious puberty. Sexual pseudoprecocity reverses with adequate thyroid replacement. Galactorrhea: This condition develops in primary hypothyroidism secondary to TRH secretion from the hypothalamus. TRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to release TSH and prolactin. Galactorrhea resolves as prolactin concentrations fall with thyroid replacement. If the newborn with congenital hypothyroidism is not identified by newborn screening and receives no replacement therapy, clinical manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism evolve during the first weeks after birth. Note that although the signs listed below are classic for congenital hypothyroidism, they may be subtle or absent. Recognition of this disorder has been enhanced by systematic newborn screening for the past 30 years. Physical signs of congenital hypothyroidism include the following: Rare cry or hoarse cry (hoarse cry is secondary to myxedema of the vocal cords) Large protruding tongue (secondary to accumulation of myxedema in the tongue) Delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes (The Achilles tendon reflex appears to be most sensitive to effects of hypothyroidism.) Enlarged cardiac silhouette, usually because of pericardial effusion Prolonged conduction time and low voltage on electrocardiogram (ECG) The signs of acquired hypothyroidism can include many physical findings observed with congenital hypothyroidism, such as the following: Mild obesity (5-15 lb over 6 mo) or morbid obesity (>20 lb overweight), which is seldom caused by hypothyroidism alone (The evaluation of obesity often includes assessment of serum TSH and free T4 levels.) This may occur secondary to the effects of TSH receptor–stimulating antibodies, inflammatory lymphocytic infiltration, or compensatory hyperplasia because of decreased serum T4 and increased TSH concentrations. Typically, the thyroid gland is enlarged diffusely, although it may not be enlarged symmetrically. Upon palpation, the thyroid gland may initially be soft but then takes on a firm feeling with rubbery consistency and a seedlike surface secondary to hyperplasia of the normal lobular architecture Approximately 75% of infants with congenital hypothyroidism have defects in thyroid gland development, 10% have hereditary defects in thyroid hormone synthesis or uptake, 5% have secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamus) hypothyroidism, and 10% have transient hypothyroidism. Thyroid dysgenesis: Defective thyroid gland development accounts for most instances of congenital hypothyroidism. Thyroid dysgenesis occurs sporadically in most cases but is occasionally familial because of mutations or deletions of genes (TSHR, PAX8, NKX2-1, FOXE1, and NKX2-5) that are involved in fetal thyroid formation. Thyroid dysgenesis ranges in severity from thyroid aplasia or hypoplasia to functional ectopic thyroid tissue. Approximately 40-60% of infants with thyroid gland dysgenesis have some functioning tissue. Laboratory and imaging studies facilitate the determination of the degree of dysgenesis. Thyroid agenesis is suggested by a low serum T4 level with an elevated serum TSH level and undetectable serum thyroglobulin. Newborns with ectopic or hypoplastic thyroid glands manifest low serum T4, elevated serum TSH, and measurable levels of circulating thyroglobulin. Imaging aids in confirming the diagnosis of aplastic, hypoplastic, or ectopic thyroid. Familial thyroid dyshormonogenesis: Rare autosomal recessive inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis, secretion, or uptake also cause congenital hypothyroidism. The following 8 inborn errors have been identified: Failure to respond to TSH secondary to defective activation of the thyroid receptor and related cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal transduction pathway Defect in trapping of iodide secondary to sodium-iodide symporter failure Defective oxidation of iodide to iodine secondary to thyroid peroxidase deficiency Partial peripheral resistance to thyroid hormones (autosomal dominant defect): Patients relate a family history of goiter with euthyroidism or hypothyroidism in the face of elevated serum levels of T4 or T3 but nonsuppressed serum TSH concentrations. Transplacental passage of maternal TSH-binding inhibitory antibodies: This can cause transient neonatal hypothyroidism. In mothers with autoimmune thyroiditis, immunoglobulin G (IgG) antithyroid antibodies can be transmitted across the placenta. These antibodies block binding of TSH to its receptor on the fetal thyroid. The half-life of these antibodies is approximately 1 week, and this form of congenital hypothyroidism usually resolves within 2-3 months of life. Although these infants are asymptomatic, they require thyroid hormone replacement until the pituitary-thyroid axis recovers. Monitoring the infant's serum titer of maternal antibodies is unnecessary, although monitoring serum TSH values is essential for guiding therapy. Maternal exposure to radioiodine: The fetal thyroid is able to trap iodide by 70-75 days' gestation. Hypothyroidism can develop if the mother is exposed to radioiodine to treat Graves disease or thyroid carcinoma. Goitrogens: These include iodides found in certain asthma medications, amiodarone, neonatal exposure to iodine-containing antiseptics, propylthiouracil, or methimazole. CLT (ie, autoimmune thyroiditis, Hashimoto thyroiditis) is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism and goiter in children living in iodine-sufficient areas. An increased frequency of CLT occurs in children with trisomy 21 syndrome, Ulrich-Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, or other autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus. CLT appears to require both an environmental trigger and a genetically determined defect in immune surveillance. Evidence suggests that the disease develops secondary to a defect in cell-mediated immunity whereby suppressor T lymphocytes fail to destroy forbidden clones of thyroid-directed T lymphocytes, which form as part of random immunologic differentiation. The attack on the thyroid involves natural killer cells and the complement cascade. Various thyroid autoantibodies (antithyroglobulin antibody, antithyroid peroxidase antibody) are demonstrable in the serum but are not believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of CLT. Clinical manifestations of CLT vary depending on the type and predominance of thyroid antibodies produced. Most children present with an asymptomatic goiter and may be biochemically euthyroid, although compensated hypothyroidism and symptomatic hypothyroidism are more common presentations. Rarely, the child with CLT may be symptomatic with a small atrophied gland. A small percentage of children with CLT initially present with transient symptoms of hyperthyroidism. This short-lived thyrotoxic phase may be secondary to autonomous release of stored T4 and T3 (with progressive inflammatory lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid) or secondary to an initial predominance of TSH-receptor stimulating immunoglobulins (termed hashitoxicosis). Subacute thyroiditis is a rare disorder in children. Typically, a painful thyroid gland is accompanied by signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, with elevated serum T4 and suppressed serum TSH. Patients with this condition may present later manifesting a hypothyroid phase with goiter. The clinical hallmarks are painful swelling of the thyroid, usually after a viral infection, with lymphocytosis and elevated sedimentation rate. The inflammation results in autonomous release of thyroid hormone and a thyrotoxic phase, followed by a euthyroid phase and then a hypothyroid phase. Each phase lasts at least 1 week and is commonly followed by a return to an euthyroid state, depending on the degree of tissue damage. Treatment of the thyroid disorder is usually unnecessary. Drug-induced hypothyroidism can result from use of thioamides, lithium, amiodarone, and excess dietary iodine. Exposure to these substances most often results in biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism in the absence of clinical symptoms. Endemic goiter results from nutritional iodine deficiency with or without environmental goitrogen exposure. Endemic regions include high mountain plateaus and other areas that do not have ready access to salt water or seafood. T4 is converted in peripheral tissues to bioactive T3 by thyroxine-5'-deiodinase enzyme. This enzyme is also responsible for clearing small amounts of reverse T3 (rT3), which are the by-products of T4 metabolism. Many nonthyroidal illnesses are associated with inhibition of 5'-deiodinase activity in peripheral tissues, resulting in a decrease of circulating bioactive T3 and an increase in reverse T3 (rT3). Examples include acute or chronic severe illness, surgery, trauma, fasting, malnutrition, and use of certain drugs. TSH secretion is also decreased and does not appropriately respond to falling serum levels of T4. The classic findings include low or normal TSH, low T4 and free T4, low T3 and free T3, and elevated rT3 levels in serum. Thyroid hormone replacement is not needed because the disorder resolves with improvement of the underlying disease. Childhood onset of congenital hypothyroidism secondary to hypoplastic or ectopic gland, which becomes unable to meet the demands of the growing child. Radioiodine uptake imaging assists in making the diagnosis. Irradiation of the thyroid gland may be a cause. For example, the Chernobyl disaster of 1987 released massive quantities of radioactive iodine and cesium into the environment, leading to an increase in the subsequent incidence of both hypothyroidism and thyroid malignancy. Infiltrative and storage disorders of the thyroid gland, including histiocytosis X and cystinosis, may be associated with hypothyroidism. In these instances, the primary disease is usually evident prior to the development of hypothyroidism. Surgical excision may be associated with hypothyroidism. For all measures of thyroid function, age must be considered to interpret the results. In the term neonate, laboratory tests best reflect true thyroid function when performed in infants older than 24 hours. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration remains the most sensitive screening test for hypothyroidism and for establishing the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. The sample can be obtained at any time of day. A value within the reference range does not exclude TSH deficiency or TRH deficiency. A physiologic surge of TSH occurs within the first 30 minutes of life and appears to be related to the stress of delivery and exposure to the cold temperature of the extrauterine environment. Serum TSH levels peak at levels as much as 70 mIU/L within the first 24 hours of life and then rapidly drop to less than 10 mIU/L within the first 3 days of life. Beyond the neonatal period, healthy serum levels of TSH are less than 6 mIU/L. Serum TSH levels are elevated in primary hypothyroidism or compensated hypothyroidism and should be low or within the reference range in cases of pituitary (TSH deficiency) or hypothalamic (TRH deficiency) etiologies. Isolated TSH deficiency is far less common than multiple anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies. Serum TSH is the optimal parameter to guide dosing of thyroid hormone replacement, except in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism. In these patients, measuring serum free T4 by means of equilibrium dialysis is the superior testing method. Adequate thyroid hormone replacement results in normalization of serum TSH. In the rare syndromes of thyroid hormone resistance, serum TSH levels are elevated in the presence of normal-to-high serum total T4 concentration. Serum TSH levels are often mildly abnormal (≤ 7 mIU/L) in children and adolescents who are morbidly obese (>20 lb overweight). If the serum free T4 level is normal, the growth velocity has been normal for at least 6 months, the serum TSH level remains stable (not rising) over at least 3 months, and no other signs of hypothyroidism are present, these children and adolescents do not require routine T4 therapy. T4 is present in both the free state and bound to TBG. Total T4 assays measure T4 in both states and are useful to establish the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism and to assess response to treatment. Free T4 should be directly measured with the equilibrium dialysis method. Many laboratories report a calculated value termed the free T4 index, which is an estimate of the free T4 concentration, not a measurement. The free T4 index is calculated by multiplying the T4 by the T3 resin uptake. Serum free T4 by equilibrium dialysis should be measured when secondary hypothyroidism (pituitary TSH deficiency) or tertiary hypothyroidism (hypothalamic TRH deficiency) is suggested. Measurement of serum T3 concentration, free or total, is not required to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism includes the following: Required by US law in all 50 states, these programs measure total T4 levels using a filter paper–based assay. In those neonates whose serum T4 level falls within the lowest 10th percentile for newborns screened that day by the program, T4 is reassayed, and TSH is simultaneously determined. Remember that, even with the best screening programs, infants with hypothyroidism can be missed. Therefore, the occurrence of a normal screening result must not preclude thyroid function testing in any infant with signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism. Infants with abnormal or borderline screening results should have total T4 and TSH obtained for definitive testing. Thyroid hormone replacement may be empirically initiated while awaiting the confirmatory studies. In infants, if the serum total T4 is less than 85 nmol/L (< 7 mg/dL), with TSH more than 40 mIU/L, congenital hypothyroidism is likely. If total T4 is low, and serum TSH is not elevated, TBG deficiency, central hypothyroidism, or euthyroid sick syndrome should be considered, and repeat testing may be needed.[5] Serum free T4 concentration is normal in TBG deficiency. Normal TSH (< 20 mIU/L) in the presence of low total T4 and free T4 concentrations suggest secondary or tertiary causes of hypothyroidism. In the latter, signs of associated hypopituitarism (eg, poor feeding, hypoglycemia) and physical findings (eg, midline defects, micropenis) support the diagnosis. All such infants should be screened for other pituitary hormone deficiencies (see Hypopituitarism). Serum antithyroid antibody test findings do not facilitate the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and only serve to establish a diagnosis of CLT and indicate the risk of subsequent development of hypothyroidism. Antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibody titers are elevated in 90-95% of children with CLT. A small proportion of children with test results that are initially negative become positive later. As many as 20% of individuals who have antibody-positive test results do not develop hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Serum total T4 levels and serum free T4 levels are both low in patients with hypothyroidism. In compensated hypothyroidism, total T4 may remain within the reference range in the presence of elevated TSH. Newborns with an elevated TSH should be treated empirically with thyroid hormone replacement until they are aged 2 years to eliminate any possibility of permanent cognitive deficits as a result of hypothyroidism. Low or low-normal serum total T4 levels in the setting of a serum TSH within the reference range suggests TBG deficiency. This congenital disorder causes no pathologic consequence; however, it should be recognized to avoid unnecessary thyroid hormone administration. TBG deficiency affects 1 individual per 3000 population; therefore, occurrence is nearly as frequent as that in congenital hypothyroidism. TBG deficiency results in low serum total T4; however, serum TSH and serum free T4 concentrations are normal. Assessment of the serum TBG concentration, preferably with simultaneous serum free and serum total T4 concentrations, confirms the diagnosis. In vivo radionucleotide studies: The iodide-trapping or concentrating mechanism of normal thyroid tissue can be evaluated by radioisotope (iodine-123 or technetium-99m pertechnetate). In children, technetium-99m is a useful radioisotope because it is trapped by the thyroid but not organified; thus, the child is exposed to lower amounts of radiation. In congenital organification defects and lymphocytic thyroiditis, the amount of radioisotope uptake is within reference range; however, the half-life of the radioisotope within the thyroid is decreased because of the lack of organification. This can be demonstrated by means of a perchlorate washout study. Radioisotope-based thyroid scanning is useful to detect the absence or ectopic location of healthy thyroid tissue in congenital hypothyroidism. Iodine-123 scanning of the thyroid can be used to identify ectopic thyroid tissue, such as lingual thyroid. Absence of a signal on this study confirms athyreosis.  X-ray of the knee can provide useful information regarding degree of severity of intrauterine hypothyroidism by the presence or absence of femoral and tibial epiphyses. Fine-needle aspiration is generally not necessary in children with hypothyroidism. This study, which is designed to evaluate a thyroid nodule, should only be performed by a physician experienced with this procedure. This procedure is most strongly indicated in adolescents or young adults who have a single cold nodule detected by means of iodine-123 scanning. The histologic appearance of CLT includes lymphocytic infiltration, formation of lymphoid follicles, and follicular cell hyperplasia. In congenital hypothyroidism, treatment should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is suggested preferably before 2 weeks of life, immediately after obtaining blood for confirmatory tests. Delaying treatment after 6 weeks of life is associated with a substantial risk of delayed cognitive development. Recommended starting dose of levothyroxine for congenital hypothyroidism is 10 to 15 μg/kg/day.[6]  Newborns with elevated TSH should be treated empirically with thyroid hormone replacement until they are aged 2 years to eliminate any possibility of permanent cognitive deficits caused by hypothyroidism. Once treatment is initiated for congenital hypothyroidism, serum total T4 and TSH concentrations should be assessed monthly until the total or free T4 levels normalize, then every 3 months until the patient is aged 3 years. Thereafter, total T4 and TSH should be measured every 6 months. In patients with thyroid agenesis, serum TSH levels may remain slightly elevated (15-25 mcIU/mL) despite adequate thyroid hormone replacement, as indicated by serum total or serum free T4 levels and clinical assessment. This phenomenon has been termed a reset thyrostat and reflects initial transient unresponsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (hypertrophied thyrotrophs) to thyroid hormone replacement. The higher the initial serum TSH, the more likely one is to observe persistent mild elevation despite adequate replacement. If appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy is given, the thyrostat typically resets to a normal value within a few months. Initial evaluation and follow-up can be conducted on an outpatient basis. Bone age may confirm the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism or can be used to assess excessive thyroid hormone replacement. Therapeutic goals are normalization of thyroid function test results and elimination of all signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. Therapy should correct growth, pseudoprecocious puberty, and galactorrhea. Goiter may be reduced; however, replacement therapy often does not result in complete normalization of size. When indicated by an elevated serum TSH, dosage adjustments of 0.0125 mg levothyroxine are usually sufficient. Because the half-life of T4 in the serum is about 6 days, approximately 3.5 weeks are required for serum T4 values to reach a new steady state. Depending on the degree of hypothyroidism and the time spent in the hypothyroid state, suppression of elevated TSH levels may take longer; therefore, repeat measurements of total T4 and TSH should be obtained no sooner than 1 month after any dosage adjustment or change in brand of thyroid hormone. Levothyroxine tablets are easily crushed and can be given in a spoon with a small amount of water, formula, or cereal. Suspensions are not commercially available and are not recommended because maintaining a consistent concentration of levothyroxine in solution is difficult. Approximately 20% of children with CLT recover to the euthyroid state and do not require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement. After treatment beyond the completion of puberty, a 6-month trial off thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be considered, with monitoring of serum TSH and total T4 levels every 3 months. If serum TSH levels rise above the reference range, levothyroxine treatment should be resumed and continued for life. Patients with CLT should undergo at least yearly monitoring of thyroid function with serum total T4 and TSH assessment to assure adequate treatment and maintenance of euthyroidism. In the case of concomitant hypopituitarism with corticotropin deficiency or any other causes of suspected adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid replacement should always precede thyroid hormone replacement. This reduces the risk of adrenal crisis resulting from increased demands from enhanced metabolism from thyroid hormone replacement. Rarely, a massive goiter may require surgical resection for cosmetic indications. Generally, surgical therapy has no role in the treatment of hypothyroidism. Case reports have documented surgical resection of an enlarged pituitary gland, which subsequently demonstrated physiologic thyrotroph hypertrophy related to primary hypothyroidism. This condition is best treated by adequate T4 replacement. Consultation with a nuclear medicine physician is indicated for performance of radioiodine scan. Surgical consultation is advised during evaluation of a single cold nodule in the adolescent or young adult. No dietary restrictions are necessary. However, soy-based formulas have been recognized to reduce the absorption of levothyroxine. Thus, these infants may require a slightly higher replacement dose to achieve euthyroidism. Children with large pericardial effusions secondary to hypothyroidism should not participate in vigorous sports activities, until the effusion has resolved with T4 replacement. Such pericardial effusions from myxedema typically resolve within a month of attaining euthyroidism. No restriction of activity is required for patients with hypothyroidism who are euthyroid on replacement therapy. Levothyroxine is generally considered to be the treatment of choice for patients with hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is the preferred form of thyroid hormone replacement in all patients with hypothyroidism. Rarely, patients with congenital hypothyroidism display a ""reset thyrostat"" (ie, the serum TSH is not suppressed to reference range even with supraphysiologic replacement of levothyroxine). The primary therapeutic goal in patients with congenital hypothyroidism is to maintain the free serum T4 level within the high end of the reference range without resulting in symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid hormones only should be used as replacement therapy in children with hypothyroidism. In active form, thyroid hormone influences growth and maturation of tissues, metabolism, and development. It does not enhance final adult height in euthyroid children. Synthetic drug identical to human T4. Adjust dose on basis of total T4 and TSH (if primary hypothyroidism) or free T4 (if secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism); target range is normal total or free T4, with TSH < 5 mcU/mL. Use a single brand to avoid variations in potency between brands. Several commercial preparations are available and share equal efficacy, despite different potency. With age, dose decreases on a weight basis, although daily dose approximates 100 mcg/m2, IV dose is approximately 40-50% of the PO dose. Once euthyroid, infants with congenital hypothyroidism should be observed every 3 months until they are aged 3 years. Thereafter, these children can be evaluated every 6 months. Levothyroxine is the appropriate replacement therapy for all clinically significant forms of hypothyroidism (see Medical Care). Screening of newborns for hypothyroidism is required by law in all 50 US states. One preventable cause of congenital hypothyroidism is avoidance of administration of radioiodine to women who are pregnant.[7] Thus, women should undergo pregnancy testing before receiving radioiodine. The etiology of adverse clinical outcomes is multifactorial. Even with optimal therapy, some children with congenital hypothyroidism display intelligence quotient values lower than would be expected on the basis of genetic potential. Factors associated with this adverse outcome include a markedly low T4 value at birth, a markedly delayed bone age at diagnosis, delay in treatment, and low serum T4 levels during the first year of therapy. The prognosis for patients with congenital hypothyroidism that is appropriately treated within 6 weeks of birth is excellent. Children with acquired hypothyroidism who receive adequate treatment at least 5 years before the onset of puberty typically achieve a final adult height consistent with their genetic potential. Overtreating with thyroid hormone does not enhance catch-up growth and may compromise final adult height by advancing osseous maturation.  Clinical Assistant Professor, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, University of Arizona College of Medicine Sunil Kumar Sinha, MD is a member of the following medical societies: American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, Endocrine Society, Pediatric Endocrine SocietyDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.  Director, The Thyroid Center, Division of Endocrinology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Andrew J Bauer, MD is a member of the following medical societies: American Academy of Pediatrics, American Thyroid Association, Pediatric Endocrine Society, Endocrine SocietyDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.  Adjunct Associate Professor, University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Pharmacy; Editor-in-Chief, Medscape Drug ReferenceDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.

The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland that site in the neck under the Adam's apple. It regulates the body's metabolism by sending thyroid hormone to the organs through the blood. Two conditions, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) and an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) can result when the thyroid isn't working right. An overactive thyroid gland generates too much thyroid hormone, which speeds up metabolism. Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: The first line of treatment for an overactive thyroid gland is drug therapy. If that doesn't resolve the problem, a dose of radioactive iodine may fix the problem by destroying thyroid cells. Sometimes the treatment damages so much of the gland that it can't produce enough thyroid hormone and it becomes necessary to take thyroid hormone. Surgery to remove some of the thyroid gland can be an option when other treatments don't work or aren't advisable. An underactive thyroid gland doesn't generate enough thyroid hormone. This condition, which slows metabolism, is increasingly common with age. It can also be caused by Hashimoto's disease, a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the thyroid gland, or by thyroiditis, an inflammation of the gland. Hypothyroidism is usually treated by taking thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which your body makes too much thyroid hormone. It is also called overactive thyroid. Thyroid hormones are made by the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located in the lower front of the neck. Thyroid hormones regulate the body's energy. When levels of thyroid hormones are unusually high, the body burns energy faster and many vital functions speed up. Many women are reporting symptoms they believe are associated with their breast implants. Sometimes called breast implant illness, this combination of vague symptoms—such as hair loss, fatigue, anxiety, and depression—is also associated with a number of other conditions, including menopause, thyroid problems, and autoimmune conditions. Researchers are now working with patient advocacy groups to better understand the problem. Experts recommend that women understand the potential risks and benefits of breast implants before having the surgical procedure. Thyroid Nuclear Medicine Tests (Thyroid Scan and Uptake) There are two types of thyroid nuclear medicine tests. Both assess the health of your thyroid, a gland in your neck. The first type, a thyroid scan, produces a picture of the gland. It can spot lumps or inflammation, or to investigate the cause of an overactive thyroid. The second type, a radioactive iodine uptake test, is performed to see if your thyroid is functioning normally and to determine why thyroid hormone levels may be elevated. For both types of test, a small amount of a weakly radioactive substance, known as a radionuclide, is either injected into a vein or given to you as a pill. A thyroid scan is usually ordered when a physical examination or laboratory finding suggests that the thyroid is enlarged or has a lump (called a thyroid nodule). If laboratory tests show an overactive thyroid, a radioactive iodine uptake test may be ordered at the same time to evaluate thyroid function. If there is any chance that you are pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding, let your doctor know: radionuclides could harm a developing fetus or your nursing baby. Your doctor has other ways of diagnosing the problem, such as ordering additional blood tests or a thyroid ultrasound. A low thyroid hormone level (hypothyroidism) can harm the heart and requires treatment. Treating borderline cases of hypothyroidism (known as subclinical hypothyroidism) is common but controversial. Many other things, including insufficient sleep and lack of exercise, can cause the most common symptoms of low thyroid hormone: fatigue and weight gain. Levothyroxine, the treatment for hypothyroidism, must be taken an hour before eating or taking supplements. Failing to follow those rules or skipping doses can lead to dosage adjustments and possible overtreatment. Overtreatment can raise thyroid levels too high, increasing the risk of atrial fibrillation.  A recent study suggests that the average person with subclinical hypothyroidism does not benefit from taking thyroid hormone pills. An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can cause a fast heartbeat, trouble sleeping, and weight loss. In some people, the condition may trigger the heart rhythm disorder known as atrial fibrillation. Thyroid disorders and heart conditions: What’s the connection? Thyroid disorders are often overlooked as the cause of heart problems. An underactive thyroid may cause blood pressure problems, a slow heart rate, an increase in cholesterol, an increase in fluid around the heart, and heart failure. An overactive thyroid can cause the heart to beat faster, which can lead to palpitations or an irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation (afib). Treating the thyroid may help relieve symptoms and may reverse some heart conditions. However, it’s very difficult to reverse afib in someone with ongoing hyperthyroidism.  About one-fourth of women over 60 have low levels of thyroid hormone, which might not cause symptoms yet still raise “bad” cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease. A thyroid test is a good idea for women at risk. Is thyroid hormone causing my recent mood changes? Hyperthyroidism can cause anxiety, irritability, and agitation. It can also raise blood pressure, increase the risk of heart failure, and accelerate bone loss. The thyroid gland secretes hormones that regulate metabolism and energy levels. When it produces too little thyroid hormone, the heart can lose pumping strength, and cholesterol and blood pressure rise. Too much thyroid hormone can cause the heart to race and raises the risk of developing heart failure. Anyone with heart disease who has the symptoms of thyroid trouble should see their cardiologist or primary care doctor for simple blood test.

a3856f2b-7f96-4925-8e54-3064e9d9d5bb,"underactive thyroid issues: hi on here again i do... - Thyroid UK hi on here again i do not understand my thyroid at all and have posted here few times but no wiser. I've had it for about 10 years and take 225 mg but feel terrible most of time just getting over bout of depression as a result. I've tried to be referred to endocrine but doctor won't do it. please look at my results and give me some advice You don’t have any useful thyroid blood test result there, just TSH, which if you felt well would be OK, but because you don’t, you need more testing of the specific thyroid hormones free T3 and free T4. You will have todo this privately. Blue Horizon and Medicheck both offer full thyroid panels. To have this condition for 10 years, felt unwell for 10 years and not done your research is a little lax. You can’t rely on GP’s for this. Start with the book Your Thyroid and how to Look After it by Dr Barry Durant Peatfield. It’s available on Amazon and is a good entry level introduction in easy format. So I would advise you buy one of the private blood tests for a full set of results and read the book. Come back with your test results and their reference ranges. Make sure your blood test is taken first thing in the morning. Eat nothing and drink only water from the night before. Don’t take your Levothyroxine until after your blood test is finished. With a stubborn GP you are going to have to help yourself. This is the start. Better things lie ahead. A TSH alone is not evidence of a problem with your thyroid gland, you need a Full Thyroid Hormone test, which is TSH, T4, T3, Free T4, Free T3 and thyroid antibodies. Doctors only look at the TSH alone and if low, like yours, believes there's no problem with your gland The fact that tsh means Thyroid Stimulating Hormone and is from the Pituitary Gland I think they're completely unaware. You can get a private test through one of our private labs who do home pin-prick finger blood tests. If you decide, you should make sure you are well hydrated a couple of days before draw and make sure your hands/arms are warm so it is easier all round. Before blood tests and levothyroxine replaced NDT (which contain all of the hormones) we were diagnosed upon clinical symptoms alone and given a trial of NDT. If we improved we were hypo and stayed on NDT for life with adjustments when necessary. That important skill of knowing clinical symptoms has now been lost through the insistence that a TSH and T4 reveal all. Not so. When deciding to do a private test (or even one at GPs). It has to be at the earlist possible time, fasting (you can drink water) and allow a gap of 24 hours between last dose of thyroid hormones and the test and take afterwards. If GP hasn't also tested B12, Vit D, iron, ferritin and folate ask for these at the same time. Deficiencies can also cause symptoms and all have to be optimal to give thyroid hormone replacements a chance of success. thyroiduk.org.uk/tuk/testing/interpretation_thyroid_blood_tests.html T4 is an inactive hormone. T3 is the only Active hormone and if low we will not feel well as our millions of T3 receptor cells need T3. T4 should convert to T3 but not always effectively. Always get a print-out with the ranges and post for comments. Sometimes DIY improves our health more quickly. thank you ill book some private blood tests can you recommend a company please These are the 2 most commonly used companies that are used on here..... They often have deals on Thursdays for people with thyroid problems. I have taken you to this page because the Thyroid check plus 11 is very popular and tests all this. The ferritin, folate and B12 are essential for the body to be able to convert and utilise T4/T3: You get a lot of ""bang for your buck"" and will find out if you have Hashimoto's (the commonest form of hypothyroidism and auto-immune related). This will give you many answers and there is a lot that we can do for ourselves as GP's are given so little training on thyroid issues...""It will all be better when you take this pill daily"". If only it was that simple! I do this test once a year and thankfully my GP is open to accepting the results and adds them to my notes. Some GP's are more sniffy which is rather odd as both labs are used by private doctors and some NHS work. I'm afraid a lot of this condition is down to Go Your Own Way. It does help when you feel a bit more in control too with lots of help and advice from this terrific forum. ok thank you for the advice I'm going to send for private testing out and take it from there ill post my results when I get them. many thanks For full Thyroid evaluation you need TSH, FT4, FT3 plus TPO and TG thyroid antibodies and also very important to test vitamin D, folate, ferritin and B12 Private tests are available. Thousands on here forced to do this as NHS often refuses to test FT3 or antibodies or vitamins Medichecks Thyroid plus ultra vitamin or Blue Horizon Thyroid plus eleven are the most popular choice. DIY finger prick test or option to pay extra for private blood draw. Both companies often have money off offers. All thyroid tests should ideally be done as early as possible in morning and fasting. When on Levothyroxine, don't take in the 24 hours prior to test, delay and take straight after test. This gives highest TSH, lowest FT4 and most consistent results. (Patient to patient tip, GP will be unaware) If antibodies are high this is Hashimoto's, (also known by medics here in UK more commonly as autoimmune thyroid disease). About 90% of all hypothyroidism in Uk is due to Hashimoto's. Low vitamins are especially common with Hashimoto's. Food intolerances are very common too, especially gluten. So it's important to get TPO and TG thyroid antibodies tested at least once . months later, the second time my GP asked me to reduce the dosage to 125mcg, I again ended up in... Hi? I've underactive thyroid for a long time. Ive been very ill for months but now I'm terribly... all this...will try to keep it as brief as possible! have been taking levothyroxine for over 10 years now and my results are fine (due for another blood... blood results and put on here (just been to doc and got my anti depressant dose increased).

e1c1a44f-a3c0-44fa-aa02-07cdd40fc287,"Thyroid - life and death: A heart-breaking story... - Thyroid UK A heart-breaking story - and one which has a stunning mention of thyroid medication: A lawyer for Hailu's father Fanuel Gebreyes lost a bid to stop brain electroencephalogram, or EEG, tests until after Hailu receives additional thyroid treatments that could boost her metabolism and better measure her condition. He wants the judge to order her father to consent to another round of brain wave tests to determine if they satisfy the state's criteria for clinical death. Gebreyes has refused, instead insisting she be given thyroid medication and a tracheostomy so she can receive nutrition through her throat, not just fluids through an IV. The reporting leaves me gasping - as it doesn't ask the right questions or provide the needed answers. It reads as if Hailu is not being given thyroid medication - but it isn't clear whether she was on any before the operation, or perhaps some medics are thinking it could be an additional thing to try. Helvella, tragic situation. Would have been helpful if the article explained whether, or how, improving metabolism with thyroid replacement and tube feeding rather than IV feeding could improve low brain activity. I did a quick search but didn't find anything that added much. Sometimes with this type of reporting, a better report appears at some point. I was rather surprised it was a UK paper where I first saw it. Perhaps to do with press times and the timing of the release of information. I think she was on thyroid hormone replacement before the op, because it says : ""Doherty said she didn't have any evidence to conclude continued thyroid treatment would significantly alter results of tests to determine brain activity."" 'Continued thyroid treatment' suggests she was on it previously. And it seems to me that is she needed it before, she's only going to get worse in the future, without it. absolutely, definitely don’t have a thyroid problem. She herself has thyroid problems.

During embryogenesis, primordial thyroid cells arise from epithelial cells on the pharyngeal floor; they then migrate caudally to fuse with the ventral aspect of the fourth pharyngeal pouch by 4 weeks' gestation. The thyroid continues to develop anteriorly to the third tracheal cartilage. Thyroglobulin is produced by 8 weeks' gestation. Trapping of iodine occurs by 10-12 weeks' gestation, followed by the synthesis of iodothyronines. Colloid formation and pituitary secretion of thyrotropin, also termed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), occur by the 12 weeks' gestation. The primary function of the thyroid gland is synthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Pituitary thyrotropin regulates thyroid hormone production. TSH synthesis and secretion are stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is synthesized by the hypothalamus and is secreted into the hypophyseal portal vasculature for transport to the anterior pituitary gland. Serum T4 concentration modulates secretion of both TRH and TSH by means of a classic negative feedback loop. Circulating T4 is predominantly bound to T4-binding globulin (TBG). T4 is deiodinated in peripheral tissue to T3, the more bioactive thyroid hormone. T3 carries 3-4 times the metabolic potency of T4, freely enters cells, and binds to receptors of the hormone into the cell nucleus. Thyroid hormone exerts profound effects on the regulation of gene transcription. Some major clinical phenomena of thyroid hormone action include differentiation of the CNS and maintenance of muscle mass. Thyroid hormone also controls skeletal growth and differentiation and metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and vitamins. Thyroid hormone synthesis absolutely requires iodine. Dietary iodine deficiency is endemic in several areas of the world, particularly high mountain plateaus. In the United States, supplementation of salt with iodine has nearly eliminated dietary deficiency of this essential element. The recommended dietary allowance of iodine is 40-50 mcg daily in infants, 70-120 mcg daily for children, and 150 mcg daily for adolescents and adults. The daily intake in North America varies from 240 mcg to more than 700 mcg. In the thyroid gland, iodide is trapped, transported, and concentrated in the follicular lumen for thyroid hormone synthesis. Before trapped iodide can react with tyrosine residues, it must be oxidized by thyroidal peroxidase. Iodination of tyrosine forms mono-iodotyrosine and di-iodotyrosine. Two molecules of di-iodotyrosine combine to form T4, and one molecule of mono-iodotyrosine combines with one molecule of di-iodotyrosine to form T3. Formed thyroid hormones are stored within thyroglobulin in the lumen of the thyroid follicle until release. TSH stimulates uptake and organification of iodide as well as liberation of T4 and T3 from thyroglobulin. is among the most common endocrine diseases. Congenital hypothyroidism most commonly results from agenesis, dysplasia, or ectopy of the thyroid; however, it is also caused by autosomal recessive defects in the organification of iodine (thyroid hormone synthesis) and defects in other enzymatic steps in T4 synthesis and release. In older children and adults, acquired hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by autoimmune destruction (Hashimoto thyroiditis). Congenital hypothyroidism has a frequency of 1 case per 1500-3000 live births. Hypothyroidism can be congenital. Thyroid dysgenesis affects 1 per 4000 newborns worldwide. Hypothalamic or pituitary insufficiency, which results in secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, respectively, affects 1 per 60,000-140,000 newborns worldwide. Hypothyroidism can be acquired. Depending on the criteria used for diagnosis, as many as 10% of young females are estimated to have some signs of autoimmune thyroid disease, usually chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT). Not all cases progress to frank hypothyroidism; however, these patients remain at an increased risk compared with the general population. Untreated congenital hypothyroidism in early infancy results in profound growth failure and disrupted development of the CNS, leading to developmental cognitive delay (cretinism). Untreated hypothyroidism in older children leads to growth failure as well as slowed metabolism and impaired memory. In descending order, thyroid dysgenesis occurs more frequently in Hispanics than in whites, followed by blacks. Thyroid dysgenesis occurs more frequently in females than in males, with a female-to-male ratio of 2:1. CLT also has a 4:1 female-to-male preponderance in childhood. Congenital hypothyroidism can present with goiter at birth or with the gradual development of symptoms over the first several months of life.The age of symptom onset is unpredictable in a child who has thyroid dysgenesis with a hypoplastic and/or ectopic thyroid gland because initial increases in TSH may be able to initially overcome the relative insufficiency of the thyroid gland. CLT typically presents during adolescence; however, it may present any time in life. Aversa T, Valenzise M, Corrias A, Salerno M, De Luca F, Mussa A, et al.

Understanding them and knowing what is normal for our stage of life helps us learn what to look out for when things go wrong.  Find out about the system that governs your hormone production and learn about what hormones are and what they do. Hormones are chemical messengers which move through the body co-ordinating a multitude of bodily processes. Each hormone targets a different part of the body and has a very specific job to do. Target cells are equipped with receptors that the hormone binds to; this creates a biological reaction which has an effect on the body. A hormone cannot bind to a cell unless it has receptors for it, but cells can have receptors for many different hormones. Your hormones are responsible for many body functions, including growth, metabolism, reproduction and homeostasis (maintaining the body’s internal balance). There are 3 types of hormone – protein (or peptide) based, lipid-based and amino acid-based. These include follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and the “feel good” hormone oxytocin. These are the steroid hormones which are formed from cholesterol and structurally are very similar. They include oestradiol and testosterone. These are simple molecules which are not fat-soluble – they include the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine and melatonin. The endocrine glands are responsible for releasing hormones into the bloodstream so that they can travel to the target cells and create a biological response. The endocrine system is a tightly regulated system that manages the release of hormones and their effects on the body. It operates in a signalling “feedback-loop” so that the release of hormones can be increased or slowed down to maintain their effects at just the right level. There are 10 main glands in the endocrine system – the hypothalamus, the pituitary, the adrenals, the thyroid, the ovaries, the testes, the pancreas, the parathyroid, the pineal and the thymus. Each has a very specific role to play in the body - we’ll take a look at each of them and what they do in the following chapters. Ever wondered what keeps your body from over-heating or why you get thirsty? This little area set deep in your brain has the answers. Buried deep in the brain, the hypothalamus is responsible for homeostasis (keeping the body in balance) and hormones. Read on to find out more about its role in the body and about the hormones it produces and controls. The hypothalamus is a small area of the brain which is located between the pituitary gland and the thalamus. Its main role is to keep the body in healthy balance (homeostasis) by releasing hormones to stimulate or inhibit other hormones which govern bodily processes. The hypothalamus is part of the feedback loop which tells the body whether to produce more or less of a certain hormone to keep the body in balance. The hypothalamus is responsible for the processes which regulate: There are two types of hormones produced by the hypothalamus – those that travel to the pituitary where they are released directly into the bloodstream (oxytocin and anti-diuretic hormone), and those that travel to the pituitary where they control the production and release of further hormones which stimulate other parts of the endocrine system. - ADH (or vasopressin) controls the reabsorption of water into the blood from the kidneys. - CRH controls the release of ACTH (see next chapter) by the pituitary gland to regulate the production of adrenal hormones. - GRH stimulates the release of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary gland. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)/Growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH) GHRH and GHIH stimulate the release or inhibition of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. Growth hormone controls the growth and repair of cells throughout our lives. - Oxytocin is the hormone that stimulates the womb to contract during labour and the release of milk for breastfeeding. Prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH)/Prolactin inhibiting hormone (PIH) - PRH and PIH control the release or inhibition of prolactin by the pituitary gland. Prolactin stimulates the production of breast milk. - TRH stimulates the release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland. TSH controls the production of thyroid hormones which regulate metabolism. Problems with the hypothalamus are often caused by trauma to the brain either through a head injury or surgery, or by tumours which are in or close to the hypothalamus and affect its functioning. Other causes of hypothalamus disorders can be genetic or can be caused by malnutrition (including eating disorders such as anorexia), or infection and inflammation of the brain. What are the symptoms of hypothalamus dysfunction? The hypothalamus has a wide role in the body, therefore a disorder of the hypothalamus can have many consequences which can make it difficult to diagnose. The hypothalamus is part of a communication system with the pituitary gland which in turn controls hormone production in other hormone glands. Hypothalamus dysfunction can be difficult to distinguish from pituitary dysfunction, and both can cause the same symptoms as disorders of the other endocrine glands e.g. thyroid or adrenal disorders. Diagnosis of a hypothalamic disorder made after a combination of clinical examination including eye tests and brain imaging to detect any lesions, as well as hormone blood tests to measure levels of circulating hormones. Low levels of hormones can be treated with hormone replacement therapy while surgery may be necessary to remove any physical pressure on the gland. How are hormones turned on and off? Learn how the pituitary gland is the conductor of the endocrine orchestra and what happens when your hormones get our of synch.  It may be small, but the pituitary gland is the “master gland” of the endocrine system, signalling endocrine glands all over the body to increase or decrease their hormone production. Learn more about how the pituitary gland controls hormone production and what can happen if things go wrong. The pituitary gland is a small pea-sized gland located in the base of the brain. It is often referred to as the “master gland” as it controls the production of hormones in most of the endocrine glands in the body. The pituitary gland has two lobes which are connected to the hypothalamus gland by a stalk. The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland is responsible for producing the hormones which signal other hormone glands to increase or decrease hormone production. These hormones include: - ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, a steroid hormone which influences many different processes around the body including metabolism and immune response. ACTH levels are highest in the morning and gradually decline during the day. - FSH is an important reproductive hormone. In women, it stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles (eggs) in the ovaries and in men, the testes to produce sperm. In women, FSH levels rise as the number of viable eggs declines with age. Elevated FSH is a marker for menopause in women. - Growth hormone is produced in the anterior gland of the pituitary where it is released into the bloodstream. It acts on many cells in the body, working to stimulate growth and cell reproduction and repair. Growth hormone, also known as human growth hormone (HGH) rises in childhood and declines from middle age. - LH is a gonadotrophic hormone, essential for the reproductive health of men and women. In men, it stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone. In women, it plays a role in the menstrual cycle and preparing the body for pregnancy – stimulating the ovaries to produce oestradiol in the first half of the cycle and the corpus luteum to produce progesterone in the second half. A surge in LH triggers the ovary to release an egg (ovulation) mid-way through the menstrual cycle. - MSH is the name for a group of hormones which have a range of functions, from stimulating the production of melanin in the skin (pigmentation) to controlling inflammation and appetite. It is produced in the pituitary gland as well as the skin and hypothalamus gland. - Prolactin is the hormone that is responsible for lactation, the production of breast milk. It also has a role in men and women for sexual satisfaction, behaviour and the regulation of immune function. - TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones which govern the body’s metabolic rate, influencing virtually every cell of the body. The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland does not produce hormones but acts as storage and release for oxytocin and anti-diuretic hormone, which are produced in the hypothalamus. As such, it acts as an extension of the hypothalamus gland. As with the hypothalamus, injuries or trauma to the head can cause problems in pituitary function as can tumours in the brain which put pressure on the pituitary gland. By far the most common cause of a pituitary disorder is a tumour of the pituitary gland itself. The vast majority of pituitary tumours are benign (non-cancerous) and some do not have any effect on hormone production (non-functioning tumours). However, some pituitary tumours can cause the over-production of one or more pituitary hormones, while others can cause the suppression of hormone production (hypopituitarism, or underactive pituitary gland). Prolactinoma (too much prolactin caused by a prolactin-producing tumour) Growth hormone deficiency (growth hormone suppression) Diabetes insipidus (suppression of anti-diuretic hormone affecting the kidney’s ability to retain water) What are the effects of hypopituitarism (an underactive pituitary gland)? Problems with your pituitary can affect its ability to produce one or more hormones which can have wide ranging implications for your health, depending on which hormones are affected: Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) – egg and sperm production Luteinising hormone (LH) – menstruation, testosterone production and fertility Growth hormone (GH) – growth in children and a range of issues in adulthood Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) – maintenance of normal metabolism Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) – adrenal function What are the symptoms of a pituitary gland disorder? As the pituitary gland plays such a central role in orchestrating the production and release of many hormones throughout the body and can affect a single or multiple hormone system, the symptoms of a pituitary disorder can be wide-ranging. They can also be confused with other conditions and many pituitary disorders go undiagnosed. Symptoms will vary according to whether the pituitary disorder is causing over or under-production of the affected hormone. Symptoms will depend on which endocrine gland is ultimately affected. Milky discharge from nipples (in both men and women) This list is by no means exhaustive and you should make a note of all symptoms which apply to you so that your doctor can confirm or rule out a pituitary disorder. How is a pituitary disorder diagnosed and treated? A pituitary disorder is diagnosed through a combination of a physical examination (including eye examination and brain imaging to detect tumours) and symptoms as well as hormone blood tests which can detect unusual levels of hormones in the blood. A pituitary disorder is often picked up as an incidental finding on a test even if you are not experiencing symptoms. Many pituitary tumours do not require treatment. However, if the tumour is causing over-production of certain hormones or is putting pressure on the optic nerve, surgery or radiation therapy may be required to remove it. Hormone replacement therapy or hormone blocking treatments can normalise the under-production or over-production of hormones. Rapid heartbeat, sweaty palms, ready to run? Learn about the glands that control your flight or fight response and what happens to your body when you experience stress. Learn about the hormones which govern your stress response and find out why your doctor is unlikely to diagnose you with adrenal fatigue. The adrenal glands are two triangular-shaped glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They are best known for producing the hormones which govern our stress response, but they also have an important role to play in metabolism, the immune function and regulation of blood pressure. The adrenal glands are made up of two parts; the cortex and the medulla, and each is responsible for producing different hormones. The adrenal cortex is the outer part of the adrenal glands and is responsible for producing hormones which are vital for life – the glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens. The adrenal medulla is the inner part of the adrenal glands and is responsible for producing catecholamines, the hormones that are released in our “fight or flight” response. (a glucocorticoid) is the best-known hormone of the adrenal cortex. It has a role in metabolism, signalling the body when to convert fat, proteins and carbohydrates into glucose for energy. It also has an important role to play in the body’s stress response, releasing glucose to provide an energy boost in an emergency, as well as shutting down non-essential bodily functions (digestion, immune function, reproduction) to preserve energy. (a mineralocorticoid) helps the body regulate blood pressure and maintain the level of electrolytes (sodium and potassium) in the blood. are also produced by the adrenal cortex. These are precursor hormones which are converted to male hormones in the testes and to female hormones in the ovaries. Testosterone and oestradiol are also produced in much larger amounts directly in the testes and ovaries. (epinephrine) is a neurotransmitter and hormone which is released into the bloodstream when a person is under stress or in danger with the aim of making them physically more able to deal with the threat, i.e. the fight or flight response. Adrenaline increases blood sugar for energy, causes the heart muscle to contract faster and harder to get more blood to the muscles and the brain, and relaxes the airways to get more oxygen to the lungs. Once the perceived threat has gone, adrenaline levels go back to normal. (norepinephrine) is very similar to adrenaline, but also acts to constrict blood vessels to increase blood pressure in times of stress. Adrenal disorders are usually caused by the over or under-production of adrenal hormones which can be caused by adrenal or pituitary problems. Adrenal disorders include Cushing’s disease and Addison’s disease. Cushing’s disease or Cushing’s syndrome is caused when the body produces too much cortisol. This can be caused by a pituitary disorder (often a tumour) which causes too much ACTH to be produced which overstimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, or by a tumour on the adrenal glands themselves. Cushing’s can also be caused by taking steroid medication, or by an ACTH-producing tumour elsewhere in the body. Cushing’s is rare, and most often affects women between the ages of 30 and 40. Cushing’s disease causes a number of symptoms including: A fatty “hump” on the back of the neck and shoulders Weight gain around the torso (but not arms and legs) Excessive hair growth on the face and body (women) Cushing’s disease can be difficult to diagnose, especially as some of the symptoms are common with other conditions. Typically, diagnosis will be made with a series of tests to measure cortisol production over the course of a day (urine, saliva or blood tests), a physical examination and scans to detect whether there is a pituitary or adrenal tumour. Sometimes a cortisol mimicking drug will be given, which in someone without Cushing’s would cause a reduction in cortisol but has no effect on people with Cushing’s disease. Treatment will depend on what is causing the production of excessive cortisol. This can mean surgery to remove a pituitary or adrenal tumour, or even removal of the adrenal glands themselves, or the gradual reduction of steroid treatment if this has caused the problem. Medication can also be prescribed which suppresses cortisol production, although this is normally a short-term solution. Addison’s disease is also known as adrenal insufficiency and occurs when your adrenal glands don’t produce enough hormones. In primary adrenal insufficiency, the problem is caused by damage to the adrenal cortex, usually because of an autoimmune disease where the body starts attacking its own tissues. Primary adrenal insufficiency affects the production of both cortisol and aldosterone and causes wide ranging symptoms including weight loss, areas of dark skin and low blood pressure. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is normally caused by a pituitary problem (usually a tumour) which results in a reduced production of ACTH which then fails to stimulate the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and androgens (aldosterone is unaffected). Taking steroid medication (e.g. for asthma or rheumatoid arthritis) can also affect adrenal function. The pituitary gland which normally regulates the output of adrenal hormones senses that there are normal levels of steroid hormones in the blood (due to the medication) and stops sending signals to the adrenal glands to make more. This doesn’t usually cause problems until a time of severe stress (when insufficient hormones are released to manage the stress response), or if steroid medication is stopped too quickly. Addison’s disease can develop slowly and in its early stages can be mistaken for other conditions. However, when more advanced, or if symptoms deteriorate sharply (adrenal crisis), Addison’s disease can be life-threatening. Irregular menstrual periods and loss of pubic and underarm hair Addison’s disease is normally diagnosed through a combination of a physical examination, including a blood pressure test to check for low blood pressure, and tests (blood, urine or saliva) to measure levels of adrenal and pituitary hormones. Tests for cortisol, ACTH, aldosterone, DHEA, may all be used to make a diagnosis while tests for sodium, potassium and glucose can help to distinguish between primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. For confirmation, a synacthen stimulation test is performed. Synacthen is a synthetic form of ACTH and should stimulate the adrenal glands to make cortisol. If, after an injection of synacthen adrenal hormones remain low, then adrenal insufficiency is confirmed. An adrenal antibody test can confirm whether an autoimmune disorder is causing the adrenal glands to fail. Addison’s disease or primary adrenal insufficiency is normally treated by replacing the adrenal hormones that are missing. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic hormone which is used to replace the glucocorticoid, cortisol. If aldosterone is also affected then a replacement mineralocorticoid (fludrocortisone) is prescribed alongside a recommendation to increase salt in the diet if needed. As we’ve learned, the adrenal glands are two small glands that sit on top of your kidneys and are responsible for the production of hormones that control your body’s response to stress, in particular cortisol. The theory behind adrenal fatigue is that if you suffer from an acutely stressful event, or suffer from prolonged, chronic stress, then your adrenal glands can become overloaded and ineffective, failing to produce the right amount of cortisol for the demands of the body at the right time of day. Normally, cortisol levels are highest in the morning on waking, and decline naturally through the day until their lowest level, just before bed. This means that we wake with energy and vitality to take on the day ahead, and fall asleep in an easy and relaxed state at bed-time. If the cortisol cycle is broken, then the theory goes that this can lead to you feeling exhausted on waking and alert when you’re supposed to be going to sleep. The symptoms which are attributed to adrenal fatigue are very general and can be experienced with other conditions. Adrenal fatigue would not normally be diagnosed by a conventionally trained doctor. Indeed, the Society of Endocrinologists has stated that adrenal fatigue is not even a medical condition and that there is no evidence that this condition exists. While there are conditions that do affect the adrenal glands like Addison’s Disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) and Cushing’s Syndrome (caused by the over-production of cortisol), there is no evidence that overloading the adrenal glands through stress causes any functional problems which could lead to adrenal insufficiency. In fact, most endocrinologists suggest the opposite, that when the body experiences stress, the adrenal glands increase their production of cortisol rather than reduce it. Adrenal fatigue is much more likely to be diagnosed by an alternative or natural health practitioner than by a GP or endocrinologist. In most cases they will treat it by natural methods such as nutrition and lifestyle, rather than a course of drugs or hormone replacement. They will typically use non-invasive saliva testing to assess cortisol rhythm – cortisol levels that remain flat all day or even rise at bed time would signal to them that the adrenal glands are impaired. What are the risks of being diagnosed with adrenal fatigue? Most alternative practitioners will treat adrenal fatigue through lifestyle changes aimed at reducing stress: establishing a good bedtime routine, getting a full night’s sleep, eating an unprocessed diet rich in vegetables and whole grains, taking time in the day to meditate and re-charge batteries and taking regular moderate exercise. This is sensible advice for anyone who is looking to improve their lifestyle and, because it advocates many healthy habits, can also improve symptoms associated with chronic stress. In some cases, they will recommend the use of supplements containing dried adrenal cortex. This contains the hormone hydrocortisone and can cause symptoms that resemble Cushing’s disease if excessive amounts are taken. However, problems can arise if symptoms which are general and non-specific are attributed to adrenal fatigue when in fact they are early signs of something more serious or of another treatable condition. Conditions that may be attributed to adrenal fatigue because of similar symptoms include anaemia and thyroid problems. Please remember it is also always important to talk to your GP and rule out any more serious conditions before seeking an alternative diagnosis. The testes and the ovaries produce the hormones most likely to change over our lifetimes. From puberty to menopause, learn how these hormones affect libido, fertility and mood.  The testes and the ovaries are both reproductive organs and endocrine glands. Find out about the reproductive hormones they produce and their role in male and female characteristics, the menstrual cycle and fertility. The gonads are the glands in men (testes) and women (ovaries) which are responsible for producing gametes (sperm and eggs) for reproduction as well as the hormones which are responsible for male and female characteristics. They produce many of the same hormones but in different amounts. The ovaries are responsible for producing ova (eggs) as well as manufacturing hormones. The primary hormones produced by the ovaries are oestrogens and progesterone. The ovaries produce 3 types of oestrogen – oestrone (E1), oestradiol (E2) and oestriol (E3). Of these oestradiol (E2) is the most potent; E1 and E3 are weaker forms of oestrogen. Oestrogens play an important role in the development of female secondary sex characteristics, the female reproductive system as well as a host of other bodily functions including bone formation, collagen production and mood regulation. In females, oestrogen levels increase at puberty leading to the development of female secondary sex characteristics such as the development of breasts, the widening of the hips and the growth of pubic and underarm hair. Oestrogen also plays a key role in the menstrual cycle – including the maturing and release of an egg at ovulation and preparing the uterine lining for fertilisation. Oestrogen levels increase in the first half of the menstrual cycle and then decline, triggering menstruation if the egg has not been fertilised. Low levels of oestrogen during menstruation then triggers an increase in FSH to prepare a new egg for ovulation. If an egg is fertilised, oestrogen levels continue to rise throughout pregnancy, developing the placenta to nourish the growing baby and preparing the breasts to produce milk. Oestrogen levels peak in the 3rd trimester and trigger the release of oxytocin by the hypothalamus which causes the womb to contract and labour to begin. Progesterone is a steroid hormone which is made in the corpus luteum (the remains of the follicle after an egg has been released) in the second half of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone prepares the endometrium for implantation and, if implantation is successful, its level rises rapidly to maintain the pregnancy. The corpus luteum continues to make progesterone for the first 8 -12 weeks of pregnancy after which production switches to the placenta. As well as maintaining the health of the placenta to nourish the baby, progesterone causes changes in the body to accommodate the growing baby (e.g. the expansion of the womb and relaxation of ligaments) and prepare for childbirth (e.g. growth of milk ducts in the breasts). If the egg isn’t fertilised the corpus luteum breaks down and the production of progesterone drops, causing the menstrual cycle to start again. Although it is known as the male sex hormone, women also produce small amounts of testosterone both in the adrenal glands and the ovaries. Testosterone causes the bodily characteristics which are considered male, such as the deepening of the voice, growth of muscle, growth of facial hair and libido. In females, testosterone has a role in bone health, breast health, fertility and sex drive. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, also known as PCOS, is a common hormone condition which affects about 1 in 5 women in the UK [1]. PCOS affects a woman’s ovaries, the reproductive organs that are responsible for protecting all the eggs that a woman is born with, and for releasing them into the fallopian tube for fertilisation. The ovaries are also responsible for producing oestrogen and progesterone, the hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle. Normally, a woman’s ovaries produce an egg each month, but with polycystic ovaries (an imbalance in the reproductive hormones that govern ovulation) this process can be disrupted. During the monthly cycle FSH stimulates the ovary to produce a follicle – a sac to contain an egg, and then LH triggers the ovary to release a mature egg. In a woman with PCOS, the ovaries and ovulation process are affected. Its three main features are: In polycystic ovaries, several small, fluid-filled sacs grow inside of the ovaries. These small sacs contain a number of harmless follicles that are up to 8mm in size. Each one of the follicles contains an immature egg which never matures enough to activate ovulation. The absence of ovulation changes the levels of oestrogen, progesterone, FSH and LH, making them lower than usual, while male hormone levels are higher than usual. The exact cause of PCOS remains a mystery, however it often runs in families [2]. It is also believed that an increase of male hormones prevents the ovaries from producing hormones and releasing eggs normally. Factors which are thought to play a role in PCOS include: – women with PCOS often have increased levels of inflammation in their bodies which has been linked to higher levels of androgens [3]. Being overweight can also impact a woman’s inflammation levels. – it has been identified that 70% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance which means their cells can’t use insulin properly [4]. This means that more and more insulin is produced to try to move glucose from the blood into the body’s cells. This elevated insulin is thought to be one of that factors that causes polycystic ovaries to develop. The symptoms of PCOS can vary from person to person. Many women experience very few symptoms, which can lead to some being unaware that they have PCOS. A study found that up to 70% of women with PCOS haven’t been diagnosed [5]. If symptoms are visible, women usually start to notice them around their first period, whilst others may only uncover they have PCOS after they have gained a lot of weight or have had trouble trying to get pregnant. Excessive hair growth – usually on the face, chest or back Difficulty getting pregnant due to irregular ovulation or failure to ovulate PCOS has also been found to increase a woman’s risk of developing health problems in later life, such as type 2 diabetes and elevated cholesterol. Higher levels of androgens can impact your overall health in a variety of ways: - As women with PCOS do not ovulate regularly or at all, the eggs that are required for fertilisation are not released making it difficult to become pregnant. - A study found that women who are obese and have PCOS are 5 to 10 times more likely to develop sleep apnoea than those who don’t have PCOS [6]. The condition causes repeated pauses in breathing during the night, which can affect sleep. - Due to the hormonal changes and the difficulties PCOS presents such as unwanted hair and infertility, women can experience high levels of depression and anxiety [7]. Many women report that getting a diagnosis for PCOS can be a struggle as there is no single test to identify whether you have it. Under NHS guidelines, doctors should confirm that a woman has two or more of the following; Usually your doctor will send you to have an ultrasound scan and a blood test. The ultrasound scan uses sound waves to look for abnormal follicles and other problems with your ovaries and uterus. The blood test will check whether your male hormone levels are higher than normal. There is no cure for PCOS, although symptoms can be managed by making lifestyle changes or taking medication [8]. – treatment for PCOS often starts with lifestyle changes such as weight loss, diet and exercise. Studies have found losing just 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can help regulate your menstrual cycle and improve PCOS symptoms [9]. – several medications can assist in regulating the menstrual cycle and treat PCOS symptoms such as hair growth and acne. Metformin can help to restore the menstrual cycle and Clomiphene, a fertility drug, can help women with PCOS get pregnant. – if taking Clomiphene is not successful, a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) can be performed. This involves using heat or a laser to destroy the tissue in the ovaries that is producing androgens. Menopause occurs when a woman’s reserve of viable eggs runs out and is characterised by a rapid decline in oestrogen. Women can experience fluctuations in oestrogen for years before they stop menstruating altogether, normally around the age of 50. Menopause is defined as no menstruation for a year. The symptoms of the menopause can start up to 10 years before a woman’s final period (perimenopause) and can continue for a decade after. For women of menopausal age, diagnosis is normally made by an assessment of symptoms; menopause is not usually diagnosed with a blood test, as fluctuating hormone levels in the years preceding the menopause can give a misleading diagnosis. However, in women who are experiencing symptoms of menopause before their 45th birthday, a blood test to determine levels of FSH (which will be higher during menopause) and oestradiol (which will be lower) can indicate an early menopause. As the symptoms of menopause are very similar to those of other conditions, especially an underactive thyroid (which is often first diagnosed in women of menopausal age), a thyroid blood test can also help to distinguish between menopausal symptoms and a thyroid disorder. Many women go through the menopause without need for any treatment, but for some women the symptoms are very debilitating and can affect their quality of life. For these women, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can do a lot to relieve symptoms. Most HRT is a combination of oestrogen and progesterone and can be taken by oral tablets, skin patches, gels or pessaries. The primary hormone produced by the testes is testosterone although they also produce small amounts of oestradiol. Testosterone levels increase significantly at puberty which leads to the development of secondary sex characteristics in boys such as lowering of the voice, development of muscle mass, increase in body and facial hair and the enlargement of the penis. Testosterone is responsible for libido, sperm production, mood and muscle mass all through adulthood. Testosterone levels typically peak when a man is in his 40s and then decline by around 1% every year. It is very rare for men to overproduce testosterone; it is far more common to have low testosterone levels than naturally high testosterone. Low testosterone (hypogonadsim) has many causes, typically through damage to the testicles (through injury or chemotherapy), medication or anabolic steroid use, or as a side effect of other conditions such as diabetes, liver disease or obesity. Low testosterone can also be caused by an inherited condition called Klinefelter Syndrome where the male is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome. Late onset hypogonadism is caused by falling levels of testosterone in older men. Reduced muscle mass and inability to gain muscle in the gym Low testosterone is normally diagnosed by an assessment of symptoms and a blood test. As testosterone levels fall during the day, it is normally recommended that testosterone is tested in the morning before 10am. Low testosterone can be treated by reversing any lifestyle factors that may be causing it, e.g. sleeping better, losing weight and reducing alcohol, or by prescribing testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) which can restore testosterone to normal levels. Testosterone can be given orally, through injections or gels. A small amount of oestradiol is made in the testes but testosterone can also be converted to oestradiol in the liver and fat tissues by the action of the aromatase enzyme. Oestradiol plays a role in sexual desire, the ability to achieve an erection as well as sperm production. While all men make oestradiol, in some men levels of oestradiol can be too high causing symptoms such as the growth of breast tissue (gynaecomastia), infertility and erectile dysfunction. High oestradiol in men is often caused by having high levels of testosterone (usually by taking too much TRT or steroid misuse) which leads to more testosterone being converted to oestradiol. It can also be caused by obesity and through exposure to exogenous oestrogens e.g. plastics and phyto-oestrogens in food. High oestradiol may be treated by lifestyle adjustments e.g. losing weight and reducing alcohol consumption as well as keeping testosterone levels within normal levels. If high oestrogen persists you may be prescribed aromatase inhibitors which reduce the amount of testosterone that is converted to oestradiol. “Your endocrine system tightly controls the amount of hormones in your body. If hormones go too high or too low then problems can follow” Dr Sam Rodgers Too hot? Too cold? Losing weight or gaining it? Irritable and moody or just plain tired? Learn about the hormones that can affect your metabolism and overall wellbeing. The thyroid and the parathyroid glands are located next to each other in the neck but, despite their name, that’s really all they have in common. Read on to find out more. The thyroid gland is a butterfly shaped gland which wraps around the windpipe in the throat. It is responsible for producing the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine which affect the metabolic rate of the body. Thyroid hormones impact almost all bodily processes from how fast your heart beats, how much energy you have, how quickly you digest food to how sensitive you are to heat and cold. Elevated thyroid hormones cause your metabolism to run to fast (hyperthyroidism) and insufficient levels cause your metabolism to run too slowly (hypothyroidism). - Thyroxine is the primary hormone produced by the thyroid gland but it has little direct influence on the body’s cells. It is a prohormone for triiodothyronine (T3) which is the more biologically active thyroid hormone. Thyroxine is converted to T3 in the liver and other organs of the body. - Only around 20% of T3 is produced by the thyroid gland itself – the rest is converted from T4 by the deiodinase enzymes. T3 is the more biologically active thyroid hormone which directly affects the body’s metabolism. Autoimmune conditions cause the vast majority of thyroid disorders. In an autoimmune condition, the body mistakenly identifies its own cells as “foreign” and begins attacking them. In the case of a thyroid disorder, this autoimmune attack can cause the thyroid gland to over-produce thyroid hormone (Graves’ disease) which speeds up the metabolism, or destroys thyroid tissue which reduces its ability to produce thyroid hormones causing the metabolism to slow down (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis). In secondary thyroid disease, the problem does not lie with the thyroid gland itself, but with the signalling gland – the pituitary. A tumour in, or surrounding, the pituitary gland can cause thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to be over-produced which in turn stimulates the over-production of thyroid hormones (secondary hyperthyroidism). TSH can also be under-produced causing the under-production of thyroid hormones (secondary hypothyroidism). Thyroid hormones affect almost every cell in the body and have wide-reaching effects on all of the body’s processes. Classic symptoms of an overactive thyroid include a faster heartbeat, sensitivity to heat, losing weight and diarrhoea, while an underactive thyroid causes the opposite – a slower heartbeat, sensitivity to cold, weight gain and constipation. Thyroid disease is normally diagnosed through an assessment of symptoms alongside a thyroid function blood test. A thyroid function blood test normally tests for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and sometimes, but not always, free triiodothyronine (FT3). An overactive thyroid is normally treated by anti-thyroid medication such as carbimazole – or by removing or destroying all or part of the thyroid gland through surgery or radioactive iodine treatment. After the thyroid gland has been destroyed or removed, thyroid replacement hormones will need to be taken for life. An underactive thyroid is treated by replacing the hormones that are no longer being produced by the thyroid gland. In most cases, this is achieved by replacing T4 (levothyroxine) which then converts into T3 as normal. In some people who don’t convert T4 to T3 effectively, a combination of T4 and T3 (liothyronine) will be prescribed. What are the parathyroid glands and what do they do? Despite their name, the parathyroid glands have nothing to do with producing thyroid hormones; their name refers to the fact that they are located behind the thyroid gland in the neck. There are four parathyroid glands, each the size of a grain of rice, that are responsible for regulating calcium in the body. Calcium is a very important element in the human body and is necessary not only for strong bones and teeth, but also for the functioning of the nervous and muscular systems by providing electrical energy. - The sole job of the parathyroid gland is to regulate calcium within a tight range by the release of parathyroid hormone. If the glands sense that the level of calcium in the blood is too low they will release parathyroid hormone which extracts calcium from the bones. If they detect excess calcium in the blood they will stop the production of PTH. Hyperparathyroidism is the most common condition of the parathyroid glands and is normally caused by a benign tumour affecting one or more of the glands. This causes them to over-produce parathyroid hormone which means the body extracts more calcium from the bones than it needs and blood levels of calcium rise. The condition affects mostly women and is likely to be diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 60. Hypoparathyroidism, where the body produces insufficient amounts of parathyroid hormone, is rare. It can develop if the parathyroid glands are damaged during surgery on the thyroid gland. Symptoms of high levels of calcium in the blood can come on suddenly or can develop over several years and are not always related to calcium levels. Some people can experience debilitating symptoms with only slightly raised blood calcium levels. Many of the symptoms are non-specific and may be confused with other conditions, especially if they are mild. The effects of elevated calcium levels are progressive meaning that symptoms like osteoporosis will get worse the longer the condition remains untreated. A diagnosis is made through the combination of an assessment of symptoms and a test to measure that amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium in the blood. Treatment may begin with medication to lower calcium levels, but normally surgery is required to remove the affected parathyroid gland. From diabetes, your sleep-wake cycle to your immune function, these endocrine glands are vital to long-term health. Read on to understand why. Find out about the endocrine glands that help metabolise food for energy, govern your circadian rhythm and turn your immature immune cells into mature, disease fighting T cells. The pancreas is an abdominal organ which is responsible for producing enzymes that aid digestion as well as producing the hormones insulin and glucagon to regulate blood sugar. - Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas when blood sugar (glucose) levels rise after eating and is necessary to get glucose from the blood into cells for energy. Insulin attaches to the body’s cells which “unlocks” them to absorb glucose. Insulin also enables excess glucose to be stored in the liver for future use. - Glucagon is produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas when it senses that blood glucose levels are too low. It signals to the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream while at the same time reducing glucose consumption by the liver to retain as much as possible in the blood. The main condition which affects the ability of the pancreas to produce hormones is an autoimmune condition called type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the beta cells in the pancreas and impairs its ability to produce insulin. Type 1 diabetes is different from type 2 diabetes (diabetes mellitus), which normally develops later in life and is caused by the body’s cells becoming resistant to the effects of insulin. In both types of diabetes, glucose levels in the blood can become dangerously high –hyperglycaemia. Diabetes is normally diagnosed through a test to measure the amount of glucose in the blood or urine. A blood test may measure glucose levels after a fast overnight or may measure the amount of glucose that has attached the haemoglobin in the blood which gives a better long-term picture of blood glucose levels. Type 1 diabetes is commonly diagnosed in childhood, whereas type 2 diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in older adults and is usually lifestyle related – associated with obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet. People with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin to control their blood sugar for the rest of their lives. In its early stages, type 2 diabetes or prediabetes may be controlled through lifestyle changes, in particular weight loss, a low-calorie diet and more exercise. Medications to lower blood sugar may also be prescribed (e.g. metformin). The longer someone has type 2 diabetes, the higher the probability that they will progress to need insulin to control their blood sugar in the future. The pineal gland is a small gland situated deep in the brain which is shaped like a pine-cone (from which it gets its name). The pineal gland governs the circadian rhythms of the body through the production of the hormone melatonin. - Melatonin is responsible for governing the sleep-wake cycles of the body. It is sensitive to light, switching off production in daylight to promote wakefulness and producing higher levels when it is dark which promotes sleep. Night-time levels of melatonin are at least 10 times greater than during the day. The pineal gland can develop benign cysts and sometimes tumours. Pineal tumours are very rare but are most frequently diagnosed in children and adults under 40 years old. They normally require surgery to remove them. Overproduction or underproduction of melatonin can affect the sleep cycle and can also impact mood. Chronic stress and a poor diet are also thought to impact the production of melatonin which can disrupt your sleep wake cycle. Tryptophan, an essential amino acid from food, is the precursor to melatonin and a diet low in tryptophan can supress melatonin levels. However, the main factor to affect melatonin production is light at night; even the dim light caused by a phone or computer in the bedroom can affect melatonin production. Improvements in lifestyle like removing any source of light from the bedroom, managing stress, and eating foods rich in tryptophan (such as seeds, pulses, chocolate, oats, dates and dairy products) can improve melatonin levels. Melatonin supplements are also available and are often used by people who fly frequently to manage jet lag. The thymus is both an endocrine (hormone producing) and lymphatic gland. It is glandular tissue that is located in the upper body behind the breastbone in the thoracic cavity. The thymus has an important role in immune function and is responsible for “training” T cells to fight infection by bacteria, viruses and fungi – T cells are also important in protecting the body against cancer. It is most active during childhood – by puberty the body has almost all the T cells it needs. The thymus continues shrinking through adulthood with glandular tissue being replaced by fat. The thymus produces thymosin, a hormone that stimulates the development of T cells. Problems with the thymus gland are associated with its immune function as opposed to its endocrine function. The three most common disorders of the thymus include myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune condition which attacks muscle receptors causing muscle weakness, red cell aplasia, when the immune system attacks the stem cells that form blood cells, and hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition where the body doesn’t make enough antibodies.

Thyroxine is naturally secreted by the follicular cells of the thyroid gland. Levothyroxine is used for the treatment of thyroid hormone deficiency, and rarely for the prevention of thyroid cancer recurrence. In the past, its related compound Dextrothyroxine was used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia but it was withdrawn due to cardiac side effects. Accordiong to the WHO’s Essential List of Drugs, it is on of the the most important medicine needed in a basic health system. Levothyroxine is also used for the prevention of kidney and eye complications in people who have diabetes. The drug is available under generic name: Most common Brand names are: Euthyrox, Synthroid, Levothroid, Levoxyl, Levoxine, Levothyrox, Letrox, Tirosint, and Unithroid. This drug can be also used in combination with other drug such as: (containing Levothyroxine and Liothyronine) What is the source of the drug (natural or synthetic)? Levothyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone. Chemically it is a chiral molecule in the L-form which is identical to natural thyroid prohormone thyroxine – T4. Levothyroxine is used as supplemental or replacement therapy in acquired or congenital hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism in recovery phase period of subacute thyroiditis. Specific indications include: thyroidal (primary), pituitary (secondary), hypothalamic (tertiary) hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Primary hypothyroidism may result from partial or total congenital absence of the thyroid gland, functional deficiency, primary atrophy, or from the effects of surgery, drugs, radiation, with or without the presence of goiter. Patients with hypothyroidism often require lifelong thyroid hormone therapy In the prevention or treatment of different types of euthyroid goiters including thyroid nodules, subacute or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), multinodular goiter and, for surgery and radioiodine therapy in the treatment of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated . It is also used for the treatment of decompensated hypothyroidism or myxedema coma and stupor. Pharmacophore structure: Information about the chemical structure of the drug Levothyroxine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as diphenylethers, aromatic molecules containing two benzene rings that are linked to each other with an ether group. Levothyroxine sodium is an almost white or slightly brownish-yellow powder, or a fine, crystalline powder, which is very slightly soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol 96%. It dissolves in dilute solutions of alkali hydroxides. Levothyroxine sodium has melting point on 235.5 °C What are the different dosage forms and strengths of the drug Levothyroxine is available in following forms and doses: Capsule (13, 25, 50, 75, 88, 100, 112, 125, 137, and 150 ug), Liquid (500 mcg), Powder for Solution (200 and 500 mcg) and Tablets (100mcg, 100ug, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0,1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.0088, 0.01 mg) How the Levothyroxine medicine works (mode of action) Levothyroxine is a synthetically levo-isomer of thyroxine (also known as tetraiodothyronine or T4), which is the main hormone of the thyroid gland. Thyroglobulin releases thyroxine by proteolysis and then hormone is secreted into the blood. Peripherally, Thyroxine is deiodinated to the form of triiodothyronine (T3) which has a wide spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism. Thyroid hormones increases the metabolic rate of cells of all tissues in the body. Thyroid hormone is very significant for the growth and development of all tissues including bones and the brain in the fetus and newborn. In adults, thyroid hormone helps to maintain food metabolism, brain function, and body temperature but also has many indirect effects. The main symptoms of thyroid deficiency relieved by levothyroxine include lack of energy, slow speech, hair loss, dry thick skin, weight gain, and unusual sensitivity to cold. Levothyroxine acts by imitating the effects of endogenous thyroid hormone thyroxine – T4, which is a tetra-iodinated tyrosine derivative. T4 is converted to T3 (the active metabolite) in the liver and kidney. Thyroid hormones attach to thyroid hormone binding proteins, thyroxin-binding globulin, and thyroxin-binding prealbumin (transthyretin) in order to increase solubility. After that, protein complex is transported to cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell where complex is binding to the thyroid hormone receptors. So by levothyroxine acting as a replacement for natural thyroxine, deficiency symptoms are relieved. Levothyroxine usually comes as a tablet or a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually used once a day on an empty stomach, one half to 1 hour before breakfast. Patients should follow prescribed directions carefully, and ask their doctor or pharmacist any part they do not understand. They should take levothyroxine exactly as directed. They should not take more or less of it or take it more frequently than doctor recommendations. Capsules should be swallowed. Capsules should not be chewed or crushed. The tablets may get stuck throat or cause gagging or choking; therefore, the tablet should be taken with a full glass of water. If levothyroxine is given to an infant, child, or adult who cannot swallow the tablet, the tablet should be crushed and mixed in 1 to 2 teaspoons of plain water. This drug should be taken at least 4 hours before or after administration of other drugs that are known that interfere with its absorption. The peak therapeutic effect is expected after 4 to 6 weeks. The individualization of the dose should be performed on the basis of clinical response and biochemical test results. Regular monitoring of TSH and thyroxine is recommended at the beginning of therapy or changing the dose. Doctor will probably start with therapy on a lower dose of levothyroxine and gradually increase the dose. Levothyroxine can control hypothyroidism, make symptoms less frequent but it does not cure it. It may take several weeks before patients can notice a change in their symptoms. Patients should continue taking levothyroxine even if they feel well. Patient should not stop taking levothyroxine without talking to your doctor. Therapy may be started at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals who are less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (few months): : 1.7 mcg/kg/day (100 to 125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult) Doses greater than 200 mcg/day orally are rarely required An insufficient response to daily doses of 300 mcg/day or higher is very rare and may be because of poor compliance, drug interactions or malabsorption. Patients older than 50 years or patients under 50 years with undrlaying cardiac disease: 25 to 50 mcg/day, with gradual increments in dose at 6 to 8 week intervals, if it is needed 5 to 50 mcg once a day orally; dosage can be increased in 12.5 to 25 mcg/day increments every 2 to 4 weeks (until the TSH level is normalized, accompanied by clinical and laboratory results) Patients with pituitary – secondary or hypothalamic – tertiary hypothyroidism: The oral dose should be titrated until the serum level of free-T4 is restored to normal range and if patient is clinically euthyroid. -This drug should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach with water, at least one-half hour before any food is eaten. The target level for TSH suppression has not been established. For benign nodular disease the efficacy of TSH suppression is controversial. Thus, the dose should be individualized based on the specific disease and the patient being treated. In the management of well differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary and follicular), levothyroxine is used as an adjunct therapy to surgery and radioiodine therapy. Generally, TSH is suppressed to less than 0.1 IU/liter (mU/L), and this usually requires a dose greater than 2 mcg/kg/day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be less than 0.01 mU/L. In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target such as 0.1 to 0.5 mU/L for nodules and 0.5 to 1.0 mU/L for multinodular goiter compared to the doses used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. This drug is contraindicated if the serum TSH is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening condition characterized by hypometabolism and poor circulation. It may result in unpredictable absorption from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Only the intravascular dosage form of levothyroxine should be used for this condition: : 50 and 100 mcg intravascular, until the patient can tolerate oral therapy 5 to 25 mcg per day orally, with gradual dose increments at 4 to 6 week intervals The dose is adjusted in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized. Age 0 to 3 months: 10 to 15 mcg/kg once per day orally Patients in which growth and puberty are complete: 1.7 mcg/kg/day For chronic or severe hypothyroidism: 25 mcg once per day orally and increase dosage as needed in increments of 25 mcg every 2 to 4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved. What are the pharmacokinetic properties of the Levothyroxine Absorption of levothyroxine after oral administration from the gastrointestinal tract varies from 40–80%, but the most of the drug is absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. Levothyroxine absorption can be increased by fasting and reduced in certain malabsorption conditions, by certain foods, and with age. Dietary fibers can dcrease the bioavailability of the drug. More than 99% of circulating thyroid hormones are bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding prealbumin, albumin and thyroxine-binding globulin. Only free form of hormone is metabolically active. About 70% of secreted T4 is deiodinated to equivalent amounts of T3 and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), which is metabolically inactive. Elimination of T3 and T4 involves metabolic reactions of hepatic conjugation to glucuronic and sulfuric acids. The hormones go through enterohepatic circulation and after that, they are as conjugates hydrolyzed in the intestine and reabsorbed. Conjugated molecules that reach the colon are hydrolyzed and eliminated as free compounds in the feces. Other minor T4 metabolites have been also identified. : Levothyroxine half-life is 6–7 days for healthy patients, 9–10 days for patients with hypothyroidism and 3–4 days for patients with hypothyroidism. Approximately 80% of thyroid hormones are eliminated by the kidneys; however urinary excretion is decreased with age. The remaining 20% of T4 is eliminated in the feces. What special precautions should I follow/ What should I avoid while using Levothyroxine Patients should tell their doctor and pharmacist if they are allergic to levothyroxine, or any other medications, or any of the ingredients in levothyroxine dosage forms. Patients should tell their doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medicines, nutritional supplements, vitamins and herbal preparations they are taking or plan to take. Patients should mention if they are using any of the following drugs: anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin), amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone); amphetamines; aspirin or any other NSAID; beta-blockers such as propranolol (Inderal), timolol (Timoptic), metoprolol (Lopressor), carbamazepine (Equetro, Tegretol); corticosteroids such as dexamethasone; imatinib (Gleevac); insulin or other medications to treat diabetes; lithium (Lithobid);  maprotiline; oral contraceptives; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline (Zoloft); theophylline (TheoDur); and tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil), phenobarbital; phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); rifampin (Rifater, Rifamate, Rifadin). Doctor may need to change the doses of these medications or monitor carefully for side effects. Patients should also mention their doctor or pharmacist if they are taking: any antacid drug, colesevelam (Welchol), colestipol (Colestid), calcium carbonate (Tums), iron, orlistat (Alli, Xenical), simethicone (Phazyme, Gas X), sevelamer (Renvela, Renagel),  sucralfate (Carafate), sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate. These drugs have to be taken at least 4 hours after or 4 hours before levothyroxine administration. Patients should tell their doctor and pharmacist if they have or have ever had diseases such as: diabetes; atherosclerosis, some liver or kidney disease; bleeding problems; porphyria, cardiovascular disease such as chest pain (angina), arrhythmias, high blood pressure or heart attack; an underactive adrenal or pituitary gland, or any condition that makes swallow difficult. Patients should also tell their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding. If they become pregnant while using levothyroxine, they should call their doctor. If patients should have surgery, including dental surgery, they should tell their doctor or dentist that they are using levothyroxine. Which pregnancy category (A; B; C; D; X) has been assigned to Levothyroxine Levothyroxine has been given pregnancy category A by the FDA. This means that this drug has no risk during pregnancy – “Adequate and well-controlled human studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters).” Studies in women using levothyroxine during pregnancy have failed to show an increased risk of congenital abnormalities. Thus, the possibility of fetal harm is excluded. Levothyroxine should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be treated promptly. Although thyroid hormones can be excreted only in small amounts into human milk, caution is needed when Levothyroxine is administered to a nursing woman. However, adequate replacement doses of Levothyroxine are generally required to maintain normal lactation. What should I know about storage and disposal of levothyroxine This medication should be kept in the container it came in, out of reach of children and tightly closed. It should be stored at room temperature and away from extra heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Outdated medications should be thrown away any medication. Patients should talk with their pharmacist about the proper disposal of this medication. Patients should eat a normal and healthy diet. Some foods and beverages, particularly those that contain walnuts, dietary fiber and soybeans, may affect how levothyroxine action, so it recommendable to take levothyroxine one half to 1 hour before breakfast. The missed dose should be taken as soon as patients remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, patients should skip the missed dose and continue the regular dosing schedule. They should never take a double dose to make up for a missed one. In case of overdose, patients should call their local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. The table below shows the incidence of side effects after levothyroxine administration in recommendable doses. The incidence can be increased if this drug is overdosed. Angina pectoris, Myocardial infarction, Palpitations, Congestive heart failure, Flushing, Increased pulse, Choking sensation, Emotional lability, Headache, Heat intolerance, Arrhythmias, Arthralgia, Alopecia, Weight loss, Infertility, Dyspnea, Tremor, Fever, Tachycardia, Nervousness, Anxiety, Myasthenia, Pseudomotor cerebri, Cramps, Diarrhea, Insomnia, Decreased bone mineral density Does Levothyroxine have any interaction with other drugs Glucocorticoids, Dopamine/Dopamine Agonists and Octreotide: These drugs may reduce TSH secretion however the reduction is not sustained, therefore, hypothyroidism does not occur. Amiodarone, Lithium, Iodide, Propylthiouracil (PTU), Methimazole, Tolbutamide and Sulfonamides: These drugs may decrease thyroid hormone secretion, which may result in hypothyroidism. However, Iodide and Amiodarone may cause hyperthyroidism in euthyroid patients with Grave’s disease previously treated with antithyroid drugs or in euthyroid patients with thyroid autonomy. Amiodarone may induce hyperthyroidism by causing thyroiditis. Antacids, Bile Acid Sequestrants, Calcium Carbonate, Cation Exchange Resins, Orlistat These drugs may reduce T4 absorption, which may result in hypothyroidism. Furosemide, Hydantoins, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, Salicylates, Heparin: These drugs may cause protein-binding site displacement so co-administration of these agents with Levothyroxine may result in an initial increase in FT4. Continued administration results in a decrease in serum T4 and normal FT4 and TSH concentrations and, therefore, patients are clinically euthyroid. Clofibrate, Estrogens (oral), Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, 5-Fluorouracil, Heroin/Methadone, Mitotane, Tamoxifen: These drugs may increase serum TBG concentration. Androgens/Anabolic Steroids, Asparaginase, Glucocorticoids, and Nicotinic Acid: These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Rifampin and Hydantoins: These drugs may increase hepatic metabolism, which may result in hypothyroidism. Stimulation of hepatic microsomal metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of Levothyroxine, resulting in lower concentration of Levothyroxine in blood and thus less effects of the drug Amiodarone, Beta-adrenergic antagonists and Glucocorticoids: Administration of these drugs may decrease the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. Anticoagulants and Levothyroxine co-administration may lead to increased catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, thus increasing the anticoagulant activity of oral anticoagulants. Concomitant use of tri/tetracyclic antidepressants and Levothyroxine may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs. Addition of Levothyroxine to antidiabetic or insulin therapy may result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Therapeutic effect of digitalis glycosides may be reduced. Therapy with interferon-α has been associated with the development of antithyroid microsomal antibodies in 20% of patients and some have transient hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or both. Excessive use of thyroid hormones with growth hormones may accelerate epiphyseal closure. Concurrent use with Levothyroxine may produce hypertension and tachycardia. Methylxanthine Bronchodilators such as Theophilline: Decreased theophylline clearance may occur in hypothyroid patients Concurrent use may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may reduce the uptake of 123 I, 131I, and 99mTc. Does Levothyroxine have any interaction with Diseases In women, prolonged therapy with Levothyroxine has been linked with increased resorption of bone, by decreasing the mineral density of bones, especially in postmenopausal women on greater than replacement doses or in women who are receiving suppressive doses of Levothyroxine. The increased resorption of the bones may be related with increased blood levels and urinary excretion of phosphorous and calcium, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase and suppressed PTH-parathyroid hormone levels. Caution is needed when Levothyroxine is administered to patients with cardiovascular disorders and to the elderly where is an increased risk of cardiac diseases. In such patients, Levothyroxine should be initiated at lower doses than doses which are recommended in younger and healthy individuals or in patients without cardiac disease. If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, the Levothyroxine dose should be reduced or discontinued for one week and then cautiously restarted at a lower dose. Levothyroxine overdosage may have side cardiovascular effects such on: heart rate, thickness of cardiac wall, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate arrhythmias or angina. Patients with coronary artery disease who are using Levothyroxine should be monitored carefully during surgical procedures, since the possibility of precipitating cardiac arrhythmias may be greater in those treated with Levothyroxine. Combination of Levothyroxine and sympathomimetic agents to patients with coronary artery disease may precipitate coronary insufficiency. Patients with Nontoxic Diffuse Goiter or Nodular Thyroid Disease: When administering Levothyroxine to patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease caution is needed in order to prevent thyrotoxicosis precipitation. If the serum TSH is already suppressed, Levothyroxine should not be administered. In patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, additional hypothalamic/pituitary hormone deficiencies should be considered, and, if diagnosed, treated. Patients with adrenal insufficiency should be treated with glucocorticoids before the beginning of Levothyroxine therapy. Failure may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis when therapy with levothyroxine is started, due to increased metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids by thyroid hormone. Patients with diabetes mellitus may require upward adjustments of their antidiabetic therapeutic regimens when treated with Levothyroxine. http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.5614.html?rid=447fc4fa-fddf-4980-9a4f-2da5d2be08b3 http://www.druglib.com/druginfo/levoxyl/indications_dosage/ https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682461.html http://www.rxlist.com/levoxyl-drug/indications-dosage.htm http://reference.medscape.com/drug/synthroid-levoxyl-levothyroxine-342732 http://www.healthnewslibrary.com/most-of-the-population-have-thyroid-problems/ 6 Unconventional Weight Loss Tips That Will Actually Work Popular Heartburn Drug Contains Chemicals Linked To Cancer 10 Diet and Weight Loss Products Available at Urban Outfitters Aspirin Linked To Higher Survival Rates For Head, Neck, and Lung Cancers Vitamin D Supplements May Slow Diabetes Progression Eating Between Certain Hours Can Accelerate Weight Loss 3 Mistakes You’re Making When Exercising In the Heat © 2020 All texts are the intellectual property of this site.

2373beed-1f83-4cbb-9d40-07234dc46a4a,"Northwind Pharmaceuticals Drugs with thyroid hormone activity, alone or together with other therapeutic agents, have been used for the treatment of obesity. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects. Thyroid hormone drugs are natural or synthetic preparations containing tetraiodothyronine (T4, levothyroxine) sodium or triiodothyronine (T3, liothyronine) sodium or both. T4 and T3 are produced in the human thyroid gland by the iodination and coupling of the amino acid tyrosine. T4 contains four iodine atoms and is formed by the coupling of two molecules of diiodotyrosine (DIT). T3 contains three atoms of iodine and is formed by the coupling of one molecule of DIT with one molecule of monoiodotyrosine (MIT). Both hormones are stored in the thyroid colloid as thyroglobulin. Thyroid hormone preparations belong to two categories: (1) natural hormonal preparations derived from animal thyroid, and (2) synthetic preparations. Natural preparations include desiccated thyroid and thyroglobulin. Desiccated thyroid is derived from domesticated animals that are used for food by man (either beef or hog thyroid), and thyroglobulin is derived from thyroid glands of the hog. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has standardized the total iodine content of natural preparations. Thyroid USP contains not less than (NLT) 0.17 percent and not more than (NMT) 0.23 percent iodine, and thyroglobulin contains not less than (NLT) 0.7 percent of organically bound iodine. Iodine content is only an indirect indicator of true hormonal biologic activity. Liothyronine sodium tablets contain liothyronine (L-triiodothyronine or LT3), a synthetic form of a natural thyroid hormone, and is available as the sodium salt. L-Tyrosine, O-(4-hydroxy-3-iodophenyl)-3,5-diiodo-,monosodium salt Twenty-five mcg liothyronine is equivalent to approximately 1 grain of desiccated thyroid or thyroglobulin and 0.1 mg of L-thyroxine. Inactive ingredients consist of calcium sulfate dihydrate, corn starch, gelatin, magnesium stearate and mannitol. The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones exert their physiologic action are not well understood. These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body, increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system. Since liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein, it is readily available to body tissues. The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium is rapid, occurring within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days, providing early clinical response. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days. T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Liothyronine sodium has a rapid cutoff of activity which permits quick dosage adjustment and facilitates control of the effects of overdosage, should they occur. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Thyroid hormone drugs are indicated:As replacement or supplemental therapy in patients with hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis. This category includes cretinism, myxedema and ordinary hypothyroidism in patients of any age (pediatric patients, adults, the elderly), or state (including pregnancy); primary hypothyroidism resulting from functional deficiency, primary atrophy, partial or total absence of thyroid gland, or the effects of surgery, radiation, or drugs, with or without the presence of goiter; and secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism (see WARNINGS).As pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppressants, in the treatment or prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters, including thyroid nodules, subacute or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s) and multinodular goiter.As diagnostic agents in suppression tests to differentiate suspected mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy. Liothyronine sodium tablets can be used in patients allergic to desiccated thyroid or thyroid extract derived from pork or beef. Thyroid hormone preparations are generally contraindicated in patients with diagnosed but as yet uncorrected adrenal cortical insufficiency, untreated thyrotoxicosis and apparent hypersensitivity to any of their active or extraneous constituents. There is no well-documented evidence from the literature, however, of true allergic or idiosyncratic reactions to thyroid hormone. Drugs with thyroid hormone activity, alone or together with other therapeutic agents, have been used for the treatment of obesity. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects. The use of thyroid hormones in the therapy of obesity, alone or combined with other drugs, is unjustified and has been shown to be ineffective. Neither is their use justified for the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is accompanied by hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormones should be used with great caution in a number of circumstances where the integrity of the cardiovascular system, particularly the coronary arteries, is suspected. These include patients with angina pectoris or the elderly, in whom there is a greater likelihood of occult cardiac disease. In these patients, liothyronine sodium therapy should be initiated with low doses, with due consideration for its relatively rapid onset of action. Starting dosage of liothyronine sodium tablets is 5 mcg daily, and should be increased by no more than 5 mcg increments at 2-week intervals. When, in such patients, a euthyroid state can only be reached at the expense of an aggravation of the cardiovascular disease, thyroid hormone dosage should be reduced. Morphologic hypogonadism and nephrosis should be ruled out before the drug is administered. If hypopituitarism is present, the adrenal deficiency must be corrected prior to starting the drug. Myxedematous patients are very sensitive to thyroid; dosage should be started at a very low level and increased gradually. Severe and prolonged hypothyroidism can lead to a decreased level of adrenocortical activity commensurate with the lowered metabolic state. When thyroid-replacement therapy is administered, the metabolism increases at a greater rate than adrenocortical activity. This can precipitate adrenocortical insufficiency. Therefore, in severe and prolonged hypothyroidism, supplemental adrenocortical steroids may be necessary. In rare instances the administration of thyroid hormone may precipitate a hyperthyroid state or may aggravate existing hyperthyroidism. General - Thyroid hormone therapy in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus or insipidus or adrenal cortical insufficiency aggravates the intensity of their symptoms. Appropriate adjustments of the various therapeutic measures directed at these concomitant endocrine diseases are required. The therapy of myxedema coma requires simultaneous administration of glucocorticoids. Hypothyroidism decreases and hyperthyroidism increases the sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Prothrombin time should be closely monitored in thyroid-treated patients on oral anticoagulants and dosage of the latter agents adjusted on the basis of frequent prothrombin time determinations. In infants, excessive doses of thyroid hormone preparations may produce craniosynostosis. Information for the Patient - Patients on thyroid hormone preparations and parents of pediatric patients on thyroid therapy should be informed that: Replacement therapy is to be taken essentially for life, with the exception of cases of transient hypothyroidism, usually associated with thyroiditis, and in those patients receiving a therapeutic trial of the drug.They should immediately report during the course of therapy any signs or symptoms of thyroid hormone toxicity, e.g., chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual event.In case of concomitant diabetes mellitus, the daily dosage of antidiabetic medication may need readjustment as thyroid hormone replacement is achieved. If thyroid medication is stopped, a downward readjustment of the dosage of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. At all times, close monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients.In case of concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy, the prothrombin time should be measured frequently to determine if the dosage of oral anticoagulants is to be readjusted.Partial loss of hair may be experienced by pediatric patients in the first few months of thyroid therapy, but this is usually a transient phenomenon and later recovery is usually the rule. Laboratory Tests - Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation, bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except products containing liothyronine sodium. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine and have essentially replaced older tests of thyroid hormone measurements, i.e., PBI, BEI and T4 by column. Oral Anticoagulants - Thyroid hormones appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. If oral anticoagulants are also being given, compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis are impaired. Patients stabilized on oral anticoagulants who are found to require thyroid replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started. If a patient is truly hypothyroid, it is likely that a reduction in anticoagulant dosage will be required. No special precautions appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a patient already stabilized on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy. Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics - Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases in insulin or oral hypoglycemic requirements. The effects seen are poorly understood and depend upon a variety of factors such as dose and type of thyroid preparations and endocrine status of the patient. Patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemics should be closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy. Cholestyramine - Cholestyramine binds both T4 and T3 in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones. In vitro studies indicate that the binding is not easily removed. Therefore, 4 to 5 hours should elapse between administration of cholestyramine and thyroid hormones. Estrogen, Oral Contraceptives - Estrogens tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBg). In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy, free levothyroxine may be decreased when estrogens are started thus increasing thyroid requirements. However, if the patient’s thyroid gland has sufficient function, the decreased free thyroxine will result in a compensatory increase in thyroxine output by the thyroid. Therefore, patients without a functioning thyroid gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given. Tricyclic Antidepressants - Use of thyroid products with imipramine and other tricyclic antidepressants may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity; transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed. Thyroid hormone activity may also be enhanced. Digitalis - Thyroid preparations may potentiate the toxic effects of digitalis. Thyroid hormonal replacement increases metabolic rate, which requires an increase in digitalis dosage. Ketamine - When administered to patients on a thyroid preparation, this parenteral anesthetic may cause hypertension and tachycardia. Use with caution and be prepared to treat hypertension, if necessary. Vasopressors - Thyroxine increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Therefore, injection of these agents into patients receiving thyroid preparations increases the risk of precipitating coronary insufficiency, especially in patients with coronary artery disease. Careful observation is required. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions - The following drugs or moieties are known to interfere with laboratory tests performed in patients on thyroid hormone therapy: androgens, corticosteroids, estrogens, oral contraceptives containing estrogens, iodine-containing preparations and the numerous preparations containing salicylates. Changes in TBg concentration should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of T4 and T3 values. In such cases, the unbound (free) hormone should be measured. Pregnancy, estrogens and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives increase TBg concentrations. TBg may also be increased during infectious hepatitis. Decreases in TBg concentrations are observed in nephrosis, acromegaly and after androgen or corticosteroid therapy. Familial hyper- or hypothyroxine-binding-globulinemias have been described. The incidence of TBg deficiency approximates 1 in 9000. The binding of thyroxine by thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA) is inhibited by salicylates.Medicinal or dietary iodine interferes with all in vivo tests of radioiodine uptake, producing low uptakes which may not be reflective of a true decrease in hormone synthesis.The persistence of clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism in spite of adequate dosage replacement indicates either poor patient compliance, poor absorption, excessive fecal loss, or inactivity of the preparation. Intracellular resistance to thyroid hormone is quite rare. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility - A reportedly apparent association between prolonged thyroid therapy and breast cancer has not been confirmed and patients on thyroid for established indications should not discontinue therapy. No confirmatory long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility in either males or females. Pregnancy - Category A. Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier. The clinical experience to date does not indicate any adverse effect on fetuses when thyroid hormones are administered to pregnant women. On the basis of current knowledge, thyroid replacement therapy to hypothyroid women should not be discontinued during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers - Minimal amounts of thyroid hormones are excreted in human milk. Thyroid is not associated with serious adverse reactions and does not have a known tumorigenic potential. However, caution should be exercised when thyroid is administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use - Clinical studies of liothyronine sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Pediatric Use - Pregnant mothers provide little or no thyroid hormone to the fetus. The incidence of congenital hypothyroidism is relatively high (1:4000) and the hypothyroid fetus would not derive any benefit from the small amounts of hormone crossing the placental barrier. Routine determinations of serum T4 and/or TSH is strongly advised in neonates in view of the deleterious effects of thyroid deficiency on growth and development. Treatment should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis and maintained for life, unless transient hypothyroidism is suspected, in which case, therapy may be interrupted for 2 to 8 weeks after the age of 3 years to reassess the condition. Cessation of therapy is justified in patients who have maintained a normal TSH during those 2 to 8 weeks. Adverse reactions, other than those indicative of hyperthyroidism because of therapeutic overdosage, either initially or during the maintenance period are rare (see OVERDOSAGE). In rare instances, allergic skin reactions have been reported with liothyronine sodium tablets. Signs and Symptoms - Headache, irritability, nervousness, sweating, arrhythmia (including tachycardia), increased bowel motility and menstrual irregularities. Angina pectoris or congestive heart failure may be induced or aggravated. Shock may also develop. Massive overdosage may result in symptoms resembling thyroid storm. Chronic excessive dosage will produce the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Treatment Of Overdosage - Dosage should be reduced or therapy temporarily discontinued if signs and symptoms of overdosage appear. Treatment may be reinstituted at a lower dosage. In normal individuals, normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function is restored in 6 to 8 weeks after thyroid suppression. Treatment of acute massive thyroid hormone overdosage is aimed at reducing gastrointestinal absorption of the drugs and counteracting central and peripheral effects, mainly those of increased sympathetic activity. Vomiting may be induced initially if further gastrointestinal absorption can reasonably be prevented and barring contraindications such as coma, convulsions, or loss of the gagging reflex. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Oxygen may be administered and ventilation maintained. Cardiac glycosides may be indicated if congestive heart failure develops. Measures to control fever, hypoglycemia, or fluid loss should be instituted if needed. Antiadrenergic agents, particularly propranolol, have been used advantageously in the treatment of increased sympathetic activity. Propranolol may be administered intravenously at a dosage of 1 to 3 mg over a 10-minute period or orally, 80 to 160 mg/day, especially when no contraindications exist for its use. The dosage of thyroid hormones is determined by the indication and must in every case be individualized according to patient response and laboratory findings. Liothyronine sodium tablets are intended for oral administration; once-a-day dosage is recommended. Although liothyronine sodium has a rapid cutoff, its metabolic effects persist for a few days following discontinuance. Mild Hypothyroidism: Recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg daily. Daily dosage then may be increased by up to 25 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks. Usual maintenance dose is 25 to 75 mcg daily. The rapid onset and dissipation of action of liothyronine sodium (T3), as compared with levothyroxine sodium (T4), has led some clinicians to prefer its use in patients who might be more susceptible to the untoward effects of thyroid medication. However, the wide swings in serum T3 levels that follow its administration and the possibility of more pronounced cardiovascular side effects tend to counterbalance the stated advantages. Liothyronine sodium tablets may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T4) during radioisotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 is suspected. Myxedema: Recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg daily. This may be increased by 5 to 10 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks. When 25 mcg daily is reached, dosage may be increased by 5 to 25 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks until a satisfactory therapeutic response is attained. Usual maintenance dose is 50 to 100 mcg daily. Myxedema Coma: Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. An intravenous preparation of liothyronine sodium is marketed by JONES PHARMA INCORPORATED, under the trade name Triostat® for use in myxedema coma/precoma. Congenital Hypothyroidism: Recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg daily, with a 5 mcg increment every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require only 20 mcg daily for maintenance. At 1 year, 50 mcg daily may be required. Above 3 years, full adult dosage may be necessary (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use). Simple (non-toxic) Goiter: Recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg daily. This dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks. When 25 mcg daily is reached, dosage may be increased every week or two by 12.5 or 25 mcg. Usual maintenance dosage is 75 mcg daily. In the elderly or in pediatric patients, therapy should be started with 5 mcg daily and increased only by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium tablets from thyroid, L-thyroxine or thyroglobulin, discontinue the other medication, initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage, and increase gradually according to the patient's response. When selecting a starting dosage, bear in mind that this drug has a rapid onset of action, and that residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks of therapy. Thyroid Suppression Therapy: Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom baseline laboratory tests appear normal or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Graves’ ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy. Each 5 mcg tablet contains liothyronine sodium equivalent to 5 mcg of liothyronine. Each 25 mcg tablet contains liothyronine sodium equivalent to 25 mcg of liothyronine. Each 50 mcg tablet contains liothyronine sodium equivalent to 50 mcg of liothyronine. Liothyronine sodium tablets are given in doses of 75 to 100 mcg/day for 7 days, and radioactive iodine uptake is determined before and after administration of the hormone. If thyroid function is under normal control, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. Liothyronine sodium tablets should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is a strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source. Each tablet contains liothyroninesodium equivalent to 50 mcg of liothyronine.

2f50cd90-5db3-4ab3-a3fc-2cbbb8363eae,"Hormones produced by one endocrine gland that regulate another endocrine gland. For example, the hypothalamus secretes tropic hormones that stimulate the anterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary produces thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which stimulates the thyroid gland, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal cortex. What type of method is used for most hormone assays? What is the precursor in the biosynthesis of all steroid hormones? Cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone. Where is follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the anterior pituitary. It stimulates production of sperm and eggs. There is a sharp increase in FSH just before ovulation. Where is growth hormone (GH) produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the anterior pituitary. It stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth and division. Where is thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the anterior pituitary. It stimulates the thyroid to produce T3 and T4. It is also known asthyrotropin. Where is adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the anterior pituitary. It stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce corticosteroids. ACTH exhibits diurnal variation, with highest levels in the early morning and lowest levels late in the day Where is anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary. It regulates reabsorption of water from the distal convoluted tubules. ADH is decreased in diabetes insipidus, leading to the excretion of an increased volume of dilute urine Where is cortisol produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the adrenal cortex and regulates carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, and suppresses inflammatory and allergic reactions. Adrenal insufficiency, characterized by decreased cortisol and increased ACTH. (This is an example of feedbackcontrol. The ACTH is increased because of the decreased cortisol; however in Addison disease, the adrenal gland isunable to respond appropriately to the ACTH.) The signs and symptoms associated with elevated cortisol levels. Cushing syndrome may be due to tumors of thepituitary (Cushing disease), tumors of the adrenal glands, ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors, or administration ofglucocorticoids or ACTH. What is the advantage of a 24-hour urine free cortisol measurement? It is not affected by circadian variation and is the most sensitive and specific screen for excess cortisol production. It is measured by tandem mass spectroscopy. Where is aldosterone produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the adrenal cortex. It increases retention of Na+ and excretion of K+ and H+ The hormones secreted by the adrenal medulla: epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Their metabolite is vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). Where is progesterone produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the ovaries. It prepares the uterus for pregnancy and stimulates lactation. What is the major estrogen produced by the ovaries? Estradiol (E2). Estrogens are involved in the development of the female reproductive organs and secondary sexcharacteristics, regulation of the menstrual cycle, and maintenance of pregnancy Which hormones are used to assess fetal well·being? Estriol, progesterone, and its metabolite, pregnanediol. Which hormone can be measured by a home testing kit to determine the time of ovulation? Luteinizing hormone (LH), secreted by the anterior pituitary. There is a sharp peak just before ovulation. Why are estrogen and progesterone receptor assays performed? To establish a prognosis for patients with breast cancer. Where is thyroxine (T4) produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the thyroid and controls metabolic rate, growth and development, and sexual maturation.Triiodothyronine (T3) is formed primarily from deiodination of T4 by tissues. Free T4 (FT4). Most T4 is bound to thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), the main carrier protein for T4 and T3. What is the recommended screening test for thyroid function? Thyroid·stimulating hormone (TSH). With primary hypothyroidism, TSH may be increased before clinicalsymptoms. A normal TSH usually excludes a diagnosis of primary thyroid dysfunction. What further thyroid testing is recommended when the TSH is abnormal? Free T4. Free T3 assays are available but are not routinely performed. What methodology is most often used to measure TSH and free T4? A patient has a high TSH and a low free T4. What is a likely diagnosis? Primary hypothyroidism, a disorder of the thyroid gland. TSH increases as the pituitary tries to stimulate thethyroid to produce more T3 and T4. A patient bas a low free T4 and a low TSH. What is a likely diagnosis? Secondary hypothyroidism, a pituitary disorder. The thyroid is nonnal, but it isn't stimulated to produce the nonnal amount of thyroid hormones because of insufficient TSH from the pituitary. How can primary hypothyroidism be differentiated from secondary hypothyroidism? By TSH. Primary hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland. TSH increases as the pituitary tries to stimulate the thyroid to produce more T3 and T4. Secondary hypothyroidism is a pituitary disorder. TSH levels are low. What lab findings are typical of primary hypothyroidism? What screening is done for neonatal hypothyroidism? Measurement ofT4 or TSH or a combination of tests is performed using dry blood spots or cord blood. All 50states require newborn screening for hypothyroidism to eliminate severe mental retardation associated with thyroid hormone deficiency. TSH is low and free T4 is high. The high level of T4 produced by the thyroid sends a feedback message to the pituitary to slow down production of TSH. An autoimmune disease that is the most common type of hyperthyroidism in the U.S. Thyroid stimulating hormonereceptor antibodies (TRab) are present in the serum. A type of autoimmune hypothyroidism and the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the developed world. It is characterized by the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies that gradually impair thyroid function, leading to decreased synthesis of thyroid hormones. The best test for diagnosing the condition is thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), which is present in 80-99% of cases. Hashimoto's is also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. Where is parathyroid hormone (PTH) produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the parathyroid glands. It increases serum calcium and decreases phosphates. PTH is increased in primary hypcrparathyroidism and decreased in hypoparathyroidism Where is glucagon produced and what is its main action? It is produced in the alpha cells of the pancreas. It increases glucose levels.

3c768acb-435e-4385-ad87-a384ebe42d3a,"All About Standard TSH Ranges by Age and Life Stage — — Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is produced by your pituitary gland, which helps regulate hormone production and metabolism throughout your body. TSH helps your thyroid gland make other hormones essential to your metabolism, such as thyroxine. It also contributes to your overall energy levels, nerve functions, and much more. The typical range of reference for TSH levels is anywhere . A suggests that the normal range should be more like 0.45 to 4.12 mU/L. TSH can vary wildly based on your age, sex, and stage of life. For example, a 29-year-old woman may have normal TSH around 4.2 mU/L, while an 88-year-old man may reach 8.9 mU/L at their upper limits. And stress, your diet, medications, and having your period can all make TSH fluctuate. change inversely with how much thyroid hormone is in your body. Think of your pituitary gland as a thyroid thermometer: Abnormally high TSH levels usually mean that your thyroid is underperforming. Your pituitary gland reacts to a lack of thyroid hormones by producing extra TSH to make up the difference. This is called . Low TSH levels usually mean that you’re producing too much thyroid hormone. Your pituitary gland responds accordingly by decreasing TSH production to get thyroid function under control. This is called . Let’s learn more about the range of TSH levels for different groups of people and what to do if your level is too high or too low. Here are the estimated normal, low, and high ranges of TSH levels for adults, based on a : Women are at for developing abnormal TSH levels during , when giving birth, and after going through menopause. Around in the United States have some kind of thyroid condition, compared with 3 percent of men. Despite claims that high TSH increases your risk for heart disease, a found no link between high TSH and heart conditions such as a . But a showed that older women are especially at risk for developing if they have high TSH levels along with thyroid . Both high and low TSH can affect fertility. Men with hypo- or hyperthyroidism both had fewer . And to complications like of the genitals if they have high TSH. Taking thyroid hormone replacement therapy may be necessary for men to balance TSH. can vary based on their age: A that closely measured TSH levels in kids from birth to as old as 18 years found wildly different TSH levels throughout their lives. And though TSH tends to be high for the first month after they’re born, a child’s TSH levels will gradually decrease as they get closer to adulthood before rising again as they age. The chart below shows you how to know when your TSH levels are normal, low, and high when you’re , specifically between the ages of 18 and 45: It’s important to monitor TSH levels during pregnancy. High TSH levels and hypothyroidism can especially affect chances of a . As a result, a small percentage of pregnant women may receive levothyroxine (Synthroid), methimazole (Tapazole), or propylthiouracil (PTU) to help control TSH and thyroid hormone levels, especially if they have hypo- or hyperthyroidism. If you’re pregnant and already taking this medication for abnormal thyroid hormone levels, your doctor may recommend increasing your dose by about . Successful treatment of high TSH and hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lower your chances of having a miscarriage. Control of TSH levels can also help prevent other , such as: Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatments for abnormal levels of TSH: natural thyroxine hormone extracts and supplements consuming less of substances that affect levothyroxine absorption, such as fiber, soy, iron, or calcium oral radioactive iodine to shrink your thyroid gland methimazole or propylthiouracil to keep your thyroid from making too much thyroid hormone of your thyroid gland if regular treatments don’t work or may be threatening to your health, such as during pregnancy Abnormal TSH can indicate that your thyroid gland isn’t functioning properly. This can lead to long-term complications if you have an underlying condition that leads to hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Make sure you get your TSH levels tested regularly, especially if you have a family history of thyroid disorders or have seen abnormal TSH levels on previous test results. Follow any instructions your doctor gives you to stop taking certain medications or eating certain foods before a TSH test to make sure the results are accurate. This way, your doctor can give you a treatment plan that’s best for the cause of abnormal TSH. — — Best Diet for Hypothyroidism: Foods to Eat, Foods to Avoid A combination of the right nutrients and medications may help restore thyroid function and minimize symptoms of hypothyroidism.

80003ac8-e76a-4866-8eaa-48fd62d77637,"Over medicated? : Hi everyone, So...I was... - Thyroid UK So...I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid around 3-4 years ago and have been on levothyroxine ever since. It’s always been up and down but settled a bit. I was on 125 per day but as we are going through IVF they upped it to 150. So, started our second round and they’ve said my TSH level has dropped so I’m guessing that means I am being over medicated? I’m confused as I see this as being just as bad as under medicating. Luckily they let us carry on with round number 2 due to my last results being ok but I’m worried now. A low TSH does not automatically mean that you are over-medicated. You are only over-medicated if your FT3 is over-range. Are they testing your FT3. Do not allow them to reduce your dose solely on the basis of a low TSH. You need the FT4 and FT3 and antibodies tested as well. Ahhhh right. I don’t think I’ve ever had anything checked except my TSH...may be one to ask. Thanks! One to insist on! Dosing by the TSH is a very good way to keep the patient sick. Just thought I’d say hi, I’m trying to work my thyroid out around ivf too! My ivf consultant is refusing to transfer any more embryos at the moment as my TSH is 0.1, he says it’s too low. I think for an actual ivf round, stims and retrieval etc, I would be ok, it’s just the FET he doesn’t want to do. Hey! Ahhhh it’s good to talk to someone in the same boat! We started out stim on Saturday but they very nearly didn’t let us due to my levels being low (it was their error, no one checked my tat results until the day before we were due to start 😤) but they said as my last one was ok we could go ahead. What would be the difference doing a frozen rather than a fresh cycle? That just be devastating, I’m sorry. I know how hard IVF is on it’s own never mind adding the nightmare that is thyroid issues!! Could it be that your TSH was too high and would have possibly meant a miscarriage once pregnant. My family arrived before my thyroid problem but I have read that in the first trimester the TSH needs to be lower than 2.5. Do you know what your TSH reading is? They said it was too low, however have let us do this cycle as my last one was ok. I believe it was around 1.3, I’m not too sure. I’m just confused as my thyroid was ok taking 125 per day but they upped it to 150 specifically for the IVF. Very confusing x Sorry not heard about a lowest level for conception etc though doctors often panic if suppressed and throw osteoporosis at you which is a myth! But they are letting you continue so they must feel it's ok. I’m under a private GP for Levo and 4 weeks ago my TSH was 1.86 although I don’t have the T4... I've been over medicated for a while but the symptoms of over medication have gotten worse in diagnosed with underactive thyroid 7 years ago and been stable on 150mcg of levothyroxine since,... better but the test showed I was over medicated (TSH 0.01, T4 and T3 over range) and he reduced me... you are always worrying look it up under under OVER MEDICATED THYROID trust me you don`t want it...

LE Magazine September 2004 Thyroid Deficiency Preventing a Metabolic Meltdown By Raphael Kellman, MD Fatigue, weight gain, insulin resistance, depression, and dementia are all associated with the degenerative aspects of aging. Yet many of these symptoms may actually be caused by hypothyroidism, which is often overlooked and misdiagnosed. A simple thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test can reveal your thyroid status and help you avoid misdiagnosis of these symptoms. An estimated 5% of Americans suffer from hypothyroidism, a deficiency of the thyroid gland, and many go undiagnosed.1 Patients and their doctors often disregard common symptoms, mistaking them for “normal” signs of aging. In my integrative medical practice, I offer patients an alternative to suffering with symptoms that are eminently treatable. A swollen and inflamed thyroid gland. The pituitary gland secretes thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH levels are monitored in patients with thyroid disease. Role of the Thyroid The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped organ in the neck, located above the collarbone and below the Adam’s apple. This tiny gland is vital to regulation of the body’s metabolism. Made up of small sacs, the thyroid is filled with an iodine-rich protein called thyroglobulin, along with the two thyroid hormones, T4 (tetraiodothyronine, or thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine). T3, the more active of the two thyroid hormones, is produced in much smaller amounts than T4, which accounts for about 93% of the hormone produced. Most of the T3 is created by conversion from T4, which occurs in the liver and kidneys. The primary function of these two hormones is to convert food into energy and to regulate the body’s other systems. A deficiency in the production (or absorption) of thyroid hormones can cause a global decline in the body’s metabolic reactions and lead to a host of symptoms, most commonly fatigue, weight gain, low body temperature, dry skin, and hair loss in the eyebrows.2-4 But low thyroid function—that is, hypothyroidism—can also produce more far-ranging symptoms, potentially affecting all of the body’s organs and cells. That is why I make it a point to test a patient’s thyroid levels whenever he or she presents with a common and often interrelated series of health problems. The Testing Controversy Diagnosing hypothyroidism has sparked an ongoing debate in the medical community over what hormone levels constitute a hormone deficiency. Generally, doctors use the TSH blood test to diagnose thyroid conditions. TSH is produced in the brain’s pituitary gland. A pituitary that produces excess TSH indicates that the thyroid is functioning below par and therefore requires more stimulation than normal. The problem lies in defining the standard range for TSH levels. I have found that even at the edges of the so-called “normal” range, many patients suffer from untreated hypothyroidism, with significantly diminished health. The reference ranges published by various laboratories are subject to change as new information becomes available. In fact, the medical profession always adjusts these ranges to reflect new discoveries in clinical practice. For example, while a total cholesterol level of 300 mg/dL was once considered normal, we now know that that number is far too high, and levels around 200 mg/dL are now recommended. In 2002, the American Academy of Clinical Endocrinology revised the normal range for TSH levels downward to the current values of 0.2-5.5 mµ/ml.5 From testing and treating patients who present with significant health problems, I and many other doctors believe that this upper value is still too high. Studies have shown that values of more than 4.0 mµ/ml increase the prevalence of heart disease after correcting for other known risk factors.6 Other research reveals that people with TSH values of more than 2.0 mµ/ml have a higher risk of developing overt hypothyroid disease over the next 20 years.7 Research also links hypothyroidism with high cholesterol. When the level of TSH is over 1.9 mµ/ml, with concomitant high levels of cholesterol, doctors should look for thyroid deficiency before treating the patient with cholesterol-lowering drugs.8 These findings all show a notable difference between the optimal TSH range and the so-called “normal” range. Even when tests reveal “normal” TSH levels, I sometimes suspect the presence of hypothyroidism, especially in older patients, as thyroid deficiencies often imitate age-related symptoms. In such cases, I perform a stimulation test using thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) to disclose low thyroid performance even if a blood test is normal. The TRH stimulation test is conducted only under the direct supervision of a physician. The test requires the intravenous injection of the hormone TRH with additional blood sampling before and after the injection. The results of this test help to distinguish between outright hypothyroidism and “subclinical” or developing hypothyroidism. In some individuals (and depending on the physician’s interpretation of the laboratory tests), outright hypothyroidism may take as long as 20 years to develop. With the help of measures such as the TRH stimulation test, I am able to diagnose hypothyroidism when the onset of symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, etc.) precedes abnormal laboratory values. Early intervention thus may save patients from years of needless suffering. Symptoms of Hypothyroidism I generally prefer to observe patients closely and assess their entire range of symptoms to determine whether hypothyroidism is a contributor to their condition, and then to use blood tests to confirm hypothyroidism. I first look for deficiency, low metabolism or tiredness, and weight gain, though there are many other indicators. According to the pioneering physician Broda Barnes, author of Hypothyroidism: The Unsuspected Illness, there are at least 47 symptoms of low thyroid function—most of them overlooked by blood tests. “The development and use of thyroid function blood tests,” Barnes wrote, “left many patients with clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism undiagnosed and untreated.” For this reason, Barnes estimates that up to 34% of the adult population has some form of thyroid deficiency. In addition to fatigue, I have found that symptoms may include depression, dementia, decreased cognitive function (“brain fog”), a weakening of the immune system, constipation, weight gain and fluid retention, irregular menstrual cycle, infection, discoloration of the skin, hair loss, and drooping eyelids.9-17 A sluggish thyroid can also be linked to a fatty liver or high cholesterol, candida, and low glucose and insulin levels. In extreme cases, untreated hypothyroidism can cause anemia, low body temperature, and heart failure.18-27 Additional tests to better determine the significance of such symptoms include a liver panel, a complete blood count (CBC), a chemistry panel including a cholesterol profile, the candida antibody test, and a fasting insulin level. Because the thyroid governs metabolic processes extending all the way down to the cellular level, every organ and system of the body can potentially be affected by its dysfunction. For example, hypothyroidism can affect the digestive tract, leading to constipation. This occurs when a sluggish metabolism affects the cells lining the gut walls, in turn slowing peristalsis, the contractions that govern bowel movements. Slowed metabolic activity in the brain can manifest as lowered mood and depression, the result of a decreased production of neurotransmitters. Nerve cells that are not firing well may produce decreased cognitive function. In fact, many elderly people with hypothyroidism have been misdiagnosed as suffering from dementia. One of my patients, a 78-year-old woman who was progressively declining at home, had lost overall function, was tired and forgetful, and could not remember the names of those close to her. Routine tests for TSH showed her to be in the “normal” range, and her doctors had concluded that she was suffering from “beginning dementia,” an all-too-common misdiagnosis in the elderly. Suspecting hypothyroidism, I tested her and then started her on low doses of thyroid hormone, to which she immediately responded. Her memory returned and her overall function improved dramatically. “I feel like I was rescued from the dead,” she told me. Although many patients with subclinical hypothyroidism show no symptomatic improvement upon treatment according to the medical literature, it is impossible to refute this anecdotal observation. It is tragic that so many elderly patients are considered untreatable and dismissed as “over the hill” when their symptoms, due to hypothyroidism, can be alleviated with hormone treatment. LE Magazine September 2004 Thyroid Deficiency Preventing a Metabolic Meltdown By Raphael Kellman, MD Thyroid dysfunction can also contribute to insulin resistance, especially among overweight people, and in such cases is often a precursor to diabetes.28,29 Insulin, produced by the pancreas, results in the storage of excessive calories. But in insulin resistance, the cells become less responsive to the action of insulin. The body therefore produces more and more insulin as a result, trying to maintain normal blood sugar levels, a condition known as hyperinsulinemia. High insulin levels also stimulate appetite: when glucose levels drop, the insulin sends a signal to the brain to keep the food coming. Thus, you begin to eat when you least need to, with intractable weight gain being the result. A high insulin output over many years because of poor diet can cause the pancreas to “burn out” and insulin output to drop, resulting in diabetes. A number of studies suggest that hypothyroidism is associated with diabetes mellitus.30 The connection between the thyroid and the hypothalamus-pituitary axis results in three different types of hypothyroidism. Primary hypothyroidism arises from a deficiency in the thyroid itself, while secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism involve the pituitary and hypothalamus, respectively. In tertiary hypothyroidism, the hypothalamus shuts down protectively in response to stress, producing low levels of thyroid hormone.31 Often linked to chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, this condition can cause low body temperatures, a tendency toward infections, and the other metabolic consequences of low thyroid.32 It has been suggested that problems with the mitochondria, the cellular structures that furnish us with energy, may cause this suppression of the hypothalamus. Since dysfunction of the mitochondria is also a result of hypothyroidism, here again we have an example of how processes behave reciprocally in the body. Weight gain is an effect of hypothyroidism that can similarly become a cause. In response to the metabolic slowdown and corresponding weight gain, patients may lower their caloric intake, which in turn can lower production of T3, initiating a vicious cycle in which the basal metabolic rate slows and leads to even more weight gain. I use the little-known Achilles Tendon Reflex Recovery Test and the Barnes Basal Temperature as measures of deficient conversion of T4 to T3 to ascertain whether hypothyroidism is implicated in cases of obesity. In addition to those previously mentioned, several other blood tests also gauge T3 and T4 levels, including the reverse T3, T3 uptake, T4, and complete thyroid panel tests. Thyroid and Hormonal Imbalances Thyroid function is intimately tied to adrenal function, which reciprocally acts to stimulate the pituitary, where TSH is produced. If the adrenals are not working well, the thyroid and pituitary often will be affected. Adrenal imbalances can be measured via cortisol levels. Stress tends to raise cortisol levels, increasing insulin and thereby leading, in some cases, to insulin resistance and overproduction of cortisol, as measured by the saliva test, thus signaling trouble for the thyroid.33,34 Excess cortisol causes a decrease in thyroid expression by leading to diminished conversion of T4 into T3, the active hormone. A progesterone-estrogen imbalance can similarly interfere with thyroid function as well as result from diminished thyroid function. Estrogen and thyroid hormone have opposite effects: estrogen causes calories to be turned into fat, and thyroid hormone causes fat calories to be turned into energy. So when progesterone is low and estrogen is dominant (even when TSH blood levels are normal), if symptoms of hypothyroidism are present, high estrogen levels could be the cause.35,36 Weight gain can also upset the progesterone-estrogen balance. To counteract this effect of estrogen, I generally recommend the use of topical progesterone creams. Higher levels of progesterone activate estrogen receptor sites in the body and cause the estrogen to be used before it can do harm. The progesterone-estrogen balance can be determined by a monthly saliva test or by progesterone and estrogen blood tests. Autoimmune Thyroid Disease Low progesterone in women between the ages of 30 and 50 may lead to autoimmune hypothyroiditis, or Hashimoto’s disease, as a consequence of immune stimulation by the dominant estrogen. In this condition, the body’s immune system develops antibodies to thyroid cell components, resulting in self-destruction of the thyroid gland; specifically, antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin are generated pathologically. Twenty-five percent of such cases may also result from a genetic predisposition. This attack by the immune system on the thyroid results in damage to the cellular mitochondria, the energy producers in the cytoplasm, and the progressive destruction of the thyroid itself. Stress can also provoke this mitochondrial response, which in turn can result in other types of inflammation and allergies. To improve mitochondrial function, we use N-acetylcysteine (a precursor to glutathione), coenzyme Q10, and alpha lipoic acid, an antioxidant for liver and nerve health that also works to regenerate coenzyme Q10.37 This treatment also improves cholesterol and fat levels in the liver, and helps the gall bladder. Looking for the Cause In addition to treating both symptoms and organic dysfunction, it is important to identify and eliminate all other possible causative factors. These may include: Iodine deficiencies. Iodine is an important component of T4 and T3. Although dietary iodine deficiencies are now almost nonexistent in the US, some people need to supplement their iodine intake with kelp, seaweed, or iodine tablets. Iodine is also found in dietary supplements such as Thyroid & L-Tyrosine Complex™ capsules, which contain other trace minerals needed for optimal endocrine function—such as iodine, magnesium, zinc, copper, and manganese—as well as tyrosine, the precursor to thyroid hormone.38 Toxicity/heavy metals. Metal toxicity, determined by hair analysis, can be addressed with chelation, both intravenous and oral. Selenium supplementation can also help remove heavy metals by working in conjunction with glutathione peroxidase, a compound found in asparagus, garlic, and mushrooms.39,40 A blood test can determine if selenium supplementation is needed; if so, there are several options, including Se-methylselenocysteine caps. Candida. Candida is detected using stool testing for overgrowth of yeast and yeast antibodies. Eliminating yeast, sugar, and wheat from the diet helps to starve out candida. People suffering from this disorder should eliminate even honey and fruit sugars from their diet at first, and then slowly reintroduce them into the diet later. Twinlab Yeast Fighters include biotin, fiber, acidophilus, and herbs to support a healthy intestinal environment. Environmental radiation. Radiation can cause free-radical damage to the thyroid, as has happened in Ukraine as a result of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster. The cell mitochondria are also prone to free radical damage. I recommend turning off cell phones and unplugging bedside electronic and electrical devices (including the telephone) at night, even though these devices produce relatively low levels of radiation. Because electromagnetic radiation in food can also be problematic, eating organic food whenever possible is also recommended. Treating Hypothyroidism Conventional treatment calls for patients to take an oral, synthetic form of T4. Synthroid®, the most popular such medication, is used by about 8 million Americans. Especially in older people for whom the side effects can be more problematic, it is important to advance the dosage slowly until TSH blood levels return to normal. This medication usually must be taken for life. I have discovered that many people respond better to Armour® Thyroid, which is desiccated porcine thyroid. A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine claimed greater improvements in mood and brain function with Armour® Thyroid than with Synthroid®.41 I recommend starting treatment with a dose of 60-120 mg of Armour® desiccated thyroid, and then retesting in a month. One of my patients, a woman in her early forties, complained of fatigue along with dry scalp and hair loss. She had gained 10 pounds and had irregular periods of depression. Because her blood test results were in the “normal” range, she went from doctor to doctor, until one physician prescribed birth control pills and Prozac®. When she consulted me, I noticed that her TSH level was 3 mµ/ml; this score, though considered to be within the normal range, may indicate low thyroid. I treated her empirically with Armour® Thyroid. I also tested her adrenals and found that they were hypofunctioning, and thus prescribed ashwagandha and Panax ginseng.42,43 Two weeks after treatment, the woman regained her energy and told me, “I have my life back!” The weight also disappeared—she dropped 10 pounds in eight weeks, her skin returned to normal, and her mood lifted. LE Magazine September 2004 Thyroid Deficiency Preventing a Metabolic Meltdown By Raphael Kellman, MD Vitamin Supplements Natural supplements for thyroid problems include vitamins A, B complex, B12, C, and E; coenzyme Q10; and especially the minerals magnesium, manganese, selenium, and zinc. Deficiencies of any of these minerals can prevent the conversion of T4 to T3 and should be corrected. Sufficient protein iodine and especially the amino acid tyrosine are necessary to make T4 in the thyroid gland. Conclusion The causes and effects of hypothyroidism are interrelated. Healthy thyroid function depends on the action of other glands, and many key processes in turn depend on healthy thyroid function. Using integrative medicine to treat these interrelated functional areas can offer patients tremendous benefits.

Since thyroid hormones influence the metabolic activity of every cell, less-than-optimal thyroid function can profoundly affect the body and the mind. This protocol reviews thyroid function and regulation. You’ll learn how so-called normal thyroid lab test results don’t necessarily mean your thyroid isn’t contributing to your symptoms. Important aspects of thyroid function aren’t measured on most standard thyroid lab tests. Combining comprehensive thyroid function testing, integrative nutritional and dietary supplement strategies and judicious thyroid hormone replacement under physician guidance can help restore balanced thyroid function. Selenium and iodine are micronutrients that play key roles in thyroid function. Supplementation can help ensure the thyroid has access to adequate levels of these nutrients. What Does the Thyroid Do? The thyroid is an organ in the neck responsible for regulating metabolism by controlling the rate of oxygen and calorie conversion to energy. The metabolic rate of every cell in the body is controlled by thyroid hormones, particularly T3. The thyroid produces the hormones T3 and T4 in response to stimulation by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced in the pituitary gland. The thyroid requires iodine and L-tyrosine to synthesize T3 and T4. Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid does not produce enough thyroid hormone, significantly slowing metabolism. Hypothyroidism has detrimental effects on the body. Fortunately, thyroid function tests (eg, TSH, T3, and T4) can help identify an underlying thyroid condition as well as help direct proper treatment and improve symptoms. Nutrients such as iodine and selenium help support thyroid function. What are Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism? Fatigue Weakness Sensitivity to cold Constipation Unexplained weight gain Dry skin and hair (and/or hair loss) Muscle cramps Depression If left untreated, hypothyroidism can lead to goiter, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Hypothyroidism? Thyroid hormone replacement therapy Desiccated thyroid extract Which Nutrients Support Thyroid Health? Iodine. Iodine is required to synthesize thyroid hormone. Iodine deficiency is a leading cause of mental retardation due to its significance in thyroid activity. Many table salts have added iodine, and certain foods such as seaweed contain high concentrations of iodine. Selenium. Selenium is a necessary component of the enzyme that converts T4 to T3. Patients with various thyroid disorders were shown to have lower selenium levels. Zinc. Zinc may contribute to the conversion of T4 to T3. In a group of patients with abnormal thyroid hormone levels, zinc supplementation normalized the levels. Iron. Iron deficiency hampers the production of thyroid hormone. One study showed subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism were more likely to be iron deficient than the control group. Vitamin E. Several preclinical studies indicate vitamin E may help reduce oxidative stress caused by hypothyroidism. Ashwagandha extract. Ashwagandha extracts have been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to alleviate stress. A small study indicated that the extract also improved thyroid function and thyroid-related hormone levels. Korean ginseng. Korean ginseng extract has shown promise in multiple clinical trials for a variety of conditions. In a trial of subjects with congestive heart failure and low T3 and T4, intravenous ginseng extract increased levels of both hormones. Vitamin A. Vitamin A (a family of related retinoic acids including retinol and beta-carotene) is important for thyroid health, and deficiencies are associated with thyroid dysfunction. Other natural interventions for thyroid health and function include guggul extract, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and turmeric. 2 Introduction The thyroid is a small gland located at the base of the neck that produces thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones exert considerable influence over most aspects of human physiology. Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce normal amounts of these hormones. Because thyroid hormones affect so many parts of the body, hypothyroidism can have serious and varied consequences.1,2 An estimated 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disease, and nearly 60% of those with thyroid issues are unaware of their condition.3 While people of all races and ages can develop thyroid issues, women are more likely than men to have thyroid problems: one in eight women will develop a thyroid problem during her lifetime.2 Stress, unhealthy diet, and even normal aging can compromise healthy thyroid function. Hypothyroidism affects an estimated 4.6% of the world population.4 Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, depression, weight gain, cognitive deficits, and several other concerns.5 Hashimoto’s disease, a condition in which the immune system attacks the thyroid and causes low thyroid function over time, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in regions where iodine deficiency is uncommon. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a term that describes mild hypothyroidism in which some lab values are abnormal but thyroid hormone production is within normal limits. While this condition does not typically cause major health problems, it may undermine quality of life in some people.4 For a long time, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement was standard care, even in people without symptoms; however, current evidence does not support this strategy.6 In most cases, subclinical hypothyroidism identified on a blood test should only be treated if the affected person has symptoms likely related to thyroid dysfunction or if there are other indications for treatment, such as if the affected person is trying to get pregnant. Subclinical hypothyroidism often resolves on its own, but in some cases it progresses to overt hypothyroidism. In this protocol, you will learn how the thyroid gland works and what happens when there is too little thyroid hormone activity in your body. You will also learn how simple blood tests can assess thyroid function, and what treatments are available for hypothyroidism. In addition, you will discover several integrative interventions and dietary and lifestyle changes that can support healthy thyroid function. 3 Background: Understanding the Thyroid Thyroid hormone production is regulated by two specific brain regions: the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. To ensure stable levels of thyroid hormones, the hypothalamus monitors circulating thyroid hormone levels and responds to low levels by releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH stimulates the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn stimulates the thyroid gland to increase triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) secretion. When thyroid hormone levels increase, pituitary production of TSH decreases, which slows the release of hormones from the thyroid gland.1 This interconnected system is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. On a blood test, elevated TSH levels are highly suggestive of hypothyroidism. This is because the pituitary releases excessive TSH into the bloodstream in attempt to stimulate sufficient T3 and T4 production. On the other hand, low TSH levels generally indicate hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. This occurs when the thyroid is making too much T3 and T4, which causes the pituitary gland to stop releasing TSH into the blood.7 In rare cases, abnormal TSH levels are a reflection of problems with the pituitary gland rather than the thyroid. The Primary Thyroid Hormones: T4 and T3 Thyroxine, or T4, is produced solely by the thyroid gland and is the more common thyroid hormone in the blood, but triiodothyronine, or T3, is the more biologically active thyroid hormone. T3 is formed by the removal of one of T4’s four iodine atoms. This process is mediated by selenium-dependent enzymes.8 T4 is found in the body in two forms: bound and free. Free T4 is not bound to any proteins and is able to enter into body tissues. Bound T4 is attached to proteins that render it biologically inactive. Approximately 99% of T4 in the body is in the bound form.9 Very small changes in the amount of carrier proteins will affect the percentage of unbound hormones. High blood levels of T4 typically indicate hyperthyroidism and low levels are associated with hypothyroidism. However, pregnancy and oral contraceptive use can elevate thyroid hormone levels, while severe illness and certain medications can lower T4 levels.7 Elevated levels of cortisol, as seen during times of stress and in conditions such as Cushing’s syndrome, lower TRH, TSH, and thyroid hormone levels.10,11 Cold temperatures increase TRH levels, which is thought to be an intrinsic mechanism that helps keep the body warm in cold weather.12 The thyroid gland needs iodine and the amino acid L-tyrosine to make T4 and T3. A diet deficient in iodine can lead to hypothyroidism.13 Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism can be overt, in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormones, or subclinical, in which the thyroid requires excessive stimulation to make normal amounts of thyroid hormone. Approximately one of every 300 people in the United States has overt hypothyroidism, and about one of every 23 has subclinical hypothyroidism, though not all cases are symptomatic.4 Hypothyroidism can be caused by Hashimoto’s disease, thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid), certain medications, thyroid surgery, or radiation treatment of the thyroid region. Women are more likely to develop this condition, but risk increases in both genders in people over age 60.14 Hypothyroidism is generally characterized by a reduced metabolic rate. The main symptoms are14,15: fatigue weakness increased sensitivity to cold constipation unexplained weight gain dry skin hair loss or coarse, dry hair muscle cramps depression People with hypothyroidism may also have an increased risk of bleeding and some forms of anemia.16,17 Most hypothyroid-related symptoms take years to develop. The slower one’s metabolism gets, the more obvious the signs and symptoms become. If hypothyroidism goes untreated, severe symptoms such as a swollen thyroid gland (goiter) or slow thought processes may develop. Untreated chronic hypothyroidism can even result in a rare life-threatening condition called myxedema coma. Subclinical Hypothyroidism Subclinical hypothyroidism, or mild thyroid dysfunction, is a far more common condition than overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism manifests as mildly elevated TSH levels (often defined as levels above 4.5 µIU/mL) and normal T4 and T3 levels. Individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism may be at greater risk for developing overt hypothyroidism, although the condition resolves on its own in about half of cases.18 Most people with subclinical hypothyroidism have mild or no symptoms. In contrast, those with overt hypothyroidism have abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels and often have pronounced symptoms.19 Risk factors for progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism include female gender, advanced age, having a goiter, and a high iodine intake. Nearly 70% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism have no symptoms, but others experience fatigue, dry skin, cognitive decline, and muscle weakness.18,20 4 Causes and Risk Factors There are two main classifications of hypothyroidism: primary and secondary. Primary hypothyroidism arises when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone despite normal release of TSH. This leads to low levels of circulating thyroid hormones and subsequent increases in TSH levels. Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when not enough TSH is being produced in the pituitary gland, which is much less common and is usually associated with a central nervous system problem.21 The focus of this protocol is primary hypothyroidism. Chronic Autoimmune Thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s Disease) Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, commonly called Hashimoto’s disease, is by far the most common cause of hypothyroidism in areas where iodine deficiency is not prevalent, such as the United States. In this condition, the immune system mistakenly attacks thyroid tissue. Hashimoto’s disease is characterized by production of antibodies, such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and antithyroglobulin antibodies, which cause the immune system to attack the thyroid and impair its ability to make hormones.22 Some patients with Hashimoto’s disease experience an initial period of hyperthyroidism, typically lasting one to two months, prior to a drop in thyroid hormone production. This phase of the disease is referred to as Hashimoto’s thyrotoxicosis, or hashitoxicosis.23 Healthcare-Associated Hypothyroidism (Iatrogenic Hypothyroidism) Hypothyroidism may arise as a consequence of medical treatment, either directly or indirectly. For instance, thyroid removal (thyroidectomy) due to cancer or persistent autoimmune thyroid disease is a cause of hypothyroidism. Similarly, treatment with radioactive iodine for thyroid conditions can lead to hypothyroidism. Radiation treatment to the neck or upper chest region can lead to hypothyroidism, whether it was initially intended to treat a thyroid condition or something else.24,25 Some drugs used for non-thyroid conditions may also lead to hypothyroidism. These include high-dose lithium carbonate, amiodarone, interferon alpha, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and some immunotherapies and targeted therapies for cancer, among others.26,27 Environmental and Infectious Causes Exposure to some environmental toxins may disrupt thyroid function and lead to hypothyroidism. For instance, exposure to flame retardants called polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) was linked to hypothyroidism in an observational study of Canadian women.28 A variety of infections, predominately of bacterial origin, can lead to thyroid inflammation and associated thyroid dysfunction.29 Other Diseases Sometimes, diseases not directly related to the thyroid but which cause systemic problems may lead to thyroid dysfunction. Blood cancers,30 iron overload (hemochromatosis),31 and scleroderma32 are examples of systemic diseases that may cause hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism due to non-thyroid diseases may be a consequence of the disease itself or a side effect of treatment for the disease; for example, children or adolescents treated for leukemia may develop treatment-related hypothyroidism later in life.30 Pregnancy Pregnancy considerably increases the metabolic demands on women’s bodies, and thyroid function needs to adjust to accommodate these demands. Sometimes, women develop thyroid dysfunction (either hypo- or hyperthyroidism) during pregnancy or after giving birth.33 Thyroid function usually returns to normal shortly after the woman gives birth unless she has a condition that can cause prolonged thyroid issues, such as iodine deficiency or autoimmune thyroid disease. Iodine Deficiency or Excess Iodine plays an important role in thyroid physiology. Too much or too little of this trace element can cause hypothyroidism. In the United States, iodine deficiency is uncommon. Excessive intake may occur due to overconsumption of iodine-rich foods like seaweed, or excessive supplementation (the upper limit for daily iodine intake in adults recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board in the United States is 1,100 mcg daily). People with underlying thyroid disorders may be more susceptible to thyroid dysfunction due to iodine excess.34 5 Testing Thyroid Function Several tests are available to assess different aspects of thyroid health35: Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to evaluate overall thyroid function; Total thyroxine (T4) to measure the total amount of T4 being produced by the thyroid; Free thyroxine (T4), a measure of the amount of bioavailable T4 not bound to transport proteins; Free triiodothyronine (T3) to measure the amount of unbound T3 available; Reverse T3 to measure the non-functioning form of T3; Thyroglobulin antibodies that can attack proteins involved in thyroid hormone production; Thyroid peroxidase antibodies that can attack an enzyme involved in thyroid hormone production Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Measuring TSH levels in the blood is the most common test of thyroid function. The normal range for TSH in healthy individuals is 0.45–4.5 µIU/mL.36 In general, TSH levels above 4.5 µIU/mL suggest hypothyroidism, and levels below 0.45 µIU/mL represent thyroid hormone excess; however, TSH levels typically increase with age. A longitudinal cohort study following 908 healthy people for 13 years found serum TSH levels increased with age, with the largest increases observed in those who had lower TSH levels at the start of the study. Researchers concluded that this increase was not the result of disease, but rather age-related changes in TSH bioactivity.37 A large cohort study involving over 150,000 healthy people over age 18 also demonstrated that TSH levels increased with age. The authors concluded that TSH reference ranges should be age-specific, including an age group of those over 70 years of age.38 Accordingly, the American Thyroid Association recommends a TSH target level of 4–6 µIU/mL in people older than 70.39 TSH production can also fluctuate with time of day, infection, and various other factors. In a survey of nearly 350,000 people published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, abnormal TSH levels spontaneously returned to normal in more than 50% of patients when the test was repeated at a later date.40 No single measurement of TSH should be considered diagnostic, and repeated testing may be necessary to guide treatment decisions. Tests for T4 and T3 Thyroid hormones can be tested in both their free and protein-bound forms. Tests for the protein-bound forms of T4 and T3 are generally referred to as total T4 and total T3, respectively; unbound forms are called free T4 and free T3. Each of these tests provides information about how the body is making, activating, and responding to thyroid hormones. The normal range for free T4 is 0.82–1.77 ng/dL,41 and for total T4 is 4.5–12.0 µg/dL.42 The normal range for free T3 is 2.0–4.4 pg/mL43 and for total T3 is 71–180 ng/dL.44 The feedback mechanisms by which the body regulates thyroid hormone levels are very sensitive, such that small changes in T4 levels lead to relatively large changes in TSH. Therefore, TSH is generally considered an excellent indicator of thyroid health in most people whose hypothalamus and pituitary gland are functioning normally. Because T4 is converted to T3, and changes in levels of binding proteins do not affect free T4 levels, free T4 is typically the hormone measured in a clinical setting.7 While T3 testing can help diagnose or determine the severity of hyperthyroidism, it is generally not as useful in someone with hypothyroidism as it is typically the last measure to become abnormal.35 Reverse T3 T4 can also be converted into an inactive form of T3 called reverse T3 (rT3), which does not have thyroid hormone activity.45 Certain individuals with apparently normal T4 and T3 hormone levels may still have some symptoms of hypothyroidism. This may be due to an excessive production of rT3, which may interfere with T3’s activity in the body. Stress and extreme exercise may lower thyroid hormone action by suppressing production of TSH and T3 and elevating rT3 levels.10,46 In general, rT3 levels are elevated during times of critical llness.47 In hypothyroid states, rT3 levels may be low due to a reduced production of T4.48 The reference range for rT3 is 9.2–24.1 ng/dL.49 Autoimmune Antibodies The body’s immune system uses antibodies to attack foreign particles, such as bacteria and viruses, but in autoimmune disorders, dysfunctional antibodies are produced that attack healthy tissues, cells, or biomolecules. In people with autoimmune thyroid conditions, antibodies interfere with normal thyroid cell function, resulting in either stimulation or suppression of thyroid activity. Antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (an enzyme involved in thyroid hormone production) and thyroglobulin (a protein in the thyroid gland from which thyroid hormone is produced) are relatively common antibodies that can compromise thyroid function.35 Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (also called TPO or thyroid microsomal antibodies) are normally found at levels of 34 IU/mL or less. In a person with hypothyroidism, the presence of elevated TPO antibodies suggests Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, the most common cause of overt hypothyroidism in the United States.50 Interestingly, celiac disease or sensitivity to gluten appear to correlate with increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease.51,52 Elevated thyroid antibodies are often associated with chronic urticaria, or hives. Studies report that roughly 30–57% of patients with chronic urticaria also have anti-thyroid antibodies.53,54 Some evidence suggests that treatment with T4 may improve the itching associated with urticaria, but is not recommend unless the patient has hypothyroidism.55,56 Basal Body Temperature Measuring basal body temperature can sometimes provide some insight into thyroid function, although it should only be used in conjunction with standard thyroid blood testing. Body temperature testing in the context of suspected thyroid issues was common before the development of accurate thyroid function blood tests. Basal body temperature is taken when the body is at complete rest, immediately after waking, and before beginning any activity. Normal basal temperature is roughly 97.6–98.6º F, and some integrative practitioners suggest that a five-day consecutive temperature reading below 97.6º F may suggest hypothyroidism. In a large longitudinal study of over 35,000 people whose temperatures were taken during routine medical visits, there was a correlation between TSH levels and body temperature. Hypothyroidism was linked to lower body temperatures.57 Nevertheless, there are many reasons for alteration of basal body temperature, so a thyroid panel blood test should be taken to more accurately evaluate thyroid function. Additional Testing Sometimes additional testing, such as biopsy or enzymatic studies, is required to establish a definite diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Major abnormalities of the thyroid gland detected in a physical exam can be further assessed by other procedures, including ultrasound or scintigraphy. Ultrasound may be used to more closely examine thyroid nodules (or lumps in the neck region) to determine if they are cancerous. Scintigraphy is a scan that can be used to look at the size and shape of the thyroid gland, as well as its position in the body. A small amount of radioactive iodine is used in this procedure to detect nodules and determine the cause of any thyroid issues. The radioactive iodine uptake test may also be useful in diagnosing thyroid issues. As the thyroid takes iodine from the bloodstream to produce T4, this action can be clinically measured by having a patient swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine. This allows the doctor to track where the iodine is going and measure thyroid function by determining how much radioactivity is taken up by the thyroid gland. The test is performed by taking a pill containing radioactive iodine. The thyroid is then scanned by a computer after several hours and usually again after a full day to assess the thyroid’s uptake of the radioactive iodine. A low level of radioactivity uptake is seen in those with hypothyroidism.35 6 Complications and Associated Conditions Complications of hypothyroidism include goiter, depression and other mental disorders, heart problems, infertility and pregnancy complications, and nerve damage. In rare cases, long-term untreated hypothyroidism can lead to a life-threatening condition known as myxedema coma, which is triggered by severe stress, sedative use, or infection. Myxedema coma is indicated by intense cold intolerance and drowsiness, followed by lethargy and unconsciousness.58 Fatigue and Weakness Fatigue is a near-universal symptom of low thyroid hormone levels, and many hypothyroid patients report fatigue, weakness, and decreasing quality of life. A decrease in thyroid hormone production and a disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis reduces energy production and metabolism, which results in tiredness.59 Gastrointestinal Manifestations Thyroid function and gut health are interrelated. The thyroid hormone T4 is converted to T3 in many tissues, including those of the gastrointestinal tract.60 Inflammation in the gut may inhibit this process. In addition, the intestinal microbiome plays a key role in immune function. When potential infectious agents penetrate the intestinal lining, the immune system may respond by producing antibodies, triggering an inflammatory response that may in some cases contribute to the development of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.61 Hypothyroidism is a common cause of constipation, which may result from diminished motility of the intestines. In some cases, this can lead to intestinal obstruction or an enlarged colon.62 This decreased gastric motility is also associated with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which may occur in nearly half of people who have hypothyroidism.63 Hypothyroidism is also associated with decreased motility in the esophagus, which can cause difficulty swallowing, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and vomiting. Other gastrointestinal manifestations of thyroid disease include abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and bloating. Depression and Psychiatric Disorders Changes in thyroid hormone levels can alter brain function, and thyroid dysfunction was long ago linked to mental disorders. Panic disorders, depression, and changes in cognition are frequently associated with thyroid disorders.64-66 In fact, hypothyroidism is often misdiagnosed as depression.67 Also, thyroid hormone replacement has been shown to enhance responsiveness to antidepressant drugs.68 Cognitive Dysfunction Thyroid hormones play a key role in brain function and neuronal metabolism. Patients with low thyroid function can suffer from a range of impaired cognitive functions, such as slowed thinking, decreased attentiveness, language difficulties, confusion, difficulty recalling names, and even hallucinations.69 Cognitive deficits from hypothyroidism are often reversible with treatment.59,70,71 Cardiovascular Manifestations Proper thyroid function is necessary for optimal cardiovascular health because thyroid hormones influence heartbeat, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Hypothyroidism is associated with increased cholesterol levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.72 Abnormal thyroid hormone levels can affect the strength and speed of heart contractions and the physiology of the vascular system.73 High cholesterol and atherosclerosis. Thyroid hormones aid in metabolizing cholesterol and synthesizing fatty acids in the liver. Hypothyroidism is characterized by hypercholesterolemia and an increase in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and apolipoprotein B.74 In one retrospective study involving 568 individuals, elevated TSH levels were associated with increased total cholesterol levels, independently of thyroid hormone levels.75 These changes in lipid metabolism accelerate atherosclerosis, and hypothyroidism has been found to increase the risk of coronary artery disease in proportion to the degree of TSH elevation.76 In addition, autoimmune-induced hypothyroidism has been associated with increased stiffness of the blood vessel walls.77 Thyroid hormone replacement may slow the progression of coronary heart disease by inhibiting the progression of atherosclerotic plaques.78,79 Homocysteine dysregulation. High blood levels of homocysteine, an amino acid derived from methionine, is an independent risk factor for heart disease.80 In one study, fasting and post-meal homocysteine levels were higher in 40 people with hypothyroidism compared with a control group. TSH was the strongest predictor of homocysteine levels, and thyroid hormone replacement decreased fasting but not post-meal homocysteine levels.81 A meta-analysis of 17 studies found that plasma homocysteine levels were elevated in patients with hypothyroidism compared with healthy subjects, and homocysteine levels decreased with T4 replacement in patients with subclinical and overt hypothyroidism.82 Elevated C-reactive protein. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation that circulates in the blood throughout the body. Elevated CRP is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.83 Hypothyroidism is associated with elevated CRP, and CRP levels have been shown to increase with progressive thyroid failure.84 One study found higher CRP levels and more pronounced carotid artery stiffness in people with hypothyroidism compared with those whose thyroid function was normal. This study also found that baseline CRP levels and carotid artery stiffness were correlated, and thyroid hormone replacement was independently associated with lower baseline CRP.85 Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a group of metabolic conditions that are risk factors for heart disease and type 2 diabetes, including abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, abnormal blood glucose levels, and high blood pressure. Research suggests hypothyroidism is associated with metabolic syndrome, and people with metabolic syndrome are at greater risk of developing hypothyroidism.86-92 Hypothyroidism is associated with insulin resistance, and severity of insulin resistance seems to increase with severity of hypothyroidism.93 Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with both overt and subclinical thyroid dysfunction.94,95 In a cross-sectional population-based study of over 29,000 people without previous thyroid problems, those with higher TSH levels had lower glomerular filtration rate, which is a measure of kidney function. Individuals with TSH levels in the highest third of the reference range had a 31% increased risk of advanced kidney disease compared with those whose TSH levels were in the lowest third.96 Importantly, appropriate treatment of thyroid disease may mitigate CKD progression in some cases.97 Reproductive System Manifestations Thyroid hormones regulate many aspects of ovarian function and reproductive health.98 Thyroid problems are the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age.99 Low levels of thyroid hormones can interfere with ovulation, which may cause menstrual irregularities and infertility.100,101 Proper treatment can restore a normal menstrual cycle and improve fertility.102 Hypothyroidism is also linked to miscarriage, premature delivery, low birth weight, fetal distress during labor, and gestation-induced hypertension. In males, hypothyroidism is associated with erectile dysfunction and problems with sperm motility.103 7 Thyroid Hormone Replacement The goal of thyroid hormone replacement is to replicate normal thyroid function in people whose thyroid is not producing adequate levels of thyroid hormones. This can usually be accomplished with medications that contain thyroid hormones (ie, replacement therapy).104 Thyroid hormone replacement therapy aims to relieve symptoms and decrease elevated TSH to normal levels.105 Levothyroxine (T4) Thyroid replacement usually begins with synthetic T4 (levothyroxine) preparations, such as Synthroid or Levoxyl, which work like natural T4. Low doses are usually used at first as a rapid increase in thyroid hormone levels may result in cardiac damage.106 Sometimes hypothyroid symptoms persist despite T4 treatment. In one study, T4 therapy was no more effective than placebo in improving cognitive function and psychological well-being in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism, despite improvement in free T3 levels.107 Another study compared T3 and T4 levels in hypothyroid patients treated with T4 alone against levels found in healthy people. In this study, T4 supplementation alone did not increase T3 to the same level as in healthy people.108 Combination T4 and T3 While T4 therapy is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism, combination therapy with synthetic T4 and T3 may be useful in some cases. Although the scientific evidence does not show a clear advantage of combination therapy versus T4 alone, some individuals may respond better to combination therapy.109-112 Importantly, excess T3 may cause adverse cardiac events in older individuals.113 One combination option is the drug Thyrolar (Liotrix), which combines synthetic T4 and T3 in a fixed 4:1 ratio. Another synthetic T3 option is liothyronine (Cytomel), which can be used in combination with a T4 drug. Desiccated Thyroid Extract Armour Thyroid, Nature-Throid, and Westhroid are prescription medications that contain desiccated porcine thyroid gland. Natural thyroid extracts have been used since 1892 and were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1939. Armour Thyroid and most other natural glandular preparations are made to standards approved by the United States Pharmacopoeia. Desiccated thyroid contains T4, T3, and another hormone known as calcitonin, which helps regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the blood. In a double-blind controlled study, 70 people with hypothyroidism were randomized to receive either desiccated thyroid extract or levothyroxine for 16 weeks. Each group then switched treatment arms for 16 weeks. Approximately half of the participants preferred the desiccated thyroid extract, while 19% preferred the levothyroxine. Desiccated thyroid extract use was also associated with greater weight loss. Both treatments normalized thyroid blood tests and there was no difference in symptom relief between treatment groups.114 Armour thyroid is preferred by some clinicians because it may achieve results in patients who fail to respond to levothyroxine alone. Some patients with hypothyroidism show greater improvements in mood and brain function if treated with Armour Thyroid rather than Synthroid.115 Note that some health conditions and the use of certain medications may interfere with desiccated thyroid extract. In particular, people with adrenal insufficiency, clotting disorders, diabetes, heart disease, and thyrotoxicosis should speak with a health care provider before beginning this medication.116 Ultimately, there may not be a single optimal way to normalize low thyroid hormone levels. The best treatment option may be to monitor thyroid levels through regular blood testing and adjust replacement therapy protocols to see what works best. Some people may prefer to begin with desiccated thyroid, while others may find it preferable to begin with T4 supplementation and then move to a combination T3-T4 therapy if they experience no improvements. It is important to work with a physician to determine which approach is best for you. Treating Subclinical Hypothyroidism Previously, the recommended treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism was T4 replacement therapy, with clinical management based on TSH levels, age, and presence of any other health conditions. However, elevated TSH levels may be more common in older people, which may lead to overtreatment in this population group. Recent research suggests untreated subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults without symptoms is not necessarily harmful in all cases, and there may be a lack of benefit from treatment in this age group.117 A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 737 adults over age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism found that levothyroxine treatment at a starting dose of 50 mcg, adjusted according to TSH levels, did not improve hypothyroid symptoms, tiredness, or quality of life measures.118 In another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 185 people over age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism, 96 were treated with levothyroxine (T4) therapy and the rest were given placebo for 18 months. There were no differences in carotid plaque thickness or atherosclerosis progression between the placebo and treatment groups.119 Guidelines issued in 2019 by a consortium of North American and European researchers and physicians made a strong recommendation against the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement in otherwise healthy adults. The guidelines, which were based on a review of the available evidence that included 21 clinical trials with data on over 21,000 participants, recommended against treatment unless the patient has overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH levels greater than 20 µlU/mL, is pregnant or trying to become pregnant, or presents other considerations strongly indicating treatment.120 In elderly patients (those over age 85) with TSH levels up to 10 µlU/mL, limited evidence supports no treatment.119 Treating aging people with thyroid hormone replacement when they are asymptomatic is not recommended, as it does not improve clinical symptoms such as depression, fatigue, body mass index, cardiovascular health, and quality of life. Subclinical hypothyroidism identified by blood testing should be monitored for progression and the presence of any symptoms, but not necessarily treated in most cases.120 In fact, mild subclinical hypothyroidism may have an anti-aging benefit, perhaps due to its influence on metabolic rate. A recent population-based cohort study involving over 7,000 participants examined the influence of thyroid function on cardiovascular disease and mortality. Researchers found that after age 50, those with low-normal thyroid function had a longer life expectancy (by 3.5 years) and longer expected survival free of cardiovascular disease (by 3.1 years) than those with high-normal thyroid function.121 However, this theory needs to be studied further. As of early 2020, the American Thyroid Association recommends a TSH target level of 4–6 µIU/mL in people older than 70 years.39 Absorption of Thyroid Hormone Medications Some foods and medications may interfere with the absorption or action of thyroid hormone medications. Too much dietary fiber can impair absorption of thyroid hormone medication.122 In addition, walnuts, calcium supplements, coffee,123 aluminum-containing antacids,124 ferrous sulfate (iron),125 calcium carbonate,126 soy,127 and possibly grapefruit juice128 may all decrease the absorption of thyroid hormone prescriptions. Medications to treat ulcers or lower cholesterol may also interact with absorption of thyroid medications.122 Therefore, doctor and pharmacist instructions for thyroid hormone medication use should be carefully followed. Many doctors simply advise patients to take thyroid hormone(s) alone, several hours before or after any food or medication. While many people take thyroid medication in the morning, some research suggests it is more effective to take it just before bed. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, 90 people with hypothyroidism took levothyroxine either before bedtime or 30 minutes before breakfast for a 3-month period. Subjects then switched times and took their medication on the other study schedule for three months. TSH was lower and thyroid hormone levels higher when the medication was taken at bedtime compared with morning intake.129 This study suggests taking levothyroxine at bedtime may enhance absorption, which may be useful in some patients. Taking thyroid medications at different times can also result in varying hormone levels, highlighting the need to take thyroid medication at the same time each day.130 8 Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Dietary Considerations Because the body needs iodine to make thyroid hormone, and iodine is relatively uncommon in the standard American diet, people who avoid iodized salt or adhere to a salt-restricted diet may become iodine deficient.131 Vegetarians are also at risk of developing iodine deficiency, especially if they eat food grown in low-iodine soil.132 Vegans who avoid sea vegetables are also at higher risk.133 On the other hand, excessive iodine intake may increase risk of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.134 Iodine or foods high in iodine, such as seaweed, are thought to be useful in treating hypothyroidism, but this is likely only true for people who are iodine deficient.133,134 The upper intake level of iodine for adults is 1,100 mcg per day. However, iodine ingestion at moderately higher levels is generally well tolerated in people without sensitivities or underlying thyroid issues.135 Anyone supplementing with high doses of iodine should periodically have a thyroid panel blood test to ensure their thyroid activity remains in a healthy range.136 Some foods contain goitrogenic substances that may reduce the utilization of iodine. These include cabbage,137 Brussels sprouts, and other cruciferous vegetables,138 as well as cassava,139 millet,140 and soybeans.141 The actual content of goitrogens in these foods is relatively low, however, and cooking significantly reduces their impact on thyroid function.142 It is unlikely that typical servings or supplements of cruciferous vegetables will have a measurable effect on thyroid function.143 For those with hypothyroidism, it may be advisable to consume raw, goitrogenic foods in moderation. Some doctors also recommend avoiding caffeine and gluten and limiting sugar, alcohol, and dairy to help control symptoms, although more studies are needed to validate these approaches.144 There has historically been some concern that soy and soy-containing foods may suppress thyroid function, but a 2019 meta-analysis of data from 18 studies concluded that soy consumption is not likely to impact thyroid function in most people. The analysis found that, while soy supplementation slightly increased TSH levels, free T4 and free T3 levels did not differ between soy-supplemented and control groups. However, there was some evidence that increases in TSH levels were slightly greater among people with subclinical hypothyroidism at baseline.145 The evidence available as of the time of this writing suggests moderate soy consumption through dietary intake or supplementation is unlikely to compromise thyroid function in people without thyroid dysfunction to begin with. People who have thyroid dysfunction should monitor their thyroid hormone levels periodically if they consume significant amounts of soy foods or supplements. Exercise Regular physical activity can improve muscle tone, maintain cardiovascular health, and support healthy energy levels. Exercise has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in people with hypothyroidism,146 and is important for preventing atherosclerosis and other complications of hypothyroidism.147 In one clinical trial, 10 women with subclinical hypothyroidism were assigned to engage in one hour of aerobic exercise three times per week for 16 weeks, and 10 similar women were assigned to remain sedentary. Those who exercised experienced improvements in exercise capacity, general health, and emotional health, as well as increases in mental and physical aspects of quality of life.148 Nevertheless, individuals suffering from hypothyroidism often experience reduced exercise capacity that does not necessarily resolve with thyroid hormone replacement therapy149 and have been found to exercise less than their healthy counterparts.150 Research suggests thyroid disease is associated with changes in cardiovascular physiology and the effects of exercise. One study with 108 participants reported that arterial stiffness and TSH levels decrease after exercise, but in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, the effect of exercise on arterial stiffness was reduced and the effect on TSH levels was greater.151 Studies have also reported a slower rise in heart rate during the transition from rest to physical activity in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism.152 Because people with hypothyroidism may adapt to cardiorespiratory conditioning less efficiently than those with normal thyroid function, they should remain aware of their exercise tolerance and modulate accordingly.153 Stop Smoking Cigarette smoking is believed to impact thyroid function and may play a role in the development of autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves’ disease), but evidence of a link between smoking and hypothyroidism is inconsistent, with some evidence suggesting a possible protective effect of smoking on Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.154 Nevertheless, because smoking is clearly associated with the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of hypothyroidism, as well as myriad other health problems, it is best for those with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism to avoid smoking. Manage Stress Stress may exacerbate thyroid dysfunction, and relaxation techniques may be a useful means of helping control symptoms of mild thyroid conditions. Stress appears to alter the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis.155 Stress and the immune system may interact in such a way that stress exacerbates the onset and/or progression of immune-mediated thyroid diseases.156 In a controlled clinical trial, an eight-week stress management program reduced anti-thyroid antibody levels compared to usual care in women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In addition, women in the stress management program reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.157 Although a link between severe stress and the onset of autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves’ disease) is better documented, at least one case of Hashimoto’s thyrotoxicosis followed by temporary hypothyroidism after a period of stress has been reported.158 More information is available in Life Extension’s Stress Management protocol. 9 Supplements to Support Thyroid Health Iodine The body needs the trace element iodine to make thyroid hormone and for optimal immune function. While present naturally in seaweed, dairy products, grain products, and eggs, more than 70 countries have programs in which iodine is added to salt to increase consumption and reduce the risk of iodine deficiency.159 Iodized salt has been sold in the United States since 1924, and it has proven effective at reducing iodine deficiency in areas where it was previously common, including the Great Lakes, Appalachian, and Northwestern areas. However, approximately 30% of the global population is still at risk of iodine deficiency.160 Iodine deficiency in pregnant women is associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and congenital deformities in the infant.160 During pregnancy, T4 production nearly doubles, causing increases in daily iodine requirements.161 Iodine-deficient pregnant women cannot sufficiently produce the thyroid hormones needed for proper neurological development of their growing babies. Infants born to women with iodine deficiency may have growth, hearing, or speech problems, or they may suffer from intellectual difficulties. In severe cases, underactive thyroid can cause hypothyroidism in the unborn child, or cretinism, which is characterized by brain damage, mental abnormalities, and growth problems. Worldwide, congenital hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency during pregnancy is the most common preventable cause of mental disabilities.160 Severe iodine deficiency is associated with goiter and hypothyroidism, as thyroid hormones cannot be adequately produced due to low levels of iodine. In cases of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency, increased activity of the thyroid gland may maintain thyroid function for a time, but long-term thyroid stimulation may increase the risk of goiter and hyperthyroidism.13 It is important to test thyroid function when supplementing with iodine, as both low and excessively high intake can contribute to thyroid dysfunction.135 Selenium Selenium, an essential micronutrient found in Brazil nuts, cereals, mushrooms, and some fish (eg, tuna, halibut, and sardines), is a potent antioxidant that helps regulate thyroid hormone production and immune function.162 The thyroid contains more selenium by weight than any other organ,163 and selenium is a necessary component of the enzymes that convert T4 into T3. Some evidence suggests selenium supplementation may help support efficient conversion of T4 into T3.164 Selenium also plays a role in protecting the thyroid gland from oxidative stress. The cells of the thyroid generate hydrogen peroxide during the process of making thyroid hormone. Selenium protects the thyroid gland from the oxidative damage caused by these reactions. Without adequate selenium, high iodine levels can destroy thyroid gland cells.165,166 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 230 pregnant women received 60 mcg per day of selenium from 12 weeks gestation until time of delivery. The women given selenium who were also positive for thyroglobulin antibodies at the beginning of the study exhibited small declines in TSH levels. Selenium supplementation was also associated with greater declines in free T4 levels than placebo at 35 weeks.162 A cross-sectional observational study of over 6,100 subjects from two Chinese counties (one with low and the other with adequate levels of selenium in the soil) found that the prevalence of thyroid disorders was lower in the adequate-selenium county, and low selenium status was associated with thyroid disease.167 A recent literature review regarding selenium’s role in promoting thyroid health found that selenium supplementation in those with autoimmune thyroiditis reduced antibody levels, improved presentation of the thyroid on ultrasound, and improved patient quality of life.168 In a placebo-controlled study, German researchers gave 200 mcg of sodium selenite daily to patients with Hashimoto's disease and high levels of thyroid peroxidase antibodies. After three months, the thyroid peroxidase antibody levels of the patients taking selenium decreased by 36% from their pre-treatment values. Quality of life and antibody levels improved more in selenium-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients.169 However, Austrian researchers were unable to duplicate the results of the earlier study when they did not limit the study population to those with high levels of thyroid peroxidase antibodies. They suggested that selenium supplementation might be of greater benefit to patients with higher disease activity.170 Vitamin A Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin necessary for several human cellular processes. Vitamin A refers to a family of structurally related retinoic acids, including retinol, retinal, retinyl esters (including retinyl palmitate), and beta-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A).171 Vitamin A, found in liver, fish oil, green leafy vegetables, milk, and eggs, plays a central role in immune function, vision, and reproduction.172 Vitamin A is important for healthy thyroid function, and vitamin A deficiency is associated with thyroid dysfunction.173,174 Vitamin A deficiency may change the structure of the thyroid gland and disrupt the delicate and critical signaling network of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis.175,176 Conversely, inadequate thyroid function can impair the conversion of beta-carotene into the biologically active vitamin A.177 In 84 healthy premenopausal women in Iran, supplementation with 25,000 IU of retinyl palmitate daily reduced TSH blood levels. The authors suggested vitamin A supplementation may reduce the risk of subclinical hypothyroidism in this population.178 It should be noted, however, that long-term supplementation with high doses of pre-formed vitamin A is not generally recommended. The vitamin A precursor, beta-carotene, is better suited for daily supplementation. L-Tyrosine This non-essential amino acid plays an important role in thyroid hormone synthesis. Thyroxine (T4) is produced in the thyroid via iodination of tyrosine. Thus, theoretically, tyrosine insufficiency could undermine adequate thyroid hormone production. However, tyrosine deficiency is rare because it is found in the diet and because the body can make tyrosine from another common amino acid, phenylalanine. Although mechanistic data support the notion that tyrosine supplementation may support thyroid function, no well-designed clinical trials have shown supplementation with L-tyrosine to be an effective treatment for hypothyroidism.1,179 Nevertheless, the nutrient is generally well-tolerated and readily available in many thyroid health formulas. Ashwagandha Extract Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), also called winter cherry or Indian ginseng, is one of the most important herbs in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.180 Extracts of ashwagandha have been used for centuries in the Ayurvedic system as an adaptogen to alleviate physical and mental stress.181 Extracts of ashwagandha have been prepared from the leaves, berries, and roots of the plant. Among the important chemical compounds found in ashwagandha are oligosaccharides and withanolide glycosides.182-184 Research indicates ashwagandha extract may promote optimal thyroid health. In one randomized controlled trial, 50 subjects with high TSH levels received either 600 mg ashwagandha or placebo for eight weeks. Those in the treatment group experienced normalized serum thyroid indices, including T3, T4, and TSH levels.185 Researchers studying the effects of ashwagandha extract on bipolar disorder also collected data on thyroid function. In this study, three individuals were treated for eight weeks with 500 mg per day of a standardized ashwagandha extract. All three ashwagandha-treated patients experienced decreases in TSH and increases in T4 levels of 7%, 12%, and 24% compared with baseline, indicating improved thyroid function. The researchers concluded that, although further study is necessary, ashwagandha may be useful in treating subclinical hypothyroidism.181 Korean Ginseng Extract Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng, family Araliaceae) is a native perennial plant of Asia and North America that is an integral part of traditional Asian medicine. It has been in use for thousands of years and may have implications for diabetes, pulmonary disease, fatigue, and immune function.186-189 Korean ginseng contains a wide range of bioactive components, including at least 112 saponins, most of which are glycosides of triterpenoid aglycones. The class of saponins called ginsenosides are believed to be important bioactive compounds in Korean ginseng.190 Research suggests Korean ginseng can reduce concentrations of rT3. In a placebo-controlled trial in 54 adults with congestive heart failure and abnormally low levels of T3 and T4, administration of intravenous ginseng extract resulted in increased T3 and T4 levels as well as reduced rT3 levels two weeks after infusion.191 Korean ginseng has also been shown to improve symptoms of cold hands and feet, which are sometimes associated with suboptimal thyroid function. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 80 women with cold hypersensitivity of the hands and feet were given 500 mg Korean ginseng daily for eight weeks. At the end of the trial, subjects had substantially higher skin temperature in both their hands and feet.192 Hypothyroidism affects fertility, sexual health, and menstrual cycle regularity. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 32 menopausal women, 3 grams of Korean red ginseng per day improved sexual function and sexual arousal (a common complaint in those with thyroid dysfunction) compared with placebo.193 In hypothyroid rats, Panax ginseng improved reproductive hormone levels, including luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol, prolactin, and progesterone. The mechanism of action was proposed to be scavenging free radicals.194 Findings from another study involving hypothyroid rats suggested ginseng extract may improve cellular metabolism and energy production.195 An enzymatically fermented ginseng extract has been developed that provides a highly bioavailable ginsenoside metabolite. Compared with non-fermented ginseng, the fermented preparation resulted in 15.5 times greater absorption over 24 hours and a 27-fold higher peak concentration in blood, which was reached in roughly a quarter of the time (3.3 hours vs. 12.0 hours).196 Several studies have demonstrated that ginsenoside metabolites may have higher biological activity than unmetabolized ginsenosides, which are believed to be less bioavailable. Orally consumed unmetabolized ginsenosides are inefficiently metabolized by stomach acid and liver enzymes, but fermented ginseng may provide greater bioavailability of key ginseng compounds.196-198 Guggul Extract Guggul, the gum resin of the mukul myrrh tree (Commiphora mukul or Commiphora wightii), has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat tumors, obesity, lipid disorders, low metabolism, and other conditions.199 Evidence suggests guggul is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that also supports cardiovascular health.200 Guggulsterones are thought to be the most important bioactive compounds in guggul extract.199,201,202 Some preclinical data suggest guggul enhances thyroid function by supporting the conversion of T4 to T3.203 A laboratory study showed an extract of Commiphora mukul significantly increased iodine uptake, T3 resin uptake, protein-bound iodine, and free T4 levels in thyroid tissue.204 Rats given guggulsterone derived from Commiphora mukul exhibited an increase in thyroid gland activity, as evidenced by increased iodine uptake and enhanced thyroid enzyme function.205 An extract of Commiphora mukul reversed experimentally-induced hypothyroidism in mice.203 This effect appears to have been mediated through enhanced production of T3 and a reduction in hepatic oxidative stress.203,206 Zinc Zinc, an essential mineral that plays a role in immune functioning, cellular metabolism, and wound healing, is found in red meat, poultry, beans, and nuts.207 Zinc, copper, and selenium are necessary for production of thyroid hormones, and deficiencies of these minerals may result in hypothyroidism. On the other hand, thyroid hormones are required for zinc absorption, and hypothyroidism may result in zinc deficiency.208 Zinc plays complex roles in regulating various aspects of thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, including the conversion of T4 to T3.209 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 68 women with hypothyroidism received either 30 mg zinc and 200 mcg selenium, zinc and placebo, selenium and placebo, or placebo alone for 12 weeks. Free T3 increased in both groups taking zinc, which suggests zinc alone or with selenium may promote proper thyroid function.210 In a group of patients with low levels of free T3 and normal T4, but elevated rT3 and mild-to-moderate zinc deficiency, oral zinc supplementation for 12 months normalized serum free T3 and total T3 levels, decreased rT3 levels, and normalized TSH levels.211 Note: Chronic, very high doses of zinc interfere with copper absorption and can lead to serious and potentially fatal copper deficiency.212-214 Thus it is advised to take copper when supplementing with high-dose zinc. Iron Iron, an essential mineral commonly found in foods such as lean meats, seafood, nuts, and beans, is a necessary component of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, and plays a role in growth, metabolism, and development.215 Iron deficiency hinders manufacture of thyroid hormone by reducing the activity of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase. In one study, 29.8% of women with subclinical hypothyroidism were iron deficient compared with 9.8% of the control group.216 In a cross-sectional study of over 220 Nepalese children, anemic and iron-deficient children were more likely to have thyroid issues, including hypothyroidism.217 In another study of over 3,000 women of childbearing age in China, there was a clear association between iron deficiency and low serum T4 levels in both pregnant and non-pregnant women.218 Iron-deficiency anemia decreases, and iron supplementation improves, the beneficial effects of iodine supplementation.166 Treating 51 iron-deficient hypothyroid patients with levothyroxine along with iron improved their iron-deficiency anemia more than treatment with iron alone.219 Vitamin E Vitamin E, a fat-soluble compound with natural antioxidant properties, plays a role in immune function, gene expression, and cellular metabolism.220 Vitamin E may reduce oxidative stress caused by hypothyroidism. Much of the research involves work with animal models. In one study, vitamin E protected animals from increased oxidation and thyroid cell damage.221 In another study, vitamin E reduced the amount of thyroid cell replication in animals with induced hypothyroidism.222 In yet another controlled animal trial, levothyroxine replacement therapy paired with vitamin E supplementation helped restore the cognitive decline seen in hypothyroidism via a decrease in oxidative stress.223 Vitamin D Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps support bone growth and remodeling, enhance calcium absorption, promote immunity, and reduce inflammation. It is found in fatty fish and fish liver oil, and is produced naturally with exposure to sunlight.224 Vitamin D deficiency is associated with autoimmune thyroid disease, including Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In addition, impaired vitamin D signaling pathways have been indicated in thyroid cancer.225 A correlational study found serum vitamin D and calcium levels were significantly lower in 30 hypothyroid patients than in 30 healthy controls.226 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with over 200 hypothyroid participants, TSH levels decreased in those taking 50,000 IU/week vitamin D for 12 weeks.227 When adjusted for age, the presence of thyroid antibodies associated with Hashimoto’s disease was inversely correlated with vitamin D levels in a group of 642 participants (244 males and 398 females) in a study in New Delhi, India.228 Moreover, other evidence suggests vitamin D deficiency is more common among individuals with thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules compared with the general population.229 More long-term, randomized, controlled trials are necessary to determine the therapeutic role vitamin D may play in thyroid disease. Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 aids in red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis, and neurological functions. B12 can be found in a variety of dietary sources, including fish, meat, eggs, and milk.230 Hypothyroid patients are often vitamin B12 deficient. In one study, 190 patients with thyroid antibodies were more likely to have hemoglobin, iron, and vitamin B12 deficiencies and had higher homocysteine levels compared with 190 controls.231 In another study that included 116 hypothyroid patients in Pakistan, approximately 40% of participants were found to have B12 deficiency.232 A study involving multiple sclerosis patients in Saudi Arabia noted that low B12 levels were correlated with low T3 and T4 levels.233 Although this evidence suggests there may be a link between B12 deficiency and low thyroid function, it is not yet known whether B12 supplementation can improve thyroid function.234 Turmeric (Curcuma longa) Extract Turmeric, a plant related to ginger and native to Southeast Asia and India, is a revered plant traditionally used for a variety of health concerns.235 Recent research indicates turmeric may play a role in maintaining thyroid health. Turmeric contains curcumin and related compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions and may help regulate thyroid and other hormone production and activity.236 In one retrospective study of over 2,000 people in Pakistan, people with diets high in turmeric had fewer goiters.237 In animal research, treatment with turmeric extract reduced the impact of chemically induced hypothyroidism on thyroid weight, T4, T3, and cholesterol levels.238 Results of a similar trial on rats treated with vitamin E and curcumin showed that treatment prevented a decline in basal body temperature and protected the liver.239 Disclaimer and Safety Information This information (and any accompanying material) is not intended to replace the attention or advice of a physician or other qualified health care professional.

An enlarged thyroid, known a a goiter, may also occur in some people. This protocol reviews thyroid function and what happens when there is too much thyroid hormone activity in your body. You will learn about causes of hyperthyroidism, including Graves' disease, and strategies for treating the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism. Selenium plays a key role in protecting the thyroid gland, and supplementation can help ensure the thyroid has access to adequate levels of this nutrient. What Does the Thyroid Do? The thyroid is an organ in the neck responsible for regulating metabolism by controlling the rate of oxygen and calorie conversion to energy. The metabolic rate of every cell in the body is controlled by thyroid hormones, particularly T3. The thyroid produces the hormones T3 and T4 in response to stimulation by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced in the pituitary gland. The thyroid requires iodine and L-tyrosine to synthesize T3 and T4. Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid produces too much thyroid hormone, significantly accelerating metabolism. Hyperthyroidism has detrimental effects on the body. Fortunately, thyroid function tests (e.g. TSH, T3, and T4) can help identify an underlying thyroid condition as well as help direct proper treatment to improve symptoms. Nutrients such as selenium and coenzyme Q10 may help support healthy thyroid function. What are Signs and Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism? Sudden weight loss Rapid heartbeat Thinning hair and nails Frequent urination Shortness of breath Sweating Nervousness or irritability If left untreated, hyperthyroidism can lead to a goiter. Extreme hyperthyroidism can cause elevated heart rate and blood pressure, extreme exhaustion, and high fever. This condition sharply increases the risk of stroke and heart attack, and it can be fatal in up to half of all cases. What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Hyperthyroidism? Anti-thyroid drugs, such as methimazole or propylthiouracil, to inhibit the production of T3 Radioactive iodine to destroy the overactive thyroid gland Surgical removal of the thyroid Βeta-blockers to control high blood pressure and increased heart rate Which Nutrients Support Thyroid Health? Note: Certain supplements, including iodine and biotin, should be used with caution by those with hyperthyroidism. On the other hand, there’s evidence suggesting the following supplements may be helpful in cases of hyperthyroidism. Selenium. This micronutrient is an essential component for converting T4 into T3 and for overall thyroid health. A literature review found that supplementing with selenium improved antibody levels and quality of life in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with the autoimmune thyroid disease called Graves’ disease. Some research indicates supplementation might be beneficial for those with hyperthyroidism, including a study that showed better vitamin D status was associated with a lower relapse rate for those being treated for Graves’ disease. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). CoQ10 deficiency has been suggested as a factor in complications of hyperthyroidism, including heart failure. Preclinical research and a small clinical study indicate CoQ10 supplementation may help improve cardiac performance in those with hyperthyroidism. Magnesium. Magnesium levels are decreased in patients with hyperthyroidism and may lead to an increased risk of complications following thyroid surgery. Vitamin E. Many of the damaging effects of hyperthyroidism are related to oxidative stress, so supplementing with antioxidants is an area of research. In a preclinical study, vitamin E and curcumin improved antioxidant gene expression in animals with hyperthyroidism. Bugleweed. Lycopus europaeus, or bugleweed, has been used traditionally to relieve symptoms of hyperthyroidism. It may work by inhibiting antibodies associated with Graves’ disease. Preliminary clinical studies indicate it may help normalize thyroid lab values in patients with mild hyperthyroidism. Lemon Balm. Some laboratory research suggests lemon balm may prevent antibodies associated with Graves’ disease from stimulating the thyroid. 2 Introduction The thyroid is a small gland located at the base of the neck that produces thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones exert considerable influence over most aspects of human physiology.1,2 Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much of these hormones. Because thyroid hormones affect so many parts of the body, hyperthyroidism can have serious consequences. An estimated 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disease. Globally, up to 1% of the population has hyperthyroidism.3,4 While people of all races and ages can develop thyroid issues, women are more likely than men to have thyroid problems: one in eight women will develop a thyroid problem during her lifetime.2 Stress, unhealthy diet, and even normal aging can compromise healthy thyroid function. Because thyroid hormones have an up-regulating effect on metabolism, hyperthyroidism can lead to nervousness and irritability, weight loss, a racing heart, sleep disturbances, and vision issues among other concerns.5 Graves’ disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is an autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to make antibodies that trigger excessive thyroid hormone production.6 Graves’ disease and other types of hyperthyroidism are generally treated with anti-thyroid drug therapy or thyroid ablative (destructive) therapies, which include radioactive iodine and surgery.5,7,8 Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, occurs when the thyroid does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, depression, weight gain, cognitive deficits, and several other concerns.9 Many people who require treatment for hyperthyroidism will develop hypothyroidism as a result of that treatment and require thyroid hormone supplementation to maintain healthy thyroid hormone levels.10 Please refer to the Hypothyroidism protocol for more information about hypothyroidism. In this protocol, you will learn how the thyroid gland works and what happens when there is too much thyroid hormone activity in your body. You will also learn how simple blood tests can assess thyroid function, and what treatments are available for hyperthyroidism. In addition, you will discover several integrative interventions and dietary and lifestyle changes that can support healthy thyroid function. 3 Background: Understanding the Thyroid Thyroid hormone production is regulated by two specific brain regions: the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. To ensure stable levels of thyroid hormones, the hypothalamus monitors circulating thyroid hormone levels and responds to low levels by releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH stimulates the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn stimulates the thyroid gland to increase triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) secretion. When thyroid hormone levels increase, pituitary production of TSH decreases, which slows the release of hormones from the thyroid gland.11-13 This interconnected system is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. On a blood test, low TSH levels almost always indicate hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid. This occurs when the thyroid is making too much T3 and T4, which suppresses the release of TSH by the pituitary gland. On the other hand, high TSH levels generally indicate hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland. In this condition, the pituitary keeps releasing TSH into the bloodstream in order to stimulate T3 and T4 production. In rare cases, abnormal TSH levels are a reflection of problems with the pituitary gland rather than the thyroid.1,14 The Primary Thyroid Hormones: T4 and T3 Thyroxine, or T4, produced solely by the thyroid gland, is the more common thyroid hormone in the blood. However, triiodothyronine, or T3, is the more biologically active thyroid hormone. T3 is formed by the removal of one of T4’s four iodine atoms. This process is mediated by selenium-dependent enzymes.15 T4 is found in the body in two forms: bound and free. Free T4 is not bound to any proteins and is able to enter into body tissues. Bound T4 is attached to proteins that render it biologically inactive. More than 99% of T4 in the body is in the bound, inactive form.16 High blood levels of T4 typically indicate hyperthyroidism and low levels are associated with hypothyroidism. However, pregnancy and oral contraceptive use can elevate thyroid hormone levels, while severe illness and certain medications can lower T4 levels.11,12 Elevated levels of cortisol, as seen during times of stress and in conditions such as Cushing’s syndrome, lower TRH, TSH, and thyroid hormone levels.17,18 Cold temperatures increase TRH levels, which is thought to be an intrinsic mechanism that helps keep people warm in cold weather.19 Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism affects about 1.3% of the U.S. population (0.5% clinical and 0.7% subclinical).19 In most people with hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, which can significantly accelerate the body's metabolism. Typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism include sudden weight loss, a rapid heartbeat, thinning hair and nails, frequent urination, shortness of breath, sweating, nervousness or anxiety, and irritability. An enlarged thyroid gland, known as a goiter, may occur in some people. Goiters are characterized by neck swelling and discomfort and a sore throat, and severe cases may result in problems swallowing and breathing.21 Subclinical Hyperthyroidism Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a condition marked by low TSH levels but normal circulating levels of thyroid hormones. This means the overactive thyroid is not producing excessive amounts of thyroid hormones as long as stimulation via TSH is abnormally low. People with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms compared with those seen in overt hyperthyroidism. Subclinical hyperthyroidism also increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, bone loss and osteoporotic fractures in older adults when TSH levels are very low or undetectable.22,23 Since treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism does not appear to be universally beneficial, recommendations for treatment are limited to those with the lowest TSH levels. For those with moderately low TSH levels, the decision to treat is based on individual and clinical factors. For example, there is evidence to suggest some individuals over age 65 with subclinical hyperthyroidism may benefit from treatment, even if they are not symptomatic.22 4 Causes and Risk Factors In most cases of hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland is overactive even though it is not being stimulated by TSH. This is known as primary hyperthyroidism. Secondary hyperthyroidism is a less common condition caused by abnormally high levels of TSH, such as due to a TSH-producing pituitary tumor, which overstimulates the thyroid gland.24 The focus of this protocol is primary hyperthyroidism. Risk factors for hyperthyroidism include family history, female gender, and having certain medical conditions such as type 1 diabetes and adrenal insufficiency. In addition, emotional or physical stress, pregnancy, smoking, and being under 40 increase the risk of Graves’ disease, the number one cause of hyperthyroidism.25-28 Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disorder that involves production of thyrotropin (TSH) receptor antibodies (TRAb) and, more specifically, thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI). These antibodies bind to and activate TSH receptors, disrupting normal regulation of thyroid function. Thyroid activity is then accelerated, increasing circulating levels of thyroid hormones in the blood.29 This condition is characterized by rapid heartbeat, sweating, nervousness, tremors, muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, increased appetite, and sudden weight loss.30 One telltale sign is Graves’ ophthalmopathy (also called orbitopathy), in which antibodies damage TSH receptors in the eye sockets and surrounding muscles, resulting in discomfort, visual problems, an inability to move the eyes, and bulging eye balls.31 Less commonly, hyperthyroidism is caused by conditions other than Graves’ disease, including toxic multinodular goiter, in which non-cancerous growths in the thyroid cause the gland to swell and make too much T4. This occurs more frequently in iodine-deficient regions. Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid), which may occur in pregnancy or in the context of some autoimmune conditions, is another uncommon cause of hyperthyroidism.3,23 5 Complications and Associated Conditions An overactive thyroid can cause anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, and irritability. Goiter, or thyroid enlargement, is common in people with Graves’ disease and can occur with other causes of hyperthyroidism as well.5,26-28,32,33 Research suggests diagnosed but untreated hyperthyroidism is associated with depression and anxiety.26,27,34 Complications of hyperthyroidism include heart problems, such as a rapid heartbeat, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure; weak bones; skin changes; vision problems (including double vision) in those with Graves’ ophthalmopathy; and pregnancy complications, including preterm birth, stillbirth, congenital malformations, and pre-eclampsia.7,30 Infants of mothers with Graves’ disease have a risk of being born with hyperthyroidism, a condition known as neonatal hyperthyroidism.7 Extreme hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis, can progress to a life-threatening condition called thyroid storm. In this medical emergency, often brought on by stress, pregnancy, or thyroid trauma, patients suffer from an elevated heart rate and blood pressure, extreme exhaustion, and high fever. Thyroid storm sharply increases a patient’s risk for stroke and heart attack, and is fatal in up to 25% of cases, even with the best medical care.33 6 Testing Thyroid Function Several tests are available to assess different aspects of thyroid health35: Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to evaluate overall thyroid function; Total thyroxine (T4) to measure the total amount of T4 being produced by the thyroid; Free thyroxine (T4) , a measure of the amount of available T4 not bound by transport proteins; Free triiodothyronine (T3) to measure the amount of unbound T3 available; Antibody tests to identify underlying autoimmune causes of thyroid dysfunction Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Measuring TSH levels in the blood is the most common test of thyroid function. The normal range for TSH in healthy individuals is 0.45–4.5 µIU/mL.36 TSH levels below the normal range generally represent hyperthyroidism. Most cases of overt hyperthyroidism are marked by undetectable TSH levels (<0.1 μIU/L), but levels of 0.1–0.45 μIU/L may indicate subclinical hyperthyroidism. Undetectable levels in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are associated with a greater risk of progression to overt hyperthyroidism.22,23 TSH production can also fluctuate with time of day, infection, and various other factors. In a survey of nearly 350,000 people published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, abnormal TSH levels spontaneously returned to normal in more than 50% of subjects when the test was repeated at a later date.37 No single measurement of TSH should be considered diagnostic, and repeated testing may be necessary for optimal treatment. Tests for T4 and T3 Thyroid hormones can be tested in both their free and protein-bound forms. Tests for the protein-bound forms of T4 and T3 are generally referred to as total T4 and total T3, respectively; unbound forms are called free T4 and free T3. Each of these tests provides information about how the body is making, activating, and responding to thyroid hormone. The normal range for free T4 is 0.82–1.77 ng/dL, and the range for total T4 is 4.5–12.0 µg/dL.38-41 The feedback mechanisms by which the body regulates thyroid hormone levels are very sensitive, such that small changes in T4 levels lead to relatively large changes in TSH. Therefore, TSH is generally considered an excellent indicator of thyroid health in most people whose hypothalamus and pituitary gland are functioning normally. Because T4 is converted to T3, and changes in levels of binding proteins do not affect free T4 levels, free T4 is typically the hormone measured in a clinical setting.13 The reason changes in binding protein levels typically do not affect free T4 levels is that the feedback mechanisms governing thyroid hormone levels either increase or decrease thyroid hormone release in response to fluctuations in free thyroid hormone levels.16 However, in some cases of hyperthyroidism, T4 levels are normal and T3 levels are high, so measuring both T3 and T4 may be useful in diagnosing or determining the severity of hyperthyroidism. The reference ranges are 2.0–4.4 pg/mL for free T3 and 71–180 ng/dL for total T3.40,41 Autoimmune Antibodies Normally, the body’s immune system uses antibodies to attack foreign particles, such as bacteria and viruses, but in autoimmune disorders, dysfunctional antibodies are produced that attack healthy tissues, cells, or biomolecules. In people with autoimmune thyroid conditions, antibodies interfere with normal thyroid cell function, resulting in either stimulation or suppression of thyroid activity. In a hyperthyroid patient, testing for the presence of thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI, a type of TRAb) can help secure a diagnosis of Graves’ disease.29 Some people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity are at increased risk for developing autoimmune thyroid disease.43 Elevated thyroid antibodies are often associated with chronic urticaria, or hives. Studies report that roughly 30–57% of patients with chronic urticaria also have anti-thyroid antibodies.44 Some of these patients manifest Graves’ hyperthyroidism, but more of them have autoimmune hypothyroidism.44,45 Basal Body Temperature Measuring basal body temperature can sometimes provide some insight into thyroid function, although it should be used in conjunction with standard thyroid blood testing. Body temperature testing in the context of suspected thyroid issues was common before the development of accurate thyroid function blood tests. Basal body temperature is measured when the body is at complete rest, immediately after waking, and before beginning any activity. Normal basal temperature is roughly 97.6–98.6º F. Some integrative practitioners suggest that basal body temperature readings below 97.6º F on five consecutive days may be a sign of hypothyroidism. Although it is less common for practitioners to recommend basal body temperature monitoring to identify hyperthyroid conditions, some suggest that a series of mildly elevated readings may be a sign of hyperthyroidism. Additional Testing Sometimes additional testing, such as biopsy or enzymatic studies, are required to establish a definite diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Major abnormalities of the thyroid gland detected in a physical exam can be further assessed by other procedures, including ultrasound or scintigraphy. Ultrasound may be used to more closely examine thyroid nodules (or lumps in the neck region) to determine if they are cancerous. Scintigraphy is a scan that can be used to look at the size and shape of the thyroid gland, as well as its position in the body. A small amount of radioactive iodine is used in this procedure to detect nodules and determine the cause of any thyroid issues. The radioactive iodine uptake test may also be useful in diagnosing thyroid issues. As the thyroid takes up iodine from the bloodstream to produce T4, this action can be clinically measured by having a patient swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine. This allows the doctor to track where the iodine is going and measure thyroid function by determining how much radioactivity is taken up by the thyroid gland. The test is performed by taking a pill containing radioactive iodine. The thyroid is then scanned by a computer after several hours and usually again after a full day to assess the thyroid’s uptake of the radioactive iodine. A high level of radioactivity uptake is seen in those with hyperthyroidism, and a low level is seen in those with hypothyroidism.3,29,35,47 7 Treatment of Hyperthyroidism Initial treatment of hyperthyroidism focuses on controlling dangerous manifestations of excessive thyroid hormone activity that can cause immediate problems. Longer-term management aims to suppress excessive production of thyroid hormone and keep thyroid hormone activity in a healthy range. The overall strategy will depend on what caused hyperthyroidism in the first place, and to what extent, if any, excessive thyroid signaling has already caused damage. Other factors that will inform the treatment strategy include the affected person’s age, health history, and, for women, desire to become pregnant. Acute Management: Beta Blockers Because pronounced hyperthyroidism can rapidly cause serious health problems, the aim of initial treatment is to counter high-risk manifestations of hyperthyroidism, such as heart rhythm irregularities. Beta blockers are typically used in the initial treatment of symptoms caused by pronounced hyperthyroidism. These drugs are commonly used to treat high blood pressure levels, but are also effective in relieving symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism such as tremors, rapid heart rate, and heart palpitations.30,48-51 Beta blockers are recommended in most patients with severe symptoms of hyperthyroidism, especially the elderly. Calcium channel blockers may be an acceptable alternative for initial symptom control in people who cannot tolerate beta blockers.7,52 Long-Term Management Treatment options for reducing excess thyroid hormone levels include51: anti-thyroid drugs, which prevent the thyroid from making hormones; radioactive iodine, which destroys overactive thyroid cells, causing the thyroid to shrink and decreasing levels of thyroid hormone; and surgery, in which the thyroid gland is removed. The choice of treatment depends on the patient’s age and overall health, severity and cause of hyperthyroidism, and patient preference. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy to re-establish normal levels of T4, T3, and TSH may be needed following treatment in which thyroid tissue is destroyed or removed (thyroid ablation).5,26-28 In a long-term randomized trial, 179 people with Graves’ disease received treatment with either anti-thyroid medications, radioiodine, or surgery. An assessment 14‒21 years after treatment assignment determined that there were no significant differences in quality of life among the three treatment arms.53 In another trial, 131 people with Graves’ hyperthyroidism were randomized to receive medication, radioiodine treatment, or thyroid surgery, while all patients received levothyroxine (T4) as necessary. TSH antibodies were measured before treatment and for five years after therapy to determine TSH-receptor autoimmunity. Most people who took medication or had surgery experienced remission of TSH-receptor autoimmunity, while fewer people who had radioiodine therapy went into remission.54 Anti-thyroid drugs (thionamides). Anti-thyroid drugs (thionamides), such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil, prevent the thyroid gland from making too much T3 and T4. This allows symptoms of hyperthyroidism to improve within a few weeks to a few months, but treatment may need to be continued for up to a year or more. Some people may experience allergic reactions to these medications, and one possible side effect is liver damage.5,28 Agranulocytosis, a severe condition in which the number of white blood cells drops to a critical level, is a rare side effect of anti-thyroid drugs, especially when high doses are used.23 Thionamides and beta blockers are recommended for those with significant symptoms of hyperthyroidism and those at risk of complications (older individuals or people with cardiovascular disease). This may be followed by radioiodine or surgery.52,55 About 52% of hyperthyroidism patients treated with anti-thyroid drugs relapse. For these individuals, thyroid-ablative treatment with radioactive iodine or surgery may be needed.56 A study that followed 1,186 Graves’ disease patients for 6–10 years found more than half of those initially treated with anti-thyroid drugs later required thyroid-ablative treatment, and only 40% achieved normal thyroid hormone levels without thyroid hormone replacement therapy by the end of the study.57 Long-term low-dose treatment with anti-thyroid medication may be an alternative to thyroid-ablative treatments in patients whose hyperthyroidism returns after initial treatment. In a non-randomized retrospective study, 238 patients with Graves’ disease who experienced a relapse after anti-thyroid medication therapy either received radioiodine therapy followed by levothyroxine (T4) replacement (114 people) or low-dose methimazole (2.5‒7 mg/day) (124 people). The low-dose methimazole treatment was safe and effective, and was associated with less thyroid dysfunction than radioactive iodine treatment.58 Radioactive iodine. Radioactive iodine therapy involves orally consuming sodium iodide (I-131). I-131 is absorbed into the thyroid gland where it emits local radiation and damages thyroid cells over a period of 12 to 18 weeks. The damaged cells shrink, which decreases levels of thyroid hormones. Residual iodine is generally eliminated from the body within a period of weeks to months. Radioactive iodine treatment carries a small risk of thyroid storm due to radiation-induced thyroiditis. In addition, a small percentage of people treated with radioactive iodine experience thyroid swelling and sore throat.23,56 Radioactive iodine therapy is unsuccessful in about 8% of cases, as the remaining functional thyroid tissue sometimes overproduces thyroid hormones after treatment.23,56 In such cases, the treatment can be repeated or surgery may be performed. More often, radioactive iodine therapy induces a hypothyroid state, and many people who utilize this treatment require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy to maintain healthy thyroid hormone levels.5,28,32,59 Radioiodine is the most common treatment for hyperthyroidism in the United States, and research has supported its use for over 70 years.60,61 Importantly, those who undergo radioiodine treatment should reduce exposure to other people for a period after taking the radioiodine, especially pregnant women. This helps reduce others’ exposure to radiation. The dose of radioiodine a patient receives informs how long he or she should limit contact with others. Consult your physician for more information. Surgery (thyroidectomy). A thyroidectomy involves the removal of the thyroid gland. This is typically performed in people who cannot tolerate anti-thyroid medications, have large goiters, or are not candidates for radioactive iodine therapy. Potential risks of this surgery include damage to the vocal cords or parathyroid gland. Those who undergo this surgery require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy to support normal levels of thyroid hormone.5,28,32 A meta-analysis of 35 studies involving over 7,200 subjects concluded that thyroidectomy is highly successful in treating hyperthyroidism in people with Graves’ disease.62 Research involving 99 people with Graves’ disease suggests thyroidectomy early in the course of treatment is not associated with complications, but rather improved biochemical recovery, as compared with delayed surgery.63 Treatment-Induced Hypothyroidism Patients who undergo thyroid-ablative treatment like radioactive iodine or surgery typically experience overt or subclinical hypothyroidism after treatment. In most cases, treatment-induced hypothyroidism is permanent, but in some cases, thyroid function fluctuates over time.10 Thyroid hormone replacement therapy is used to manage treatment-induced hypothyroidism.3,9,64 This approach aims to replicate normal thyroid activity, prevent symptoms, and maintain normal TSH levels.65 Please refer to the Hypothyroidism protocol for more information about thyroid hormone replacement therapy. 8 Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Dietary Considerations In a large study that surveyed over 65,000 Seventh Day Adventists in the United States and Canada, eating a vegetarian diet was correlated with a lower risk of hyperthyroidism: those who excluded all animal products (vegans) were least likely to report having hyperthyroidism, and had 52% fewer hyperthyroidism cases than among omnivores. Vegetarians whose diets included fish (pesco-vegetarians) and whose diets included eggs and dairy products (lacto-ovo-vegetarians) also had less hyperthyroidism compared with omnivores, but these differences were smaller than for vegans.66 The possible association between vegetarian diet and lower risk of hyperthyroidism may be due to the high amounts of compounds such as antioxidants, phytochemicals, and prebiotic fibers present in plant foods. These types of compounds appear to protect against autoimmune diseases, including Graves’ disease—the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.67 Adequate iodine intake via foods such as iodized salt, seaweed, seafood, dairy products, eggs, blackstrap molasses, and some bread and grain products is necessary for healthy thyroid function. Although iodine deficiency is better known as a cause of hypothyroidism, mild hyperthyroidism is reported to be more common in iodine-deficient regions, suggesting low iodine intake may trigger excessive thyroid activity in some people.33 Eating excessive amounts of iodine-rich foods can also trigger increased thyroid hormone production in susceptible individuals. Cases have been reported in which daily intake of seaweed, particularly kelp, has resulted in iodine and thyroid hormone excess, but cases of iodine overdose from supplements are more common.68 Hyperthyroidism patients preparing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment may be instructed to eat a low-iodine diet.69,70 On the other hand, adequate iodine intake during treatment with anti-thyroid drugs was found in one study to help prevent relapse.71 Vegetables in the Brassica family, such as broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts, are well known to contain compounds called goitrogens that can interfere with the thyroid’s ability to absorb iodine. Goitrogens are less active after cooking, but eating large amounts of raw Brassicas may reduce production of thyroid hormones.72 While people with hypothyroidism are often encouraged to limit intake of raw Brassica vegetables, those with hyperthyroidism are sometimes told to increase raw Brassica consumption. In order to achieve large quantities of goitrogens, some individuals with hyperthyroidism consume fresh raw Brassica vegetable juices, such as cabbage juice; however, there is no evidence at this time that high intake of raw Brassica vegetables can effectively treat hyperthyroidism. Exercise Thyroid hormones have a profound effect on cardiovascular function and performance. Chronic hyperthyroidism is associated with heart rhythm disturbances such as atrial fibrillation, changes to the heart muscle, and heart failure. In patients with hyperthyroidism, the heart’s ability to respond to increasing oxygen demands is diminished, resulting in reduced exercise capacity.72,73 Even those with subclinical hyperthyroidism have been found to have decreased cardiac capacity for physical activity, but cardiac capacity can improve after treatment.73,74 Because of the importance of physical activity on all parameters of health, hyperthyroidism patients should work with their health care provider to implement a regular exercise program that supports healthy cardiac function after appropriate therapy for their thyroid condition. Stress Management Stress may exacerbate thyroid dysfunction, and relaxation techniques may be a useful means of helping control symptoms of mild thyroid conditions. Stress appears to alter the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.75 Stress can be a trigger for the onset and exacerbation of Graves’ disease and may worsen the response to treatment.76 In one study, chronic social stress was associated with lower chance of recovery after one year of anti-thyroid drug therapy for a new diagnosis of Graves’ disease in women, but not men. In fact, women with the highest “daily hassles” scores were almost four times more likely to still have hyperthyroidism after a year of treatment than women with the lowest scores.77 Please refer to Life Extension’s Stress Management protocol for more information. Stop Smoking Cigarette smoking is believed to impact thyroid function and may play a role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease, particularly Graves’ disease. Smoking may induce changes in thyroid function tests, including a decrease in TSH levels and an increase in some thyroid hormone levels.78 One cohort study of over 4,000 participants in the sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2014‒2015) suggested a dose-related effect of smoking status (based on urinary cotinine levels) on thyroid function and autoimmunity. Urinary cotinine levels were positively associated with thyroid antibodies in male participants. The authors suggested smoking may influence many metabolic processes, including hormone synthesis, release, binding, transport, and storage.79 9 Supplements to Support Thyroid Health Certain supplements should be used with caution by those with hyperthyroidism. These include iodine and biotin. Excessive iodine intake can increase thyroid hormone production and trigger dangerous exacerbation of hyperthyroid symptoms.68 Taking large amounts of biotin can interfere with blood tests assessing thyroid function and may result in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.80 On the other hand, a few nutritional and herbal supplements have scientific or historical evidence suggesting they may be helpful in cases of hyperthyroidism. L-carnitine L-carnitine is an amino acid derivative that plays a critical role in mitochondrial energy metabolism. L-carnitine deficiencies have been linked with malfunction of several different organs, including the heart, liver, and thyroid.113 In thyroid-hormone-responsive cell lines, carnitine inhibited the nuclear uptake of thyroid hormones, which suggests that L-carnitine may limit tissue and organ susceptibility to excess thyroid hormone levels, potentially decreasing the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.113,114 In clinical studies, L-carnitine has been shown to both reverse and prevent symptoms of hyperthyroidism.115,116 In a study of 50 women receiving TSH-suppressive L-T4 therapy, treatment with 2 or 4 g/day L-carnitine was shown to improve clinical and biochemical markers of hyperthyroidism relative to placebo.115 More recently, L-carnitine has been used in patients with Graves’-disease-related hyperthyroidism experiencing thyroid storms. Several case studies have reported the success of this approach, with L-carnitine both preventing progression and resolving symptoms in patients experiencing severe thyroid storms.117-119 L-carnitine may also be combined with other agents to address subclinical hyperthyroidism. After one month of treatment with L-carnitine and selenium, patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism had significant reductions in thyroid symptoms, which returned to baseline after treatment was discontinued.116 Selenium Selenium, an essential micronutrient found in Brazil nuts, cereals, mushrooms, and some fish (eg, tuna, halibut, and sardines), is a potent antioxidant that helps regulate thyroid hormone activation and deactivation, as well as immune function.81,82 The thyroid contains more selenium by weight than any other organ,83 and selenium is a necessary component of the enzymes that convert T4 into T3.84 Selenium also plays a role in protecting the thyroid gland from oxidative stress. The cells of the thyroid generate hydrogen peroxide during the process of making thyroid hormone, and selenium protects the thyroid gland from the oxidative damage caused by these reactions. Without adequate selenium, high iodine levels can destroy thyroid gland cells.85,86 A recent literature review regarding selenium’s role in promoting thyroid health found that selenium supplementation in those with autoimmune thyroiditis reduced antibody levels, improved presentation of the thyroid on ultrasound, and improved patient quality of life.83 In those with mild Graves’ ophthalmopathy, selenium supplementation may improve eye movement and delay disease progression.83,87 Vitamin D Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps support bone growth and remodeling, enhance calcium absorption, promote immunity, and reduce inflammation. It is found in fatty fish and fish liver oil, and is produced naturally with exposure to sunlight.88 Vitamin D deficiency is associated with autoimmune thyroid disease, including Graves’ disease. In addition, impaired vitamin D signaling pathways have been indicated in thyroid cancer.89 Multiple studies have demonstrated a correlation between low vitamin D levels and risk of Graves’ disease and Graves’ ophthalmopathy.90-93 One study noted better vitamin D status was associated with lower risk of relapse in Graves’ disease patients treated with anti-thyroid drug therapy.94 In a randomized clinical trial, taking 2,800 IU (70 mcg) of vitamin D daily for nine months led to reduced arterial stiffness in Graves’ disease patients who were vitamin D insufficient at the beginning of the trial, but not those with sufficient vitamin D status. In addition, vitamin D lowered in-office blood pressures compared with placebo, but did not impact 24-hour blood pressures.95 A case report described a patient with Graves’ disease and vitamin D deficiency who was treated only with vitamin D supplementation. The patient was given 4,000 IU (100 mcg) vitamin D per day for six months, followed by 50,000 IU (3,750 mcg) per month for five months, after which 25-hydroxy vitamin D, TSH, free T4, and free T3 levels were all normal and thyroid antibodies were no longer detectable.96 Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is needed for normal mitochondrial function in cells throughout the body and is especially concentrated in heart muscle cells. CoQ10 is depleted in conditions of high metabolic demand, including hyperthyroidism, and CoQ10 deficiency has been proposed as a contributing factor in complications of hyperthyroidism such as heart failure.97-99 Findings from animal research suggest CoQ10 supplementation can prevent the damaging effects of high thyroid hormone levels on heart muscle.100 In a preliminary clinical trial that included 12 women with untreated hyperthyroidism and related signs of heart failure, taking 120 mg CoQ10 daily for one week led to improvements in cardiac performance.101 Magnesium Magnesium levels have been found to be decreased in patients with hyperthyroidism.102 In addition, surgical thyroid removal can further reduce magnesium levels, which may be linked to increased risk of long-term surgical complications.103 One report described cases in which supplementation with approximately 100 mg magnesium citrate and 200 mcg selenomethionine per day, along with stress reduction interventions, improved thyroid gland structure and reduced anti-thyroid antibody levels in women with Graves’ disease over a period of two to four years.104 Vitamin E Vitamin E, a fat-soluble compound with natural antioxidant properties, plays a role in immune function, gene expression, and cellular metabolism.105 Many of the tissue effects and symptoms of hyperthyroidism are related to oxidative stress, and vitamin E may reduce cell and tissue injury by scavenging free radicals.106-108 In rats with experimental hyperthyroidism, supplementing with vitamin E plus curcumin (a carotenoid from turmeric) normalized expression of genes related to antioxidant enzyme production in liver cells.109 Whether or not vitamin E and other antioxidant supplements can have beneficial effects on the course of hyperthyroidism remains to be determined. Bugleweed Bugleweed (Lycopus europaeus) is a European herb used historically to relieve symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Although the exact mechanisms behind its effects are not fully understood, bugleweed extract has been found to inhibit autoantibodies associated with Graves’ disease in the laboratory110 and increase urinary excretion of T4 in subjects with Graves’ disease.111 Findings from preliminary clinical trials suggest it may help reduce symptoms and normalize lab values in patients with mild hyperthyroidism.111,112 Lemon Balm Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is a calming herb used traditionally to treat anxiety and insomnia. Laboratory research suggests lemon balm extract may prevent binding of Graves’ disease-associated antibodies, preventing them from stimulating the thyroid.110 Clinical research is needed to assess its potential benefit in the treatment of hyperthyroidism.

Too frequently, physicians overlook a malfunctioning thyroid as a cause for fatigue, lack of concentration, and even hair loss! Eva Cwynar, MD, explains why it is essential to test your thyroid, especially as you age. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on July 2020. Written By LifeExtension Book Excerpt. Too often, uninformed physicians diagnose fatigue, difficulty concentrating, unwanted weight gain, and hair loss in their patients as the inevitable results of aging. This blanket diagnosis may be flat-out wrong. In fact, your lack of energy and inability to focus may have nothing at all to do with your age! You may simply need to adjust a thyroid malfunction. The thyroid affects every cell in your body and is a key regulator of your energy, metabolism, heart, and bones. In her new book, The Fatigue Solution, Eva Cwynar, MD, urges readers to have their thyroid checked with a simple blood test. Check Your Thyroid When was the last time you went to the doctor and he checked your thyroid? You would know if he did, because to manually examine the thyroid, you have to step behind the patient and put your hands around the patient's neck as if you were going to choke her. That's the only way you can feel for the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland, which is located at the front of the neck near the collar bone (right where a man would wear a bowtie). When I introduce this examination to my patients, I always get the same reaction: ""Why are you doing that? No doctor has ever done that to me before!"" You can't breathe without the thyroid, you can't think without the thyroid, you'd constantly be constipated without a thyroid, and yet it's way down at the bottom of the list of possible causes of some very common symptoms. Are you losing your hair? It could be your thyroid. Is your voice getting hoarse and raspy? It could be your thyroid. Are you always cold? It could be your thyroid. Are you having trouble concentrating? It could be your thyroid. And if it is, it's something that is easily fixed. That's why I get so angry and excited at the same time about the subject. People are suffering needlessly, some for many years, when they could be leading much more energetic, productive lives with the right diagnosis and treatment. The Thyroid: What, Where, and How One woman in eight will develop a thyroid disorder during her lifetime. And by the time they reach age 60, more than 20 percent of American women will have a thyroid disorder. I personally believe the numbers may be even higher because so many women haven't been officially diagnosed. The simplest way to describe your thyroid and its function is to compare it to a furnace that is run by a thermostat (the pituitary gland). Together, they regulate how much energy and stamina you have on a daily basis. The amount of thyroid hormone you have affects how well you have slept, how you feel when you get up in the morning, and how effectively you will make it through your day. Thyroid function affects every cell in the body. It is the main regulator of basal metabolism, which is the amount of energy needed to maintain essential physiologic functions when you are at complete rest, both physically and mentally. If your thyroid gland is not producing optimally, your cells cannot properly take in the nutrients they need, receive the right amount of oxygen, or get rid of waste materials efficiently. Thyroid hormones also affect your heart, muscles, bones, and cholesterol, to name just several of its jobs. Introducing the 3s and 4s There are two main hormones produced by the thyroid: Triiodothyronine, known as T3 Tetraiodothyronine, known as T4 You may have noticed a portion of the word ""iodine"" in each of the hormones above. That's because the function of the thyroid gland is to take iodine, found in many foods, and convert it into thyroid hormones. Thyroid cells are the only cells in the body that can absorb iodine. These cells combine iodine and the amino acid tyrosine to make T3 and T4. There is one more factor we have to mention to complete this process, and that is Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain and gives that gland its thermostat-like function. So the thyroid is the furnace that provides ""heat"" in the form of the T3 and T4 hormones and the pituitary gland is the thermostat that goes on and off according to the amount of heat in the body. TSH tells the thyroid to raise or lower the heat. The process goes like this: T3 and T4 travel through the bloodstream, producing heat The pituitary gland senses the heat; the thermostat shuts off; TSH production slows down The body cools as the level of thyroid hormones decrease The furnace produces more heat When your body temperature drops, your metabolic rate drops, too. You produce less energy, and you store more calories as fat—in other words, you gain weight. You also suffer from fatigue, irritability, and the inability to concentrate. Too Few Hormones The most common form of thyroid disorder is hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid is not producing enough of its hormones. Approximately 25 million people suffer from hypothyroidism, and about half of them are undiagnosed. It is usually found in women, particularly older women; the percentage of patients with hypothyroidism is greater for women for each decade of age after age 34. That is because thyroid hormone production decreases with age. One of the reasons that hypothyroidism often goes undiagnosed is that symptoms usually appear slowly over time, and they may appear to be signs of normal aging. Symptoms include: Anxiety and nightmares Difficulty losing weight Dry skin Easy weight gain Impaired concentration and memory Menstrual irregularities Mood swings Severe fatigue Thinning eyebrows Thinning hair Yellow skin from poor conversion of beta carotene to vitamin A There are many women who have no symptoms and feel perfectly healthy, and yet, when tested, are diagnosed with hypothyroidism. These women need to be treated as well as those who have symptoms, because their slowed metabolism will result in adverse effects down the line. If you are not treated for hypothyroidism, you may have a heart attack because of the metabolic dysfunction that your thyroid has produced over the course of many years. That's the reason testing is so important, especially as you get older and the likelihood of hypothyroidism increases. In the United States, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is called Hashimotos's thyroiditis. This is an autoimmune disorder—in other words, the body's immune system attacks thyroid tissue. The tissue eventually becomes so inflamed that the gland can't make enough thyroid hormone. The pituitary gland, noticing the lack of these hormones, reacts by turning up the thermostat and sending out TSH to raise hormone production. But that's no longer possible because of the inflammation of the gland. Thyroid cells start to enlarge and multiply, which will eventually cause nodules and swelling. Hashimosto's disease, like many other autoimmune diseases, is most often inherited, usually from mothers to daughters. Too Many Hormones When everything is functioning properly, the thyroid and pituitary work together to produce just the right amount of hormones. But there are times when the thyroid malfunctions and produces either too many or too few hormones. When the thyroid becomes overactive and produces too many hormones, you end up with a condition called hyperthyroidism. This condition affects 10 times more women than men, and usually occurs in women under 40. Here are some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism: Being nervous, moody, weak, or tired Excessive sweating Fine hair that is falling out More bowel movements than usual Rapid heartbeat Red, itchy skin Shaky hands Shortness of breath The most common form of this disorder is Graves' disease, which was made ""famous"" when first lady Barbara Bush was diagnosed with the illness in 1989 (coincidentally, her husband, President George H. W. Bush, was later diagnosed with the same disease, as was their dog, Millie). One of the stranger symptoms of Graves' disease is known as ""frog eyes"" where the eyeballs get pushed forward and protrude because fat builds up behind them. Graves' disease can be life threatening and can lead to heart problems if left untreated. This type of hyperthyroidism is an autoimmune disease that is genetically inherited. It causes mood and body changes when the immune system ""mistakenly attacks"" the thyroid gland, causing overproduction of the thyroid hormones. People who have hyperthyroidism are often confused when they hear the diagnosis. My patients tell me, ""I thought if I had hyperthyroidism, I'd be full of energy and losing weight and able to multitask like crazy! How come I'm so tired all the time?"" Although this line of thinking is correct in most situations, the answer in other situations is that the overactive thyroid is burning out your body. It's affecting other organs (such as the adrenal gland) that are being compromised. It's like an engine that is constantly revving at a very high speed and going nowhere. Eventually, the parts will burn out and the engine will stop going. Another type of hyperthyroidism is subacute thyroiditis, which involves swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland and is thought to be produced by a virus that usually follows an infection of the upper respiratory tract. It is often treated with anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen to decrease both the production and the release of thyroid hormone. A beta-blocker (usually given for heart disease or hypertension or even tremor or anxiety) is also given to slow down the heart rate and make the patient more comfortable until the situation spontaneously resolves itself. This disease usually lasts for only a few months and heals itself naturally, but if left untreated can be life threatening. Testing Your Thyroid The good news is that there is a simple blood test that can measure thyroid function to determine whether or not your hormone production is normal (the ""gold standard"" is to test one of many thyroid functions, which is the production of thyroid stimulating hormone). The bad news is that if you get five doctors in a room, you'll get five different opinions on what is ""normal"" and what is not. In my practice, I don't rely on blood tests alone because over the years I have found that what is normal for one person, and even normal for the population at large, may be abnormal for someone else. I use other tests as well (such as one that tests for particular antibodies) and palpation (examining with my hands) of the thyroid to determine its size, shape, firmness, or location to check for abnormalities. Internists may do this as well, but since they do not palpate the gland as frequently as endocrinologists do, they may miss the diagnosis. Some doctors may recommend an ultrasound of the thyroid as well. Here's where the tricky part comes in. As of 2010, at most laboratories in the United States, the official normal reference range for the thyroid stimulating hormone blood test runs from approximately .5 to 5.0 (measured in micrograms per deciliter). Reference range is what determines—for the vast majority of physicians, who rely on blood tests almost exclusively—whether or not thyroid disease is even diagnosed at all, much less treated, and when diagnosed, how it is treated. In January of 2003, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommended that doctors ""consider treatment for patients who test outside the boundaries of a narrower margin based on a target TSH level of 0.3 to 3.0."" Even though many years have passed since the new range was established, some doctors use it and some don't. The issue that it raises is this: One study found that using a TSH upper normal range of 5.0, approximately 5 percent of the population is hypothyroid. However, if you use 3.0 as the top of the normal range, approximately 20 percent of the population would be hypothyroid. That means that millions of patients with hypothyroidism are being undiagnosed and untreated. There are now more effective blood tests that provide a complete picture of how well the thyroid produces T4, how well the body converts T4 into T3, how much of the active form T3 is created, and whether there are significant anti-thyroid antibodies present. A complete panel would also include levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4. You might want to suggest to your doctor that she use the free T3 and T4, as the ""regular"" T3 and T4 totals may not be as accurate. One of the problems with thyroid testing is that they are typically not on the list of things that are regularly checked in a standard or even a more comprehensive blood test panel. Just like the guidelines we have established for testing for colon cancer, for instance, beginning at age 50 and not before, it's not until you reach the age of 65 that your doctor will routinely request thyroid testing. When you complain to your doctor about putting on weight, losing a little hair, fatigue, lack of libido—most of the time you get the same response: ""Well, you are getting older, it's to be expected."" If you are suffering from any of these symptoms and your doctor doesn't suggest testing, bring it up yourself. Most doctors, even though they may be skeptical, will order the testing if you insist. I Keep Forgetting What You Said About Thyroids… Here is a frightening thought: many doctors have diagnosed patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, when in reality what they had was a thyroid disorder. A 2008 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that older women who had levels of TSH that were either too high or too low had more than twice the risk of Alzheimer's disease than those with more moderate levels (the same was not true of men). This is another reason that testing your thyroid become part of your standard testing routine as you get older! Your Numbers, Your Doctor, and You Here's an important point to remember if do get tested and your numbers are not ""normal."" Hypothyroidism has a huge range, from very mild to quite severe. Not only that, one person whose TSH tests result in a reading of 2.5 may feel perfectly fine, while another person with the same reading may be suffering a battery of symptoms. The numbers and the symptoms don't always correlate. Most of the time, taking thyroid medication will cure your symptoms and you will feel better within a matter of days; by six weeks on the medication you'll have a very good idea of how it's working. Unless you tell your doctor how you're feeling, he or she has nothing to go on but your test results. You need to share with your doctor if your symptoms are getting better (or worse), and you need to be consistently retested to see how your medication is working. Your numbers may go back to normal, but if you're still not feeling well it's your responsibility to tell your doctor so that more tests can be taken or your medication can be tweaked until you find what works best for you. It is possible, however, to go overboard with thyroid medication. Some of my patients have the ""if some is good, more is better"" attitude. However, too much thyroid medication can stress out the adrenal glands, which will then overproduce cortisol as well as dysregulate (impair) the ratio of cortisol and DHEA and epinephrine and norepinephrine. This will leave you more fatigued than you were in the first place, because the rest of your body's systems will not be able to produce the energy needed to keep up with your now revved-up thyroid. Iodine Deficiency and the Thyroid Since iodine is needed for the production of thyroid hormone, and the body does not make iodine, we have to get through what we eat. It is commonly found in foods such as saltwater fish, seaweed, sea vegetables, shellfish, bread, cheese, and iodine-containing multivitamins. Iodized salt is now the main source of iodine in the American diet, but only about 20 percent of the salt America eats contains the micronutrient. Increasingly popular ""designer"" table salts, such as sea salts and Kosher salts, usually do not have much iodine. However, the majority of salt intake in the United States comes from processed foods, and food manufacturers almost always use noniodized salt in processed foods. Add to that the ubiquitous warnings against using too much salt because of our ever-pressing issues of hypertension, congestive heart disease, and other coronary artery diseases, and iodine deficiency becomes a real threat for some people in the United States. Whereas, just a few years ago iodine was mandated by the FDA to be included in salts (and was for decades), now most medical advice states that, due to the large variety of food sources available from all over the world, iodine in salt is no longer necessary in the United States and other Western countries. Iodization of salt is now voluntary in America. It appears that iodine intake has declined by 50 percent in North America in the past 30 to 40 years and the anticipated rate of future hypothyroid cases has risen dramatically. Before the 1920s, iodine deficiency was common in the Great Lakes, Appalachian, and Northwestern regions of the United States and Canada; however, the introduction of iodized salt has virtually eliminated the problem in those areas. Iodine deficiency can lead to goiter, hypothyroidism, and even to mental retardation in infants and children (the term ""cretin"" comes from the fetus not getting enough iodine while in the mother's womb). Worldwide, the number one cause of hypothyroidism is iodine deficiency, which remains a public health problem in 47 countries, and about 2.2 billion people (38 percent of the world's population) live in areas with iodine deficiency. An article in The Lancet in 2008 stated that, ""According to WHO, in 2007, nearly 2 billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake, a third being of school age. Thus iodine deficiency, as the single greatest preventable cause of mental retardation, is an important public health problem."" There are many different types and brands of iodine supplementation available over the counter. It's important, however, that you get guidance from your doctor or health professional before taking any iodine supplementation. If you take too much, you can develop hyperthyroidism.   Thyroid Treatments One of the first thyroid treatments that was commercially available was Armour Thyroid, which was a natural product made of desiccated pig and cow thyroid glands put into pill form. It is still available today. It contains both T3 and T4 hormones. It fell out of favor over the years because quality control of this medication was difficult. In recent years, however, production has become much more stable and it is back in use again. Your doctor may prescribe Armour Thyroid if you have had problems with a synthetic therapy, or if you or your doctor prefer natural products. The most commonly prescribed synthetic drug for hypothyroidism is called levothyroxine, known under the brand names Synthroid, Levothroid, Levoxyl, and Unithroid. A more recent addition is a drug called Tirosint, which is made in Switzerland and distributed in the United States. It has fewer additives and preservatives than the other synthetic medications, so it may be a good choice for you if you find you're allergic to any of the other brands. Another popular drug is called Cytomel, which contains only T3. Synthroid contains only T4, which must be converted to T3 by the body. Some people respond better to T3 preparations because they have trouble converting T4 into T3; those people fare better with either a combination of T3/T4 or T3 alone. The mineral selenium decreases the antibodies that form in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thereby decreasing the inflammation, which is why I recommend selenium to everyone who has hypothyroidism. It is also useful as a messenger in the brain helping with the communication between the thyroid and the adrenal gland. How to Take Thyroid Medication Although thyroid problems are usually easily treated with medication, it can be tricky to take because of how thyroid hormones react with other substances. Tell your doctor about all the prescription and over-the-counter medications you use because there are many other medicines that can affect thyroid medications. This includes vitamins, minerals, and herbal products. There are also some substances that block the absorption of thyroid medications (e.g., soy, calcium, iron, some mood altering prescription medications), which is why some patients don't see the results they'd like. Do not take thyroid medication within two hours of eating as food may delay or reduce its absorption. Do not take estrogen, birth control pills, or hormone replacement therapy in the pill form at the same time you're taking thyroid medication (you can take them in the same day, just not at the same time of the day). Any form of oral estrogen may be a problem if taken at the same time as thyroid because both estrogen and thyroid hormone share the same binding globulin (a protein to which thyroid hormone binds in the blood and from which it is released into tissue cells) in the liver. If you take them both at the same time, you're not absorbing as much of either one. This does not apply if you are taking other forms of birth control, such as the patch or the NuvaRing; transdermal (through the skin) hormone replacement; or sublingual (dissolving directly into the bloodstream from drops or lozenges into the mouth) hormone replacement. That's another reason why I treat my menopausal women who have hypothyroidism with a hormone CREAM instead of the standard oral prescription pill. Calcium also prevents absorption of thyroid medication, so they should not be taken at the same time. Iron, whether alone, or as part of a multivitamin or prenatal vitamin supplement, interferes with thyroid hormone absorption. You should not take your iron supplements or your vitamins with iron at the same time as your thyroid hormone, and should allow at least two hours (four being the optimal time frame) between taking them. Your Thyroid and Menopause Although it is very rarely mentioned, your thyroid and your reproductive cycle are closely related. Thyroid problems can cause irregularities in the menstrual cycle, and even infertility in extreme cases. As you get older, these problems can become exacerbated. In fact, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a woman to be in an artificial premature perimenapause or even throw her into menopause. It's important to remember that the thyroid is part of the overall endocrine system, and when any of this system's hormones get out of balance, all of the parts suffer. So when you go through times where hormonal imbalance is more than likely—such as pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause—your thyroid is also more than likely to get out of whack as well. That is why women over 50 should be tested for thyroid problems every few years (earlier if you have a family history) and woman over 65 should be tested annually. Any woman of any age should be tested at any time and as frequently as needed if she has symptoms of hypothyroidism. Your doctor will then be able to determine whether you need thyroid hormone medication, and/or iodine or other supplementation. In dealing with thyroid problems, it's important to find a doctor who will listen to your symptoms and be open to the newest research, the latest reference range recommendations, inclusive testing, and who understands that each patient will react differently to various treatments. You may need to see an endocrinologist, someone who is trained in the art and science of working with hormones, to get the results you need and deserve. It makes me frustrated to know that there are so many women who suffer unnecessarily for so many years. I hear it over and over again, how finally being diagnosed and treated for thyroid problems has changed women's lives. They have accepted their ""lot in life"" for so long that they have almost forgotten what it's like to have energy and focus and fun in their lives. I'm here to tell you, don't just accept it. Get tested. Check your results. Ask for a copy of your labs. See a specialist. Don't settle—if you don't agree with your doctor, go somewhere else. You know your body better than anyone else. Listen to it and get your life and your health back in your hands. The ""Check Your Thyroid"" Jump Start Tip Taking Matters into Your Own Hands—or Armpits. If you suspect you're having thyroid problems and you want to check yourself out at home, there is a simple test you can do called the basal temperature test. Here are the steps: Get a basal thermometer (the kind you can use under your tongue). Leave it overnight on your bedside table. First thing in the morning, before you get out of bed, tuck the thermometer under your armpit and lay completely still for 10 minutes. Set a timer before you begin so that you don't have to move around to look at the clock. Record your temperature for there to five days. If your temperature is consistently below 97.8°F, you may have a thyroid problem, and you should have yourself evaluated by a health professional. Remember, thyroid disease is not just about fatigue, it can ultimately affect your morbidity as well as your mortality. Take control, but do it with the assistance of an expert.

It usually arises from the thyroid isthmus 4) Thyroid gland is in level witha) C2 - C5b) C5 - T1 c) C2 - T2d) T1 - T4 b) C5 - T1The thyroid is ensheathed by the ## pretracheal layer of deep cervical fascia. The pretracheal fascia binds the thyroid to the trachea, and it moves with the trachea on swallowing. ## When there is thyroid enlargement, the attachment of the sternothyroid muscle to the trachea limits upward expansion of each lobe. Inferior expansion may extend into the superior mediastinum, compressing the trachea and veins at the thoracic outletTHE THYROID EXAM • Look at the thyroid region. If the gland is quite enlarged, you may actually see it.• To find the thyroid gland, first locate the thyroid cartilage (Adams Apple). This is a mid-line bulge towards the top of the anterior surface of the neck. The thyroid gland lies approximately 2-3 cm below the thyroid cartilage. • If you're unsure, give the patient a glass of water and have them swallow as you watch this region. Thyroid tissue, along with all of the adjacent structures, will move up and down with swallowing. The normal thyroid is not visible. It is not worth going through this swallowing exercise if you don't see anything on gross inspection.• Anterior palpation can be performed by using the thumb of one hand. Posterior palpation is done standing behind the seated patient with the tip of index, middle and ring fingers.• If enlargedo Is it symmetrically enlarged? o Is the enlargement unilateral or bilateral? o Are there discrete nodules within either lobe? If nodules are palpated, determine their shape, size, position, translucency, and consistency.o If the gland feels firm, is it attached to the adjacent structures (i.e. fixed to underlying tissue, consistent with malignancy) or freely mobile (i.e., moves up and down with swallowing)? • If there is concern regarding malignancy, a careful lymph node exam is important.• A midline mass high in the neck, which rises further when the patient extends the tongue, is typical of a thyroglossal duct remnant or cyst.• A systolic or continuous bruit over the thyroid suggests Graves' disease. 5) Method of choice to accurately estimate size of the thyroid gland isa) Palpationb) Ultrasound c) Radioiodine d) TSH scanning Size of the thyroid gland can be estimated by ultrasound. Nodules as small as 2-3 mm can be detected. The right lobe is normally slightly larger than the left. 6) What is the first branch of the external carotid artery? a) Superior thyroid arteries b) Inferior thyroid arteries c) Arteria thyroidea ima d) Lingual arteriese) Thymic artery 7) The recurrent laryngeal nerves are closely related to ---------a) Superior thyroid arteries b) Inferior thyroid arteries c) Arteria thyroidea ima d) Lingual arteries 8) What is the cause of Pemberton's sign?a) Hyperthyroidismb) Hypothyroidismc) Retrosternal goiter d) Thyroid malignancy 9) The ligament of Berry - False statement(s)a) Closely attached to the cricoid cartilage b) Attached to the capsule c) Related to the recurrent laryngeal nerve d) Alle) None 10) The recurrent laryngeal nerve - False statementa) Supplies the cricothyroid b) Damage to one recurrent laryngeal nerve results in a normal, but weak voice c) Bilateral damage cause airway obstruction d) Alle) None 11) Thyroid gland develops during --------------- of gestationa) Third week b) 11 week c) 6 monthsd) 8 months a) Third week The thyroid gland develops from the floor of the pharynx during the third week of gestation. The gland migrates from the foramen cecum at the base of the tongue. It migrates along the thyroglossal duct to reach the neck. Rarely, ectopic location of thyroid tissue is found at the base of the tongue (lingual thyroid). In most of these cases this may be the only thyroid tissue that remains. Enlargement of a lingual thyroid can cause airway obstruction, dysphagia, or bleeding. Most lingual thyroid glands can be suppressed with thyroid hormone administration. Thyroglossal duct disappears by 8th week of intrauterine life.Thyroid hormone synthesis normally begins at about 11 weeks of gestation.• 8th week- Thyroglobulin synthesis- Thyroglossal duct disappears• 11 th week- Synthesis of thyroid hormones and calcitonin• 12 th week- Iodide trapping• 20 th week- Hypothalamic-pituitary axis] 12) Which can cross the placenta?a) T 3b) T4c) T4 and T 3d) TSH, T4 and T 3e) None e) NoneTSH, T4 and T 3 do not cross the placenta. Fetal hypothalamic - pituitary axis functions by 20th week. It is independent of maternal endocrine status. 13) Which is the only component of the adult thyroid gland not of endodermal origin?a) Isthmusb) Pyramidal lobec) Calcitonin-producing C cells d) Right lobee) Left lobe During development the tissue that ultimately becomes the thyroid gland arises initially as a midline diverticulum in the floor of the pharynx. This tissue originates in the primitive alimentary tract. It consists of cells of endodermal origin. Calcitonin-producing C cells arise from the fourth pharyngeal pouch. They migrate from the neural crest into the lateral lobes of the thyroid. These cells are distributed among the follicles. These C cells are the only component of the adult gland not of endodermal origin. 14) Pyramidal lobe - True statement a) Enlarged parathyroidb) Distal end of the thyroglossal duct c) Sign of malignancyd) Large cyst b) Distal end of the thyroglossal duct The pyramidal lobe represents the most distal portion of the thyroglossal duct. The thyroglossal duct is usually reabsorbed after 6 to 8 weeks of intrauterine life. The distal end of the thyroglossal duct remnant may occasionally be retained and mature as a pyramidal lobe in the adult thyroid 15) What does thyroid colloid contain in large amounts?a) Free T3b) Free T4c) Thyroglobulin d) All of the abovee) None of the above c) Thyroglobulin The thyroid is divided by thin fibrous septae into lobules composed of about 20 to 40 follicles. Each thyroid follicle contains a single layer of follicular epithelial cells (known as thyrocytes) surrounding a lumen containing colloid. The principal component of colloid is thyroglobulin 16) True about thyroglobulin-a) Precursor of thyroid hormones b) Synthesized by the follicular cells c) Contains tyrosine residues d) All of the above d) All of the abovea) Precursor of thyroid hormonesThyroglobulin is an iodinated glycoprotein. Thyroglobulin is a prohormone (precursor of thyroid hormones).]b) Synthesized by the follicular cells The follicular cells synthesize thyroglobulin and then secrete it into the colloid.c) Contains tyrosine residues Thyroglobulin contains 115 tyrosine residues. Each tyrosine residue is a site for iodination. Iodide is required to complete thyroglobulin formation. Iodine enters the follicular cells by active transport from the blood capillaries. The iodinated thyroglobulin is proteolysed in the cell to yield thyroid hormones, which are secreted into the bloodstream. 17) What regulates thyroid follicular activity? a) TSH b) Sympathetics c) TRH d) Thyroxine e) Thyroglobulin a) TSH Follicular activity is mainly controlled by TSH secreted from the pituitary gland.Catecholamines enhance the incorporation of iodine and synthesis of hormones. Adrenergic receptor blockers abolish these effects. Adrenergic receptor blockers do not affect the ability of cells to respond to TSH.c) TRH Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. TRH is transported to the anterior pituitary gland through the hypophysial portal system. TRH regulates TSH release from the pituitary.d) Thyroxine Thyroxine has a negative feed-back inhibition on the release of both TRH and TSH. 18) What is/are the effect(s) of high levels of circulating TSH?a) Induce follicular hypertrophy b) Progressive resorption of colloid c) Increases vascularity of the thyroid d) All of the above d) All of the above TSH stimulate the growth and invasive characteristics of some well-differentiated thyroid cancer cell lines. Doppler ultrasound can detect increased vascularity of the thyroid.There is also progressive resorption of colloid and increased stromal vascularity.TSH stimulates thyroid cell growth and differentiation. TSH stimulates iodine uptake, organification and release of T3 and T4. In the absence of TSH, the follicular cells are squamous and 'resting'. Prolonged high levels of circulating TSH induce follicular hypertrophy and even hyperplasia. 19) TSH receptors are present on thea) Basolateral surface of the follicular cells b) Apical surface of the follicular cellsc) Both apical and basolateral surface of the follicular cellsd) Pituitary gland a) Basolateral surface of the follicular cells The basolateral surface of the thyroid follicular cells are opposed to the bloodstream. The apical surface faces the follicular lumen. TSH receptors are present on the basolateral surface of the follicular cells.When TSH binds with the TSH receptor, it is activated. The TSH receptor interacts with a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) and stimulates the production of cyclic AMP. 20) How does Iodide enter the follicular cells?a) Passive diffusion from bloodb) Passive diffusion from lymphc) Active transport from blood d) Bound to TSH c) Active transport from blood Iodide enters the follicular cells across the basal plasmalemmal membrane of the thyrocytes (follicular cells) by active transport from the blood capillaries. 24) What is the normal T/S ratio?a) 25:1 b) 1:25c) 1:50d) 50:1 a) 25:1 T/S ratio is ratio of iodide in thyroid to iodide in serum. Thyroid gland, mammary gland, chorion, salivary gland and stomach can concentrate iodine against an electrochemical gradient. T/S ratio reflects the activity of the thyroidal iodine transporter. Thyroid is the only tissue that can oxidize iodine to a higher valence state. This step involves peroxidase. Thiourea drugs inhibit oxidation. 18) What is/are the effect(s) of high levels of circulating TSH?a) Induce follicular hypertrophy b) Progressive resorption of colloid c) Increases vascularity of the thyroid d) All of the above d) All of the above TSH stimulate the growth and invasive characteristics of some well-differentiated thyroid cancer cell lines.TSH stimulates thyroid cell growth and differentiation. TSH stimulates iodine uptake, organification and release of T3 and T4. In the absence of TSH, the follicular cells are squamous and 'resting'. Prolonged high levels of circulating TSH induce follicular hypertrophy and even hyperplasia.Doppler ultrasound can detect increased vascularity of the thyroid. There is also progressive resorption of colloid and increased stromal vascularity. 19) TSH receptors are present on thea) Basolateral surface of the follicular cells b) Apical surface of the follicular cellsc) Both apical and basolateral surface of the follicular cellsd) Pituitary gland a) Basolateral surface of the follicular cellsThe basolateral surface of the thyroid follicular cells are opposed to the bloodstream. The apical surface faces the follicular lumen. TSH receptors are present on the basolateral surface of the follicular cells. When TSH binds with the TSH receptor, it is activated. The TSH receptor interacts with a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) and stimulates the production of cyclic AMP 20) How does Iodide enter the follicular cells?a) Passive diffusion from bloodb) Passive diffusion from lymphc) Active transport from blood d) Bound to TSH Iodide enters the follicular cells across the basal plasmalemmal membrane of the thyrocytes (follicular cells) by active transport from the blood capillaries. 21) What is the location of the thyroid peroxidase? a) Follicular basal plasmalemmal membraneb) Follicular apical plasmalemmal membrane c) Colloidd) RBC b) Follicular apical plasmalemmal membrane Within the thyrocyte, iodide is rapidly oxidized by H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. The thyroid peroxidase in the apical plasmalemma oxidizes iodide to iodine. 22) Organificationa) Monoiodotyrosine formedb) diiodotyrosine formedc) Both are formed d) Neither are formed Iodine is attached to the tyrosyl groups of the thyroglobulin to generate monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine residues. This process is known as organification. ## Excessive circulating iodide may transiently inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by disrupting organification. Iodinated thyroglobulin is the precursor of thyroid hormones. Thyroid peroxidase also catalyzes the coupling of the monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine residues to generate thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). ## Excessive circulating iodide may also transiently inhibit secretion of T4 and T3 by inhibiting proteolysis of thyroglobulin. 23) Main hormone secreted by the thyroida) MIT b) DITc) T3 d) T4 d) T4 Formation of T4 is the major pathway. Both T3 and T4 are bound to thyroglobulin and stored within the colloid. This allows quick secretion of the preformed hormones. There is storage of about 2 weeks supply of thyroid hormone. The administration of antithyroid agents for as long as 2 weeks has little effect. T3 is formed by coupling of a molecule of MIT with a molecule of DIT. T4 is formed by coupling of two molecules of DIT.MIT and DIT are biologically inert. Coupling of these two residues gives rise to the two biologically active thyroid hormones T4 and T3. 31) What is the half-life of TSH?a) 30 seconds b) 12 minutes c) 50 minutes d) 1.5 hours c) 50 minutesTSH variations are not much compared to other pituitary hormones. Therefore, single measurements of TSH are adequate for assessing its circulating level. 32) TSH measured using immunoradiometric assays can be used for the diagnosis of ------a) Hyperthyroidismb) Hypothyroidismc) Both d) Neither TSH is measured using immunoradiometric assays. These assays are highly sensitive and specific. TSH can be used for the diagnosis of both hyperthyroidism (low TSH) and hypothyroidism (high TSH). 33) What % of administered radioactive 123 I taken up by normal thyroid? a) Less than 10%b) 25% c) 60%d) 90% 10 to 25% of radioactive tracer (e.g., 123I) is taken up by the normal thyroid gland over 24 h. 70 to 90% of radioactive tracer is taken up in Graves' disease. 34) Most common cause of preventable mental deficiencya) Down's syndrome b) Iodine deficiency c) Birth injuriesd) Infections Majority of cases of mental deficiency are idiopathic. Iodine supplementation of salt, bread, and other food substances has markedly reduced the prevalence of cretinism. 35) Recommended daily intake of iodine is ----------------- ug/d for adultsa) 25b) 75c) 150 d) 350 c) 150 ug/d Recommended daily intake of iodine is 90 to 120 ug/d for children, and 200 ug/d for pregnant women. Increased iodine intake is associated with autoimmune thyroid disease 36) Recommended for surveillance of iodine deficiency isa) Prevalence of goiterb) Prevalence of cretinismc) Urinary iodine excretion d) Serum T4 e) Prevalence of neonatal hypothyroidism Urinary iodine excretion is particularly recommended for surveillance of iodine deficiency. The objective of goiter control programme is to increase iodine intake. Serum T4 is a more sensitive indicator of thyroid deficiency than T3. What is Wolff-Chaikoff effect?a) Excess iodide causes hyperthyroidism b) Iodine deficiency increases thyroid blood flow c) Excess iodide inhibits thyroid iodide organification d) Iodide inhibits T4 release from the thyroid c) Excess iodide inhibits thyroid iodide organificationExcess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification. This phenomenon is known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. This stunning effect is transient. Normal thyroid gland escapes from this inhibitory effect and iodide organification resumes. The thyroid gland has an autoregulated process. When dietary iodide is excessive, there is inhibition of uptake of iodide into follicular cells. The reverse is true in iodide deficiency.Iodine deficiency increases thyroid blood flow and stimulates uptake by the NIS. This is not Wolff-Chaikoff effect.Iodine supplementation can be used to treat hyperactivity of the gland in preparation for surgery.T4 release from the thyroid cells is inhibited by iodide. Inhibition of hormone release is responsible for the rapid improvement that Iodide causes in hyperthyroid patients.Oversupply of iodine, through supplements or foods enriched in iodine (e.g., shellfish, kelp), is associated with an increased incidence of autoimmune thyroid disease. 38) T4 circulate bound toa) Thyroxine-binding globulin b) Albumin c) Transthyretin d) All Most T3 and T4 are bound to proteins so that free T4 constitutes less than 1% of peripheral hormone. Both hormones circulate bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR or thyroxine-binding prealbumin ), and albumin. TBG has high affinity and carries 80% of the bound hormones.Albumin has low affinity for thyroid hormones but albumin has a high plasma concentration. Albumin binds up to 10% of T4 and 30% of T3TTR also carries 10% of T4 but little T3.T3 is less tightly bound than T4. Therefore, the amount of free T3 is more than free T4. Only the free hormone is active. 100% of T4 is from thyroid. Only 20% of T3 is from thyroid. Most of T3 is formed by peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. This conversion is the result of deiodination, which takes place largely in the plasma and liver.When the effects of the various binding proteins are combined, approximately 99.98% of T4 and 99.7% of T3 are protein-bound 39) Which Increase TBG levels?a) Estrogens b) Hepatitis c) Tamoxifen d) All of the above Pregnancy and exposure to pharmacologic doses of estrogens can increase TBG levels. Because of this, total T4 level is increased in pregnancy.Hepatitis and familial TBG excess increase TBG levelsCertain medications including 5-fluorouracil, tamoxifen, and methadone can increase TBG levels.salicylates and salsaltes can displace thyroid hormonesfrom circulating binding proteins. Mutations in TBG, TTR, and albumin that increase binding affinity for T4 and/or T3 cause disorders known as euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia or familialdysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (FDH).The familial nature of the disorders, and the fact that TSH levels are normal rather than suppressed, should suggest the diagnosis. Free hormone levels (ideally measured by dialysis) are normal in FDH. These disorders are usually dominantly transmitted and result in increased total T4 and/or T3, but free hormone levels are normal. 40) Glucocorticoids - True statement a) Increase TBG levelsb) Inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 c) Lower serum TSH d) All of the above Exogenous glucocorticoids inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. This effectively lowers serum T3 levels. Steroids are used to rapid inhibit T3 formation in hyperthyroid conditions. Steroids can also lower serum TSH.Dopamine, glucocorticoids, and somatostatin suppress TSH but are not of major physiologic importance except when these agents are administered in pharmacologic doses. Because of the rapid action of steroids, they are an important in the treatment of thyrotoxic crisis or resistant hyperthyroidism.T4®T3conversion may be impaired by fasting, systemicillness or acute trauma, oral contrast agents, and a variety of medications (e.g. propylthiouracil, propranolol, amiodarone, glucocorticoids) 41) X-linked TBG deficiency - True statement a) Very low levels of total T4 b) Very low levels of total T 3c) Euthyroid d) TSH levels are normale) All All true. X-linked TBG deficiency is associated with very low levels of total T 4 and T3. Free hormone levels are normal. Hence, patients are euthyroid and TSH levels are normal. The importance is not to try to make total T4 levels normal. This causes thyrotoxicosis. T4 level cannot be made normal because of rapid hormone clearance in the absence of TBG. 42) Estrogen - True statement a) Delay TBG clearanceb) Increased total T4 c) Normal free T3d) All e) None TBG is produced in the liver. Estrogen delays TBG clearance and increase TBG synthesis. Therefore, in pregnant women or in those taking estrogen-containing contraceptives, TBG levels are elevated. This increases total T4 and T3 levels. Free T4 and T3 levels are normal 43) What is the most important source of reverse T3?a) Type 1 deiodinase b) Type 2 deiodinase c) Type 3 deiodinase d) Type 4 deiodinase c) Type 3 deiodinase Type 3 deiodinase is present in the glial cells of the central nervous system. The type 3-deiodinase enzyme is the major T3 and T4 inactivating enzyme. Type 3 deiodinase converts T4 to inactive reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and T3 to inactive diiodothyronine (T2). Type 3 deiodinase is the most important source of reverse T3 (rT3 ).T4 is converted to T3 by the deiodinase enzymes. More than 80% of the T3 present in tissues is derived from T4 through the action of deiodinase enzymes. Type 1 deiodinase is located primarily in thyroid, liver, and kidney.Type 2 deiodinase is found primarily in the pituitary gland, brain, brown fat, and thyroid gland.Type 4 deiodinase has not been described. 44) T4 to T3 conversion is impaired by a) Fastingb) Systemic illness c) Oral contrast agentsd) Glucocorticoids e) All T4 to T3 conversion is impaired by systemic illness or acute trauma. Glucocorticoids, propylthiouracil, propranolol, and amiodarone impair T4 to T3 conversion. 45) Thyroid hormone resistance - False statementa) Autosomal dominant b) Increased free thyroid hormone levelsc) Elevated TSHd) Goiter e) Severe hypothyroidism e) Severe hypothyroidism Thyroid hormone resistance is characterized by elevated free thyroid hormone levels and normal or elevated TSH. Increased levels of thyroid hormone compensate hormone resistance. Therefore, these patients are ** not hypothyroid. The diagnosis is suspected when free thyroid hormone levels are increased without suppression of TSH. ## No treatment is indicated. The importance of making the diagnosis is to avoid inappropriate treatment of mistaken hyperthyroidism. Resistance to thyroid hormone is an autosomal dominant disorder. Resistance is caused by mutations in the thyroid receptor gene. 46) A primary abnormality of thyroid function is excluded bya) Normal TSH level b) TRH stimulation test c) Normal total T4d) Normal free T3 e) Normal USS of thyroid TSH levels change with any changes in free T 4 and T 3 levels. So, in suspected thyroid disease, first determine whether TSH is suppressed, normal, or elevated. A normal TSH level excludes a primary abnormality of thyroid function except in rare situations. If TSH level is abnormal, measure circulating thyroid hormone levels to confirm hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH) or hypothyroidism (elevated TSH).TRH stimulation test is not done now.Serum total T 4 and total T 3 are measured by radioimmunoassays. T 4 and T 3 are highly protein-bound. Therefore, total T 4 and total T 3 levels are influenced by illness, medications, and genetic factors. It is more useful to measure the free or unbound hormone levels. Measure circulating thyroid hormone levels only if TSH levels measured using immunoradiometric assays are abnormal.USS is most useful to detect anatomical abnormality. USS can detect nodules and cysts more than 3 mm. USS is useful for guiding FNA biopsies and for the aspiration of cystic lesions. 47) T3 thyrotoxicosis - True statementa) Commonest type of thyrotoxicosis b) Free T4 and T3 are raised c) TSH levels are normal or high d) None All are false statements.Less than 5% of patients with thyrotoxicosis have T3 toxicosis.In T3 toxicosis, only elevated T3 level is elevated. T4 level is normal.TSH is suppressed. Thus, free T3 levels should be measured in patients with a suppressed TSH but normal free T4 levels. 48) Which is not useful in suspected hypothyroidism?a) TSHb) Total T4c) Free T4d) Free T3 Free T 3 levels are normal in 25% with hypothyroidism. Therefore, T3 is not very useful in suspected hypothyroidism. 49) Most common cause of an elevated TSH levela) Assay artifactb) TSH-secreting pituitary tumorc) Primary hypothyroidism d) Thyroid hormone resistance e) After treatment of hyperthyroidism c) Primary hypothyroidismTSH remains suppressed for several weeks after treatment of hyperthyroidism 50) Low TSH levela) First trimester of pregnancyb) High dose glucocorticoidsc) After treatment of hyperthyroidismd) All e) None d) All Low TSH level usually indicates thyrotoxicosis. Suppressed TSH level may also be seen during the first trimester of pregnancy and in response to certain medications (e.g., high doses of glucocorticoids or dopamine). TSH remains suppressed for several weeks after treatment of hyperthyroidism. 51) 50-year-old woman has been on treatment for angina for the past 5 years. She has low total T4 and TSH. How would you proceed?a) Treat with low doses of thyroxineb) Do TMT and echocardiography before giving thyroxinec) Admit and give thyroxine under supervisiond) Do free T4e) Take CT head e) Take CT head Low T4 and TSH suggest secondary hypothyroidism caused by hypothalamic-pituitary disease. 52) Major thyroid microsomal antigena) Thyroid receptorb) TSH receptorc) Thyroxine d) Thyroid peroxidase 53) Serum thyroglobulin levels are increased ina) Thyrotoxicosis factitia b) After total thyroidectomy c) After radioablation of thyroidd) Alle) None All are false statementsSome iodinated thryoglobulin escapes intact from the follicles. They can be detected in blood by radioimmunoassay. ** Serum thyroglobulin levels are increased in all types of thyrotoxicosis except thyrotoxicosis factitia.## The main role for thyroglobulin measurement is in the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients. After total thyroidectomy and radioablation, thyroglobulin levels should be undetectable. ## If thyroglobulin can be detected, it suggests incomplete ablation or recurrent cancer. 54) Radioisotope used in thyroid scanninga) 99 m Tc pertechnetate b) 123 Ic) 125 Id) 131 I e) All The thyroid gland selectively transports these radioisotopes of iodine. ## Hot nodules (i.e., with increased tracer uptake) are almost never malignant. Cold nodules (i.e., with diminished tracer uptake) are also usually benign. However, these nodules are more likely to be malignant (5 to 10%). Fine-needle aspiration is preferred to thyroid scans in the evaluation of solitary thyroid nodules. Thyroid scanning is also used in the follow-up of thyroid cancer. After thyroidectomy and ablation using 131I, there is diminished radioiodine uptake in the thyroid bed. Whole-body scans using 131 I is performed to detect metastatic thyroid cancer deposits.Technetium-99m (99mTc) pertechnetate is the most widely used thyroid-imaging agent. Pertechnetate is concentrated within the thyroid. Imaging begins 20 minutes after the intravenous injection of sodium pertechnetate. Normal uptake of the injected activity is 0.4 -4.0%.Radioiodine uptakes are usually determined at 6 or 24 hours and range from 8 to 28%.RADIOISOTOPE THYROID SCANNING- Increased tracer uptake with homogeneous distribution - Graves' disease - Focal areas of increased uptake, with suppressed tracer uptake in the remainder of the gland - Toxic adenomas- Multiple areas of increased or decreased tracer uptake - Toxic multinodular goiter - Very low uptake because of follicular cell damage and TSH suppression - Subacute thyroiditis.Low uptake - Thyrotoxicosis factitia 23) Main hormone secreted by the thyroida) MITb) DITc) T3 d) T4 Formation of T4 is the major pathway. Both T3 and T4 are bound to thyroglobulin and stored within the colloid. This allows quick secretion of the preformed hormones. There is storage of about 2 week's supply of thyroid hormone. The administration of antithyroid agents for as long as 2 weeks has little effect. T3 is formed by coupling of a molecule of MIT with a molecule of DIT. T4 is formed by coupling of two molecules of DIT.MIT and DIT are biologically inert. Coupling of these two residues gives rise to the two biologically active thyroid hormones T4 and T3. 22) Organificationa) Monoiodotyrosine formedb) diiodotyrosine formedc) Both are formed T [ Iodine is attached to the tyrosyl groups of the thyroglobulin to generate monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine residues. This process is known as organification. Excessive circulating iodide may transiently inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by disrupting organification. Iodinated thyroglobulin is the precursor of thyroid hormones. Thyroid peroxidase also catalyzes the coupling of the monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine residues to generate thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Excessive circulating iodide may also transiently inhibit secretion of T4 and T3 by inhibiting proteolysis of thyroglobulin. See figure above. HYPERTHYROIDISM (39 MCQs)1) Causes of hyperthyroidisma) Subacute thyroiditis b) Thyrotoxicosis factitia c) Struma ovarii d) All e) None e) NoneAll these are causes of thyrotoxicosis, but not causes of hyperthyroidismThyrotoxicosis refers to the manifestations of excessive quantities of the thyroid hormones. The main causes of thyrotoxicosis are hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenomas. ## Thyrotoxicosis is not same as hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is due to excessive thyroid function. Hyperthyroidism is thyrotoxicosis resulting from overproduction of hormone by the thyroid gland itself (e.g., Graves' disease). In thyroiditis (subacute or silent thyroiditis), presenting symptoms are those of thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis in thyroiditis is due to the release of preformed thyroid hormones. True hyperthyroidism is absent since there is no overproduction of thyroid hormones. Radionuclide uptake is low in thyroiditis.Thyrotoxicosis factitia is another cause of thyrotoxicosis with low or absent thyroid radionuclide uptake. Thyrotoxicosis factitia can be distinguished from thyroiditis by low levels of thyroglobulin.Ectopic thyroid tissue, particularly teratomas of the ovary (struma ovarii ) and functional metastatic thyroid carcinoma also cause thyrotoxicosis with low or absent thyroid radionuclide uptake. Whole-body radionuclide studies can demonstrate ectopic thyroid tissue.TYPES OF THYROTOXICOSISHYPERTHYROIDISM (RAIU increased except for iodine-induced hyperthyroidism)1 Graves' disease2 Toxic multinodular goiter3 Toxic adenoma4 Iodine-induced (Jod-Basedow)5 Trophoblastic tumor6 Increased TSH secretionNO ASSOCIATED HYPERTHYROIDISM (RAIU decreased)1. Thyrotoxicosis factitia2. Subacute thyroiditis3. hyroiditis with transient thyrotoxicosis - Painless thyroiditis - Silent thyroiditis - Postpartum thyroiditis4. Ectopic thyroid tissue - Struma ovarii - unfunctioning metastatic thyroid cancer 2) What is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis?a) Graves' disease b) Toxic multinodular goiterc) Toxic adenomasd) Thyroiditis a) Graves' disease Graves' disease accounts for 60 to 80% of thyrotoxicosis 3) Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins cause a) Hyperthyroidism b) Ophthalmopathy c) Dermopathy d) All e) None a) Hyperthyroidism The hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease is caused by thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI). TSI bind to TSH receptors and stimulate it.The extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves' disease (i.e., ophthalmopathy and dermopathy) are immunologically mediated. T cells and macrophages infiltrate skin and extraocular muscles and secrete cytokines (IFN-alpha, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1). These cytokines activate fibroblasts and cause accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans cause trapping of water and edema. Later, fibrosis becomes prominent. 4) Major risk factor for Graves' diseasea) Smoking b) Iodine deficiency c) Iodine supplementationd) Female sex e) Viral infection d) Female sex Female sex is the chief risk factor for Graves' disease. Estrogen modulates the autoimmune responseSmoking is only weakly associated with Graves' hyperthyroidism. Smoking is strongly associated with the development of ophthalmopathy.In regions of iodine deficiency, iodine supplementation precipitates hyperthyroidism, by means of the Jod-Basedow phenomenon. Jod-Basedow phenomenon is excess iodine increasing thyroid hormone synthesis. Wolff-Chaikoff effect is excess iodine transiently inhibiting thyroid iodide organification.There is no evidence that infection affects the susceptibility to Graves' hyperthyroidism or directly induces it.Lid retraction and lid lag can occur in any form of thyrotoxicosis, regardless of the underlying cause. These ocular signs are due to sympathetic over activity. It is important to differentiate these ocular manifestations from those of ## infiltrative orbitopathy, which are characteristic of Graves' disease. Retraction of the upper eyelid is detected by the presence of a rim of sclera between the lid and the limbus. Lid lag is the phenomenon in which the upper lid lags behind the eyeball when the patient is asked to look slowly downward. 5) Commonest sign of thyrotoxicosis in the elderlya) Lid retraction b) Proximal muscle weaknessc) Goiterd) Tremore) Atrial fibrillation e) Atrial fibrillationIn the elderly, the clinical features of thyrotoxicosis may be subtle. The elderly may present with fatigue and weight loss, leading to apathetic hyperthyroidism. 6) What is the most common cardiovascular manifestation of thyrotoxicosis?a) Sinus tachycardia b) Atrial fibrillation c) Bounding pulsed) Heart failure a) Sinus tachycardiaTachycardia is almost always present. Thyrotoxicosis results in hypermetabolism and increases circulatory demands. At rest, cardiac output is increased because of an increase in stroke volume and heart rate. The high cardiac output produces a bounding pulse, widened pulse pressure, and an aortic systolic murmur.Atrial fibrillation is more common in patients older than 50 years. 7) In thyrotoxicosis there isa) Hypercalcemia with hypercalcuria b) Hypercalcemia with hypocalcuriac) Hypocalcemia with hypercalcuriad) Hypocalcemia with hypocalcuria Thyrotoxicosis is usually associated with increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in urine and stool. Thyroid hormones directly increase bone resorption. Osteopenia may occur in long-standing thyrotoxicosis. Mild hypercalcemia occurs in up to 20% of patients 8) Typical of Graves' diseasea) Diffuse goiterb) Positive TPO antibodiesc) Pretibial myxedemad) All of the above d) All of the aboveRemember that pretibial myxedema is seen in Graves' disease and not in myxedema (hypothyroidism)GRAVES' DISEASE - DIAGNOSIS1. Diffuse goiter2. Thyrotoxicosis3. Positive TPO antibodies4. Infiltrative orbitopathy and ophthalmopathy5. Infiltrative dermopathy 9) Specific to hyperthyroid Graves' diseasea) Thyroid peroxidase antibody b) Thyroglobulin antibodyc) TSH Receptor antibody d) Alle) None c) TSH Receptor antibody In autoimmune thyroid disease, antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and the TSH-receptor are present in the serum. Autoimmune thyroid disease is also characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland.TSH-Receptor autoantibodies (TSHRAbs) are specific to hyperthyroid Graves' disease. 90% of untreated hyperthyroid patients with Graves' disease have detectable TSHR Abs. These antibodies compete with TSH for binding to the TSH receptor site in the cell membrane. After binding to TSHR, they can act as TSH agonists 10) Not detectable in the normal populationa) TSHRAbs b) Tg antibodies c) TPO antibodies d) Alle) None a) TSHRAbs TSHRAbs are not detectable in the normal population. TSH receptor antibodies are very rare in patients without autoimmune thyroid disease. They occur in 90% of patients with Graves' disease. A positive test is therefore confirmatory, but a negative test does not exclude Graves' disease.Other thyroid antibodies (e.g. anti-peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies) are unhelpful in the differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis since they occur frequently in the population and are found with several of the disorders which cause thyrotoxicosis.There is a high prevalence of Tg antibodies and TPO antibodies in the normal population. 11) The major antigen of Graves' diseasea) Acetyl choline receptors in ocular musclesb) Thyroid receptors in ocular musclesc) Thyroid receptors in follicular cellsd) Thyrotropin receptor d) Thyrotropin receptorThe TSH-Receptor is the primary autoantigen of Graves' disease 12) Thyroid-stimulating antibodies are produced bya) Thyroidb) Lymph nodesc) Bone marrowd) All Thyroid-stimulating antibodies are produced within and outside the thyroid gland. Thyroid-stimulating antibodies activate thyrotropin receptors and cause excess production of thyroid hormone. Antithyroid drugs decrease the production of thyroid-stimulating antibody (immunomodulatory effects) 13) Which cell is involved in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy? a) Neutrophilsb) T cells c) Gr-v cellsd) NK cells There is an inflammatory-cell infiltrate in the extraocular muscles and orbital connective tissue. The cells are composed predominantly of activated T cells. The T cells localize in the orbit because of the presence of an orbital antigen that cross-reacts with a thyroid antigen. The activated T cells produce cytokines. The cytokines activate fibroblasts, stimulating the production of glycosaminoglycans (mainly hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate) and leading to edema and fibrosis. 14) What causes the clinical manifestations of Graves' ophthalmopathy?a) Demyelination of optic nerveb) Axonal degeneration of optic nervec) Increase in the volume of retrobulbar tissue d) Papilledema c) Increase in the volume of retrobulbar tissue Graves' ophthalmopathy is characterized by edema and inflammation of the extraocular muscles and an increase in orbital connective tissue and fat. The edema is due to the hydrophilic action of glycosaminoglycans secreted by fibroblasts. The inflammation is due to infiltration of the extraocular muscles and orbital connective tissue by lymphocytes and macrophages. The increase in the volume of retrobulbar tissue is responsible for most of the clinical manifestations of ophthalmopathy. The muscle cells are normal until the late stages of ophthalmopathy, when they may become atrophic or fibrotic. 15) Graves' ophthalmopathy is associated witha) Hyperthyroidism b) Normal thyroid function c) Hypothyroidismd) Any of the above d) Any of the aboveAbout 90 percent of patients with ophthalmopathy have hyperthyroidism. The remainder has autoimmune hypothyroidism or is euthyroid at presentation.The onset of Graves' ophthalmopathy occurs within the year before or after the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in 75%. It can sometimes precede or follow thyrotoxicosis by several years, accounting for some cases of euthyroid ophthalmopathy.Graves' disease is associated with specific eye signs (Graves' ophthalmopathy). ## It occurs without Graves' disease in 10%. Therefore, it is also called thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. The most frequent signs of ophthalmopathy are eyelid retraction or lag and periorbital edema. Lid retraction and lid lag can occur in any form of thyrotoxicosis, regardless of the underlying cause. Graves' ophthalmopathy refers to clinical features of exophthalmos, and periorbital and conjunctival oedema, not simply the lid lag and lid retraction which can occur in all forms of thyrotoxicosis. 16) What is the earliest manifestation of Graves' ophthalmopathy?a) Sensation of grittiness b) Proptosis c) Periorbital edema d) Diplopia a) Sensation of grittiness The earliest manifestations of ophthalmopathy are a sense of irritation in the eyes, resembling that caused by a foreign body, and excess tearing.About 35 % have proptosis. Exophthalmos is usually bilateral and is often asymmetrical in degree.Periorbital edema, scleral injection, and chemosis are also frequent.In less than 10%, the muscle swelling is severe and causes diplopia. Many patients with Graves' disease do not have much clinical evidence of ophthalmopathy. USS, CT, or MRI of the orbits can detect orbital changes in virtually all patients with Graves' disease. Orbital changes are swelling of extraocular muscles and increased retro-orbital fat. The most serious manifestation is compression of the optic nerve at the apex of the orbit. This leads to papilledema and peripheral field defects. If untreated, permanent loss of vision results. NO SPECS SCHEME FOR GRADING ORBITAL CHANGES OF GRAVES' DISEASE0 - No signs or symptoms1 - Only signs (lid retraction or lag), no symptoms2 - Soft tissue involvement (periorbital edema)3 - Proptosis ( >22 mm)4 - Extraocular muscle involvement (diplopia)5 - Corneal involvement6 - Sight loss 17) What is the best screening test for the presence of hyperthyroidism?a) Serum TSH b) Serum total thyroxine and triiodothyroninec) Serum free triiodothyronine d) Serum thyroid hormone-binding proteins Very small increases in thyroid secretion reduce the secretion of thyrotropin (TSH). Therefore, measurement of serum TSH is a useful screening test for the presence of hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism must be confirmed by the measurement of serum free thyroxine. 18) How can you confirm Graves' disease in a patient with thyrotoxicosis and diffuse goiter?a) Raised T 4b) Raised T 3c) Raised T3 and T4 with suppressed TSHd) Radionuclide scan e) CT or MRI scan d) Radionuclide scan Diagnostic features of Graves' disease are biochemically confirmed thyrotoxicosis, diffuse goiter, ophthalmopathy, occasionally dermopathy, and positive TPO antibodies. The signs of ophthalmopathy or dermopathy are sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of Graves' disease in a patient with hyperthyroidism and a diffuse goiter. When the diagnosis is unclear clinically, the presence of a high serum concentration of thyroid peroxidase antibody provides evidence of Graves' disease. It is present in about 75 percent of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. For patients with thyrotoxicosis who lack these features, the most reliable diagnostic method is a radionuclide (99m Tc, 123 I, or 131 I) scan of the thyroid. There is diffuse, high uptake in Graves' disease. Radionuclide scan can differentiate Grave's disease from nodular thyroid disease, destructive thyroiditis, ectopic thyroid tissue, and factitious thyrotoxicosis.In secondary hyperthyroidism due to a TSH-secreting pituitary tumor, there is also a diffuse goiter. In secondary hyperthyroidism, TSH level is not suppressed. CT or MRI scan may show the pituitary tumor. 19) Specific to Graves' diseasea) Exophthalmos b) Pretibial myxedemac) Thyroid acropachy d) TSH receptor antibody e) All of the above e) All of the aboveAll causes of thyrotoxicosis can cause lid retraction and lid lag due to potentiation of sympathetic innervation of the levator palpebrae muscles. Only Graves' disease causes other features of ophthalmopathy (periorbital oedema, conjunctival irritation, exophthalmos and diplopia) Thyroid acropachy is a periosteal hypertrophy indistinguishable from finger clubbing. It is a rare manifestation 20) Low radioiodine uptake thyrotoxicosisa) Graves' diseaseb) Toxic nodular goiterc) Thyroiditis d) All of the abovee) None of the above c) Thyroiditis Low-uptake thyrotoxicosis is usually due to transient thyroiditis. Occasionally, it is due to 'factitious thyrotoxicosis' (consuming excessive amounts of a thyroid hormone). The exogenous thyroxine suppresses pituitary TSH secretion and hence iodine uptake and serum thyroglobulin. 21) Which inhibit the function of TPO?a) Propylthiouracilb) Carbimazolec) Methimazoled) All e) None d) All These drugs are actively concentrated by the thyroid gland against a concentration gradient. Their primary effect is to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by inhibiting the function of TPO. This reduces oxidation and organification of iodide (iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin). These drugs also reduce thyroid antibody levels by an unclear mechanism and may alter the course of the underlying autoimmune process. 22) Which drug(s) impair the conversion of T4 to T3a) Propylthiouracil b) Carbimazole c) Methimazoled) Alle) None a) Propylthiouracil Large doses of propylthiouracil, but not methimazole or carbimazole, impair the conversion of T4 to T3 by deiodinase type 1 in the peripheral tissues. Because of this additional action, large doses of propylthiouracil may provide rapid alleviation of severe thyrotoxicosis 23) Half-life of methimazole a) 90 minutes b) 6 hours c) 24 hoursd) 5 days b) 6 hours Half-life of methimazole is 6 h. A single dose of methimazole exerts an antithyroid effect for longer than 24 hours. Therefore, single daily dose of methimazole may be used for mild or moderate thyrotoxicosis. Once-daily dosing is possible after euthyroidism is restored. Half-life of propylthiouracil is only 1.5 hours 24) What is the time taken to achieve euthyroidism by antithyroid drugs?a) 24 to 48 hoursb) 5 to 10 daysc) 6 to 8 weeks d) More than 6 months c) 6 to 8 weeks It takes 6 to 8 weeks for most patients to achieve euthyroidism. Antithyroid drugs inhibit the synthesis but not the release of hormone. Hence, reduction in the supply of hormone to the tissues does not occur until glandular hormone stores are depleted. 25) What is the most feared side effect of antithyroid-drug therapy?a) Agranulocytosis b) Thyrotoxic crisisc) Seizuresd) Hypoglycemiae) Interstitial nephritis a) Agranulocytosis It takes 6 to 8 weeks for most patients to achieve euthyroidism. Antithyroid drugs inhibit the synthesis but not the release of hormone. Hence, reduction in the supply of hormone to the tissues does not occur until glandular hormone stores are depleted. 26) Which of the following drugs can cause massive hepatic necrosis?a) Propylthiouracil b) Methimazole c) Carbimazoled) None of the above In propylthiouracil-related hepatotoxicity, there is often markedly elevated aminotransferase levels and hepatic necrosis on biopsy. Liver transplantation may be required. Asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels occur frequently in untreated patients with hyperthyroidism. Therefore, routine monitoring of liver-function tests in patients being treated with propylthiouracil is generally not recommended.The rare hepatic abnormalities associated with methimazole and carbimazole are typical of a cholestatic process. Complete, but slow, recovery is the rule after drug discontinuation. The mechanisms of hepatotoxicity for the two antithyroid drugs differ. The alternative agent could be used cautiously to treat the underlying hyperthyroidism in a patient with complicated thyrotoxicosis and drug-induced hepatic side effects 27) Which is not a contraindication for radioiodine treatment?a) Pregnancy b) Severe ophthalmopathy c) Breast feedingd) Children b) Severe ophthalmopathyThe presence of severe ophthalmopathy requires caution. Some use prednisone at the time of radioiodine treatment to prevent exacerbation of ophthalmopathyRisk of cancer after radioiodine treatment in adults is not increased. Many avoid radioiodine in children and adolescents because of the theoretical risks of malignancy 28) Radioiodine treatment - False statementa) Useful for relapses after a trial of antithyroid drugs b) Risk of thyrotoxic crisis c) Antithyroid drugs must be continued during radioiodine administration d) Avoid close contact with pregnant women for several days e) Hyperthyroidism can persist for 3 months before radioiodine takes full effect. c) Antithyroid drugs must be continued during radioiodine administration Antithyroid drugs must be stopped 3 to 5 days before radioiodine administration to achieve optimum iodine uptake.Patients should avoid close, prolonged contact with children and pregnant women for several days. There is the possibility of transmission of residual isotope and excessive exposure to radiation emanating from the gland.Beta-adrenergic blockers or antithyroid drugs can be used to control symptoms during this interval. ## Persistent hyperthyroidism can be treated with a second dose of radioiodine, usually 6 months after the first dose. Most patients ultimately progress to hypothyroidism over 5 to 10 years. 29) What is the main side effect of radioactive iodine?a) Hypothyroidism b) Recurrent hyperthyroidismc) Worsening of ophthalmopathy d) Malignancy e) Thyrotoxic crisis a) Hypothyroidism It may be transient when it occurs in the first few months after the administration of radioactive iodine. Some require a second treatment to cure their hyperthyroidism.Radioactive iodine can induce or worsen ophthalmopathy, particularly in smokers. The worsening of ophthalmopathy is often transient and may be prevented by glucocorticoid therapy.In patients who are treated with radioactive iodine, the risk of death from thyroid cancer and possibly other cancers is slightly increased. Whether this risk is related to Graves' disease or radioactive iodine is not knownThere is a slight risk of the development of a thyrotoxic crisis soon after radioactive iodine administration. Patients with severe hyperthyroidism should be treated with an antithyroid drug for four to eight weeks before radioactive iodine is given. The antithyroid drug reduces thyroid secretion rapidly and thereby reduces the slight risk of the development of a thyrotoxic crisis. Patients with mild or moderate hyperthyroidism do not require treatment with an antithyroid drug before or after radioactive iodine therapy. Their symptoms can be adequately ameliorated with a beta-adrenergic antagonist until the radioactive iodine takes effect 30) Subtotal thyroidectomy - indication(s)a) Relapse after antithyroid drugsb) Young individuals c) Large goiter d) All d) AllThe surgical procedure of choice for the treatment of Graves' disease is a bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy. The high prevalence of postoperative hypothyroidism makes surgery an imperfect treatment. Some recommend surgery in young individuals, particularly when the goiter is very large. Control thyrotoxicosis with antithyroid drugs before surgery to avoid thyrotoxic crisis. Give potassium iodide before surgery to reduce the vascularity of the gland. Do not give iodine until a normal metabolic state has been restored by antithyroid drugs. 31) Indication(s) for surgery in Graves' disease a) Obstructive symptomsb) Very large goitersc) Antithyroid drug allergyd) All e) None Graves' disease is usually treated with antithyroid drugs, radio-iodine, or both. Most practitioners consider antithyroid drugs the treatment of choice for most young people with Graves' disease. Only a small percentage is recommended for surgery.GRAVES' DISEASE - INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY1. Patients requesting surgery2. Antithyroid drug allergy3. Cold nodule4. Very large goiters5. Need for a rapid return to normal activity6. Obstructive symptoms7. Cosmetic disfigurement 32) What is the best drug to manage Graves' disease in pregnancy?a) Propylthiouracil b) Carbimazole c) Combination therapy with an antithyroid drug and thyroxine d) Radio Iodine a) Propylthiouracil Propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole cross the placenta. They can inhibit thyroid function in the fetus. Propylthiouracil is preferred because of relatively low transplacental transfer and its ability to block T 4 to T 3 conversion. Breast-feeding is safe with low doses of antithyroid drugs. Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice as it is excreted in the milk to a much lesser extent than carbimazoleCarbimazole and methimazole have been associated with rare cases of fetal aplasia cutis (single or multiple lesions of 0.5 to 3 cm at the vertex or occipital area of the scalp). The rare syndrome termed ""methimazole embryopathy"" is characterized by choanal or esophageal atresia. Methimazole may cross the placenta more readily than propylthiouracil, but both drugs have been used highly effectively in pregnancyCombination therapy with an antithyroid drug and thyroxine must be avoided. The dose of antithyroid drug needs to be higher in patients who are also receiving thyroxine therapy. This results in fetal hypothyroidism, because little of the thyroxine reaches the fetus. 33) How can you assess risk of neonatal hyperthyroidism?a) Fetal T4 and T3b) Maternal free T4 and T3c) Maternal serum thyrotropin-receptor antibodies c) Maternal serum thyrotropin-receptor antibodiesHyperthyroidism is present in the fetuses and neonates of 1 to 5 percent of women who have Graves' disease during pregnancy. It is caused by the transplacental passage of thyroid-stimulating antibodies. ## The risk of neonatal hyperthyroidism can be assessed by measuring maternal serum thyrotropin-receptor antibodies at the beginning of the third trimester. 34) Thyrotoxic crisis - False statementa) Characterized by fever b) No significant mortality c) Thyrotoxic crisis is usually precipitated by acute illness d) Radioiodine treatment may precipitate e) None b) No significant mortality The mortality rate due to cardiac failure, arrhythmia, or hyperthermia is 30%, even with treatment. Thyrotoxic crisis is usually precipitated by stroke, infection, trauma, diabetic ketoacidosis, surgery (especially on the thyroid), or radioiodine treatment of a patient with partially treated or untreated hyperthyroidism. 35) Not used in the management of thyrotoxic crisisa) Oral propylthiouracil b) Iodide c) Propranolol d) IV calcium e) Dexamethasone d) IV calcium IV calcium is not indicatedLarge doses of propylthiouracil should be given orally or by nasogastric tube or per rectum. Propylthiouracil is the agent of choice because it inhibits peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 in large doses.## The major action of iodine is to inhibit hormone release. Iodine acutely retards the rate of ## Secretion of T4. Iodine may also block thyroid hormone synthesis via the Wolff-Chaikoff effect (excess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification). ## The rapid slowing of hormone release by iodine makes it more effective than the propylthiouracil when prompt relief of thyrotoxicosis is mandatory. Iodine is given only one hour after the first dose of propylthiouracil. The 1-hour delay allows the antithyroid drug to prevent the excess iodine from being incorporated into new hormone. Iodine is also used in preparation for subtotal thyroidectomy, in severe thyrocardiac disease, and in acute surgical emergenciesPropranolol decreases tremulousness, palpitations, excessive sweating, eyelid retraction, and heart rate. High doses of propranolol decrease T 4 to T 3 conversion. Adrenergic antagonists are most useful in the interval when a response to thionamide or radioiodine therapy is being awaited.Dexamethasone inhibits the secretion of thyroid hormone, inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and has immunosuppressive effects. Concurrent administration of propylthiouracil, iodine, and dexamethasone to the patient with severe thyrotoxicosis causes a rapid reduction in serum T3 concentration. Additional therapeutic measures include antibiotics if infection is present, cooling, and intravenous fluids. 36) Which is not a treatment of orbitopathy?a) Antibiotics b) Oral glucocorticoid c) Tarsorrhaphy d) Orbital decompression e) Total ablation of the thyroid gland e) Total ablation of the thyroid glandInfiltrative orbitopathy is not benefited by total ablation of the thyroid gland.Ulceration and infection of the cornea should be treated with antibiotics, lubricants, and protective shields.A trial of oral glucocorticoid therapy should be tried for patients with severe or progressive orbitopathy. If effective doses cannot be tolerated, a course of external radiation may be attempted if edema predominates.Tarsorrhaphy (to oppose the eyelids by means of sutures) should be performed only by an experienced ophthalmologist because sutures may be torn out and cause scarring. If glucocorticoid therapy and external radiation do not halt progression of the disease and if loss of vision is threatened, orbital decompression can be performed. Surgery almost invariably halts the progress of the disease and preserves vision if it is performed in time. See chart below. 37) Abnormality seen in sick euthyroid syndromea) Decrease in total T3 levelsb) Decrease in free T3 levelsc) Normal levels of T4 d) Normal levels of TSHe) All of the above e) All of the aboveAny acute, severe illness can cause abnormalities of circulating TSH or thyroid hormone levels. The most common hormone pattern in sick euthyroid syndrome is a decrease in total and free T 3 levels (low T 3 syndrome) with ## normal levels of T4 and TSH 38) Present in both pregnancy and hyperthyroidisma) Thyroid enlargement b) Amenorrhea c) Elevated total serum T4 and T3 levels d) All d) AllBoth Pregnancy and hyperthyroidism are accompanied by thyroid enlargement, a hyperdynamic circulation, and hypermetabolism.Amenorrhea may occur in thyrotoxicosis also.In pregnancy, serum TBG levels are increased. Thus, in both pregnancy and hyperthyroidism, the total serum T4 and T3 levels are elevated. The most useful laboratory tests in their differentiation are measurement of the serum TSH and free T4 levels. Serum TSH is suppressed in hyperthyroidism in pregnant and in nonpregnant women. 39) What is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis in childhood?a) Excess iodineb) Maternal thyrotoxicosisc) Graves' disease d) Pituitary tumore) Hypothalamic disorder c) Graves' disease Thyrotoxicosis in childhood and adolescence is almost always due to Graves' disease. Radioiodine is not used in the treatment of childhood thyrotoxicosis. Antithyroid drugs are more appropriate than surgery for most children HYPOTHYROIDISM (26 MCQs)1) What is the most common cause of hypothyroidism?a) Hashimoto's thyroiditisb) Treatment of hyperthyroidismc) Iodine deficiency d) Idiopathic c) Iodine deficiency Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In areas where iodine deficiency is not present, autoimmune disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and iatrogenic causes (treatment of hyperthyroidism) are the most common causes.CAUSES OF HYPOTHYROIDISMPrimary (in 99%) Iodine deficiency Hashimoto thyroiditis (Autoimmune hypothyroidism) Postablative - Following surgery, radioiodine therapy, or external radiation to the thyroid Drugs (lithium, iodides, amiodarone, ethionamide, interferon alpha) Congenital (thyroid dysgenesis) Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome (TR-β mutations) Congenital biosynthetic defect (dyshormonogenetic goiter) Secondary• Pituitary failure (TSH deficiency)Tertiary• Hypothalamic failure (rare)Primary hypothyroidism is the etiology in 99% of cases of hypothyroidism. Less than 1% is due to TSH deficiency or other causes. 2) Which is not a cause of hypothyroidism?a) Iodine deficiency b) Chronic iodine excess c) Anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies d) Sheehan's syndromee) None of the above e) None of the above. All are causes of hypothyroidism. Iodine deficiency is responsible for endemic goiter and cretinism. It is an uncommon cause of adult hypothyroidism.Paradoxically, chronic iodine excess can also cause goiter and hypothyroidism. Mechanism is unclear. ## Patients with autoimmune thyroiditis are especially susceptible. Amiodarone causes hypothyroidism in up to 13%. Amiodarone contains lot of iodide and iodine excess is responsible for hypothyroidism caused by amiodarone. Lithium may also cause hypothyroidism.TSH levels may be low, normal, or even slightly increased in secondary hypothyroidism. Increased TSH is due to secretion of TSH which is immunoactive but not active physiologically. The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting a low free T 4 level. 3) Drug induced hypothyroidisma) Lithium b) Contrast media c) Amiodarone d) Interferon alpha e) All e) All Lithium interferes with the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones. Approximately 5% of patients taking lithium for more than 18 months develop hypothyroidism Contrast media contain iodine. Excess iodine may cause hypothyroidism.Amiodarone is a structural analog of thyroid hormone. Chronic therapy can cause both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Interferon alpha can cause autoimmune thyroiditis. This complication is not reversible upon cessation of therapy. 4) What is the most common cause of neonatal hypothyroidism?a) Thyroid gland dysgenesis b) Inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis c) TSH-R antibody-mediated d) Antithyroid drugs in mother Thyroid gland dysgenesis accounts for about 85% of neonatal hypothyroidism. The majority of infants appear normal at birth. Diagnosis is by TSH or T 4 levels in heel-prick blood specimens. Inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis accounts for about 12% of neonatal hypothyroidism.TSH-R antibody-mediated accounts for about 5%. 5) What is the earliest sign of congenital hypothyroidism?a) Patent posterior fontanel b) Coarse facial features c) Hypertrophied muscle d) Delayed relaxation of knee jerke) Bradycardia a) Patent posterior fontanel Patent posterior fontanel is the earliest sign of congenital hypothyroidism. It is due to wide-open cranial sutures due to lag in skeletal maturation in utero.Coarse facial features appears by 8 to 10 weeks.Hypertrophied muscles are seen rarely in long standing untreated cases 6) What causes thyroid follicular destruction in Hashimoto's thyroiditis? a) B cells b) T cells c) Antibodies d) Inhibition of thyroid cell functione) Complement Thyroid follicular destruction is predominantly by T cell mediated mechanisms Antibodies may also contribute to thyroid dysfunction by complement fixation or inhibition of thyroid cell function. 7) What is the most common symptom of hypothyroidism?a) Weakness b) Hair loss c) Poor memory d) Constipation e) Weight gain Weakness and dry skin are the most common symptoms.Hair is dry, brittle and falls out easily. There may be diffuse alopecia and thinning of the outer third of the eyebrows.Poor memory and difficulty concentrating are common. Rare neurologic problems include reversible cerebellar ataxia, dementia, psychosis, and myxedema coma.Peristaltic activity is decreased and constipation is common. It may lead to fecal impaction (myxedema megacolon) 8) What is the most common sign of hypothyroidism?a) Carpal tunnel syndrome b) Delayed relaxation of tendon reflexes c) Peripheral edemad) Bradycardia e) Coarse skin e) Coarse skinCarpal tunnel and other entrapment syndromes are common. It is due to compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel by glycosaminoglycan deposits.There may be slow relaxation of tendon reflexes (""hung-up reflexes"") and pseudomyotonia. These are due to a decrease in the rate of muscle contraction and relaxation rather than a delay in nerve conductionMyocardial contractility and pulse rate are reduced. This causes reduced stroke volume. Peripheral resistance is increased and may cause hypertension, particularly diastolic.] 9) Not a feature of hypothyroidisma) Pericardial effusion b) Hoarse voice c) Menorrhagia d) Decreased prolactin Prolactin levels are often slightly increased. Galactorrhea may develop. Pericardial effusion occurs in up to 30%. Cardiomyopathy is unusual. Fluid may also accumulate in other serous cavities and in the middle ear, giving rise to conductive deafness.Fluid accumulation in the vocal cords and tongue cause hoarse voice.Another feature of hypothyroidism is menorrhagia and later amenorrhea. Fertility is reduced and the incidence of miscarriage is increased. 10) What is the cause of myxedema?a) Subclinical hypothyroidism b) Hyaluronic acid c) Sodium d) Cardiac failure b) Hyaluronic acid Myxedema is seen in severe hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism causes an accumulation of hyaluronic acid (type of glycosaminoglycan) in the dermis and other tissues. This material is hygroscopic and causes non-pitting mucinous edema. This is responsible for the thickened skin and puffy appearance (myxedema) seen in severe hypothyroidism. Myxedematous tissue is nonpitting and is seen around the eyes, on the dorsa of the hands and feet, and in the supraclavicular fossae. It causes enlargement of the tongue (macroglossia) and thickening of the pharyngeal and laryngeal mucous membranes (hoarseness of voice). A histologically similar deposit may occur in Graves' disease, usually over the pretibial area (pretibial myxedema). 11) CNS change(s) in hypothyroidisma) Dementia b) Psychiatric disorders c) Stupor d) Cerebellar ataxia e) All of the above e) All of the above All intellectual functions, including speech, are slowed in thyroid hormone deficiency. Loss of initiative is present and memory defects are common. Lethargy and somnolence are prominent. Dementia in elderly patients may be mistaken for senile dementia.Psychiatric disorders are common. They are usually of the paranoid or depressive type and may induce agitation (myxedema madness). Headaches are frequent.Cerebral blood flow is reduced. Cerebral hypoxia may predispose to confusional attacks and syncope, which may be prolonged and lead to stupor or coma. Other factors predisposing to coma in hypothyroidism include exposure to severe cold, infection, trauma, hypoventilation with carbon dioxide retention, and depressant drugs.Body movements are slow and clumsy, and cerebellar ataxia may occur. 12) Which is not a feature of Hashimoto's thyroiditis?a) Puffy faceb) Edematous eyelidsc) Nonpitting pretibial edemad) Pretibial myxedema e) Obstructive sleep apnea d) Pretibial myxedema Pretibial myxedema is typical of Graves disease. The typical lesion has an ""orange-skin"" appearance. It is most common over the anterior and lateral aspects of the lower leg. Hence, it is called pretibial myxedema.Obstructive sleep apnea is common in hypothyroidism. It is reversible with restoration of a euthyroid state 13) Hashimoto's encephalopathy - True statementa) Myoclonus b) Steroid-responsive c) May occur without hypothyroidism d) All of the above d) All of the above Hashimoto's encephalopathy is a rare syndrome. It is associated with myoclonus and slow-wave activity on electroencephalography. It can cause coma and death.It is steroid-responsive.It may occur in autoimmune thyroiditis without hypothyroidism. 14) Which of the following is not associated with autoimmune hypothyroidism?a) Vitiligo b) Pernicious anemiac) Type 2 diabetes mellitus d) Celiac disease e) Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy c) Type 2 diabetes mellitus Autoimmune hypothyroidism may be associated with signs or symptoms of other autoimmune diseases, particularly vitiligo, pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, alopecia areata, and type 1 diabetes mellitusLess common associations include celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic active hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and Sjogren's syndrome.Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy usually occurs in Graves' disease. It also occurs in 5% with autoimmune hypothyroidism. 15) What is the best screening test in suspected hypothyroidism?a) TSH b) Free T4 c) Free T3 d) TPO antibodies e) Creatine phosphokinase A normal TSH level excludes primary (but not secondary) hypothyroidism. If the TSH is elevated, do a free T 4 level to confirm clinical hypothyroidism. Free T 4 is inferior to TSH as a screening test. It will not detect subclinical or mild hypothyroidism.## Circulating free T 3 levels are normal in 25%. Therefore, T 3 measurements are not indicated in suspected hypothyroidism. After hypothyroidism is confirmed, TPO antibodies determine the etiology. They are present in more than 90% with autoimmune hypothyroidism. If there is any doubt about the cause of a goiter associated with hypothyroidism, do FNA biopsy to confirm autoimmune thyroiditis.Other abnormal laboratory findings in hypothyroidism include increased creatine phosphokinase, elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, and anemia (usually normocytic or macrocytic). 16) T4 level in subclinical hypothyroidism a) Normal b) Low c) Raised d) Normal or raised a) Normal In subclinical hypothyroidism, T 4 is normal with raised TSH. Do thyroid peroxidase antibodies. If peroxidase antibodies are positive, or patient is symptomatic, treat with thyroxine. If TPO Ab are negative or the patients is asymptomatic, do yearly follow up.If T4 is reduced with raised TSH, then it is clinical hypothyroidism. Do TPO antibodies test. If positive, autoimmune hypothyroidism is confirmed. If negative, look for other causes of hypothyroidism. 17) TSH is normal and T4 is low. What is the diagnosis?a) Pituitary diseaseb) Drug effectc) Sick euthyroid syndromed) All 18) How is dose of levothyroxine adjusted in hypothyroidism?a) T4 b) T3c) Free T3d) TSH d) TSH The goal of treatment is a low normal TSH. TSH responses are gradual. TSH should be measured about 2 months after instituting treatment or after any subsequent change in levothyroxine dosage. Patients may get full relief from symptoms only 3 to 6 months after restoring normal TSH levels. It patients are over treated with T4, they have an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and reduced bone density. 19) What is the best test of thyroid function 2 months after radioiodine treatment of Graves' disease?a) TSHb) TRH stimulation testc) Free T4 d) Free T3e) Radio iodine uptake Hyperthyroidism suppress TSH secretion. TSH remains suppressed for few months even after treatment of hyperthyroidism. So, free T 4 levels are a better measure of thyroid function than TSH in the months following radioiodine treatment. 3 to 4 months after radioiodine treatment, transient hypothyroidism may occur. Iatrogenic hypothyroidism is a common cause of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is due to reversible radiation damage rather than to cellular destruction. Give low-dose thyroxine until recovery occurs. 20) A 50-year-old woman with normal body weight is on 200 ug of levothyroxine per day for hypothyroidism and insulin for DM. TSH level is elevated. Free T4 levels are high. What is the next step? a) Increase levothyroxine doseb) Decrease levothyroxine dosec) Continue same treatmentd) Suspect noncompliance e) Check serum proteins High TSH levels despite a constant levothyroxine dosage is due to poor compliance. Such patients often have normal or high free T 4. This is because they take medication for a few days before testing. This normalizes T 4 but not TSH levels. Other causes of increased levothyroxine requirements must be excluded, particularly malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, small-bowel surgery) and drugs that interfere with T 4 absorption or clearance (e.g., cholestyramine, ferrous sulfate, calcium supplements, lovastatin, aluminum hydroxide, rifampicin, amiodarone, carbamazepine, and phenytoin 21) Half-life of T 4a) 12 hoursb) 24 hoursc) 3 daysd) 7 days e) 3 weeks T 4 has a long half-life of 7 days. Therefore, patients who miss doses can take up to three doses of the skipped tablets at once 22) Which of the following has a major role in myxedema coma? a) Hypoventilation b) Hypoglycemia c) Hyponatremiad) Heart failure e) Exposure to cold Myxedema coma is the final stage of severe longstanding hypothyroidism and is associated with a high mortality rate. Hypoventilation plays a major role in pathogenesis of myxedema coma. Hypoventilation causes hypoxia and hypercapnia. It is usually precipitated by drugs that impair respiration (e.g., sedatives, anesthetics, antidepressants)Hypoglycemia and dilutional hyponatremia also contribute to the development of myxedema coma.Other precipitating causes are pneumonia, heart failure, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebrovascular accidents and sepsis. Exposure to cold is also a risk factor. Myxedema coma almost always occurs in the elderly. Myxedema coma has a high mortality rate even with intensive treatment 23) Which is not indicated in the treatment of myxedema coma?a) IV levothyroxine b) IV liothyronine c) Hydrocortisone d) External warming in all e) Ventilatory support d) External warming in all External warming is indicated only if the temperature is less than 30 degree C. It can cause cardiovascular collapseLevothyroxine can be administered as a single IV bolus. If IV preparation is not available, levothyroxine can be given by nasogastric tube, though absorption may be impaired in myxedema.T3 also can be given IV or via nasogastric tube.There is impaired adrenal reserve in severe hypothyroidism. Therefore, give parenteral hydrocortisone. Hypertonic saline may be needed if there is hyponatremia. Avoid hypotonic IV fluids. Hypotonic IV fluids may exacerbate water retention secondary to reduced renal perfusion and inappropriate vasopressin secretion. 24) Subclinical hypothyroidism a) Low T4 and T3 with normal TSHb) Low T4 with normal T3 and TSHc) Low T3 with normal T4 and TSHd) Raised TSH with normal T4 and T3 e) Very low T4 with raised TSH d) Raised TSH with normal T4 and T3 Subclinical hypothyroid disease is a laboratory diagnoses. Undetected subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy may adversely affect the fetus and be associated with hypertension and toxemia. Therefore, screening of pregnant women has been advocated. Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with ovulatory dysfunction and infertility. Screening may be useful in this population also. Women who are pregnant or who have ovulatory dysfunction and infertility should be treated regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms, antibody status, or serum lipid levels.RISK FACTORS FOR SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM1. Treated hyperthyroidism2. History of neck irradiation3. Postpartum thyroiditis4. Autoimmune disorders, especially type 1 diabetes5. Amiodarone6. Lithium7. Interferon alfa 25) Pendred syndrome - True statementa) Thyroid organification defectb) Hearing lossc) Hypothyroidismd) All of the above Organification of iodine involves binding of oxidized iodide with tyrosyl residues in thyroglobulin. This process is deficient in Pendred syndrome. The abnormality is in the gene encoding pendrin. Pendrin is involved in the apical secretion of iodide into the follicular lumen. 26) Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome - True statementa) Autosomal-dominantb) High T3 and T4c) High TSHd) All Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder. It is caused by inherited mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor. The receptors are unable to bind thyroid hormones. Therefore, there is resistance to thyroid hormone, despite high circulating levels of T3 and T4 . The pituitary is also resistant to feedback from thyroid hormones. Therefore, TSH levels tend to be high as well 6) What causes thyroid follicular destruction in Hashimoto's thyroiditis? a) B cells b) T cells c) Antibodies d) Inhibition of thyroid cell functione) Complement NEOPLASMS OF THE THYROID (20 MCQs)1) Adenomas of the thyroid - True statementa.

Surgery 3) What is the treatment of suspected follicular adenoma?a. Observationb. Thyroxinec. Radioiodined. Surgery T [ A definitive diagnosis of adenomas can be made only after careful histologic examination of the resected specimen because of the need for evaluating capsular integrity.

Controversy exists about the use of total thyroidectomy versus lobectomy and isthmectomy in adults with a 1- to 2-cm papillary carcinoma. The advantage of total thyroidectomy is that radioiodine treatment is possible. Radioablation is much less effective and requires a larger dosage if residual thyroid exists as in lobectomy.

Symptoms related to compression and invasion, such as dyspnea, dysphagia, hoarseness, and cough, are common.]d. No effective therapy [ In most cases, the disease has already spread beyond the thyroid capsule into adjacent neck structures or has metastasized to the lungs at the time of presentation. There are no effective therapies. The disease is almost uniformly fatal.] e. All of the above 19) Medullary carcinomas of the thyroid - False statementa. Arise from parafollicular cells b. Calcitonin is useful in diagnosis c. 99% are associated with MEN syndrome d. Mutations in the RET protooncogene play an important role 19) Medullary carcinomas of the thyroid - False statementa. Arise from parafollicular cells [ Medullary carcinomas of the thyroid are neuroendocrine neoplasms derived from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid. They account for 5% of thyroid neoplasms.]b. Calcitonin is useful in diagnosis [ Medullary carcinomas secrete calcitonin, similar to normal C cells. Measurement of calcitonin is important for both diagnosis and postoperative follow-up.]c. 99% are associated with MEN syndrome F [ False statement. About 70% arise sporadically. 30% occurs in the setting of MEN syndrome 2A or 2B or as familial tumors without an associated MEN syndrome. Sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas present as a solitary nodule. In contrast, bilaterality and multicentricity are common in familial cases.]d. Mutations in the RET protooncogene play an important role [ Activating point mutations in the RET protooncogene play an important role. All asymptomatic MEN-2 family members carrying RET mutations are offered prophylactic thyroidectomy as early as possible to protect against the inevitable development of medullary carcinomas.] 20) Not a prominent feature of sporadic medullary carcinomaa. Mass in the neck b. Paraneoplastic syndrome c. Hypocalcemia d. Raised carcinoembryonic antigen 20) Not a prominent feature of sporadic medullary carcinomaa. Mass in the neck [ Sporadic cases of medullary carcinoma often present with a mass in the neck, sometimes associated with local effects such as dysphagia or hoarseness.]b. Paraneoplastic syndrome [ Some cases present with a paraneoplastic syndrome, caused by the secretion of a peptide hormone (e.g., diarrhea due to the secretion of VIP, or Cushing syndrome due to ACTH).]c. Hypocalcemia T [ Hypocalcemia is not a prominent feature, despite the presence of raised calcitonin levels.]d. Raised carcinoembryonic antigen [ Carcinoembryonic antigen secreted by the neoplastic cells is a useful biomarker in addition to circulating calcitonin. It is especially useful in calcitonin-negative tumors and for presurgical assessment of tumor load.] 1) Most common cause of pancreatic injurya) Penetrating trauma b) Blunt abdominal traumac) Automobile seatbeltsd) Bicycle handlebars 1) Most common cause of pancreatic injurya) Penetrating trauma T [ Two thirds of pancreatic injuries are the result of penetrating trauma.]b) Blunt abdominal trauma [ The remaining one third is due to blunt trauma. Automobile seatbelts or bicycle handlebars may cause blunt injury. The neck and body of the pancreas can be injured as they pass over the vertebral column.]c) Automobile seatbeltsd) Bicycle handlebars 2) Most frequent presentation of blunt pancreatic traumaa) Pseudocyst b) Epigastric pain c) Hematemesis d) Fistula e) Malabsorption 3) Which is best to evaluate suspected pancreatic trauma?a) Serum amylase levels at the time of hospital admissionb) Serum lipasec) Contrast-enhanced CT d) Ultrasound 3) Which is best to evaluate suspected pancreatic trauma?a) Serum amylase levels at the time of hospital admission [ Serum amylase levels are elevated in most patients with significant pancreatic trauma. They are also increased in up to 90% of severe abdominal trauma patients who do not have pancreatic injury. Thus, measurement of amylase at the time of hospital admission is not helpful in identifying those with pancreatic injury. A progressive rise in serum amylase activity is a more specific indicator of pancreatic injury.]b) Serum lipasec) Contrast-enhanced CT T [ In a patient who is hemodynamically stable, a CT scan provides the safest and most comprehensive means of diagnosis of pancreatic injury. Sensitivity is reported only to be in the range of 40-68%. CT scan is contraindicated in patients who are hemodynamically unstable. In the patient who is unstable, operative exploration provides the optimal diagnostic tool for pancreatic injury.]d) Ultrasound [ USS is also very useful to evaluate abdominal trauma, but CT is better.] 4) A patient with suspected pancreatic injury has persistent abdomi¬nal pain with signs of peritonitis.

What should be done?a) Do immediate ERCP [ ERCP is increasingly being used to diagnose pancreatic ductal injuries.]b) Start IV fluids T [ Start IV fluids. Maintain nil oral. Do urgent ultrasound. After ascertaining the damage, undertake appropriate action. The management of pancreatic injuries depends on the presence of pancreatic duct disruption, major associated vascular injury, and/or significant injury to peripancreatic organs, especially the duodenum.]c) Arrange for immediate operation [ Operation is indicated only if there is disruption of the main pancreatic duct. Almost all other patients will resolve with conservative management.]d) Fix date for MRI and cholangiography 5) What is the most common cause of death in the immediate period after pancreatic injury?a) Pseudocyst b) Pancreatic duct stricture c) Bleeding d) Peritonitis 5) What is the most common cause of death in the immediate period after pancreatic injury?a) Pseudocyst [ The major delayed complications of severe pancreatic injuries are the development of pseudocysts or a pancreatic duct stricture.]b) Pancreatic duct stricture [ This is a delayed complication.]c) Bleeding T [ Once the acute phase has passed the mortality and morbidity should be minimal with a complete return to normal activity.] d) Peritonitis 6) What is the most common cause pancreatic fistula? a) Operative trauma to the gland b) Complication of acute pancreatitisc) Complication of acute pancreatitisd) Complication of pancreatic cancer 6) What is the most common cause pancreatic fistula? a) Operative trauma to the gland T [ The danger of a pancreatic fistula is digestion of surrounding structures by activated pancreatic enzymes causing local damage, perforation, bleeding and digestion of the skin.]b) Complication of acute pancreatitisc) Complication of acute pancreatitisd) Complication of pancreatic cancer 7) How can you obtain immediate control of the fistula?a) Nil by mouth regimeb) Octreotide c) Adequate drainage of the fistula d) All of the above 7) How can you obtain immediate control of the fistula?a) Nil by mouth regimeb) Octreotide c) Adequate drainage of the fistula d) All of the above T [ As a principle, in the management of any fistula, the underlying cause for the fistula must be treated before closure will be effective.] e) None Management of the Injured Patient > D.

Increase in frequency with age [ Nodules are more common in women and increase in frequency with age and with decreasing iodine intake. Nodules detected by ultrasonography (not by palpation) are very common after the age of 60 years.]b. Only about 5% of cases are due to thyroid carcinoma [ The most common diagnoses are colloid nodules, cysts, and thyroiditis (in 80 percent of cases); benign follicular neoplasms (in 10 to 15 percent); and thyroid carcinoma (in 5 percent).]c.

Biopsy is useful to guide the type of surgery.] CLINICAL FINDINGS SUGGESTING CARCINOMA IN A EUTHYROID PATIENT WITH A SOLITARY NODULE High suspicion• Family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia• Rapid tumor growth, especially during levothyroxine therapy• Very firm or hard nodule • Fixation of the nodule to adjacent structures• Paralysis of vocal cords• Regional lymphadenopathy• Distant metastasesModerate suspicion• Age of either <20 years or >70 years• Male sex• History of head and neck irradiation• A nodule >4 cm in diameter or partially cystic• Symptoms of compression o Dysphagiao Dysphoniao Hoarsenesso Dyspneao Cough 3) Which of the following is least useful in the evaluation of solitary thyroid nodule?a. TSH b. Antithyroperoxidase antibody c. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy d. Serum calcitonin level 3) Which of the following is least useful in the evaluation of solitary thyroid nodule?a. TSH [ Clinical examination is not sensitive for identifying thyroid dysfunction (neither hypothyroidism nor hypothyroidism). Therefore, measurement of the serum TSH level is needed. Nearly all patients with thyroid cancer are euthyroid.]b. Antithyroperoxidase antibody [ If TSH level is subnormal, measure free thyroxine or free triiodothyronine to confirm hyperthyroidism. If the TSH concentration is elevated, do a serum antithyroperoxidase antibody level to confirm Hashimoto's thyroiditis.] c. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy [ A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is needed even if TPO antibody levels are elevated to exclude a coexisting cancer, including lymphoma. It accounts for only 5 percent of thyroid cancers but is associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.]d. Serum calcitonin level T [ If a patient has a family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, obtain a basal level. An elevated level suggests medullary thyroid cancer. Serum calcitonin is not routinely measured in patients who have no suggestive family history.] 4) Which one of the following can most reliably rule out malignancy?a. USS b. Functioning nodule on radionuclide scanning c. FNAB d. TPO antibodies 4) Which one of the following can most reliably rule out malignancy?a. USS [ Ultrasonography can accurately detect nonpalpable nodules and measure the size of the nodule. USS can differentiate simple cysts from solid nodules. Simple cysts have a low risk of being malignant. Solid nodules or mixed cystic and solid nodules have a 5 percent risk of being malignant. Sonographic findings cannot reliably distinguish between benign and cancerous lesions. Ultrasonography also provides guidance for diagnostic procedures (e.g., fine-needle aspiration biopsy) as well as therapeutic procedures (e.g., cyst aspiration, ethanol injection, or laser therapy).]b. Functioning nodule on radionuclide scanning T [ Radionuclide scanning is not routinely recommended. Radionuclide scanning may be used to identify whether a nodule is functioning. A functioning nodule is nearly always benign. 90 percent of nodules are nonfunctioning and has a 5 percent risk of being malignant.]c. FNAB [ In the case of a strong clinical suspicion of cancer, surgery is recommended, regardless of the results of fine-needle aspiration biopsy.]d. TPO antibodies [ It is associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.] 5) When is CT indicated in the evaluation of goiters?a. To differentiate between malignant and benign nodules b. In the evaluation of substernal goiters c. To identify nodules for biopsyd. To detect enlarged lymph nodes 5) When is CT indicated in the evaluation of goiters?a. To differentiate between malignant and benign nodules [ CT and MRI also cannot reliably differentiate between malignant and benign nodules. These tests are not usually indicated in the evaluation of a nodule.]b. In the evaluation of substernal goiters T [ CT and MRI is indicated in the diagnosis and evaluation of substernal goiters, since these imaging techniques can assess the extent of the goiter more precisely than can other techniques and can evaluate tracheal compression.]c. To identify nodules for biopsyd. To detect enlarged lymph nodes 6) What is the treatment of a benign nonfunctioning nodule in female of 65 years?a. Lifelong follow-up b. Levothyroxine c. Iodine-131 d. Surgery 6) What is the treatment of a benign nonfunctioning nodule in female of 65 years?a. Lifelong follow-up T [ Periodic lifelong follow-up every 6 to 24 months is the recommended option. This includes measurement of serum thyrotropin levels, neck palpation, and fine-needle aspiration in case of growth or other suspicious signs.]b. Levothyroxine [ For a nonfunctional benign nodule, there is no clear recommendation on the use of levothyroxine.]c. Iodine-131 [ Iodine-131 is considered the treatment of choice for a functioning benign nodule.]d. Surgery [ The main indications for surgical treatment of thyroid nodules are malignancy or indeterminate cytology on FNA, and suspicious history and physical examination. Surgery is an option, especially if the nodule is very large or partly cystic or if the patient is young.] 7) A 42-year-old woman presents with a palpable mass on the left side of her neck. She has no neck pain and no symptoms of thyroid dysfunction. Ultrasound examination reveals a solid, solitary, mobile thyroid nodule, 2 cm by 3 cm, without lymphadenopathy. The patient has no family history of thyroid disease and no history of external irradiation. What should be done? a. Repeat ultrasonography after 1 year b. Give levothyroxine c. Hemithyroidectomy d. Iodine-131 7) A 42-year-old woman presents with a palpable mass on the left side of her neck. She has no neck pain and no symptoms of thyroid dysfunction. Ultrasound examination reveals a solid, solitary, mobile thyroid nodule, 2 cm by 3 cm, without lymphadenopathy. The patient has no family history of thyroid disease and no history of external irradiation. What should be done? a. Repeat ultrasonography after 1 year T [ The main concern is to exclude thyroid cancer. The initial evaluation should include measurement of the serum thyrotropin level and a fine-needle aspiration, preferably guided by ultrasonography. The usual approach after documenting benign cytology is to follow the patient yearly with neck palpation and measurement of the serum thyrotropin level, with repeated ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration if there is evidence of growth of the nodule.]b. Give levothyroxine [ Levothyroxine is not the recommended therapy to shrink or prevent growth of benign nodules because of the drug's low efficacy and potential side effects.]c. Hemithyroidectomy [ In patients less than 20 years old, and in the case of a high clinical suspicion for cancer (e.g., follicular neoplasia as diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration and a nonfunctioning nodule revealed on scanning), the patient should be offered hemithyroidectomy regardless of the results of fine-needle aspiration.]d. Iodine-131 [ In the case of a functioning benign nodule, iodine-131 is the therapy of choice, independent of concomitant hyperthyroidism.] GOITER AND MNG (12 MCQs)1) What is the most common manifestation of thyroid disease?a. Hypothyroidismb. Hyperthyroidismc. Goiter d. Abnormal thyroid function tests 1) What is the most common manifestation of thyroid disease?a. Hypothyroidismb. Hyperthyroidismc. Goiter T [ Goiter is enlargement of the thyroid. Goiter is the most common manifestation of thyroid disease. 4 questions have to be answered 1. Is the goiter diffuse or nodular? 2. Is it nontoxic or toxic? 3. Is it causing any local compressive or cosmetic problems? 4. Is it benign or malignant?]d. Abnormal thyroid function testsCAUSES OF THYROID ENLARGEMENTDiffuse goiter• Iodine deficiency (endemic goiter)• Simple goiter• Hashimoto's thyroiditis• Graves' disease• Transient thyroiditis• Drugso Iodine, amiodarone, lithium• Suppurative thyroiditis• Dyshormonogenesis• Riedel's thyroiditis Multinodular goiterSolitary nodule• Colloid nodule - most common and do not have an increased risk of malignancy• Simple cyst• Follicular adenoma - Most follicular adenomas are benign • Carcinoma • Lymphoma• Thyroiditis 2) What causes diffuse nontoxic (simple) goiter?a. Viral thyroiditisb. Euthyroid Graves' disease c. Dietary iodine deficiency d. Colloid goiter e. Adolescence 2) What causes diffuse nontoxic (simple) goiter?a. Viral thyroiditisb. Euthyroid Graves' disease c. Dietary iodine deficiency T [ Diffuse goiter is most commonly caused by dietary iodine deficiency resulting in impaired synthesis of thyroid hormone. A compensatory rise in the serum TSH level causes hypertrophy and hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells and enlargement of the thyroid gland. The compensatory increase in functional mass of the gland may overcome the hormone deficiency, ensuring a euthyroid metabolic state. The degree of thyroid enlargement is proportional to the level and duration of thyroid hormone deficiency.]d. Colloid goiter [ Diffuse goiter (also called simple goiter) causes enlargement of the entire gland. The enlarged follicles are filled with colloid. Therefore, it is also called colloid goiter. With time, recurrent episodes of hyperplasia and involution produce an irregular enlargement of the thyroid and nodule formation (termed multinodular goiter). A thyroid nodule is a lesion in the thyroid gland due to an abnormal focal growth of thyroid cells. All long-standing simple goiters convert into multinodular goiters.]e. Adolescence [ There is no physiologic increase in thyroid volume during normal adolescence. Development of a goiter during adolescence is a pathologic rather than a physiologic process.] 3) Colloid goiter (diffuse nontoxic simple goiter) - True statementa. Usually presents between the ages of 15 and 25 years b. Mild tenderness is common c. TSH is only mildly elevated d. All of the above e. None of the above 3) Colloid goiter (diffuse nontoxic simple goiter) - True statementa.

Mild tenderness is common [ The goitre is soft and symmetrical. There is no tenderness, lymphadenopathy or overlying bruit.]c. TSH is only mildly elevated [ Concentrations of T3, T4 and TSH are normal and no thyroid autoantibodies are detected in the serum. In most cases the goitre regresses without any treatment. In some, the gland becomes multinodular as a result of recurrent episodes of hyperplasia and involution during the following 10-20 years.]d. All of the above e.

Amiodarone inhibits deiodinase activity d. May cause thyrotoxicosis e. All of the above 1) Amiodaronea. High iodine levels persist for > 6 months even after discontinuation [ Amiodarone contains 40% of iodine by weight. Thus, typical doses of amiodarone (200 mg/d) are associated with very high iodine intake. Amiodarone is stored in adipose tissue. Therefore, high iodine levels persist for > 6 months after discontinuation of the drug.] b. May cause hypothyroidism [ Excess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification. This phenomenon is known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. In normal individuals, the thyroid gland escapes from this inhibitory effect and iodide organification resumes. The suppressive action of high iodide may persist in patients with underlying autoimmune thyroid disease. Amiodarone may cause hypothyroidism in such patients susceptible to the inhibitory effects of a high iodine load. Amiodarone-associated hypothyroidism is more common in women and individuals with positive TPO antibodies. It is usually unnecessary to discontinue amiodarone for this side effect. Levothyroxine can be used to normalize thyroid function.] c. Amiodarone inhibits deiodinase activity [ Amiodarone first causes a transient decrease of T4 levels. This is due to Wolff-Chaikoff effect (i.e., the inhibitory effect of iodine on T4 release. Soon, most escape from this iodide-dependent suppression of the thyroid. Later, the inhibitory effects of amiodarone on deiodinase activity and thyroid hormone receptor action become predominant. This effects lead to increased T4, decreased T3, increased rT3, and a transient increase of TSH. TSH levels normalize or are slightly suppressed after about 1 to 3 months.]d. May cause thyrotoxicosis [ Jod - Basedow phenomenon is thyroid hormone synthesis becoming excessive as a result of increased iodine exposure. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is far more prevalent in iodine-deficient regions.]e. All of the above T [ Amiodarone may also cause a thyroiditis-like condition.] 2) Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) - True statementa. Type 1 AIT is associated with an underlying thyroid abnormality b. Type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is a destructive thyroiditis c. There is increased vascularity in type 1 AIT d. All of the above 2) Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) - True statementa. Type 1 AIT is associated with an underlying thyroid abnormality [ There are two major forms of AIT (amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis). Type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is due to release of excessive thyroid hormone. It is iodine-induced. Type 1 AIT is associated with an underlying thyroid abnormality (preclinical Graves' disease or nodular goiter). Thyroid hormone synthesis becomes excessive as a result of increased iodine exposure (Jod-Basedow phenomenon).]b. Type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is a destructive thyroiditis [ Type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is a destructive thyroiditis that causes the release of preformed thyroid hormone from the damaged thyroid gland. Type 2 AIT occurs with no intrinsic thyroid abnormalities. It is due to drug-induced lysosomal activation leading to destructive thyroiditis.] c. There is increased vascularity in type 1 AIT [ Distinguishing between the two forms of amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis is difficult, especially since some patients have both types. Color-flow Doppler thyroid scan shows increased vascularity in type 1 but decreased vascularity in type 2 AIT.] d. All of the above 3) What is the most effective long-term solution for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis?a. Stop amiodarone b. Antithyroid drugs c. Glucocorticoidsd. Lithium e. Near-total thyroidectomy 3) What is the most effective long-term solution for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis?a. Stop amiodarone [ This is often impractical because of the underlying cardiac disorder. Discontinuation of amiodarone will not have an immediate effect because of its storage and prolonged half-life.] b. Antithyroid drugs [ Type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is best treated with high doses of antithyroid drugs (methimazole or propylthiouracil). High doses of antithyroid drugs can be used in type 1 AIT but are often ineffective.] c. Glucocorticoids [ Type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis responds to high-dose corticosteroids.] d. Lithium [ It blocks thyroid hormone release and can provide modest benefit in type 1 AIT .] e. Near-total thyroidectomy T [ Near-total thyroidectomy rapidly decreases thyroid hormone levels if the patient can undergo the procedure safely. Near-total thyroidectomy is the most effective long-term solution for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.] THYROIDITIS (14 MCQs)1) Most common type of thyroiditis a. Hashimoto's thyroiditis b. Painless sporadic thyroiditis c. Painless postpartum thyroiditis d. All of the above 1) Most common type of thyroiditis a. Hashimoto's thyroiditis T [ This is the most common type of thyroiditis. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the antithyroid immune response begins with activation of helper T cells that that are specific to a thyroid antigen (e.g., thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin.). Once helper T cells are activated, they induce B cells to secrete thyroid antibodies.]b. Painless sporadic thyroiditis c. Painless postpartum thyroiditis [ Painless postpartum thyroiditis is induced by the accumulation of fetal cells in the maternal thyroid gland during pregnancy.]d.

All of the above 2) Preferentially elevated in thyrotoxicosis due to thyroiditisa. Serum T3b. Serum T4 T [ Inflammatory destruction of the thyroid may release preformed thyroid hormones from the damaged gland and lead to transient thyrotoxicosis. As thyroid hormone stores are depleted, there is often a progression through a period of euthyroidism to hypothyroidism. Serum T4 concentrations are proportionally higher than T 3 concentrations, reflecting the ratio of stored hormone in the thyroid gland. In Graves' disease and in toxic nodular goiter, T3 is preferentially elevated. The signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis due to thyroiditis are usually not severe.]c. TSHd.

Since thyroid hormones influence the metabolic activity of every cell, less-than-optimal thyroid function can profoundly affect the body and the mind. This protocol reviews thyroid function and regulation. You’ll learn how so-called normal thyroid lab test results don’t necessarily mean your thyroid isn’t contributing to your symptoms. Important aspects of thyroid function aren’t measured on most standard thyroid lab tests. Combining comprehensive thyroid function testing, integrative nutritional and dietary supplement strategies and judicious thyroid hormone replacement under physician guidance can help restore balanced thyroid function. Selenium and iodine are micronutrients that play key roles in thyroid function. Supplementation can help ensure the thyroid has access to adequate levels of these nutrients. What Does the Thyroid Do? The thyroid is an organ in the neck responsible for regulating metabolism by controlling the rate of oxygen and calorie conversion to energy. The metabolic rate of every cell in the body is controlled by thyroid hormones, particularly T3. The thyroid produces the hormones T3 and T4 in response to stimulation by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced in the pituitary gland. The thyroid requires iodine and L-tyrosine to synthesize T3 and T4. Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid does not produce enough thyroid hormone, significantly slowing metabolism. Hypothyroidism has detrimental effects on the body. Fortunately, thyroid function tests (eg, TSH, T3, and T4) can help identify an underlying thyroid condition as well as help direct proper treatment and improve symptoms. Nutrients such as iodine and selenium help support thyroid function. What are Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism? Fatigue Weakness Sensitivity to cold Constipation Unexplained weight gain Dry skin and hair (and/or hair loss) Muscle cramps Depression If left untreated, hypothyroidism can lead to goiter, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Hypothyroidism? Thyroid hormone replacement therapy Desiccated thyroid extract Which Nutrients Support Thyroid Health? Iodine. Iodine is required to synthesize thyroid hormone. Iodine deficiency is a leading cause of mental retardation due to its significance in thyroid activity. Many table salts have added iodine, and certain foods such as seaweed contain high concentrations of iodine. Selenium. Selenium is a necessary component of the enzyme that converts T4 to T3. Patients with various thyroid disorders were shown to have lower selenium levels. Zinc. Zinc may contribute to the conversion of T4 to T3. In a group of patients with abnormal thyroid hormone levels, zinc supplementation normalized the levels. Iron. Iron deficiency hampers the production of thyroid hormone. One study showed subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism were more likely to be iron deficient than the control group. Vitamin E. Several preclinical studies indicate vitamin E may help reduce oxidative stress caused by hypothyroidism. Ashwagandha extract. Ashwagandha extracts have been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to alleviate stress. A small study indicated that the extract also improved thyroid function and thyroid-related hormone levels. Korean ginseng. Korean ginseng extract has shown promise in multiple clinical trials for a variety of conditions. In a trial of subjects with congestive heart failure and low T3 and T4, intravenous ginseng extract increased levels of both hormones. Vitamin A. Vitamin A (a family of related retinoic acids including retinol and beta-carotene) is important for thyroid health, and deficiencies are associated with thyroid dysfunction. Other natural interventions for thyroid health and function include guggul extract, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and turmeric. 2 Introduction The thyroid is a small gland located at the base of the neck that produces thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones exert considerable influence over most aspects of human physiology. Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce normal amounts of these hormones. Because thyroid hormones affect so many parts of the body, hypothyroidism can have serious and varied consequences.1,2 An estimated 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disease, and nearly 60% of those with thyroid issues are unaware of their condition.3 While people of all races and ages can develop thyroid issues, women are more likely than men to have thyroid problems: one in eight women will develop a thyroid problem during her lifetime.2 Stress, unhealthy diet, and even normal aging can compromise healthy thyroid function. Hypothyroidism affects an estimated 4.6% of the world population.4 Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, depression, weight gain, cognitive deficits, and several other concerns.5 Hashimoto’s disease, a condition in which the immune system attacks the thyroid and causes low thyroid function over time, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in regions where iodine deficiency is uncommon. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a term that describes mild hypothyroidism in which some lab values are abnormal but thyroid hormone production is within normal limits. While this condition does not typically cause major health problems, it may undermine quality of life in some people.4 For a long time, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement was standard care, even in people without symptoms; however, current evidence does not support this strategy.6 In most cases, subclinical hypothyroidism identified on a blood test should only be treated if the affected person has symptoms likely related to thyroid dysfunction or if there are other indications for treatment, such as if the affected person is trying to get pregnant. Subclinical hypothyroidism often resolves on its own, but in some cases it progresses to overt hypothyroidism. In this protocol, you will learn how the thyroid gland works and what happens when there is too little thyroid hormone activity in your body. You will also learn how simple blood tests can assess thyroid function, and what treatments are available for hypothyroidism. In addition, you will discover several integrative interventions and dietary and lifestyle changes that can support healthy thyroid function. 3 Background: Understanding the Thyroid Thyroid hormone production is regulated by two specific brain regions: the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. To ensure stable levels of thyroid hormones, the hypothalamus monitors circulating thyroid hormone levels and responds to low levels by releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH stimulates the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn stimulates the thyroid gland to increase triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) secretion. When thyroid hormone levels increase, pituitary production of TSH decreases, which slows the release of hormones from the thyroid gland.1 This interconnected system is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. On a blood test, elevated TSH levels are highly suggestive of hypothyroidism. This is because the pituitary releases excessive TSH into the bloodstream in attempt to stimulate sufficient T3 and T4 production. On the other hand, low TSH levels generally indicate hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. This occurs when the thyroid is making too much T3 and T4, which causes the pituitary gland to stop releasing TSH into the blood.7 In rare cases, abnormal TSH levels are a reflection of problems with the pituitary gland rather than the thyroid. The Primary Thyroid Hormones: T4 and T3 Thyroxine, or T4, is produced solely by the thyroid gland and is the more common thyroid hormone in the blood, but triiodothyronine, or T3, is the more biologically active thyroid hormone. T3 is formed by the removal of one of T4’s four iodine atoms. This process is mediated by selenium-dependent enzymes.8 T4 is found in the body in two forms: bound and free. Free T4 is not bound to any proteins and is able to enter into body tissues. Bound T4 is attached to proteins that render it biologically inactive. Approximately 99% of T4 in the body is in the bound form.9 Very small changes in the amount of carrier proteins will affect the percentage of unbound hormones. High blood levels of T4 typically indicate hyperthyroidism and low levels are associated with hypothyroidism. However, pregnancy and oral contraceptive use can elevate thyroid hormone levels, while severe illness and certain medications can lower T4 levels.7 Elevated levels of cortisol, as seen during times of stress and in conditions such as Cushing’s syndrome, lower TRH, TSH, and thyroid hormone levels.10,11 Cold temperatures increase TRH levels, which is thought to be an intrinsic mechanism that helps keep the body warm in cold weather.12 The thyroid gland needs iodine and the amino acid L-tyrosine to make T4 and T3. A diet deficient in iodine can lead to hypothyroidism.13 Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism can be overt, in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormones, or subclinical, in which the thyroid requires excessive stimulation to make normal amounts of thyroid hormone. Approximately one of every 300 people in the United States has overt hypothyroidism, and about one of every 23 has subclinical hypothyroidism, though not all cases are symptomatic.4 Hypothyroidism can be caused by Hashimoto’s disease, thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid), certain medications, thyroid surgery, or radiation treatment of the thyroid region. Women are more likely to develop this condition, but risk increases in both genders in people over age 60.14 Hypothyroidism is generally characterized by a reduced metabolic rate. The main symptoms are14,15: fatigue weakness increased sensitivity to cold constipation unexplained weight gain dry skin hair loss or coarse, dry hair muscle cramps depression People with hypothyroidism may also have an increased risk of bleeding and some forms of anemia.16,17 Most hypothyroid-related symptoms take years to develop. The slower one’s metabolism gets, the more obvious the signs and symptoms become. If hypothyroidism goes untreated, severe symptoms such as a swollen thyroid gland (goiter) or slow thought processes may develop. Untreated chronic hypothyroidism can even result in a rare life-threatening condition called myxedema coma. Subclinical Hypothyroidism Subclinical hypothyroidism, or mild thyroid dysfunction, is a far more common condition than overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism manifests as mildly elevated TSH levels (often defined as levels above 4.5 µIU/mL) and normal T4 and T3 levels. Individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism may be at greater risk for developing overt hypothyroidism, although the condition resolves on its own in about half of cases.18 Most people with subclinical hypothyroidism have mild or no symptoms. In contrast, those with overt hypothyroidism have abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels and often have pronounced symptoms.19 Risk factors for progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism include female gender, advanced age, having a goiter, and a high iodine intake. Nearly 70% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism have no symptoms, but others experience fatigue, dry skin, cognitive decline, and muscle weakness.18,20 4 Causes and Risk Factors There are two main classifications of hypothyroidism: primary and secondary. Primary hypothyroidism arises when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone despite normal release of TSH. This leads to low levels of circulating thyroid hormones and subsequent increases in TSH levels. Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when not enough TSH is being produced in the pituitary gland, which is much less common and is usually associated with a central nervous system problem.21 The focus of this protocol is primary hypothyroidism. Chronic Autoimmune Thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s Disease) Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, commonly called Hashimoto’s disease, is by far the most common cause of hypothyroidism in areas where iodine deficiency is not prevalent, such as the United States. In this condition, the immune system mistakenly attacks thyroid tissue. Hashimoto’s disease is characterized by production of antibodies, such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and antithyroglobulin antibodies, which cause the immune system to attack the thyroid and impair its ability to make hormones.22 Some patients with Hashimoto’s disease experience an initial period of hyperthyroidism, typically lasting one to two months, prior to a drop in thyroid hormone production. This phase of the disease is referred to as Hashimoto’s thyrotoxicosis, or hashitoxicosis.23 Healthcare-Associated Hypothyroidism (Iatrogenic Hypothyroidism) Hypothyroidism may arise as a consequence of medical treatment, either directly or indirectly. For instance, thyroid removal (thyroidectomy) due to cancer or persistent autoimmune thyroid disease is a cause of hypothyroidism. Similarly, treatment with radioactive iodine for thyroid conditions can lead to hypothyroidism. Radiation treatment to the neck or upper chest region can lead to hypothyroidism, whether it was initially intended to treat a thyroid condition or something else.24,25 Some drugs used for non-thyroid conditions may also lead to hypothyroidism. These include high-dose lithium carbonate, amiodarone, interferon alpha, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and some immunotherapies and targeted therapies for cancer, among others.26,27 Environmental and Infectious Causes Exposure to some environmental toxins may disrupt thyroid function and lead to hypothyroidism. For instance, exposure to flame retardants called polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) was linked to hypothyroidism in an observational study of Canadian women.28 A variety of infections, predominately of bacterial origin, can lead to thyroid inflammation and associated thyroid dysfunction.29 Other Diseases Sometimes, diseases not directly related to the thyroid but which cause systemic problems may lead to thyroid dysfunction. Blood cancers,30 iron overload (hemochromatosis),31 and scleroderma32 are examples of systemic diseases that may cause hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism due to non-thyroid diseases may be a consequence of the disease itself or a side effect of treatment for the disease; for example, children or adolescents treated for leukemia may develop treatment-related hypothyroidism later in life.30 Pregnancy Pregnancy considerably increases the metabolic demands on women’s bodies, and thyroid function needs to adjust to accommodate these demands. Sometimes, women develop thyroid dysfunction (either hypo- or hyperthyroidism) during pregnancy or after giving birth.33 Thyroid function usually returns to normal shortly after the woman gives birth unless she has a condition that can cause prolonged thyroid issues, such as iodine deficiency or autoimmune thyroid disease. Iodine Deficiency or Excess Iodine plays an important role in thyroid physiology. Too much or too little of this trace element can cause hypothyroidism. In the United States, iodine deficiency is uncommon. Excessive intake may occur due to overconsumption of iodine-rich foods like seaweed, or excessive supplementation (the upper limit for daily iodine intake in adults recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board in the United States is 1,100 mcg daily). People with underlying thyroid disorders may be more susceptible to thyroid dysfunction due to iodine excess.34 5 Testing Thyroid Function Several tests are available to assess different aspects of thyroid health35: Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to evaluate overall thyroid function; Total thyroxine (T4) to measure the total amount of T4 being produced by the thyroid; Free thyroxine (T4), a measure of the amount of bioavailable T4 not bound to transport proteins; Free triiodothyronine (T3) to measure the amount of unbound T3 available; Reverse T3 to measure the non-functioning form of T3; Thyroglobulin antibodies that can attack proteins involved in thyroid hormone production; Thyroid peroxidase antibodies that can attack an enzyme involved in thyroid hormone production Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Measuring TSH levels in the blood is the most common test of thyroid function. The normal range for TSH in healthy individuals is 0.45–4.5 µIU/mL.36 In general, TSH levels above 4.5 µIU/mL suggest hypothyroidism, and levels below 0.45 µIU/mL represent thyroid hormone excess; however, TSH levels typically increase with age. A longitudinal cohort study following 908 healthy people for 13 years found serum TSH levels increased with age, with the largest increases observed in those who had lower TSH levels at the start of the study. Researchers concluded that this increase was not the result of disease, but rather age-related changes in TSH bioactivity.37 A large cohort study involving over 150,000 healthy people over age 18 also demonstrated that TSH levels increased with age. The authors concluded that TSH reference ranges should be age-specific, including an age group of those over 70 years of age.38 Accordingly, the American Thyroid Association recommends a TSH target level of 4–6 µIU/mL in people older than 70.39 TSH production can also fluctuate with time of day, infection, and various other factors. In a survey of nearly 350,000 people published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, abnormal TSH levels spontaneously returned to normal in more than 50% of patients when the test was repeated at a later date.40 No single measurement of TSH should be considered diagnostic, and repeated testing may be necessary to guide treatment decisions. Tests for T4 and T3 Thyroid hormones can be tested in both their free and protein-bound forms. Tests for the protein-bound forms of T4 and T3 are generally referred to as total T4 and total T3, respectively; unbound forms are called free T4 and free T3. Each of these tests provides information about how the body is making, activating, and responding to thyroid hormones. The normal range for free T4 is 0.82–1.77 ng/dL,41 and for total T4 is 4.5–12.0 µg/dL.42 The normal range for free T3 is 2.0–4.4 pg/mL43 and for total T3 is 71–180 ng/dL.44 The feedback mechanisms by which the body regulates thyroid hormone levels are very sensitive, such that small changes in T4 levels lead to relatively large changes in TSH. Therefore, TSH is generally considered an excellent indicator of thyroid health in most people whose hypothalamus and pituitary gland are functioning normally. Because T4 is converted to T3, and changes in levels of binding proteins do not affect free T4 levels, free T4 is typically the hormone measured in a clinical setting.7 While T3 testing can help diagnose or determine the severity of hyperthyroidism, it is generally not as useful in someone with hypothyroidism as it is typically the last measure to become abnormal.35 Reverse T3 T4 can also be converted into an inactive form of T3 called reverse T3 (rT3), which does not have thyroid hormone activity.45 Certain individuals with apparently normal T4 and T3 hormone levels may still have some symptoms of hypothyroidism. This may be due to an excessive production of rT3, which may interfere with T3’s activity in the body. Stress and extreme exercise may lower thyroid hormone action by suppressing production of TSH and T3 and elevating rT3 levels.10,46 In general, rT3 levels are elevated during times of critical llness.47 In hypothyroid states, rT3 levels may be low due to a reduced production of T4.48 The reference range for rT3 is 9.2–24.1 ng/dL.49 Autoimmune Antibodies The body’s immune system uses antibodies to attack foreign particles, such as bacteria and viruses, but in autoimmune disorders, dysfunctional antibodies are produced that attack healthy tissues, cells, or biomolecules. In people with autoimmune thyroid conditions, antibodies interfere with normal thyroid cell function, resulting in either stimulation or suppression of thyroid activity. Antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (an enzyme involved in thyroid hormone production) and thyroglobulin (a protein in the thyroid gland from which thyroid hormone is produced) are relatively common antibodies that can compromise thyroid function.35 Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (also called TPO or thyroid microsomal antibodies) are normally found at levels of 34 IU/mL or less. In a person with hypothyroidism, the presence of elevated TPO antibodies suggests Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, the most common cause of overt hypothyroidism in the United States.50 Interestingly, celiac disease or sensitivity to gluten appear to correlate with increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease.51,52 Elevated thyroid antibodies are often associated with chronic urticaria, or hives. Studies report that roughly 30–57% of patients with chronic urticaria also have anti-thyroid antibodies.53,54 Some evidence suggests that treatment with T4 may improve the itching associated with urticaria, but is not recommend unless the patient has hypothyroidism.55,56 Basal Body Temperature Measuring basal body temperature can sometimes provide some insight into thyroid function, although it should only be used in conjunction with standard thyroid blood testing. Body temperature testing in the context of suspected thyroid issues was common before the development of accurate thyroid function blood tests. Basal body temperature is taken when the body is at complete rest, immediately after waking, and before beginning any activity. Normal basal temperature is roughly 97.6–98.6º F, and some integrative practitioners suggest that a five-day consecutive temperature reading below 97.6º F may suggest hypothyroidism. In a large longitudinal study of over 35,000 people whose temperatures were taken during routine medical visits, there was a correlation between TSH levels and body temperature. Hypothyroidism was linked to lower body temperatures.57 Nevertheless, there are many reasons for alteration of basal body temperature, so a thyroid panel blood test should be taken to more accurately evaluate thyroid function. Additional Testing Sometimes additional testing, such as biopsy or enzymatic studies, is required to establish a definite diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Major abnormalities of the thyroid gland detected in a physical exam can be further assessed by other procedures, including ultrasound or scintigraphy. Ultrasound may be used to more closely examine thyroid nodules (or lumps in the neck region) to determine if they are cancerous. Scintigraphy is a scan that can be used to look at the size and shape of the thyroid gland, as well as its position in the body. A small amount of radioactive iodine is used in this procedure to detect nodules and determine the cause of any thyroid issues. The radioactive iodine uptake test may also be useful in diagnosing thyroid issues. As the thyroid takes iodine from the bloodstream to produce T4, this action can be clinically measured by having a patient swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine. This allows the doctor to track where the iodine is going and measure thyroid function by determining how much radioactivity is taken up by the thyroid gland. The test is performed by taking a pill containing radioactive iodine. The thyroid is then scanned by a computer after several hours and usually again after a full day to assess the thyroid’s uptake of the radioactive iodine. A low level of radioactivity uptake is seen in those with hypothyroidism.35 6 Complications and Associated Conditions Complications of hypothyroidism include goiter, depression and other mental disorders, heart problems, infertility and pregnancy complications, and nerve damage. In rare cases, long-term untreated hypothyroidism can lead to a life-threatening condition known as myxedema coma, which is triggered by severe stress, sedative use, or infection. Myxedema coma is indicated by intense cold intolerance and drowsiness, followed by lethargy and unconsciousness.58 Fatigue and Weakness Fatigue is a near-universal symptom of low thyroid hormone levels, and many hypothyroid patients report fatigue, weakness, and decreasing quality of life. A decrease in thyroid hormone production and a disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis reduces energy production and metabolism, which results in tiredness.59 Gastrointestinal Manifestations Thyroid function and gut health are interrelated. The thyroid hormone T4 is converted to T3 in many tissues, including those of the gastrointestinal tract.60 Inflammation in the gut may inhibit this process. In addition, the intestinal microbiome plays a key role in immune function. When potential infectious agents penetrate the intestinal lining, the immune system may respond by producing antibodies, triggering an inflammatory response that may in some cases contribute to the development of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.61 Hypothyroidism is a common cause of constipation, which may result from diminished motility of the intestines. In some cases, this can lead to intestinal obstruction or an enlarged colon.62 This decreased gastric motility is also associated with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which may occur in nearly half of people who have hypothyroidism.63 Hypothyroidism is also associated with decreased motility in the esophagus, which can cause difficulty swallowing, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and vomiting. Other gastrointestinal manifestations of thyroid disease include abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and bloating. Depression and Psychiatric Disorders Changes in thyroid hormone levels can alter brain function, and thyroid dysfunction was long ago linked to mental disorders. Panic disorders, depression, and changes in cognition are frequently associated with thyroid disorders.64-66 In fact, hypothyroidism is often misdiagnosed as depression.67 Also, thyroid hormone replacement has been shown to enhance responsiveness to antidepressant drugs.68 Cognitive Dysfunction Thyroid hormones play a key role in brain function and neuronal metabolism. Patients with low thyroid function can suffer from a range of impaired cognitive functions, such as slowed thinking, decreased attentiveness, language difficulties, confusion, difficulty recalling names, and even hallucinations.69 Cognitive deficits from hypothyroidism are often reversible with treatment.59,70,71 Cardiovascular Manifestations Proper thyroid function is necessary for optimal cardiovascular health because thyroid hormones influence heartbeat, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Hypothyroidism is associated with increased cholesterol levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.72 Abnormal thyroid hormone levels can affect the strength and speed of heart contractions and the physiology of the vascular system.73 High cholesterol and atherosclerosis. Thyroid hormones aid in metabolizing cholesterol and synthesizing fatty acids in the liver. Hypothyroidism is characterized by hypercholesterolemia and an increase in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and apolipoprotein B.74 In one retrospective study involving 568 individuals, elevated TSH levels were associated with increased total cholesterol levels, independently of thyroid hormone levels.75 These changes in lipid metabolism accelerate atherosclerosis, and hypothyroidism has been found to increase the risk of coronary artery disease in proportion to the degree of TSH elevation.76 In addition, autoimmune-induced hypothyroidism has been associated with increased stiffness of the blood vessel walls.77 Thyroid hormone replacement may slow the progression of coronary heart disease by inhibiting the progression of atherosclerotic plaques.78,79 Homocysteine dysregulation. High blood levels of homocysteine, an amino acid derived from methionine, is an independent risk factor for heart disease.80 In one study, fasting and post-meal homocysteine levels were higher in 40 people with hypothyroidism compared with a control group. TSH was the strongest predictor of homocysteine levels, and thyroid hormone replacement decreased fasting but not post-meal homocysteine levels.81 A meta-analysis of 17 studies found that plasma homocysteine levels were elevated in patients with hypothyroidism compared with healthy subjects, and homocysteine levels decreased with T4 replacement in patients with subclinical and overt hypothyroidism.82 Elevated C-reactive protein. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation that circulates in the blood throughout the body. Elevated CRP is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.83 Hypothyroidism is associated with elevated CRP, and CRP levels have been shown to increase with progressive thyroid failure.84 One study found higher CRP levels and more pronounced carotid artery stiffness in people with hypothyroidism compared with those whose thyroid function was normal. This study also found that baseline CRP levels and carotid artery stiffness were correlated, and thyroid hormone replacement was independently associated with lower baseline CRP.85 Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a group of metabolic conditions that are risk factors for heart disease and type 2 diabetes, including abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, abnormal blood glucose levels, and high blood pressure. Research suggests hypothyroidism is associated with metabolic syndrome, and people with metabolic syndrome are at greater risk of developing hypothyroidism.86-92 Hypothyroidism is associated with insulin resistance, and severity of insulin resistance seems to increase with severity of hypothyroidism.93 Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with both overt and subclinical thyroid dysfunction.94,95 In a cross-sectional population-based study of over 29,000 people without previous thyroid problems, those with higher TSH levels had lower glomerular filtration rate, which is a measure of kidney function. Individuals with TSH levels in the highest third of the reference range had a 31% increased risk of advanced kidney disease compared with those whose TSH levels were in the lowest third.96 Importantly, appropriate treatment of thyroid disease may mitigate CKD progression in some cases.97 Reproductive System Manifestations Thyroid hormones regulate many aspects of ovarian function and reproductive health.98 Thyroid problems are the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age.99 Low levels of thyroid hormones can interfere with ovulation, which may cause menstrual irregularities and infertility.100,101 Proper treatment can restore a normal menstrual cycle and improve fertility.102 Hypothyroidism is also linked to miscarriage, premature delivery, low birth weight, fetal distress during labor, and gestation-induced hypertension. In males, hypothyroidism is associated with erectile dysfunction and problems with sperm motility.103 7 Thyroid Hormone Replacement The goal of thyroid hormone replacement is to replicate normal thyroid function in people whose thyroid is not producing adequate levels of thyroid hormones. This can usually be accomplished with medications that contain thyroid hormones (ie, replacement therapy).104 Thyroid hormone replacement therapy aims to relieve symptoms and decrease elevated TSH to normal levels.105 Levothyroxine (T4) Thyroid replacement usually begins with synthetic T4 (levothyroxine) preparations, such as Synthroid or Levoxyl, which work like natural T4. Low doses are usually used at first as a rapid increase in thyroid hormone levels may result in cardiac damage.106 Sometimes hypothyroid symptoms persist despite T4 treatment. In one study, T4 therapy was no more effective than placebo in improving cognitive function and psychological well-being in patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism, despite improvement in free T3 levels.107 Another study compared T3 and T4 levels in hypothyroid patients treated with T4 alone against levels found in healthy people. In this study, T4 supplementation alone did not increase T3 to the same level as in healthy people.108 Combination T4 and T3 While T4 therapy is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism, combination therapy with synthetic T4 and T3 may be useful in some cases. Although the scientific evidence does not show a clear advantage of combination therapy versus T4 alone, some individuals may respond better to combination therapy.109-112 Importantly, excess T3 may cause adverse cardiac events in older individuals.113 One combination option is the drug Thyrolar (Liotrix), which combines synthetic T4 and T3 in a fixed 4:1 ratio. Another synthetic T3 option is liothyronine (Cytomel), which can be used in combination with a T4 drug. Desiccated Thyroid Extract Armour Thyroid, Nature-Throid, and Westhroid are prescription medications that contain desiccated porcine thyroid gland. Natural thyroid extracts have been used since 1892 and were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1939. Armour Thyroid and most other natural glandular preparations are made to standards approved by the United States Pharmacopoeia. Desiccated thyroid contains T4, T3, and another hormone known as calcitonin, which helps regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the blood. In a double-blind controlled study, 70 people with hypothyroidism were randomized to receive either desiccated thyroid extract or levothyroxine for 16 weeks. Each group then switched treatment arms for 16 weeks. Approximately half of the participants preferred the desiccated thyroid extract, while 19% preferred the levothyroxine. Desiccated thyroid extract use was also associated with greater weight loss. Both treatments normalized thyroid blood tests and there was no difference in symptom relief between treatment groups.114 Armour thyroid is preferred by some clinicians because it may achieve results in patients who fail to respond to levothyroxine alone. Some patients with hypothyroidism show greater improvements in mood and brain function if treated with Armour Thyroid rather than Synthroid.115 Note that some health conditions and the use of certain medications may interfere with desiccated thyroid extract. In particular, people with adrenal insufficiency, clotting disorders, diabetes, heart disease, and thyrotoxicosis should speak with a health care provider before beginning this medication.116 Ultimately, there may not be a single optimal way to normalize low thyroid hormone levels. The best treatment option may be to monitor thyroid levels through regular blood testing and adjust replacement therapy protocols to see what works best. Some people may prefer to begin with desiccated thyroid, while others may find it preferable to begin with T4 supplementation and then move to a combination T3-T4 therapy if they experience no improvements. It is important to work with a physician to determine which approach is best for you. Treating Subclinical Hypothyroidism Previously, the recommended treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism was T4 replacement therapy, with clinical management based on TSH levels, age, and presence of any other health conditions. However, elevated TSH levels may be more common in older people, which may lead to overtreatment in this population group. Recent research suggests untreated subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults without symptoms is not necessarily harmful in all cases, and there may be a lack of benefit from treatment in this age group.117 A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 737 adults over age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism found that levothyroxine treatment at a starting dose of 50 mcg, adjusted according to TSH levels, did not improve hypothyroid symptoms, tiredness, or quality of life measures.118 In another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 185 people over age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism, 96 were treated with levothyroxine (T4) therapy and the rest were given placebo for 18 months. There were no differences in carotid plaque thickness or atherosclerosis progression between the placebo and treatment groups.119 Guidelines issued in 2019 by a consortium of North American and European researchers and physicians made a strong recommendation against the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement in otherwise healthy adults. The guidelines, which were based on a review of the available evidence that included 21 clinical trials with data on over 21,000 participants, recommended against treatment unless the patient has overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH levels greater than 20 µlU/mL, is pregnant or trying to become pregnant, or presents other considerations strongly indicating treatment.120 In elderly patients (those over age 85) with TSH levels up to 10 µlU/mL, limited evidence supports no treatment.119 Treating aging people with thyroid hormone replacement when they are asymptomatic is not recommended, as it does not improve clinical symptoms such as depression, fatigue, body mass index, cardiovascular health, and quality of life. Subclinical hypothyroidism identified by blood testing should be monitored for progression and the presence of any symptoms, but not necessarily treated in most cases.120 In fact, mild subclinical hypothyroidism may have an anti-aging benefit, perhaps due to its influence on metabolic rate. A recent population-based cohort study involving over 7,000 participants examined the influence of thyroid function on cardiovascular disease and mortality. Researchers found that after age 50, those with low-normal thyroid function had a longer life expectancy (by 3.5 years) and longer expected survival free of cardiovascular disease (by 3.1 years) than those with high-normal thyroid function.121 However, this theory needs to be studied further. As of early 2020, the American Thyroid Association recommends a TSH target level of 4–6 µIU/mL in people older than 70 years.39 Absorption of Thyroid Hormone Medications Some foods and medications may interfere with the absorption or action of thyroid hormone medications. Too much dietary fiber can impair absorption of thyroid hormone medication.122 In addition, walnuts, calcium supplements, coffee,123 aluminum-containing antacids,124 ferrous sulfate (iron),125 calcium carbonate,126 soy,127 and possibly grapefruit juice128 may all decrease the absorption of thyroid hormone prescriptions. Medications to treat ulcers or lower cholesterol may also interact with absorption of thyroid medications.122 Therefore, doctor and pharmacist instructions for thyroid hormone medication use should be carefully followed. Many doctors simply advise patients to take thyroid hormone(s) alone, several hours before or after any food or medication. While many people take thyroid medication in the morning, some research suggests it is more effective to take it just before bed. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, 90 people with hypothyroidism took levothyroxine either before bedtime or 30 minutes before breakfast for a 3-month period. Subjects then switched times and took their medication on the other study schedule for three months. TSH was lower and thyroid hormone levels higher when the medication was taken at bedtime compared with morning intake.129 This study suggests taking levothyroxine at bedtime may enhance absorption, which may be useful in some patients. Taking thyroid medications at different times can also result in varying hormone levels, highlighting the need to take thyroid medication at the same time each day.130 8 Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Dietary Considerations Because the body needs iodine to make thyroid hormone, and iodine is relatively uncommon in the standard American diet, people who avoid iodized salt or adhere to a salt-restricted diet may become iodine deficient.131 Vegetarians are also at risk of developing iodine deficiency, especially if they eat food grown in low-iodine soil.132 Vegans who avoid sea vegetables are also at higher risk.133 On the other hand, excessive iodine intake may increase risk of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.134 Iodine or foods high in iodine, such as seaweed, are thought to be useful in treating hypothyroidism, but this is likely only true for people who are iodine deficient.133,134 The upper intake level of iodine for adults is 1,100 mcg per day. However, iodine ingestion at moderately higher levels is generally well tolerated in people without sensitivities or underlying thyroid issues.135 Anyone supplementing with high doses of iodine should periodically have a thyroid panel blood test to ensure their thyroid activity remains in a healthy range.136 Some foods contain goitrogenic substances that may reduce the utilization of iodine. These include cabbage,137 Brussels sprouts, and other cruciferous vegetables,138 as well as cassava,139 millet,140 and soybeans.141 The actual content of goitrogens in these foods is relatively low, however, and cooking significantly reduces their impact on thyroid function.142 It is unlikely that typical servings or supplements of cruciferous vegetables will have a measurable effect on thyroid function.143 For those with hypothyroidism, it may be advisable to consume raw, goitrogenic foods in moderation. Some doctors also recommend avoiding caffeine and gluten and limiting sugar, alcohol, and dairy to help control symptoms, although more studies are needed to validate these approaches.144 There has historically been some concern that soy and soy-containing foods may suppress thyroid function, but a 2019 meta-analysis of data from 18 studies concluded that soy consumption is not likely to impact thyroid function in most people. The analysis found that, while soy supplementation slightly increased TSH levels, free T4 and free T3 levels did not differ between soy-supplemented and control groups. However, there was some evidence that increases in TSH levels were slightly greater among people with subclinical hypothyroidism at baseline.145 The evidence available as of the time of this writing suggests moderate soy consumption through dietary intake or supplementation is unlikely to compromise thyroid function in people without thyroid dysfunction to begin with. People who have thyroid dysfunction should monitor their thyroid hormone levels periodically if they consume significant amounts of soy foods or supplements. Exercise Regular physical activity can improve muscle tone, maintain cardiovascular health, and support healthy energy levels. Exercise has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in people with hypothyroidism,146 and is important for preventing atherosclerosis and other complications of hypothyroidism.147 In one clinical trial, 10 women with subclinical hypothyroidism were assigned to engage in one hour of aerobic exercise three times per week for 16 weeks, and 10 similar women were assigned to remain sedentary. Those who exercised experienced improvements in exercise capacity, general health, and emotional health, as well as increases in mental and physical aspects of quality of life.148 Nevertheless, individuals suffering from hypothyroidism often experience reduced exercise capacity that does not necessarily resolve with thyroid hormone replacement therapy149 and have been found to exercise less than their healthy counterparts.150 Research suggests thyroid disease is associated with changes in cardiovascular physiology and the effects of exercise. One study with 108 participants reported that arterial stiffness and TSH levels decrease after exercise, but in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, the effect of exercise on arterial stiffness was reduced and the effect on TSH levels was greater.151 Studies have also reported a slower rise in heart rate during the transition from rest to physical activity in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism.152 Because people with hypothyroidism may adapt to cardiorespiratory conditioning less efficiently than those with normal thyroid function, they should remain aware of their exercise tolerance and modulate accordingly.153 Stop Smoking Cigarette smoking is believed to impact thyroid function and may play a role in the development of autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves’ disease), but evidence of a link between smoking and hypothyroidism is inconsistent, with some evidence suggesting a possible protective effect of smoking on Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.154 Nevertheless, because smoking is clearly associated with the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of hypothyroidism, as well as myriad other health problems, it is best for those with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism to avoid smoking. Manage Stress Stress may exacerbate thyroid dysfunction, and relaxation techniques may be a useful means of helping control symptoms of mild thyroid conditions. Stress appears to alter the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis.155 Stress and the immune system may interact in such a way that stress exacerbates the onset and/or progression of immune-mediated thyroid diseases.156 In a controlled clinical trial, an eight-week stress management program reduced anti-thyroid antibody levels compared to usual care in women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In addition, women in the stress management program reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.157 Although a link between severe stress and the onset of autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves’ disease) is better documented, at least one case of Hashimoto’s thyrotoxicosis followed by temporary hypothyroidism after a period of stress has been reported.158 More information is available in Life Extension’s Stress Management protocol. 9 Supplements to Support Thyroid Health Iodine The body needs the trace element iodine to make thyroid hormone and for optimal immune function. While present naturally in seaweed, dairy products, grain products, and eggs, more than 70 countries have programs in which iodine is added to salt to increase consumption and reduce the risk of iodine deficiency.159 Iodized salt has been sold in the United States since 1924, and it has proven effective at reducing iodine deficiency in areas where it was previously common, including the Great Lakes, Appalachian, and Northwestern areas. However, approximately 30% of the global population is still at risk of iodine deficiency.160 Iodine deficiency in pregnant women is associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and congenital deformities in the infant.160 During pregnancy, T4 production nearly doubles, causing increases in daily iodine requirements.161 Iodine-deficient pregnant women cannot sufficiently produce the thyroid hormones needed for proper neurological development of their growing babies. Infants born to women with iodine deficiency may have growth, hearing, or speech problems, or they may suffer from intellectual difficulties. In severe cases, underactive thyroid can cause hypothyroidism in the unborn child, or cretinism, which is characterized by brain damage, mental abnormalities, and growth problems. Worldwide, congenital hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency during pregnancy is the most common preventable cause of mental disabilities.160 Severe iodine deficiency is associated with goiter and hypothyroidism, as thyroid hormones cannot be adequately produced due to low levels of iodine. In cases of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency, increased activity of the thyroid gland may maintain thyroid function for a time, but long-term thyroid stimulation may increase the risk of goiter and hyperthyroidism.13 It is important to test thyroid function when supplementing with iodine, as both low and excessively high intake can contribute to thyroid dysfunction.135 Selenium Selenium, an essential micronutrient found in Brazil nuts, cereals, mushrooms, and some fish (eg, tuna, halibut, and sardines), is a potent antioxidant that helps regulate thyroid hormone production and immune function.162 The thyroid contains more selenium by weight than any other organ,163 and selenium is a necessary component of the enzymes that convert T4 into T3. Some evidence suggests selenium supplementation may help support efficient conversion of T4 into T3.164 Selenium also plays a role in protecting the thyroid gland from oxidative stress. The cells of the thyroid generate hydrogen peroxide during the process of making thyroid hormone. Selenium protects the thyroid gland from the oxidative damage caused by these reactions. Without adequate selenium, high iodine levels can destroy thyroid gland cells.165,166 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 230 pregnant women received 60 mcg per day of selenium from 12 weeks gestation until time of delivery. The women given selenium who were also positive for thyroglobulin antibodies at the beginning of the study exhibited small declines in TSH levels. Selenium supplementation was also associated with greater declines in free T4 levels than placebo at 35 weeks.162 A cross-sectional observational study of over 6,100 subjects from two Chinese counties (one with low and the other with adequate levels of selenium in the soil) found that the prevalence of thyroid disorders was lower in the adequate-selenium county, and low selenium status was associated with thyroid disease.167 A recent literature review regarding selenium’s role in promoting thyroid health found that selenium supplementation in those with autoimmune thyroiditis reduced antibody levels, improved presentation of the thyroid on ultrasound, and improved patient quality of life.168 In a placebo-controlled study, German researchers gave 200 mcg of sodium selenite daily to patients with Hashimoto's disease and high levels of thyroid peroxidase antibodies. After three months, the thyroid peroxidase antibody levels of the patients taking selenium decreased by 36% from their pre-treatment values. Quality of life and antibody levels improved more in selenium-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients.169 However, Austrian researchers were unable to duplicate the results of the earlier study when they did not limit the study population to those with high levels of thyroid peroxidase antibodies. They suggested that selenium supplementation might be of greater benefit to patients with higher disease activity.170 Vitamin A Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin necessary for several human cellular processes. Vitamin A refers to a family of structurally related retinoic acids, including retinol, retinal, retinyl esters (including retinyl palmitate), and beta-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A).171 Vitamin A, found in liver, fish oil, green leafy vegetables, milk, and eggs, plays a central role in immune function, vision, and reproduction.172 Vitamin A is important for healthy thyroid function, and vitamin A deficiency is associated with thyroid dysfunction.173,174 Vitamin A deficiency may change the structure of the thyroid gland and disrupt the delicate and critical signaling network of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis.175,176 Conversely, inadequate thyroid function can impair the conversion of beta-carotene into the biologically active vitamin A.177 In 84 healthy premenopausal women in Iran, supplementation with 25,000 IU of retinyl palmitate daily reduced TSH blood levels. The authors suggested vitamin A supplementation may reduce the risk of subclinical hypothyroidism in this population.178 It should be noted, however, that long-term supplementation with high doses of pre-formed vitamin A is not generally recommended. The vitamin A precursor, beta-carotene, is better suited for daily supplementation. L-Tyrosine This non-essential amino acid plays an important role in thyroid hormone synthesis. Thyroxine (T4) is produced in the thyroid via iodination of tyrosine. Thus, theoretically, tyrosine insufficiency could undermine adequate thyroid hormone production. However, tyrosine deficiency is rare because it is found in the diet and because the body can make tyrosine from another common amino acid, phenylalanine. Although mechanistic data support the notion that tyrosine supplementation may support thyroid function, no well-designed clinical trials have shown supplementation with L-tyrosine to be an effective treatment for hypothyroidism.1,179 Nevertheless, the nutrient is generally well-tolerated and readily available in many thyroid health formulas. Ashwagandha Extract Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), also called winter cherry or Indian ginseng, is one of the most important herbs in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.180 Extracts of ashwagandha have been used for centuries in the Ayurvedic system as an adaptogen to alleviate physical and mental stress.181 Extracts of ashwagandha have been prepared from the leaves, berries, and roots of the plant. Among the important chemical compounds found in ashwagandha are oligosaccharides and withanolide glycosides.182-184 Research indicates ashwagandha extract may promote optimal thyroid health. In one randomized controlled trial, 50 subjects with high TSH levels received either 600 mg ashwagandha or placebo for eight weeks. Those in the treatment group experienced normalized serum thyroid indices, including T3, T4, and TSH levels.185 Researchers studying the effects of ashwagandha extract on bipolar disorder also collected data on thyroid function. In this study, three individuals were treated for eight weeks with 500 mg per day of a standardized ashwagandha extract. All three ashwagandha-treated patients experienced decreases in TSH and increases in T4 levels of 7%, 12%, and 24% compared with baseline, indicating improved thyroid function. The researchers concluded that, although further study is necessary, ashwagandha may be useful in treating subclinical hypothyroidism.181 Korean Ginseng Extract Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng, family Araliaceae) is a native perennial plant of Asia and North America that is an integral part of traditional Asian medicine. It has been in use for thousands of years and may have implications for diabetes, pulmonary disease, fatigue, and immune function.186-189 Korean ginseng contains a wide range of bioactive components, including at least 112 saponins, most of which are glycosides of triterpenoid aglycones. The class of saponins called ginsenosides are believed to be important bioactive compounds in Korean ginseng.190 Research suggests Korean ginseng can reduce concentrations of rT3. In a placebo-controlled trial in 54 adults with congestive heart failure and abnormally low levels of T3 and T4, administration of intravenous ginseng extract resulted in increased T3 and T4 levels as well as reduced rT3 levels two weeks after infusion.191 Korean ginseng has also been shown to improve symptoms of cold hands and feet, which are sometimes associated with suboptimal thyroid function. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 80 women with cold hypersensitivity of the hands and feet were given 500 mg Korean ginseng daily for eight weeks. At the end of the trial, subjects had substantially higher skin temperature in both their hands and feet.192 Hypothyroidism affects fertility, sexual health, and menstrual cycle regularity. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 32 menopausal women, 3 grams of Korean red ginseng per day improved sexual function and sexual arousal (a common complaint in those with thyroid dysfunction) compared with placebo.193 In hypothyroid rats, Panax ginseng improved reproductive hormone levels, including luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol, prolactin, and progesterone. The mechanism of action was proposed to be scavenging free radicals.194 Findings from another study involving hypothyroid rats suggested ginseng extract may improve cellular metabolism and energy production.195 An enzymatically fermented ginseng extract has been developed that provides a highly bioavailable ginsenoside metabolite. Compared with non-fermented ginseng, the fermented preparation resulted in 15.5 times greater absorption over 24 hours and a 27-fold higher peak concentration in blood, which was reached in roughly a quarter of the time (3.3 hours vs. 12.0 hours).196 Several studies have demonstrated that ginsenoside metabolites may have higher biological activity than unmetabolized ginsenosides, which are believed to be less bioavailable. Orally consumed unmetabolized ginsenosides are inefficiently metabolized by stomach acid and liver enzymes, but fermented ginseng may provide greater bioavailability of key ginseng compounds.196-198 Guggul Extract Guggul, the gum resin of the mukul myrrh tree (Commiphora mukul or Commiphora wightii), has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat tumors, obesity, lipid disorders, low metabolism, and other conditions.199 Evidence suggests guggul is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that also supports cardiovascular health.200 Guggulsterones are thought to be the most important bioactive compounds in guggul extract.199,201,202 Some preclinical data suggest guggul enhances thyroid function by supporting the conversion of T4 to T3.203 A laboratory study showed an extract of Commiphora mukul significantly increased iodine uptake, T3 resin uptake, protein-bound iodine, and free T4 levels in thyroid tissue.204 Rats given guggulsterone derived from Commiphora mukul exhibited an increase in thyroid gland activity, as evidenced by increased iodine uptake and enhanced thyroid enzyme function.205 An extract of Commiphora mukul reversed experimentally-induced hypothyroidism in mice.203 This effect appears to have been mediated through enhanced production of T3 and a reduction in hepatic oxidative stress.203,206 Zinc Zinc, an essential mineral that plays a role in immune functioning, cellular metabolism, and wound healing, is found in red meat, poultry, beans, and nuts.207 Zinc, copper, and selenium are necessary for production of thyroid hormones, and deficiencies of these minerals may result in hypothyroidism. On the other hand, thyroid hormones are required for zinc absorption, and hypothyroidism may result in zinc deficiency.208 Zinc plays complex roles in regulating various aspects of thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, including the conversion of T4 to T3.209 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 68 women with hypothyroidism received either 30 mg zinc and 200 mcg selenium, zinc and placebo, selenium and placebo, or placebo alone for 12 weeks. Free T3 increased in both groups taking zinc, which suggests zinc alone or with selenium may promote proper thyroid function.210 In a group of patients with low levels of free T3 and normal T4, but elevated rT3 and mild-to-moderate zinc deficiency, oral zinc supplementation for 12 months normalized serum free T3 and total T3 levels, decreased rT3 levels, and normalized TSH levels.211 Note: Chronic, very high doses of zinc interfere with copper absorption and can lead to serious and potentially fatal copper deficiency.212-214 Thus it is advised to take copper when supplementing with high-dose zinc. Iron Iron, an essential mineral commonly found in foods such as lean meats, seafood, nuts, and beans, is a necessary component of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, and plays a role in growth, metabolism, and development.215 Iron deficiency hinders manufacture of thyroid hormone by reducing the activity of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase. In one study, 29.8% of women with subclinical hypothyroidism were iron deficient compared with 9.8% of the control group.216 In a cross-sectional study of over 220 Nepalese children, anemic and iron-deficient children were more likely to have thyroid issues, including hypothyroidism.217 In another study of over 3,000 women of childbearing age in China, there was a clear association between iron deficiency and low serum T4 levels in both pregnant and non-pregnant women.218 Iron-deficiency anemia decreases, and iron supplementation improves, the beneficial effects of iodine supplementation.166 Treating 51 iron-deficient hypothyroid patients with levothyroxine along with iron improved their iron-deficiency anemia more than treatment with iron alone.219 Vitamin E Vitamin E, a fat-soluble compound with natural antioxidant properties, plays a role in immune function, gene expression, and cellular metabolism.220 Vitamin E may reduce oxidative stress caused by hypothyroidism. Much of the research involves work with animal models. In one study, vitamin E protected animals from increased oxidation and thyroid cell damage.221 In another study, vitamin E reduced the amount of thyroid cell replication in animals with induced hypothyroidism.222 In yet another controlled animal trial, levothyroxine replacement therapy paired with vitamin E supplementation helped restore the cognitive decline seen in hypothyroidism via a decrease in oxidative stress.223 Vitamin D Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps support bone growth and remodeling, enhance calcium absorption, promote immunity, and reduce inflammation. It is found in fatty fish and fish liver oil, and is produced naturally with exposure to sunlight.224 Vitamin D deficiency is associated with autoimmune thyroid disease, including Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In addition, impaired vitamin D signaling pathways have been indicated in thyroid cancer.225 A correlational study found serum vitamin D and calcium levels were significantly lower in 30 hypothyroid patients than in 30 healthy controls.226 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with over 200 hypothyroid participants, TSH levels decreased in those taking 50,000 IU/week vitamin D for 12 weeks.227 When adjusted for age, the presence of thyroid antibodies associated with Hashimoto’s disease was inversely correlated with vitamin D levels in a group of 642 participants (244 males and 398 females) in a study in New Delhi, India.228 Moreover, other evidence suggests vitamin D deficiency is more common among individuals with thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules compared with the general population.229 More long-term, randomized, controlled trials are necessary to determine the therapeutic role vitamin D may play in thyroid disease. Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 aids in red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis, and neurological functions. B12 can be found in a variety of dietary sources, including fish, meat, eggs, and milk.230 Hypothyroid patients are often vitamin B12 deficient. In one study, 190 patients with thyroid antibodies were more likely to have hemoglobin, iron, and vitamin B12 deficiencies and had higher homocysteine levels compared with 190 controls.231 In another study that included 116 hypothyroid patients in Pakistan, approximately 40% of participants were found to have B12 deficiency.232 A study involving multiple sclerosis patients in Saudi Arabia noted that low B12 levels were correlated with low T3 and T4 levels.233 Although this evidence suggests there may be a link between B12 deficiency and low thyroid function, it is not yet known whether B12 supplementation can improve thyroid function.234 Turmeric (Curcuma longa) Extract Turmeric, a plant related to ginger and native to Southeast Asia and India, is a revered plant traditionally used for a variety of health concerns.235 Recent research indicates turmeric may play a role in maintaining thyroid health. Turmeric contains curcumin and related compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions and may help regulate thyroid and other hormone production and activity.236 In one retrospective study of over 2,000 people in Pakistan, people with diets high in turmeric had fewer goiters.237 In animal research, treatment with turmeric extract reduced the impact of chemically induced hypothyroidism on thyroid weight, T4, T3, and cholesterol levels.238 Results of a similar trial on rats treated with vitamin E and curcumin showed that treatment prevented a decline in basal body temperature and protected the liver.239 Disclaimer and Safety Information This information (and any accompanying material) is not intended to replace the attention or advice of a physician or other qualified health care professional.
