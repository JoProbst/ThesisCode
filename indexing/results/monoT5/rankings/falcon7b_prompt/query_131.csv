8bc4578d-a187-4d19-abad-3bc399d0c1d2,"These 12 Exercises Will Help You Reap the Health Benefits of Good Posture Medically reviewed by — — From our pain levels to our self-confidence, our posture impacts more than we think. Putting in the effort to improve your posture has huge payoffs. “Good posture is also known as neutral spine. When we have good posture, the muscles surrounding the spine are balanced and supporting the body equally,” explains , physical therapist and certified strengthening and conditioning specialist at the University of Michigan. When sitting, your feet should rest flat on the floor, with even weight on both hips. Your back should be mostly straight (you’ll have natural curves in your lumbar, thoracic, and cervical areas). Your shoulders should be back but relaxed and your ears should line up over your collarbones. When standing, your legs should have a slight knee bend so you’re not hyperextending or locking your knee joints, says , exercise physiologist at Colorado Canyons Hospital & Medical Center. Now that we know what good posture is, here are 12 key benefits along with tips to achieve them. Sitting or standing in a slouched position for prolonged periods of time stresses your lower back. More specifically, it puts pressure on the posterior structures of the spine, including the intervertebral discs, facet points, ligaments, and muscles, explains Strang. Bridges strengthen and engage your gluteal and abdominal muscles, so your body relies on them instead of stressing your lower back. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, instructs Strang. Tighten your core without changing your back position. “Lift your hips and lower torso off of the ground by contracting your gluteus maximus muscles.” Slowly lower your hips back down. Move around frequently—. “No one is able to sit with perfect posture all of the time; it takes a lot of strength to do so. When you feel your muscles tiring, or yourself slowly slouching, get up and move around,” encourages Strang. Don’t anticipate a decrease in lower back pain on your first day. “Posture is something that you should expect to work at your whole life,” says Strang. By stretching your chest, and strengthening your core and upper back muscles, you’ll see gradual but noticeable pain reduction. “Poor posture can contribute to , due to increased muscle tension in the back of the neck. Often if we correct our posture, we can reduce muscle tension and improve our headaches,” says Strang. Stretch your neck muscles with a head retraction exercise This exercise strengthens the neck muscles that are often weak and stretched out. Lie on the floor on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Pull your chin back toward the floor like you’re trying to make a double chin. Hold for 10 to 15 seconds and repeat 10 times. Check in with your body often. “Awareness is essential to good posture. We get busy working at our computers or eating a good meal, and we compress into poor posture,” says Griffith. Post a note on your computer screen to remind you to get yourself in proper alignment. Headache prevention will differ from person to person. If you’re not experiencing the progress you want, incorporate more and into your routine. When your bones and joints are in correct alignment, it allows the muscles to be used as they’re intended, so you’ll have , explains Griffith. In other words, “the muscles don’t have to work so hard to do what they’re supposed to do.” Strengthen your obliques so the right muscles are activated when you’re sitting or standing. Start by sitting on the floor with your knees bent. Lift your feet off of the floor about 6 inches. Tighten your core as you rotate your upper body and elbows from side to side. To keep your energy levels high, remember it’s okay to relax from time to time. “Give your postural muscles a break once in a while. They can get overworked and cause pain as well,” explains Strang. Noticing a spike in your energy levels is variable. It depends on how poor your posture is, how strong you are, and how aware you remain of your posture. “You should notice improvement within a week, but if you want to make it habit, it may take a month for good posture to become natural,” says Griffith. A forward head posture puts strain on the upper back, shoulder, and neck areas. With proper alignment, the joints and ligaments are less stressed and less subject to chronic overuse, explains Griffith. Stretch out your neck to relieve pressure and correct tension. Stand with a straight spine and neck. Slightly tuck your chin backward. You should feel a slight tensioning of your clavicle muscles and a lengthening of the posterior part of your neck. Hold for 3 seconds and complete 15 repetitions. Set reminders on your calendar to check in with yourself several times throughout the day. Ensure your ears are above your shoulders and that you’re using your front neck muscles — not just your posterior muscles — to hold your head up. You’ll likely notice reduced tension in your shoulders and neck within the first week or two. Applying heat or ice may provide additional relief. 5. Decreased risk of abnormal wearing of the joint surfaces Crooked sitting and standing, such as resting on one leg or side of your body, leads to hip strain. “Your joints wear down naturally over time. If your posture is even, not many problems arise. But if you’re uneven, more pain and issues tend to occur,” states Griffith. Strengthen your core and lower back with this hip flexor stretch This exercise strengthens your core and lower back at the same time while . Start in a lunge position with one knee on the floor and your leg extended backward. The other leg should be at a 90-degree angle in front of you with your foot planted on the floor. Engage your core by pulling in slightly. When sitting, “utilize a lumbar roll or rolled towel to support your natural lumbar curve,” suggests Strang. That way, you’ll have support for a straighter posture, allowing it to be more sustainable. The longer you work at strengthening your core and straightening your posture, the more natural and less challenging it will be. If you’re slouching, you’re compressing your lungs,” explains Griffith. “If you’re sitting and standing taller, your lungs have more space to expand.” In other words, . Stand with your feet hip-width distance apart. Interlock your hands behind your back. Hold for 20 seconds to stretch your chest and pectoral muscles. As an alternative, place your forearms along a door frame at shoulder height. “With one foot in front of the other, begin to shift your weight forward until you feel a stretch in your chest. Hold for 30 to 60 seconds,” recommends Strang. “In a sitting position, rock your pelvis back and forth to determine how much available motion you have in your spine. Your ideal spinal posture will be in the middle of those ranges,” says Strang. Another easy trick is to make sure most of the pressure is on your “sit bones” not your tailbone or the back of your thighs. “If we’re sitting slouched, it’s difficult for our diaphragm to fully contract and our lungs to fully expand,” Strang describes. For faster improvement, lengthen your seated position and open your lungs with three deep breaths several times a day. Griffith explains: “If you’re compressing vital organs, your circulation is poor, and those organs aren’t going to work as well.” Healthy blood flow requires proper alignment and avoiding positions which cramp circulation, like crossing your legs. Lie on your back on the ground and place a firm foam roller in a horizontal position underneath you at the bottom of your rib cage. Support your neck with your arms. Slowly extend your spine over the roller. Hold for 5 seconds and take a deep breath. Slowly move up 1 to 2 inches at a time. “When sitting, scoot your hips all the way back into the chair. Your feet must be on the ground to improve support. You may use a lumbar roll along your low back to assist with maintaining this posture. Shoulders should be back and your neck muscles relaxed,” offers Strang. When we have a forward head position, our mandibular joint and jaw muscles experience stress and tension. “This can contribute to pain with eating, talking, yawning, as well as clicking with opening, and headaches,” says Strang. With your head and neck in a neutral position and your eyes looking forward, turn your head slowly from one side to the other to stretch your neck muscles. Adjust the ergonomics at work and home to support a better posture. Find a more supportive chair, use a sit-to-stand desk, and purchase a lumbar roll that you can take wherever you go, suggests Strang. Releasing the tension in your neck and upper shoulders should reduce the effects of TMJ pain. Focus on relaxing your jaw throughout the day, especially in high-stress situations like driving during rush hour or focusing on a difficult work project. As Strang describes, muscular effort is required to maintain good posture. If you’re holding a good posture, your core and upper back muscles will remain active and engaged. Engage your back muscles with the overhead arm raise Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the ground with even weight on both hips. Engage your core by slightly tucking in and flattening your lower back. Let your arms fall to your sides comfortably. Raise them both up at the same time over your head and bring them back to the starting position. “In a standing posture, keep your shoulders back and aligned. Engage your abdominals and keep a tiny knee bend so you’re not hyperextending or locking your knee joints,” explains Griffith. Over time, your core strength will improve — helping to support the rest of your body. Your core will continue to strengthen every day if you engage it while you sit and stand properly. Our posture doesn’t just affect us when we’re sitting and standing, but when we’re exercising, too. For example, having an engaged core and neutral spine during a squat will help prevent injury. Stand upright with your feet firmly planted on the ground. Bring your hands to meet in the middle of your chest with palms and fingers touching. Pull your shoulder blades back with your ears resting above your shoulders. Lift one leg up to your thigh or shin (not your knee), and press the sole of your foot into your leg for stability. Both legs should be engaged, and your core should be tucked slightly as you maintain a neutral spine. “Most of the environments we live and work in encourage us to do things in front of us, leading to more of a forward posture,” explains Strang. By focusing our attention on proper alignment, we improve our workout results and prevent injury. Focus on your core strength and pay attention to your balance. Over time, you’ll notice this position come with more easily and become a center for calm. While it’s icing on the cake, good posture can make us more attractive. “People look taller and slimmer when they have good posture,” admits Griffith. Sometimes it can even make our abdominals appear more defined. Lie on the floor with your frontside down. Keep your forearms parallel and your feet hip-width apart. “Tighten your core and lift your torso off of the ground. Make sure you’re looking down between your elbows, your shoulder blades are pulled back, and your core muscles are tight. Don’t stick your hips in the air,” says Strang. Hold your plank for up to 30 seconds, but stop sooner if your form starts to decline. Complete 3 sets. Stand in front of a mirror with your normal posture. Look at yourself from all angles. Then, straighten your posture and notice the difference in how you look. Your appearance is one of the first aspects that will change when you practice good posture. It can be almost immediate. To make good posture a habit, continue to build the amount of time you stay in an aligned position throughout the day. Not only can good posture boost your energy levels and reduce your pain, it can also increase your self-esteem. One 2009 study says good posture gives you . Sit or stand with a neutral spine. Shift your shoulder blades to the back. Lift both forearms to a 90-degree angle at your sides. Pull your shoulder blades closer together, as if you’re squeezing them, while your arms naturally extend backward. Complete three sets of 12 reps. Before a meeting, presentation, or job interview, make sure your shoulders are relaxed, your spine is in alignment, and your ears are resting over your shoulders. Feeling more confident in yourself can start from day one. Simply pay attention to your posture as you enter a room, sit down to a meal, or work on a project at your computer. Up for a challenge?

Used to drive me nuts. She did have a point, though. Beside looking terrible, poor posture can cause neck, back, and leg pain. Slouching is an easy habit to get into, especially if you spend a lot of time sitting--your rear end almost always ends up sliding forward in the chair, putting undue pressure on your lower back. When you slouch while standing, your head moves forward, in front of your body. You can’t see your profile, but next time you’re in front of a mirror, take a peek. For every inch the head is forward of your body, its weight falls on your neck and upper back muscles. Your head weighs roughly 10-11 pounds--that’s a lot of pressure. If your head is three inches in front of your shoulders, there are 30 pounds of pressure on your neck and upper back. No wonder your back hurts. Posture affects how you walk, sleep, sit, and stand. Improper alignment creates continuous tension and can lead to muscle and head aches. Proper posture prevents fatigue and wear-and-tear on ligaments and joints. It is important for good blood circulation and full breathing. You should know what good posture looks like so you have something with which to compare what you see in the mirror: If you’re a sloucher, here are some exercises that will transform your bad posture habit into a better-looking, more healthful one--and keep your mother off your back. If you normally hold your head forward from your shoulders, this exercise will strengthen your neck muscles so you’ll find it easier to hold that 10-pound rock on the top of your body in its proper position. It can be done sitting or standing--a good little exercise break from pounding away at the computer. Looking straight ahead, place two fingers on your chin, slightly tuck it and push your head back; tucking your chin as far under as is comfortable to get a stretch. Neck Pain - Chin Tuck Exercises and Improve Posture for Relief This is good exercise to do in your car, using the headrest as opposing stationary force (only while car is stopped, of course). Press the back of your head into the headrest for 3-5 seconds. This one feels sooo good. It will open and loosen tight chest muscles. Stand in a doorway and place your leg closer to the doorjamb slightly bent and in front of you, the opposite leg behind with the ball of the foot on the floor. Lift your arm so that your elbow is parallel to the floor with your lower arm resting on the doorjamb, hand up. Slowly lean into your raised arm and push against the doorjamb for 7-10 seconds. Relax and lean again, pushing your chest forward through the doorway into a slight lunge. Hold for 7-10 seconds. Repeat 2-3 times on each side, alternating between sets. Kneel on your right knee with the top of your foot on the floor. Place your left foot flat on the floor in front of you. Place both hands on your left thigh and press your hips forward until you feel a stretch in your hip muscles. Contract your abdominal muscles and tilt your pelvis slightly back, keeping your chin parallel to the floor. Hold 20-30 seconds, then switch your legs and repeat for the other side. The resistance band provides just the right amount of stress for you to stretch your neck and shoulders, strengthening as you do. While standing, place one foot forward so your knees are slightly bent. Place the resistance band under the ball of each foot and grab one end of the band with each hand. Lift your arms up and out from your body with elbows slightly bent, slowing raising them until they are at shoulder level. Keep shoulder blades down and back (and head) straight. Hold 2-4 seconds and return to the starting position. Perform this exercise 5 days a week for noticeable relief of shoulder and neck pain and improved posture. Stand with your back against a wall with your feet about four inches from it. Keep knees slightly bent. Your buttocks, spine, and head should all be touching the wall. Bring your arms up with the elbows bent at right angles and squeeze your shoulder blades together, forming the letter “W” with your head in the middle. Straighten your elbows and raise your arms to form the letter “Y”. Keep your shoulders down. Repeat 10 times moving from “W” for 3 seconds, then to “Y”. Using a resistance band gives your muscles something to work against. This exercise strengthens the (major and minor) in your upper back between the shoulder blades. Sit on the floor with legs extended forward and straight. Place the middle of the resistance band around the bottom of your feet and cross one side over the other to make an “X” over your legs. Grab the ends of the band with arms extended in front of you. Pull the ends of the band toward your hips and bend your elbows so they point back and slightly upward. Hold 2-4 seconds and slowly return to starting position. » » 6 Easy Exercises to Help “Fix” Bad Posture That You Absolutely Have To Learn Sign up for our FREE daily newsletter.Get daily health tips and exclusive offers delivered straight to your inbox.

Straighten up with this perfect posture workout routine Good posture, like TiVo instructions, usually gets banished to your brain's bottom drawer. But it's something worth thinking about: Not only does it make you look taller and slimmer, but it also aids digestion and helps you . ""When you slouch you get less oxygen to your muscles and impair blood flow to your gut, causing indigestion. You also get headaches from cramped neck muscles and look lousy,"" says Drew DeMann, Ph.D., of Manhattan Spine and Sports Therapy. Incorporate these posture-enhancing exercises into your fitness routine — and straighten yourself out. It strengthens your upper back and shoulders to keep them from rounding forward. ""This can improve your breathing and increase energy,"" Dr. DeMann says. Sit on a stability ball with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your neck in line with your back. Grip a 5-pound dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other and your elbows bent at 90-degree angles. Row the weights to your sides, squeezing your shoulder blades together. It will help elongate your spine. ""Your head weighs the same as a small TV set,"" says Richard Brennan, author of five books on the Alexander Technique, which is a gentle, dance-inspired method known for enhancing posture. By relieving your spine of that compression, he says, you can stand half of an inch taller. Lie on a mat with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Support your head with a small pillow and, with your eyes open, let your body sink into the mat as you focus on lengthening your spine. Think of your pelvis releasing away from your head. Allow yourself to breathe deeply and continue for 20 minutes. ""You won't notice much at first, but after a few weeks, you'll have better posture,"" Brennan says. But don't confuse this exercise with sleep. ""It's different because you're lying still, consciously releasing your spine. And bending your knees especially relieves spinal pressure,"" says Mischul Brownstone, a bodywork specialist in Charlotte, Vermont. This move stretches your back, strengthens your abs and legs, and aids circulation and digestion. ""Good posture comes from a strong core, and Pilates strengthens the powerhouse,"" says Brooke Siler, author of . Balance on your tailbone with knees bent shoulder-width apart and toes resting lightly on the mat. Reach forward with both arms and lift your spine up, imagining you're on a balance beam. Next, stretch your legs out and twist your upper body to follow the reach of one arm behind you. Keep your arms straight and think of chopping a tree behind you. Inhale as you reverse the twist, pulling your knees back toward your chest and lightly touching the mat with your toes. Repeat on the other side. It stretches your spine, arms, shoulders, glutes, and hamstrings and helps straighten your spine and neck. ""Slightly tilting your head back and folding your neck is common, but it's like crimping a garden hose — we can only guess what that's doing to your brain,"" says Jean Couch, owner of the Balance Center in Palo Alto, California. Couch also uses this move to correct the American habit of pushing the pelvis forward. (African women, according to a study in the science journal Nature, can carry 20 percent of their body weight on their heads — without expending a single extra calorie — because of their proper pelvis alignment.) Begin on all fours, with your knees and feet about a foot apart. Tip your butt bones up and move your torso back so that your hipbones rest on your thighs. Then walk your hands out, keeping your palms flat, until your forehead rests on the floor. Let your spine lengthen and your pelvis continue to rise up behind you.

efab2f1a-7b96-4f60-9317-c912ed059bdb,"The Every Woman’s Guide to Perfect Posture in 30 Days — — Thanks to gravity, our feet are well grounded. But the efforts of not completely face planting? We owe to our postural muscles. At our muscle’s peak, they prevent our bones and ligaments from being stressed, strained, and jutting out of alignment. More magic our postural muscles are responsible for? Keeping our heads upright and minds well. But between and , the relationship we have with postural muscles may have flickered out over time, leaving our bodies at risk for spinal wear and tear and chronic pain. Getting that perfect spine back isn’t going to be a quick fix. You’ll need consistency, awareness, and dedication — virtues you can develop with this “Every Woman’s Guide to Better Posture in 30 Days.” Over the next 30 days, these movements and exercises will help you: Save or print out the calendar below to remind yourself what to do. It will cover which exercises to do (these will take up 8 to 20 minutes of your day) and routine reminders that’ll activate your muscle memory to keep your posture in check, long after you master the guide. Read on for detailed instructions and a how-to guide on performing each exercise. This week is about learning new poses and exercises and using them to develop what is called an “Awareness Routine.” Learn poses that will help you lengthen your spine and release any tension you may have built up over the last few years. Stand against a wall to check your posture. You should have less than 2 inches between the wall and your neck and back. Keep this position in mind as you go throughout the rest of your day, checking in at every hour. According to Dr. Austin Davis of , when it comes to posture, awareness is what’s most important. Stand with the back of your head against the wall and place your heels 6 inches from the wall. Your shoulder blades and butt should be touching the wall. Measure the space between your neck and the wall, and the space between your lower back and the wall. There should be less than 2 inches between both spaces. A larger gap indicates impaired posture. Do 5 minutes of Child’s Pose, morning and night. Child’s Pose helps lengthen and stretch the spine, which is used to slouching after years of bad posture. Start on your hands and knees, with your knees as far as shoulders-width apart and big toes touching each other. Crawl forward on your hands and extend your arms straight out toward the front of the mat. You can also drape your arms on the floor alongside your body. Slowly start to drop your hips back to rest on your heels. Start with 2 minutes of Child’s Pose and then practice 30-second intervals of Standing Forward Fold for 4 minutes. This pose deeply stretches the hamstrings, stretches the hips, and can help release any tension in the neck and shoulders. Start with your feet hips-distance apart and bend at the knees to support your body. Exhale as you bend forward at the hips, lengthening the front of your torso. Bend your elbows and hold on to each elbow with the opposite hand. Let the crown of your head hang down. Press your heels into the floor as you lift your sit bones toward the ceiling. Pull your shoulders away from your ears and drop your head and neck. Lengthen your legs until you feel a stretch in the hamstring muscles. Work on engaging your quadriceps to help your hamstring muscles release. Release deeper into the pose with each exhalation. Let your head hang as you feel the tension roll out of your shoulders and neck. Follow this stretch sequence in the morning and at night: Hold the active Child’s Pose for 1 minute and the Standing Forward Fold for 2 minutes. Then, do Cat-Cow for 5 minutes. This movement sequence will help increase spinal awareness, which is a large part of less-than-perfect posture. Start on all fours. Your wrists should be stacked under the elbows which are stacked under the shoulders. Keep your fingers spread against the ground for increased stability and keep your neck neutral. Begin the cat phase: As you exhale, tuck your tailbone under using your abdominal muscles to push your spine toward the ceiling, making the shape of a Halloween cat. Lengthen your neck and allow your head to reach toward your chest so that your ears come down by the biceps. On the out breathe, “swoop and scoop” the pelvis into the Cow position so that your belly is dropped toward the floor. Lift your chin and chest and gaze up toward the ceiling. Draw your shoulders away from your ears. Hold active Child’s Pose for 1 minute, Standing Forward Fold for 2 minutes, and Cat-Cow for 2 minutes. Add 2 minutes of a chest stretch. This is the inverse of how we normally sit at work, so it can help reverse poor alignment and ward off back pain. Do this morning and night. Start by standing. If you have joint pain, sit on your butt with your legs stretched out in front of you. Reach your arms behind you and interlace your fingers below your lower back. If your arms don’t reach, use a small towel or PVC pipe instead. Keep your head neutral and your eyes set straight ahead. Then, when you’re ready, begin to lift your chest so that your entire trunk elongates toward the ceiling and reach your hands back toward the floor. Hold this pose for 5 breaths, then relax and repeat. Do 1 minute of active Child’s Pose, 2 minutes of Cat-Cow, and 2 minutes of the chest-opening stretch. Then stand up and do 2 minutes of the Forward Fold before doing 2 minutes of Standing Cat-Cow. The point of Standing Cat-Cow is to differently activate the back and core muscles, and to help increase awareness of your back in relation to the rest of your body. With your legs hip-width apart and knees bent, place your hands either out in front of you or on your thighs for added balance. Keeping your legs static, begin the cat (upward) phase. Lengthen your neck and allow your head to reach toward your chest, maintaining alignment with the spine. On the out breathe, “swoop and scoop” the pelvis into Cow position. Repeat yesterday’s routine in the morning and night, but also conduct 2–3 minutes of the chest-opening stretch 3 times throughout the day. Here’s the Awareness Routine you’ll do every morning for week 2: 2 minutes Standing Forward Fold (swap the Fold for the chest opener on day 11) The goal for week 2 is to strengthen your core muscles while maintaining posture and spinal awareness. Before you start your Awareness Routine, do 3 to 5 rounds of (one round equals 10 breaths). The high plank requires awareness of the spinal position as well as engagement of the abdominal muscles, both of which are vital for encouraging posture corrections. Start in a pushup position, with your arms straight. Press back through your heels so that the backs of your legs are active, too. With your elbows underneath your shoulders, create space between your shoulders and ears so that there’s a slight stretch. Make sure your chest isn’t sinking and keep your shoulder blades back. Do 3–5 rounds of 10 breaths, counting your breaths. Today, end the Awareness Routine with 5 sets of Downward-Facing Dog (holding for 3 deep breaths). Downward-Facing Dog is useful for opening the anterior chest wall and shoulders that are so often rounded with excessive desk work. Tuck your toes and lift your hips high, toward the ceiling. Reach your heels back toward the mat without allowing them to plank on the ground. Drop your head so that your neck is long. As you stay here, make sure that your wrist creases stay parallel to the front edge of the mat. To alleviate the pressure on your wrists, press into the knuckles of your forefinger and thumbs. Finish the Awareness Routine with 5 minutes doing Pigeon Pose. This pose helps loosen tight hips and releases tension in the back of the spine and glutes. Step both feet together and bring your right knee forward between your hands so that your outer right leg is resting on the mat. Make sure your left hip is always pointing down toward the mat. If it begins opening up toward the ceiling, draw your right foot closer to your body. Stay here with your hands resting on your right leg or walk your hands out in front of you, allowing your torso to rest over your right knee. Hold here. Breathe into any areas of tightness and tension for 3–5 breaths, or about 30 seconds. Then place your hands on the mat in front of you, tuck your left toes, and step your right foot back. You’ll now be back in Downward-Facing Dog again. Step your left foot forward and repeat Pigeon on the left side. Today, swap the Standing Forward Fold out of your Awareness Routine for the chest opener. Then, when you get to work, set a “movement” reminder alarm to go off on your phone every 20 minutes. Each time the alarm goes off on your phone, stand up and do 30 seconds to 1 minute of Standing Cat-Cow. Plan for a 20-minute workout today — including an extra minute of the Pigeon Pose, if your hips are tight. After you’re done, do 10–12 reps of the side plank, hip up, and twists 3 times. Strong abs will help support your back so that your back muscles aren’t compensating for your body’s efforts to maintain proper posture. Make time for the Awareness Routine in the morning and at night. Then, during the day, do 2 minutes of chest- and hip-opening stretches. Ideally, you’ll do chest and hip stretches every 2 hours to counteract work posture and keep your upper body alert and aligned. Start on one knee with your opposite foot planted in front of you. Make sure your legs are far enough apart that your back leg can be lengthened while your front knee remains stacked directly over your ankle. Place your hands on your front knee and tuck your tailbone slightly toward the floor in order to activate your glutes. When you’re ready to begin, release the hip of your back leg forward and down toward the floor. Clasp your hands behind your back and reach your arms down toward the back of your back knee, keeping your arms as straight as possible. Hold for 3 to 5 breaths. Repeat on the opposite side. Move your laptop or computer to a or counter. You can also eat lunch and take conference calls or meetings standing up. Another option is to spend 15 minutes of every hour standing. If you don’t have a standing desk or high counter in your office, stack books or a crate on top of your desk to add height. Here’s the Awareness Routine you’ll do every morning of week 3: Do this routine every morning and complete other body goals throughout the day. At night, spend 5 minutes doing the thoracic spine rotation exercise. This pose helps improve mobility in your torso and reduces stiffness in the mid-to-lower back. Start out lying on your right side with your fingers spread slightly. Place your left hand behind your head, but keep your right hand outstretched on the ground in front of you with your fingers spread. Rotate your left elbow to the sky while exhaling, stretching the front of your torso, and hold for one deep breath, in and out. Return to the starting position and repeat for 5–10 breaths. At work, set a “movement” reminder alarm to go off on your phone every 20 minutes. Each time the alarm goes off, stand up and stretch for 30 seconds. tend to include a lot of poses that can help improve posture such as Camel, Child’s Pose, Cat-Cow, Downward-Facing Dog, Pigeon, and other movements that you haven’t yet done as part of this guide, such as Mountain Pose, Bow Pose, and Plow Pose. Today is about counteracting inactive glutes. When your glutes shut down, it can impact your hips and lead to poor posture. So, set a phone alarm for every hour and every time the alarm goes off, do 30 seconds of isometric glute squeezes. (You can do these sitting in your seat too.) Hold this contraction for 10 seconds and then release. Repeat for 1 minute. These isometric squeezes will help ensure that your glute muscles are firing properly. For the whole day, set a phone alarm for every 20 minutes. Every time the alarm goes off, check in on your sitting posture. your sitting position, which should be upright, tall, and comfortable Checking in with yourself and adjusting your posture accordingly can help reform neurological patterns. Try to avoid the following: Day 20: Hold your cell phone at eye level when you use it has shown that over time, looking down at our phones can exacerbate “text neck” or a neck that’s jutted forward. They found that even the slightest tilt of your head, like 15 degrees, can make your 10-pound head feel like 27 pounds. Truly poor posture can turn our heads into 60-pound weights, increasing risk of early wear and tear to your spine. Add 5 minutes of Pigeon Pose at the end of your Awareness Routine for week 1. Because stress can increase aches and pains in the body, do one thing that . Begin the morning and night with 6 minutes of Child’s Pose, Cat-Cow, and Pigeon Pose. At the end of the day, repeat the plank workout regimen of day 12. However, this time, complete 4 sets instead of 3. This week is about maintaining the strength and muscle memory you’ve built over the past few weeks. You’ll be practicing workout routines from the previous weeks but increasing the number of sets. Set a phone alarm for every hour. Every time the alarm goes off, do 30 seconds of isometric glute squeezes. Hold this contraction for 10 seconds and then release. Repeat for 1 minute. Set a phone alarm for every hour. Every time the alarm goes off, do 10 seconds of isometric rows in your seat. These isometric rows work your entire shoulder girdle, rhomboids, and crucial postural muscles, which help improve posture. Sit up straight and then drive your elbow into the seat behind you by squeezing your shoulder blades together. Hold this contraction for 10 seconds and then release. If you didn’t like the class you went to on day 17, try a beginner yoga class at a new studio. If you’re a first timer, most studios will offer you a discount — or better yet, let you ! Complete 5 sets of plank workouts from day 12 (instead of 3). After the workout regimen, do 3–5 minutes of thoracic spine rotation and chest- and hip-opener stretches. Do the Awareness Routine for 5–6 minutes. If your abdominal muscles are sore from yesterday’s abdominal workout, spend extra time doing Cat-Cow to help stretch the muscles. When you get to work, repeat the isometric glute contractions throughout the day, every hour for 30 seconds. Aim to stand for 35 percent of your workday. When you’re in the kitchen, try cutting vegetables and cooking while looking straight ahead as opposed to hunched over the oven or cutting board. Relax and stand against the wall and take a picture. Look and see if your natural position has improved since day 19. Keep your progress in mind as you move throughout the day. Stand for 50 percent of your workday and at the end of the day, evaluate how it felt. Look into your company’s standing desk policy or look at investing in one for yourself at your at-home office. If you feel that 30 days wasn’t enough time to readjust your posture, go back to day 16 and repeat the last 2 weeks. “Thirty days can make a real difference in improving posture, because shows that it takes 3 to 8 weeks to establish a routine. This guide will help you establish a morning, night, and sitting routine that benefits your posture and body as a whole,” says Marina Mangano, founder of Chiro Yoga Flow. To really check in on your progress, remember to take photos on the first and last day for evidence. At the end of these 30 days, your postural muscles should have started to build muscle memory. You should feel more confident and aware of how your back is positioned during work hours, at home, and throughout the day.

If It Doesn't Challenge You It Doesn't Change You 3 Common Posture Problems and Ways to Correct Them with Exercise 3 Common Posture Problems and Ways to Correct Them with Exercise How is your posture? If you sit at a desk all day, probably not as good as you think. If your back or neck feels tight or sore by day’s end, your posture could definitely use a tune-up. Most people aren’t aware they have poor posture. They also may not realize some of the stiffness in their neck and back at the end of the day is from prolonged sitting and sitting the wrong way in a chair. Having bad posture doesn’t look pretty either. When your body isn’t aligned properly or you have an anterior pelvic tilt, your tummy looks more prominent and gives the illusion of having more tummy fat than you actually do. Here are three of the most common posture problems people with office jobs are at risk for. Rounded shoulders come from leaning too far forward at your desk. It’s easy to slump when typing on a keyboard without even knowing it. Rounded shoulders can cause back pain and even restrict your breathing by limiting the expansion of your rib cage. When you slump forward in your chair, your chest muscles tighten and your upper back muscles, especially your trapezius muscles, lengthen. As a result, you have to recruit smaller muscles to help maintain your posture. This creates an imbalance that can lead to neck and back problems. To remedy this common problem, strengthen your trapezius muscles and stretch the pectoral muscles in your chest to loosen them up. To stretch your chest at work, do a doorway stretch. Place your palms on either side of the frame of an open door at about shoulder height. Then lean your chest forward into the door until you feel the stretch. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds. Do this several times a day. When you weight train, make sure you’re working your posterior deltoid muscles as much as your anterior ones. If you overdevelop your anterior deltoid muscles without balancing your training with posterior deltoid development, it’ll make you look hunched over. A hunched back is where you have an abnormal curvature of your upper back and your head extends too far forward. This condition is also known as postural kyphosis. If someone were to take a photo of you from the side, you’d notice your upper back protrudes more than it should. Hunchback is commonly seen with rounded shoulders. Like rounded shoulders, this postural problem is common in people who work at a computer most of the day and lean forward to type. As a result of hunching, the muscles and ligaments in the upper back stretch and become weaker. Hunchback places excessive pressure on your spine and is a risk factor for neck and upper back pain. Some people develop kyphosis during childhood from carrying a heavy book bag and it persists into adulthood. Performing too many upper body “pushing” exercises like push-ups and shoulder presses without balancing them with “pulling” exercises creates a muscle imbalance that can lead to hunchback. As with rounded shoulders, you can correct postural kyphosis by stretching your chest muscles to lengthen them and by strengthening the muscles in your upper back. Self-myofascial release techniques are also effective for postural kyphosis. Myofascial release uses pressure to relax areas of muscle tension. You can do this yourself using a foam roller. Place the foam roller underneath the tight areas and move the roller up and down the muscle, holding pressure on tight areas for 20 seconds at a time. It may take several sessions to experience improvement. With anterior pelvic tilt, your hips thrust forward more than they should. This forward thrust pushes your tummy forward and makes it look more prominent and shifts your buttocks backwards causing them to jut out. Anterior pelvic tilt also creates an abnormal arch in your lower back. Anterior pelvic tilt is linked with tight hip flexors and weak gluteal muscles. As a result of this tightness and weakness, your hamstring muscles have to work harder than they should. How can you tell if you have an abnormal pelvic tilt? Stand against a wall with your shoulders and buttocks touching it. Slide your heels about two inches away from the wall. Then slide your hand between your lower back and the wall. If you have a normal degree of pelvic tilt, your hand should fit snuggly into the gap. If there’s a space or your hand feels loose, your pelvis is tilted forward more than it should be. To correct anterior pelvic tilt, do basic hip flexor and quad stretches to lengthen your quads and iliopsoas muscle, the most powerful hip flexor. Static lunges are a good exercise for doing this. Work on strengthening your gluteal muscles with exercises like glute bridges and chair squats. If you work at a desk, prolonged sitting tightens hip flexors and worsens anterior pelvic tilt. Take a break to walk around and stretch your hip flexors at least every hour. Poor posture creates muscle and ligament imbalances that put you at risk for neck and shoulder pain as well as other problems like headaches. Make sure your computer work station is ergonomically friendly and your body is positioned properly in the chair. Take breaks throughout the day to stretch your chest muscles and hip flexors and take short walk breaks as often as possible. Make sure your workouts are balanced. Don’t work your abs without also training your back or do too many “push” exercises without exercises that involve pulling. When one muscle group is weak, another muscle group has to compensate, creating a muscle imbalance that worsens postural problems. Core exercises are also important for improving posture. The good news is strengthening the muscles in your core, back and shoulders in a balanced manner helps to prevent problems. Yoga is another form of exercise that helps with posture by creating greater body awareness and by strengthening core muscles and should be part of a balanced fitness program.

Try These 8 Strategies Medically reviewed by — In today’s modern world, it’s easier than ever to find yourself slouched over a phone or slumped over a laptop for hours at a time. Being locked on a screen for long periods of time, especially when you’re not positioned correctly, can take its toll on your muscles, joints, and ligaments. When your body gets used to being hunched over for hours, it can be easy to continue that same posture, even when you’re not in front of a screen. If you want to kick your slouching habit, there are simple exercises and strategies that can help. In this article, we’ll look at 8 steps you can take to reduce slouching and improve your overall posture. Posture is the way your body is positioned when you’re standing, sitting, or lying down. Correct posture puts the least amount of strain on your muscles and joints. Slouching, slumping, and other types of poor posture can cause muscle tension, as well as back pain, joint pain, and reduced circulation. Poor posture can even lead to breathing issues and fatigue. Having better balance not only lowers your risk of falls, it can also improve your athletic ability. Good posture puts less stress and tension on the disks and vertebra in your spine. Moving, standing, and sitting correctly reduces the strain on your muscles, joints, and ligaments. When your muscles are used more efficiently, it can help conserve your energy. Poor posture can put extra strain on your neck, which can lead to tension headaches. Good posture allows your lungs to expand more fully, allowing you to breathe easier. When your vital organs aren’t compressed by slouching, it can help your blood to flow more easily through your blood vessels and organs. The first step to not slouching is to be aware of your posture. We often get so caught up in what we’re doing that we forget to check our posture. Make it a habit to check on your posture throughout the day. Notice how you’re standing, sitting, or walking. Make corrections whenever you find yourself slouching or hunching your back or shoulders, or pushing your head or neck forward to look at a screen. The following strategies and exercises can help you cut back on slouching and use good posture instead. You might not pay much attention to how you stand, but it can make a big difference to your posture. To stand with good posture, keep these tips in mind: Stand straight and tall with your shoulders relaxed and pulled back slightly. Think of an invisible piece of string gently pulling your head toward the ceiling. Stand with your feet approximately shoulder-width apart, with your weight mostly on the balls of your feet. Keep your head level, not bent forward, with your ears over your shoulders. Shift your weight from your toes to your heels, or from one foot to the other if you have to stand in one place for a long time. When seated, keep these tips in mind to ensure you’re using good posture: Sit up straight with your shoulders relaxed, but not hunched or rounded. Choose a chair height that allows you to keep your feet firmly planted on the floor. Avoid crossing your legs. Keep your knees level or slightly higher than your hips. Sit back in your chair so the chair back supports your spine. Pay attention to your head position. Don’t let your head and chin sit forward of your shoulders. Keep your computer screen at eye level to prevent your neck from bending forward or backward. Holding one position, whether sitting or standing, for a long time can cause muscle tension, discomfort, and fatigue. The effects may be even more severe if you’re in a slouched position. To prevent muscle pain and fatigue, make a point to get up, stretch, and walk around for at least a few minutes every hour. Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to get up and move. It may also help if you can do a different task that requires you to use different muscles to the ones you’re using while seated or standing. If you’ve been sitting in one position for a while, the wall slide is a good way to reset your body and to remind you of what good upright posture feels like. It may also be helpful for relieving tightness in your neck and shoulders. Stand with your back, butt, shoulders, and head pressed firmly against a wall. Your feet can be a foot or two away from the wall to help you position your body correctly. Keep a tilt in your pelvis so there’s no arch in your back. Keep your knees slightly bent. Extend your arms straight above you with the backs of your hands against the wall. This is your starting position. You may find it difficult to raise your arms all the way up at first, and that’s OK. Lift them as far as you can while keeping your body pressed against the wall. With your back tall and your chest open, squeeze the muscles of your mid-back as you slide your arms down toward your shoulders. Keep the backs of your hands, elbows, shoulders, spine, butt, and head pressed up against the wall throughout the movement. Slide your arms downward until they’re slightly lower than shoulder height. Hold this position for a moment, then push your arms back up to the starting position without anything lifting from the wall. This simple exercise helps to stretch your spine, as well as your glutes and hamstrings. It can also help ease tension in your back and neck. Start on all fours with your hands and knees on the floor. Sink your hips back down toward your feet, while walking your hands out in front of you. If your thighs won’t go all the way down, you can place a pillow under them for support. Gently place your forehead on the floor while keeping your arms extended out in front of you. Hold this pose for 5 minutes, remembering to breathe deeply the entire time. This exercise can help improve your posture by stabilizing your shoulder and upper back muscles. It can also help make your chest muscles more flexible. Pull your shoulders back and downward slightly, as though you’re trying to get your shoulder blades to touch. Don’t overextend, but pull until you feel a slight stretch in your muscles. Hold for a few seconds and return to the starting position. Strong core muscles play an important role in helping you maintain good posture. That’s why building strength in your core is key if you want to avoid slipping into bad posture habits. Your include your abdominal muscles and the muscles around your pelvis and lower back. One of the best exercises for building a strong core is the plank. This exercise can also help relieve pain and stiffness from sitting or standing incorrectly. Start on all fours, with your hands directly below your shoulders and your knees below your hips. Lower yourself onto your elbows and straighten your legs behind you, keeping your feet hip-width apart. Hold for 20–30 seconds. Once you get used to this pose, you can hold it for longer. The bridge is another great core-strengthening exercise. Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and arms slightly out to the side, palms on the floor. Tightening your core muscles and glutes, raise your hips off the floor so your knees are in line with your shoulders. One of the keys to not slouching or hunching is to constantly be mindful of your posture. Set alerts on your phone to remind yourself to sit up straight and to take regular breaks so your muscles don’t get stiff or tense from being in one position for too long. Along with posture checks and movement, it also helps to do regular stretches and exercises to keep your muscles strong, flexible, and better able to help you maintain good posture.

eef1f728-ccd4-4d12-b8e6-61d40c5c29aa,"— Exercising, driving, sitting, reaching, standing, looking at our cell phones — you name it, we round our shoulders doing it. While some people can train themselves to pull their shoulders back while pretending to squeeze a golf ball between their shoulder blades, the rest of us spend extended periods , with our shoulders forward and down. Unfortunately, poor posture from rounded shoulders becomes a habit that can trigger everything from and to and . Austin Martinez, MS, CSCS, ATC, director of education for , says the rounded shoulder position is often associated with a condition termed “,” which is characterized by tight chest muscles (pectoralis major/minor) and neck/shoulder muscles (levator scapulae). The good news? With some retraining of your brain and body, a handful of exercises and , and a lot of practice, you too can learn how to hold that golf ball (OK, maybe a softball!) between your shoulder blades. Here are six moves to open up your chest, relax your shoulders, and correct your posture. Martinez says this stretch targets the and scalene muscles, which play a role in posture and breathing throughout the neck and shoulders. Stand or sit upright in a chair with your shoulders down and back. Gently pull your left ear towards your left shoulder to get a stretch in the right side of your neck. Complete 1–2 sets on each side, holding for 15–30 seconds. The doorway stretch is a top pick for rounded shoulders, says Jr., DPT, MS, ATC, physical therapist and CEO of . This move opens the chest while gently stretching the shoulders. Stand with a doorway about 1 to 2 feet in front of you. Bend both your elbows to 90 degrees and raise your arms so your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Place your forearms on either side of the doorway. Step forward placing one foot on the other side of the doorway. Slowly shift weight onto the front foot until you feel a stretch in your chest. Hold. Complete 3 sets for 15–30 seconds each, two to three times a day. The reverse shoulder stretch is another move that opens up the chest and stretches the shoulders. It’s also a great biceps stretch. It does require shoulder , so if you feel pain while trying to do this move, shorten the range of motion. Stand looking straight ahead, feet shoulder-width apart and arms by your sides. Clasp your hands behind your back with thumbs pointing towards the floor. Stand tall, open your chest and move your hands back and towards the ceiling. Stop when you feel a stretch in the shoulders and biceps muscles. Release the stretch and return hands to the starting position. Complete 2 sets, holding 20–30 seconds each, one to two times a day. The prone I, T, Y exercise helps strengthen the smaller in your shoulders and upper back. Lie on your stomach, forehead touching the ground, arms straight above your head with your hands in a thumbs-up position. Raise your arms as high as you can, pause, and then slowly lower them back down. Move arms out into a “Y” position, raise them as high as you can, and then slowly lower them back down. Move arms out into a “T” position, raise them as high as you can, and then slowly lower them back down. Complete 2 sets of 10 reps, one to two times a day. The band pull-apart exercise opens up the chest and strengthens the muscles in your upper back and . You’ll need a resistance/exercise band — the level or strength of the band depends on your strength level. Stand upright with back straight, feet shoulder-width apart, and knees slightly bent. Hold the band with an overhand grip and your arms straight out in front of you. Slowly pull your hands apart by squeezing your shoulder blades together. Focus on the squeeze by imagining a small ball between your shoulder blades. Complete 2 sets of 10–12 reps, one to two times a day. Scapular wall slides help and improve flexibility in the shoulder muscles. They also train you to hold your shoulder blades back. Stand with your back against a wall, arms at your sides. Make sure your head, upper back, and glutes are in contact with the wall. Your feet will be slightly away from the wall. Raise your arms overhead and press them into the wall, palms will face out with knuckles touching the wall. Bend the elbows to 90 degrees, while keeping arms against the wall. This is the starting position. From this position, slowly slide your arms up the wall as high as you can go without your back, shoulders, elbows, or wrists coming off the wall. Slowly lower your arms by sliding them down the wall to the starting position (elbows bent at 90 degrees). This movement is slow and controlled. Complete 2 sets of 10 reps, one to two times a day. Are there any other treatments I can try to help correct rounded shoulders? Your first line of defense for is stretching and strengthening. Beyond that, Gallucci says soft tissue mobilization by a physical therapist can loosen the tight muscles in the chest region, which may occur due to the hunched-over position. Some people may benefit from a that helps to keep your neck and shoulders in the correct position. If you want to go this route, talk to your doctor, or a physical therapist. They can assist in fitting one that works for you. Are there exercises I should avoid if I have rounded shoulders? As long as you’re not experiencing pain or discomfort, Gallucci says you don’t need to avoid specific exercises. What he does recommend is stretching and strengthening. “Hunched or rounded shoulders are most often experienced due to a muscle imbalance between the chest and shoulder/upper back region,” explains Gallucci. To correct the imbalance, he says stretching and strengthening should target the chest and upper back, and not specifically one or the other. When performing exercises, make sure that your spine is straight and you’re not hunching over. Rounded shoulders are a common issue for many people. By following a stretching and strengthening program designed specifically for this issue, you can help correct muscle imbalances and improve posture. As always, if you’re experiencing any pain or discomfort while doing these exercises, stop what you’re doing, and ask a physical therapist or fitness expert to demonstrate these moves with the correct form. — Medically reviewed by Hunched shoulders are a fairly common problem, especially with the rise of smartphones and laptops.

31cd674d-38e6-47ef-9611-0f85a0b8f1de,"Medically reviewed by — — Our bodies adapt to the postures we spend the most time in If a typical day includes hunching over a desk or laptop for 8 to 12 hours a day and then couch-surfing for an hour or two in the evenings to watch “The Office,” you’re not alone. Americans are sitting an average of 13 hours a day, according to conducted in 2013. Add those hours up, and it’s no wonder our natural posture has become increasingly curved, slumped, and sore. And if just hearing the phrase “poor posture” conjures up memories of mom telling you to “Sit up straight!” then keep in mind that, in this case, mother know best. “When we spend time in suboptimal positions, certain muscles in our body — such as shoulders, back, core, and neck — actually shorten,” explains , DPT, CSCS, founder of . Simply put, our bodies adapt to the postures we spend the most time in, and, over time, those shortened muscles can cause more health problems. Poor posture does much more than just affect your body’s physical structure. , a yoga and mobility instructor for , says it impacts a wide range of things from “how our body produces hormones and how our blood is circulating, to how we feel in our bodies and how we’ll be able to move as we age.” We may not immediately recognize the damage our posture is doing — but our body does. For example, Wickham says, the body can associate closed, or slumped-over posture with stress, which results in the release of cortisol. On the other hand, open or high-power positions — which endorphins and even testosterone, — ward off stress and create feelings of confidence. So not only does your posture affect your height and health, it can affect your mental health and how you feel about yourself. With that as an incentive, try these seven poses in the morning to get your blood flowing, loosen up tight muscles, and increase body awareness so you can stand straight and tall as you stroll out the front door. Keeping the bottoms of your feet facing the ceiling, touch your big toes to each other. Crawl your hands forward, and either extend your arms straight out toward the front of the mat, or drape your arms on the floor alongside your body. Slowly start to drop your hips back to rest on your heels. Child’s Pose helps you explore the range of motion in your shoulders by stretching your arms above your head. It also helps lengthen and stretch the spine, which is used to being slouched after years of bad posture. With a generous bend in your knees to support and balance your body’s shape, exhale as you bend forward at your hips, lengthening the front of your torso. Bend your elbows. Hold on to each elbow with the opposite hand. Let the crown of your head hang down. Press your heels into the floor as you lift your sitting bones toward the ceiling. Pull your shoulders away from your ears. Drop your head and neck. Lengthen your legs until you feel a stretch in the hamstring muscle. Work on engaging your quadriceps muscle to help hamstring muscles release. If you can keep the front of your torso long and your knees straight, place your palms or fingertips on the floor beside your feet. Release deeper into the pose with each exhalation. Let your head hang as you feel the tension roll out of your shoulders and neck. This fold deeply stretches the hamstrings, opens the hips, and can help release any tension in the neck and shoulders, explains Morbitzer. This can be an intense stretch for the hamstrings, so be careful not to take it too far. Instead, allow the tension in your shoulders to roll out. Start on all fours. Your wrists should be stacked under your elbows, which are stacked under your shoulders. Keep your fingers spread against the ground for increased stability. Keep your knees stacked under your hips, toes untucked, with the top of your feet pressed into the ground. Lengthen from your tailbone down to your head, so that your neck is neutral and you’re looking down a few inches from your finger. This is your starting position. Begin the Cat phase. As you exhale, tuck your tailbone under, using your abdominal muscles to push your spine toward the ceiling, making the shape of a Halloween cat. Lengthen your neck. Allow your head to reach toward your chest so that your ears come down by your biceps. On an exhale breath, “swoop and scoop” the pelvis into Cow position so that your belly is dropped toward the floor. Lift your chin and chest and gaze up toward the ceiling. Broaden your shoulder blades. Draw your shoulders away from your ears. Cycle through Cat-Cow a few times. Be careful to avoid putting stress and pressure on your head and neck. This movement sequence will help increase spinal awareness, which is a large part of less-than-perfect posture. According to Morbitzer, “The Cat-Cow movement should be done through the core and the pelvis so that as you inhale, you are creating an anterior tilt to the pelvis so that your tailbone is facing the ceiling, and as you exhale you create a posterior tilt so that your tailbone is facing towards the ground.” With your legs hip-width apart and knees bent, place hands either out in front of you or on your thighs for added balance. Keep your legs static. Begin the Cat (upward) phase: As you exhale, tuck your tailbone under using your abdominal muscles to push your spine toward the ceiling, making the shape of a Halloween cat. Lengthen your neck. Allow your head to reach toward your chest, maintaining alignment with the spine. On an exhale breath, “swoop and scoop” the pelvis into Cow position so that your belly is dropped toward the floor. Lift your chin and chest and gaze up toward the ceiling. Broaden your shoulder blades and draw your shoulders away from your ears. This stretch activates different back muscles. It can help increase your awareness of your back in relation to the rest of your body. If your job requires you to be in the same position every day, take a break and cycle through Standing Cat-Cow a few times to help counteract the effects of sitting all day. Abdominals, abductors, obliques, glutes, shoulders Start on all fours with your fingers spread slightly. Keep your core engaged and active, and your pelvis neutral. Point your tailbone down toward your heels. Keep your legs active so that you’re pulling up on your kneecaps with your quads. Press back through your heels so that your calves are active, too. With elbows underneath your shoulders, create space between the shoulders and ears so that there’s a slight stretch. To make sure that the chest isn’t sinking, puff up the space between your middle and lower back so that your shoulder blades are almost moving away from each other. “If you notice that your stomach or hips are sinking, tilt your pelvis slightly forward,” suggests Morbitzer. “But if that is too intense, bring your knees down to the ground while keeping the core tight and pelvis neutral.” This position requires awareness of the spinal position as well as engagement of the abdominal muscles. This core strength is vital for encouraging posture corrections. Tuck your toes and lift your hips high, lifting your sitting bones toward the ceiling. Reach your heels back toward the mat without allowing them to plank on the ground. As you stay here, make sure that your wrist creases stay parallel to the front edge of the mat. To alleviate the pressure on your wrists, press into the knuckles of your forefinger and thumbs. “It is useful for opening the anterior chest wall and shoulders that are so often rounded with excessive desk work,” explains Morbitzer. Practice often, and you might be able to relieve neck and back pain associated with poor posture. You might even find yourself sitting up a little straighter, too. Remember to actively draw your shoulder blades back and create a space in your neck. If you find yourself scrunching your shoulder up to your ears, it may mean you don’t have enough upper body strength. If your shoulder blades begin to tense up, bend your knees and go into Child’s Pose, and rest until you’re ready to hold the position again. Start on all fours, with your fingers spread slightly. Place your left hand behind your head, but keep your right hand outstretched on the ground in front of you with fingers spread. Rotate your left elbow to the sky while exhaling, stretching the front of your torso, and hold for a deep breath, in and out. Return to the starting position. Repeat for 5 to 10 breaths. This exercise stretches and improves mobility in your torso, specifically your thoracic spine (the middle and upper back). It also reduces stiffness in the mid to lower back. Thoracic spine mobility is extremely important for loosening tightness in the back muscles. “The point of this exercise is to take the [muscles] around the spine through its full range of motion,” Wickham explains. Right now, there’s no direct evidence linking stretching to better posture, but science, as always, is at work to find one. An early 2010 suggests that stretching could improve posture, and some researchers at believe it could help enough that they’re currently recruiting participants for a clinical trial studying the link between stretching, better posture, and reduced back pain from sitting. But what about now? Where does all this stretching lead? Well, both Wickham and Morbitzer believe active yoga poses that incorporate breath and muscle contractions can help people gradually realign their bodies and improve posture. and can help increase body awareness, so that even when you’re not trying, your body, through an ache or slump, will remind you to “Sit up straight!” And you’ll adjust, just the way your mom wanted you to. rugby-playing, mud-running, protein-smoothie-blending, meal-prepping, CrossFitting, become a morning person, tried the Whole30 challenge, and eaten, drank, brushed with, scrubbed with, and bathed with charcoal — all in the name of journalism.

4c3c9324-4c74-4436-9507-e81f113ac248,"— If you work in a job that requires sitting for prolonged periods of time, then your shoulders have likely rounded forward at some point. This is especially the case for office workers and truck drivers. If your shoulders have shifted forward, there are simple fixes for rounded shoulders. It mostly requires remembering and repeating certain exercises. These exercises can help you gain back the upper hand on your posture and overall well-being. The Cat-Cow Pose is a common yoga pose. You can practice yoga in guided classes or on your own. Most basic yoga poses can be done at home. This particular pose helps target the back and chest. These are the areas that are primarily affected by rounded shoulders. Begin by kneeling on all fours on a mat or the floor. To ensure proper alignment, position your hands directly under your shoulders, your hips shoulder-width apart, and your spine in a neutral position. Your feet should be plantar-flexed, meaning that you point your toes away from your body. To do this, the top of your foot will touch over the floor. To move into the upward cat phase of the exercise, exhale and push your spine up as far as it will comfortably go towards the ceiling. Meanwhile, your chin will tuck in towards your chest. Next, transition into the downward cow phase by first inhaling. Slowly relaxing the back and letting your abdomen dip towards the floor. This should move your shoulder blades together and cause your back to arch. Hold this for 5 to 10 seconds and then return to the starting neutral position. You may have noticed a tighter-than-normal chest from rounded shoulders. This is likely caused by the slightly forward posture of rounded shoulders that causes muscles of the chest to shorten and become tighter. This chest stretch will help to open up the front body. Start either seated or standing with your arms raised, elbows bent, and your hands interlocked on the back of your head. Imagine a tennis ball is sitting between your shoulder blades as you gently squeeze the shoulder blades together to hold it in place. Hold this stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. Remember to breathe. Make this move more comfortable by adjusting the height of your hands. For example, you can place your hands on top of your head or even a few inches above your head to get a different stretch. For a deeper stretch, try doing this after a warm shower or after light exercise like walking, when your muscles are warmed up. This fix incorporates something we all know how to do: breathe! When our shoulders and upper back round forward, this can affect breathing by making it harder for the breathing motion of the diaphragm and the rib cage to occur, making breaths feel shallow.

a5358325-70e8-427d-a7a4-057a3d50d628,"Medically reviewed by — — While are arguably the most common abdominal exercise, they may not be the most effective way to build muscle and strengthen your core. Plus, is about more than having a beach-ready body. Effectively working out your core can improve stability, reduce injury, and maintain mobility. But if you’re continuously doing crunches and situps at the gym with the hopes of achieving a sexy six-pack, you may be exercising in vain. So, what should you do instead? Try planks. A great alternative to crunches, planks can help improve core strength and stability. Here’s everything you need to know about planks to help keep your tummy tight and your core strong. The simple act of planking isn’t very hard to pull off, but holding the position is a completely different story. . Get into the top or start of a pushup position. Keep your palms and toes firmly planted on the ground, your back straight, and your core tight. A saggy back or bottom during a plank can result in lower back pain later on, so be sure not to compromise your form. Do not let your head sag. . Lower down to your forearms, maintaining the same positioning and form as the high plank. So, what exactly is it about planks that make them a more effective movement than crunches? Well, one reason is that situps and crunches can be hard on your back. Pushing your spine against the floor can cause lower back pain later on. Additionally, planks don’t just work your core: They work your entire body. Planks require your arms, your legs, and all of your abs, making them an all-encompassing workout and a more efficient way to exercise. If you’re experiencing back pain from sitting at an office desk all day, here’s some good news: Planks can help improve your posture! By strengthening your back, chest, shoulders, neck, and abs, this exercise makes it easier to keep your shoulders back and your lower back in a neutral position while sitting or standing — two vital components of good posture. Planks also help you develop isometric strength in your core muscles, which gives you the power to keep from hunching while standing or sitting for long periods of time. While it may not feel like it, planks are a great way to stretch out the lower half of your body. Getting into the hold position lengthens your hamstrings as well as the arches of your feet, making the plank pose a dual strength and stretch exercise. If you want to stretch your sides, side planks with an extended arm can target that individual area of your body. While the classic plank is a great go-to exercise, planks can also be modified and added to in order to suit what your body needs. Dropping to your forearms in the plank position is one modification you can do. Increasing the length of time you hold the pose is another way to maximize the exercise. Start with a 15- to 30-second hold, and increase your time from there. Make two minutes your maximum time limit. If you’re looking to increase your athletic performance, research shows that repeated 10-second holds may be the best workout. Want to incorporate planks into your everyday regime? Try these different variations on the classic exercise. If you want to target your side abdominals and strengthen your spine, try side planks. A study published in found that side planks could also help reduce spinal curvature in scoliosis patients. That means they can even help reduce the chances of spinal problems, or the need for corrective surgery in the future. Lie on your right side and prop yourself up onto your right forearm, which should be on the ground. Your elbow should be in line with your shoulder. Raise your hips up so that your body forms a straight line to the ground, and along with the floor, your body forms a triangle shape. The sides of your right foot will also be braced on the ground. You can try stacking your left foot on top of your right foot, or placing both feet on the ground. If you want to increase your balance challenge, try lifting your free arm in the air. Remember to switch sides! From the classic plank pose, take your right hand off the ground and lightly tap your left elbow. Use your left arm and toes to balance. Return your right hand to the ground, and repeat the action on your opposite side. Do 10 taps on each side to start off, but increase your number as your balance improves. The movement may be tricky to master at first, but it will engage your entire core while also improving your balance. This simple twist on the classic plank pose looks easy to maneuver, but it will have you sore the next day! Make sure you’re tapping the floor lightly, and keep your back straight. Don’t compromise your form! By touching your knee to the floor, your hamstrings and quads get double the workout. Now that you know how to plank, get ready for some killer abs! A stronger core will increase your athletic performance and everyday abilities.

Move your arms in small clockwise circles. Do 20 repetitions and then do 20 more small counterclockwise circles. Simply lift your shoulders up toward your ears as you inhale, then roll them back and down as you exhale. You can do these stretches throughout the day, especially as you feel your upper back or shoulders tense up. Strengthening your back, shoulder, and core muscles can also help to support your shoulders. Try working the following exercises into your routine. Lie on one side with your elbow directly under the shoulder. Engage your abdominal muscles as you lift your hips so that just your feet and elbow are touching the mat. Hold for 30 seconds and then repeat on the other side. Work up to 2 minutes per side. You’ll need a resistance band to do this next exercise. These are available on , and you can use them for a variety of exercises. Tie a resistance band around a doorknob or some other object. Take an end of the band in each hand and start with your arms outstretched in front of you. Slowly pull your arms out to your sides, squeezing your shoulder blades together as you move. Try 3 sets of 15 repetitions. As you build strength and flexibility through stretching and exercising, you can help to prevent your shoulders from returning to a hunched position by practicing good posture. But before working on your posture, it’s important to make sure you know what good posture looks and feels like. You can do this with a simple technique known as a wall test: Stand with your heels 2-3 inches away from a wall, but with the back of your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks touching the wall. Slide a flat hand in between your lower back and the wall. There should be just enough room for your hand to move in and out. If there’s too much room between your back and the wall, pull your belly button in toward your spine, which should push your lower back closer to the wall. If there isn’t enough room to slide your hand in there, arch your back just enough to make room. Walk away from the wall while holding that posture. Then return to the wall to see if you have maintained that position. Practice this throughout the day for a few days, making sure that your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks are in alignment. After some repetition, you’ll start to recognize when you’re standing up straight and identify when you need to adjust your posture. When seated, your buttocks and shoulder blades should touch the back of your chair with a slight arch in your lower back. Keep your knees at 90 degrees and your feet flat on the floor. Try to keep your neck in line with your shoulder blades and buttocks, with your chin slightly down. Do quick posture checks throughout the day, especially if you spend a lot of time carrying a heavy bag, using a computer, or talking on the phone. If you notice that your shoulders are hunched and rounded, it’s likely a sign that some of your daily habits — from driving to using a laptop — are starting to affect your posture. With some daily stretching and light exercise, you can help to loosen tight muscles and build strength. But if these changes don’t seem to help, consider working with a doctor or physical therapist to help address the underlying issue.

This is good news if you know what you’re looking for. Otherwise, it can feel overwhelming. When determining which posture corrector is right for you, here are a few things to consider. There are definitely benefits to bracing with the right support. However, bracing in general is a double-edged sword. “If you’re constantly supporting the spine in a certain position, it can make the muscles in the spine atrophy and become lazy,” says , spinal neurosurgeon and chief of spine at St. John’s Hospital in Santa Monica, California, and founder of .

And if people don’t wear it, the efficacy factor becomes irrelevant. “I find that the most comfortable ones are also the most effective, as are the softer ones, since they tend to keep the muscles activated and prevent atrophy,” he says. Vokshoor recommends posture correctors that provide support but are easily self-adjusting so people don’t have to rely on having another person around to help them put it on, take it off, and adjust the tension. Being able to wear a posture correct under or over clothes is also a key feature when choosing the right one for you.

Posture is basically an attitude of the body part to maintain or to move according to a particular activity. Posture is defined as a particular position of the body while sitting, working, communicating, etc. It is the pose or a manner the person holds the body upright. And its a characteristic of the human body that makes a major impact on health and overall wellness.  We all know that there are so many types of muscles in the human body. These are like skeletal muscles, striated muscles, non-striated muscles, cardiac muscles, anti-gravity muscles, etc. For maintaining a good posture all these muscles have to work together in a proper way. In case any of these muscle groups get into a problem (due to reasons like over usage or less usage) then the body’s posture will automatically get altered. This, in turn, shows its impact both physically as well as mentally like concentration, general or localized body pain, reduction in the confidence level, poor personality rank, etc. No matter, whether you are standing, sitting, or sleeping; good posture is essential for the health of your joints and spinal muscles. Most people lack maintenance of which creates a bad impact on the body and muscles. It is therefore imperative to know about the types of body posture that help you lift your own posture well and good. Let’s check them out here… The American Physical Therapy Association describes the good standing position as an alignment of the shoulder, knee, ear, ankle, and hip. While sitting, the head needs to be erected and the back position needs to maintain the three normal spinal curves.

From neck and shoulder pain caused by hunching over a smartphone, to lower back pain from sitting at our desks all day, it’s no surprise that we suffer from back pain and posture issues. Who hasn’t had to call in sick at work because of back pain, or put off a night out with friends because they were in too much pain to have a good time? When asking yourself how to improve posture, there are a few simple steps you can take to ensure you don’t have to miss an important meeting or an evening of fun because of back pain and posture. Posture refers to the way in which your body is positioned when you are sitting, moving or standing. As well as being vital for our movement and comfort, having a good posture means that muscles and ligaments are not working harder than they should.¹ Skeletal muscle is made up of two types of muscle fibre – static (often called 'slow twitch') and phasic (often called 'fast twitch'). Generally, static muscle fibres are found in the deeper muscle layers. They help us to maintain posture without too much effort and contribute to balance by ‘sensing’ our position and relaying this information to the brain. Phasic muscle fibres are used for movement and activity. Static fibres burn energy slowly and can keep working for a long time without tiring. However, phasic fibres quickly run out of steam. Poor posture causes muscle fatigue because it calls on the phasic fibres instead of static fibres to maintain the body’s position.¹ 42% of people say pain stops them from going out with friends.* 1 in 3 people say that body pain, for example, back pain, has forced them to call in sick at work.* Some signs of bad posture you may be able to see, including rounded shoulders, a pot belly or a tendency to jut your head forward. Others you will feel: back pain, body aches and pains, muscle fatigue or headache.¹ A good posture should feel effortless – there’s no need to throw your shoulders back and stick your chest out. If your muscles are tight or weak, it may take some time to adjust your posture habits at first, but these small changes can make a big difference to back pain and posture. When you’re standing up, you should be able to imagine a straight line running from your ear through your shoulder, hip and knee to the middle of your ankle. There are a number of simple ways in which you can help to improve your posture. While it may take some time and feel awkward at first to correct a posture that you are accustomed to, your back will thank you. If you have a tendency to slouch when sitting, with your pelvis further forward than your shoulders, your muscles have to work harder, resulting in tension and pain.² Avoid soft chairs for long periods – while they seem comfortable, they make it difficult to maintain a good posture.¹ To correct this posture, try exercises that will strengthen your core, buttocks, shoulder and neck muscles, such as back extensions.² Lie on your stomach, and bring your arms beneath you, bending your elbows so your hands are resting on the floor under your face Keep your shoulders back and neck in line with your spine Arch your back up by pushing down on your hands until you feel a gentle stretch on your stomach muscles Stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort If you’ve ever worked in a shop, as a hairdresser or in a restaurant, you’ll know that standing all day can be tiring. It’s common to stand with one leg out and your weight over the other, especially if you have been on your feet for a while. Although it seems comfortable, it places uneven strain on your hips and lower back, and can lead to muscle imbalances and pain in your lower back.² You can work on correcting uneven hips with exercises to strengthen your buttocks, lower back and core muscles, such as the plank.² Lie on your front, then raise your body on your toes and bent forearms Keep your legs straight and hips raised to create a straight line from head to toe Your shoulders should be directly above your elbows Make sure you keep your tummy muscles tight throughout the exercise Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds and repeat 8 to 10 times to strengthen your core muscles⁴ Stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomforts Poor posture is common among office workers, many of whom can sit for hours at a desk without moving. When you’re concentrating on a task, it’s easy to ignore discomfort.¹ Spending long periods looking down at a smartphone can similarly, create the modern syndrome of ‘text neck’.² Over time, the chest muscles tighten and the back muscles become weak, which can cause rounded shoulders and back stiffness.¹ It’s important to take regular breaks to stretch, move around and ensure you are sitting correctly.⁵ When you’re at work, set an alarm to remind you take a two minute break from your desk every 30 minutes.⁵ Sit in a stable chair to properly support your lower back. Your knees should be at right angles or a little lower than your hips, with your feet either supported by a footrest or flat on the floor. Having your feet firmly positioned provides support for your back.⁵ So now you know why it matters and how to improve your posture. While you are going about your daily business, occasionally pause for a second to give yourself a check. Your back will thank you for it in the long run. ¹ Better Health Channel. Posture.

85f3b417-468f-4600-8868-ef33c8cde5a6,"— — To make exercise part of your daily routine, choose a time of day that works for you. Create a comfortable exercise space and wear loose-fitting clothing. Begin with the easiest exercises and warm up slowly. Don’t overdo it: If your pain level increases, reduce the number repetitions and sets you are performing and reduce the intensity of your program until you can perform the exercises comfortably. If exercise is making your condition worse, discontinue your routine and report it to your doctor. Always consult with your doctor before beginning a new exercise program. You should perform this exercise in front of a full-length mirror. Start by standing with your heels about 4 inches away from a wall. Keep your shoulders and buttocks as close to the wall as possible without straining. Hold this position for 5 seconds. Check your posture in the mirror and think about how it feels to stand straight and tall. Relax, then repeat 10 times. You should perform this exercise on a firm surface. Use your bed if it has a firm mattress, or place a mat on the floor. Lie face down for 15 to 20 minutes. (If you can’t do this comfortably, you may use a pillow under your chest and place your forehead on a folded towel.) You may keep your head downward, turn it to one side, or alternate sides. You may not be able to do this for 20 consecutive minutes. That’s fine. Begin with whatever feels comfortable and increase the time as you gain strength. Inflammation due to AS can cause decreased chest expansion. The breaststroke specifically can help build and maintain chest expansion. Swimming in general is a great way to increase flexibility in your spine without jarring it. It also helps to increase flexibility in your neck, shoulders, and hips. You may find it easier to perform aerobic exercises while in the pool. Deep breathing helps you to increase and maintain your lung capacity, and can help keep your rib cage flexible. To start, sit or lie down and observe your normal breath. Take a slow, deep breath. You should feel air enter through your nose and move toward your lower belly. Allow your abdomen to expand fully. Breathe out slowly through your mouth or nose. With one hand on your abdomen, feel it rise as you inhale and fall as you exhale. Alternate normal and deep breaths a few times. Yoga can help ease pain and increase flexibility. Many people find that yoga helps reduce stress and tension and promote restful sleep. If you’re new to yoga, don’t attempt to learn on your own. Find a class for beginners and stick with gentle poses. As your range of motion increases, you may want to try more advanced levels. Pay attention to how you walk. Aim to keep your spine as straight as possible, with your shoulders squared and your head held high. In other words, think tall! You can test and correct your posture throughout the day by standing with your back against a wall. Your head, shoulders, buttocks, and heels should touch the wall at the same time. If your job requires you to sit at a desk all day, it may be worth it to invest in an ergonomic chair. Make sure it’s well-designed and doesn’t encourage a slumped or stooped position. Just like your walking posture, try to sit with your spine as straight as possible. Keep your shoulders squared and your head held high. Check and correct your sitting posture throughout the day. Sleep with your spine straight, if possible. To encourage this position, your mattress should be firm, but not too hard. Sleep on your stomach if you can, and don’t use a pillow. Alternatively, you can sleep on your back and use a thin pillow, or one designed to support your neck. Avoid sleeping with your legs curled and keep them as straight as you can. It might be easier to exercise or perform deep breathing after a warm bath or shower. Check on and correct your posture throughout the day. Don’t perform strenuous exercises when you’re having a flare-up. Always begin with gentle exercises and increase the intensity only if you’re not in pain. If pain increases due to exercise, discontinue and consult with your doctor. — — Weekly Exercise Routine for Ankylosing Spondylitis 10 Things Never to Say to Someone with Ankylosing Spondylitis © 2005-2021 Healthline Media a Red Ventures Company.

Research excessive sitting with an elevated risk for health conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Of course that doesn’t mean you’ll get heart disease just because you have a desk job—but sitting isn’t doing your body any favors. Sitting all day can also impact us physically. Sitting for long periods of time, especially with poor posture, makes your hip flexors tight, which causes the glutes (butt muscles) to lengthen to compensate. Over time, this compromises the ability of the gluteal muscles to activate properly, leading to a condition called . When your glutes can't do their job, other muscles in your body have to work harder, which ultimately can overwork them, leading to poor body alignment and aches. Tight hip flexors also make it harder for your pelvis to rotate properly—inhibited mobility in this area can cause compression and pain in the lower back, physical therapist Dan Giordano, D.P.T., C.S.C.S., and co-founder of in New York City, tells SELF. If you spend most of your time sitting, there is some good news. While it is true that sitting for most of the day isn’t healthy, there are some ways you can help undo the damage, Noam Tamir, C.S.C.S., founder of in New York City, tells SELF. For starters, Tamir recommends standing up for at least 30 to 40 minutes a day. “A standing desk is also a good option as it will help you become more aware of your posture and ,” he says. In addition, doing certain exercises when you’re off the clock can also make a huge difference, especially ones that focus on strengthening the posterior (back) part of your body—like your back, glutes, and hamstrings—while stretching the anterior (front) muscles such as your hip flexors, pelvis, and . This helps counteract the tightness that ensues when you're in a seated position, plus strengthens the muscles that we need for good posture (read: to be strong enough to simply sit upright and stand up straight). We asked Tamir to put together a great workout that can help undo some of the negative effects of sitting all day. “These exercises are designed to strengthen the core, work the posterior muscles of the body, engage the legs, and help with proper pelvic and spinal alignment,” he says. “Together, these moves help to offset the imbalances associated with long periods of sitting.” So what are you waiting for?

6b30b362-90e2-45ab-88e2-956a83d471cb,"| | Back pain is a common ailment, affecting eight out of ten people at some point in their lives. The spine has a difficult job in that it must support the weight of the upper body and still be able to bend and twist in any direction. The greatest strain is placed on the lower back, particularly among people who do a lot of sitting or who are underactive. Many conditions may cause back pain. Some, like pregnancy and emotional tension, are common, natural occurrences. Other factors that contribute to back problems include physical trauma, athletic injuries, poor physical fitness or being overweight. Additional examples: Overuse or improper use of the back (poor body mechanics) may cause painful muscle spasms or back strain, i.e. stretching or tearing of muscles. Weak abdominal muscles may cause back sprain, i.e. stretched or torn ligaments rather than muscles, due to improper positioning of spine. Slipped or ruptured discs may cause pain if discs press upon the spinal nerves. Pain may radiate throughout the legs as well as the back. Improper posture may cause back strain or sprain due to improper bending, lifting, sitting or standing.    The application of either ice or heat to sore back muscles can greatly relieve pain. Ice may be applied at any time. Use ice for 10-20 minutes, placing a wet towel between the ice bag and your body.  Heat is for the first 48 hours after the onset of back pain. After 48 hours, using heat or ice generally depends on what feels best to you. Use heat for a maximum of 20 minutes at a time. : Some people find that doing slight backward or forward bends can help relieve back pain. If an exercise decreases your symptoms, repeat it frequently throughout the day. Place hands on the small of your back. Bend backward from the waist, keeping your knees as straight as possible. Slowly return to an upright position. Repeat 2-10 times. Lie face down on a soft but firm surface with your head turned to the side and your arms at your sides. Relax for a couple of minutes. From this prone position, slowly raise your upper body enough to lean on your elbows. Relax as much as possible while maintaining this position for 5-30 seconds. Repeat 2-10 times. Lean forward in your chair and lower your chest to your knees. Return to a sitting position by placing your hands beside your legs, using them to push yourself slowly back to an upright position. Hold 5-30 seconds. Repeat 2-10 times. Lie on your back, placing your legs on a chair. Increase your comfort by placing a pillow under your legs. Relax for a couple of minutes. Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor. Tilt your pelvis slightly so that your spine is flat on the floor. One at a time, slowly raise each bent knee to your chest. Next, hug both knees to your chest, then lower them one at a time. Hold for 5-30 seconds. Repeat 2-10 times. Improve your posture. Stand with your lower back in a neutral position by standing tall with your chin and stomach tucked in. Try keeping your earlobe over your shoulder and your shoulder over your hip. When standing for long periods, put one foot up on a foot rest to reduce the tendency to stand with a sway back. Avoid wearing shoes that have high heels or are worn out. Sit in your chair with both feet on the floor and your back against the chair back. The chair should keep your back in a neutral position, with a small but comfortable inward curve. If you sit for long periods, it is essential to get up frequently and walk around. Pay attention to your posture while doing activities that require sitting, such as driving and watching TV. When bending forward, always bend your knees. Squat, keep your back in a neutral position and go down on one knee. Or do a ""golfer's bend,"" countering the forward movement by letting one leg rise in back. , because it can strain the back. When lifting, use one of the bending techniques described above and: Hold the object close to your body, lifting with your legs. Do not lift anything that is heavier than you can manage. Get help if the object is too large or heavy. It's best to sleep on a firm mattress with a soft top layer. If your mattress is soft, try placing a bed board beneath it to increase the firmness. Here are suggested sleep positions to reduce back pain while lying down. Choose one that works best for you. On your side with hips and knees bent and a pillow between knees and ankles. On your back with a pillow beneath bent knees for support. On your stomach with or without a pillow under your torso. Note: this position is not the best for those with neck pain. like this.  Avoid using big pillows beneath your head as they put a strain on your back.  These exercises are designed to strengthen the muscles that support your back. Try 2-3 repetitions, building up to 10 repetitions if no increase in symptoms. Lie on your back as shown. Contract your abdominals by bringing your belly button in and back towards your spine, without holding your breath. Hold for 5 seconds. This exercise strengthens buttock muscles. Lying on your back, perform abdominal drawing-in, as above, holding throughout this exercise. Gently raise your hips, keeping a straight line between your knees and shoulders. Do not arch your back. Hold for 5 seconds, then slowly lower hips to the floor. Start on your hands and knees with a flat back. Contract your abdominal muscles by drawing your belly button inward toward your spine. Slowly raise your left arm and right leg until horizontal with your torso (leg and arm in a straight line). Do not rotate your torso. Do not allow your back to sag. Hold for 5 seconds. If this is too difficult, start by raising just your arm or leg. Lie on your right side, supporting yourself with your right elbow, forearm and wrist. Contract your abdominal muscles by drawing the belly button inward toward your spine. Press firmly into the floor with your supporting arm, raising your torso and pelvis upwards until they form a straight line with your legs. Do not let your torso rotate forward or backward. Do not let your hips move toward the rear. Hold 5 seconds. Repeat on the other side. These are activities that can be sustained for up to 20 minutes to improve muscle and cardiovascular endurance and are vital in the healing process of lower back pain. It is important to include endurance exercises that will not increase or produce lower back pain. Examples include using an elliptical machine, riding a stationary bike, swimming and walking. When you are pain-free in your daily life and during endurance activities, you may begin a graduated return to sports. This may include participating for a shorter time and/or in a less competitive environment. Stress reduction through relaxation is also an important way to control lower back pain. Relaxation comes in many forms, including mindfulness-based meditation, visualization, positive self-talk, or any number of strategies that help you to release tension from your muscles. 207 Fletcher Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1050 Our Strategic Plan for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion | | © 2021 The Regents of the University of Michigan",131,exercises for better posture,-7.657275676727295,28

Do one set of each exercise. You can also combine the exercises we discussed above to create a 10-minute workout. Here’s a look at one routine: Perform each exercise one after another without resting in between. After doing all six exercises, rest for 1 minute before repeating the routine a second time. Exercising — even just in short bursts throughout the day — is linked to a number of benefits. These include: A published by researchers at the University of Utah found that even short bursts of lasting less than 10 minutes can have a positive effect on your . The researchers found that each minute of high-intensity performed throughout the day lowered the odds of obesity by 5 percent for women and 2 percent for men. A small compared the effects of an exercise program made up of 12 daily 5-minute exercise sessions with those of a program made up of one hour-long session on individuals with obesity. The researchers found that participants who exercised in 5-minute blocks reported 32 percent less hunger throughout the day than the group who exercised continuously for an hour. According to a , research has found that acute bursts of exercises are linked to positive changes in mood. Most of the research is on aerobic exercise, but there’s some evidence that anaerobic exercise like weightlifting can also have similar benefits.

a99fae42-23da-41a1-a8a8-85b447883a83,"If you have scoliosis, certain yoga postures may help decrease the curves of your spine, according to a in . It expanded on a smaller from a few years ago. Scoliosis is an abnormal sideways curvature of the spine, which typically develops in adolescence (adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, AIS) but may also progress in adulthood or develop in adults due to age-related degenerative changes in the spine (degenerative scoliosis, DS). The curves may be in any portion of the spine—lower (lumbar), mid­dle (thoracic), or upper (cervical). There may be either one curve (cre­ating a “C” shape) or two (creating an “S” shape). Scoliosis can cause back pain and, if severe, can compress organs and cause difficulty breathing, nerve impairment, cardiac complications, and other problems. Conventional management includes active surveillance (that is, keeping an eye on whether the condition progresses), bracing, and surgery. Physical therapy (including the ), various exercises, and movement therapies like the can also help manage the condition. For the latest study, 49 people with DS and 25 with AIS—but not previous spinal surgery or other musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disorders—were evaluated before and after undergoing a home yoga program that consisted of doing either one or two poses as instructed, at least every other day for 6 to 11 months. Ages ranged from 8 to 80. All the participants had scoliotic curves in the lower half of the spine and did a modified side plank () pose with the con­vex side of the lumbar or thoracolumbar scoliotic curve down. The modification was to hold the upper ribs about a half-inch higher than in the classic pose. The pose was further modified if needed to accom­modate any physical limitations participants had. Participants who also had scoliotic curves in the upper half of the spine did the modified side plank plus a half-moon () pose with the help of a belt. The half-moon—a balancing pose with one leg raised—was done with the convex side of the cervi­cothoracic or upper thoracic scoliotic curve down. All the poses were held as long as possible—which turned out to be from 30 seconds to three minutes. With just a few exceptions, participants showed significant decreases in their curves compared to baseline, as seen on spinal X-rays. For example, in people with DS, scoliotic curves in the lower half of the spine decreased nearly 24 percent, on average, over a period of 10 to 11 months. Curves in the upper half of the spine decreased nearly 28 percent. Two people with DS and four people with AIS showed no improvements, however—and two people with DS had worsening of curves. The researchers hypothesized that the poses may help straighten the spine by strengthening the musculature on the convex side of the curve. They also noted that though the study had no control group and relied on patient self-reports of compliance, the results were better than those typically seen with conservative treatments, including bracing. More study is needed to see if greater improvements would occur with continuing practice and whether the benefits are maintained when the exercises are reduced or stopped. If you have (or suspect you have) scoliosis, you should be medically evaluated. If you want to try the yoga poses, they should be done, at least initially, under the supervision of a physiatrist, physical therapist, or other health care practitioner who is trained in the treatment of spinal disorders and also specifically knowledgeable about yoga practices, since it’s critical that each pose be done with correct form and on the proper side. If done on the wrong side, they could worsen the curves, as was seen in one young study participant (though this was reversed when she corrected the mistake). The poses can be modified for people with weakness, severe arthritis, shoulder instability, or other issues—but if you have severe scoliosis, you should be under the care of a specialist and follow his or her advice about yoga. This research is still preliminary and needs to be replicated in more people. But in the meantime, something as simple as this is worth dis­cussing with your spine specialist.

eb083ed4-0771-4529-b51a-c164d897b13b,"Your Posture While Breastfeeding Actually Matters. Here’s Why — Starting your breastfeeding journey is an exciting time for you and baby. But poor posture while nursing can quickly become a big pain in the neck. With the possibility of sore and cracked , , and , there’s a lot to figure out as you perfect your breastfeeding routine. So it’s not surprising that breastfeeding posture falls to the bottom of the priority list — if you’re even aware of it at all. is a super important part of one’s well-being and can have a huge effect on your day-to-day life. Poor posture can cause back and neck pain, headaches, and even low energy levels. There are you can do to fix common posture issues caused by prolonged sitting, poor shoe choice, and even scrolling through Instagram. But many new moms are unaware that they’ve developed breastfeeding posture habits to begin with, and aren’t sure how to fix them once they realize it. your baby introduces a new set of habitual movements that can throw your body into imbalance and cause aches and pains. Many breastfeeding women experience neck pain, mid back pain, and tension headaches from incorrect breastfeeding posture, but don’t have the knowledge or resources necessary to correct it and restore balance to their bodies. “Not fixing your breastfeeding posture can have a dramatic implication on your [postpartum] recovery,” says , PT, DPT, founder and owner of and . Howald says improper breastfeeding posture often negatively impacts rib positioning, which can not only delay pelvic floor recovery postpartum, but also worsen and make it harder to lessen the appearance of that postpartum belly. “Where our ribs are [positioned] has a lot to do with how our diaphragm functions, which has a lot to do with healing your pelvic floor. If your diaphragm isn’t lined up well because of poor rib positioning, you won’t be able to automate your system [and strengthen your pelvic floor],” she says. With the amount of feedings needed for your baby (or babies!), you might spend in a position that puts unnecessary stress on your body. And unfortunately, the longer it takes you to correct the habit, the longer you might feel aches and pains — even after you finish breastfeeding. Howald recommends getting started with the proper breastfeeding posture as soon as possible to prevent any stubborn imbalances from forming. Here’s what she recommends as an ideal setup for you and your little one: Scoot your butt all the way back on the chair or couch. If you can’t touch your feet to the floor with your butt all the way back, use a pillow for extra support. Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears. Bring your baby to your breast rather than bending over to bring your breast to your baby. Howald recommends using a breastfeeding pillow to achieve this. If the pillow doesn’t bring your baby close enough, you may need to use an extra towel or pillow to tilt your baby’s head toward your breast. We know it’s hard, but avoid staring down at your babe the entire time. Too much neck flexion puts a lot of stress on your neck and back. Instead, try to keep your head neutral or even incorporate a simple neck extension exercise. Keep in mind that it’s really important that you’re actually able to relax while feeding, which Howald says can only be achieved with the proper setup. “[Your muscles] shouldn’t be so tense. It’s all about the setup — where the pillow is, having a rolled up towel that you can stick underneath one side so that your posture is mainly done through the setup. Taking the time to set this up correctly can put your body so much more at ease,” she says. What else can I do to avoid aches and pains caused by breastfeeding? Howald stresses the importance of strengthening your back, shoulder, and neck muscles to truly combat the pain that can come with breastfeeding. “During pregnancy, we’re already pulled forward because of the weight of the baby in the front. So when you go to breastfeed postpartum, the shoulders are still rounded forward,” she says. “Muscles are all about a length-tension relationship. If a muscle is too stretched out, it will spasm and burn, which is what a lot of breastfeeding moms feel.” So while many new moms feel the urge to stretch out the burning and spasming muscles in their back and neck, the actual problem likely comes from a lack of strength. “I could go to a chiropractor, I could have a massage therapist massage my back, and my back will still hurt because the muscles still have a poor length-tension relationship. They’ve been overstretched and overworked,” she says. If you’re expecting or already a breastfeeding mom, here are some example exercises Howald recommends for strengthening your neck and back and safeguarding your body from pain associated with breastfeeding. It can take 4 to 6 weeks of building muscle before you see the benefit of , so stick with it to start finding relief! Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping a slight bend in your knees. Bend over at your waist, engaging your core and keeping your back straight and head neutral. Engage your shoulder blades, anchoring them down and back. (This makes sure you’re not using your upper trap muscles to carry the weight). Keeping your arms straight, raise your arms up to make the letter ‘T.’ Pro tip: If you can’t keep your form with weights in your hand, drop ’em! Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping a slight bend in your knees. Bend over at your waist, engaging your core and keeping your back straight and head neutral. Engage your shoulder blades, anchoring them down and back. Start with your arms hanging straight down in front of you and then bend your elbows to lift the dumbbells up toward your side. Stop when the dumbbells reach your waist, squeezing through your shoulder blades. Pro tip: Keep your elbows close to your rib cage throughout the whole movement. This exercise will follow the same directions as above, but alternating the row one arm at a time. Lie down on your side and hold a dumbbell in the hand of your top arm. Engage your shoulder blade by anchoring it down and back. Keeping your arm glued to your side, raise the dumbbell up toward the ceiling by rotating your arm. When you reach the top of the exercise, give your shoulder blade an extra squeeze. Pro tip: You can use a rolled up towel under your elbow for extra support. For a more in-depth look at exercises you can do to strengthen your body for breastfeeding (and basically all of motherhood), check out Howald’s and workout guides. Before starting any new exercise or training program — particularly if you’ve recently given birth, are currently pregnant, or have underlying conditions — you should speak with your OB or a doctor. “There are so many physical and emotional challenges that go into being a new mother that are so unexpected, so knowing what you can control going into motherhood to ease tension on your body is so valuable,” says Howald.

The key to good back posture is to keep the right amount of in your lower back. A healthy back has three natural front-to-back curves that give the spine an ""S"" shape. Too much curve (swayback) or too little curve (flat back) can result in problems. The right amount of curve is called the neutral position.

95013f96-1d39-4ea5-8370-e9956ccd8dec,"— Your is more prone to chronic pain and discomfort than most other parts of your body. In fact, low back pain affects around of people at some point in their life. Swayback posture is a particular type of poor posture that often leads to lower back pain. People who exhibit swayback posture have exaggerated curves in their spine, forward-tilting hips, and the appearance of leaning back when standing. Here’s a look at what swayback posture is, what may cause it, and how it can be treated, including several exercises you can do. is a common pattern of posture dysfunction that differs from normal posture in the following ways: Your hips and pelvis are tilted forward in front of your head line. The forward shift of your pelvis causes an exaggerated inward curve in your lower back or lumbar spine; this is known as lordosis. It also causes an exaggerated outward curve in your upper back; this is called . The misalignment of your spine and pelvis from swayback posture can put you at an increased risk of developing back and hip injuries. It can also contribute to musculoskeletal injuries in other parts of your body that are forced into a compromised position, such as your neck and shoulders. Poor posture can also put pressure on your internal organs. This may lead to such as: is an exaggerated curve of your spine. Some lordosis in your lumbar spine is normal, but excessive curvature is what’s often referred to as swayback. The most common type of lordosis is lumbar lordosis. This is where your lower back becomes more curved than it should. Lumbar lordosis is one of the features of swayback posture. However, some people may have lordosis without swayback posture if they don’t exhibit the other features. Swayback posture is often caused by tight hamstrings and back muscles, weak abdominal muscles, and laxity in certain ligaments in the back and pelvis. Sitting for long periods of time may cause these muscles to tighten. Over time, if not properly stretched, they can become stiff and weak. Sitting for many hours with poor posture may also turn off your stabilizing muscles, such as your glutes and abdominals. When these muscles aren’t activated, it can lead to weakness over time — and this can also contribute to swayback posture. Other factors that can contribute to swayback posture include: Hip conditions like developmental dysplasia, where the ball and the socket of the hip doesn’t fully form, can lead to restrictions that contribute to posture issues. is a relatively uncommon disorder that causes inflammation of the discs between your vertebrae. It can be caused by , as well as viral and bacterial infections. Conditions like Scheuermann’s kyphosis can cause abnormal growth of the vertebrae, which in turn can lead to a range of motion limitations. With , one of your vertebrae slips forward from the vertebra beneath it. It can occur in people of all ages, and the hallmark symptom is persistent pain in your lower back. Traumatic injuries, such as sports or motor vehicle accidents, can cause permanent damage to your spine that restrict your range of motion. People with neuromuscular conditions like or sometimes exhibit swayback posture. A found that young adults with obesity have poor postural stability and are at an increased risk of lordosis due partially to increased abdominal fat. In the absence of any other health conditions that may be a contributing factor, swayback posture can be treated by lengthening tight muscles, such as your hip muscles and hamstrings, and strengthening weak muscles, such as your abdominals. Before starting a treatment program, it’s a good idea to get a proper assessment from a physical therapist or other trained professional. Your physical therapist can assess your posture and tell you specifically which muscles need stretching and strengthening. However, it’s also important to know what caused your poor posture in the first place. If you don’t know what led to your swayback posture, you won’t be able to target the root of the problem. As a result, your posture may deviate back into swayback as soon as you stop doing your stretches and exercises. If you have obesity, losing weight — especially around your abdomen — may help you improve the exaggerated curve in your lower back. If you spend a lot of time sitting at a desk each day, you may benefit from taking more frequent breaks or using a standing desk for part of the day instead of sitting. The following three exercises are among many that can help strengthen weak muscles that often contribute to swayback posture. The plank can help strengthen your abdominal muscles, glutes, shoulders, and upper back. Lie facedown on a comfortable surface like a yoga mat. Push yourself up onto your toes and palms, with your body in a straight line from your head to your ankles. If this is too intense, try starting with a low plank: Lift up just onto your forearms instead of straightening your arms all the way. Keep your abdominals and glutes braced as you hold this position. Hold for at least 30 seconds. Increase the time as you get stronger. This exercise can help strengthen your core muscles and glutes. Start by lying on your back, with your knees bent at 90 degrees and your arms flat against the ground by your sides. Turn your feet out slightly. Push into the ground with your feet and lift your hips by squeezing your glutes, until there’s a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Pause for a couple of seconds, then return to the starting position. Do one to two sets of 15 reps to start. Try to work up to three sets as you build your core strength. This exercise helps strengthen the muscles in your upper back and shoulders. Stand while holding a resistance band tightly between your hands. Raise your hands in front of you so that they’re shoulder-width apart and parallel with the ground. Pull the band apart while squeezing your shoulders together, until your arms are stretched out by your sides. Pause for a moment, then return to the start position Do one to two sets of 15 reps to start. Try to work up to three sets as you build your upper body strength. Swayback posture is one of the most common types of postural misalignments. It’s characterized by hips that are pushed forward, exaggerated curves in the spine, and the appearance of leaning back when you’re standing. Swayback posture is often caused by muscle weakness and tightness. A physical therapist can provide you with an individualized plan to help you strengthen and stretch key muscles and maintain good postural habits. If you’re not sure if you have swayback posture or what caused it, be sure to see your doctor for a diagnosis. — Core and Hip Exercises to Correct Lordosis Posture Medically reviewed by Certain exercises to strengthen your hamstring, glutes, and core can help improve lordosis posture and ease pain.

68943343-5f37-47e1-b4e0-fd17df65a79e,"Kyphosis (pronounced: kye-FOH-sis) is a condition affecting the back. It makes the back rounded so it looks hunched over. Sometimes the rounding is hard to see. Other times it's more noticeable. Some teens can't straighten their curve by standing up and some can. Some teens with kyphosis have back pain.  The signs of kyphosis often become obvious during the growth spurt that happens around puberty. This means someone is born with it. Even though it has been there since birth, sometimes it isn't noticed until a teen has done a lot of growing. Teens who slouch over a lot can develop a rounded back. The muscles and bones get used to being hunched over. Teens with this type of kyphosis can straighten their curve by standing up. Viewed from the side, normal vertebrae look like stacked rectangles. In Scheuermann's kyphosis, the vertebrae are triangles, or wedge shaped. This makes the spine hunch forward. Kids with this kind of kyphosis aren't able to straighten their curve by standing up straight. Doctors don't know exactly why some kids are born with this. This happens to many people, especially those who look down a lot of time, such as at schoolwork or a phone. Doctors don't know the exact cause, but it runs in families. examine the spine: while you stand, bend from the waist, and lie down Someone with kyphosis will see an (a specialist who treats conditions involving the bones). The orthopedist will examine the spine, look at the X-rays, and recommend treatment. Postural kyphosis is treated with to improve posture. Exercises can strengthen the back muscles to help them better support the spine. For congenital and Scheuermann's kyphosis, treatment options include: This means routine checkups to make sure the rounding isn't starting to cause problems. Treatment might not be needed. Most cases will stop progressing when teens are done growing. Sometimes specialists recommend a back brace. This brace is like a jacket that can be worn under clothes. It won't straighten the curve, but for some kids and teens it could keep the curve from getting worse. Some wear the brace only at night while others might wear it for 18–20 hours a day. The brace is usually worn until someone stops growing. Exercises that strengthen the muscles in the back and abdomen to better support the spine can sometimes help. Surgery isn't usually needed. But doctors might recommend a procedure called a for a severe case that causes pain, or to prevent problems in the future. If you have back pain or notice a rounded upper back, talk to your parent about seeing your doctor or nurse. Reviewed by: and Note: All information is for educational purposes only.

0ea86f22-f67b-4ade-83d3-c2bf9e73b377,"from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Kyphosis is a spinal disorder in which an excessive outward curve of the spine results in an abnormal rounding of the upper back. The condition is sometimes known as ""roundback"" or—in the case of a severe curve—as ""hunchback."" Kyphosis can occur at any age, but is common during adolescence. In the majority of cases, kyphosis causes few problems and does not require treatment. Occasionally, a patient may need to wear a back brace or do exercises in order to improve his or her posture and strengthen the spine. In severe cases, however, kyphosis can be painful, cause significant spinal deformity, and lead to breathing problems. Patients with severe kyphosis may need surgery to help reduce the excessive spinal curve and improve their symptoms. Your spine is made up of three segments. When viewed from the side, these segments form three natural curves. The ""c-shaped"" curves of the neck (cervical spine) and lower back (lumbar spine) are called lordosis. The ""reverse c-shaped"" curve of the chest (thoracic spine) is called kyphosis. This natural curvature of the spine is important for balance and helps us to stand upright. If any one of the curves becomes too large or too small, it becomes difficult to stand up straight and our posture appears abnormal. When viewed from the side, a normal spine has three gentle curves. The spine is made up of 24 small rectangular-shaped bones, called vertebrae, which are stacked on top of one another. These bones create the natural curves of your back and connect to create a canal that protects the spinal cord. Vertebrae and intervertebral disks in a healthy spine. In between the vertebrae are flexible intervertebral disks. These disks are flat and round and about a half inch thick. Intervertebral disks cushion the vertebrae and act as shock absorbers when you walk or run. Although the thoracic spine should have a natural kyphosis between 20 to 45 degrees, postural or structural abnormalities can result in a curve that is outside this normal range. While the medical term for a curve that is greater than normal (more than 50 degrees) is actually ""hyperkyphosis,"" the term ""kyphosis"" is commonly used by doctors to refer to the clinical condition of excessive curvature in the thoracic spine that leads to a rounded upper back. Kyphosis can affect patients of all ages. The condition, however, is common during adolescence—a time of rapid bone growth. Kyphosis can vary in severity. In general, the greater the curve, the more serious the condition. Milder curves may cause mild back pain or no symptoms at all. More severe curves can cause significant spinal deformity and result in a visible hump on the patient's back. There are several types of kyphosis. The three that most commonly affect children and adolescents are: Postural kyphosis, the most common type of kyphosis, usually becomes noticeable during adolescence. It is noticed clinically as poor posture or slouching, but is not associated with severe structural abnormalities of the spine. The curve caused by postural kyphosis is typically round and smooth and can often be corrected by the patient when he or she is asked to ""stand up straight."" Postural kyphosis is more common in girls than boys. It is rarely painful and, because the curve does not progress, it does not usually lead to problems in adult life. Scheuermann's kyphosis is named after the Danish radiologist who first described the condition. Like postural kyphosis, Scheuermann's kyphosis often becomes apparent during the teen years. However, Scheuermann's kyphosis can result in a significantly more severe deformity than postural kyphosis—particularly in thin patients. Scheuermann's kyphosis is caused by a structural abnormality in the spine. In a patient with Scheuermann's kyphosis, an x-ray from the side will show that, rather than the normal rectangular shape, several consecutive vertebrae have a more triangular shape. This irregular shape causes the vertebrae to wedge together toward the front of the spine, decreasing the normal disk space and creating an exaggerated forward curvature in the upper back. Illustration and x-ray show the vertebral wedging that occurs in patients with Scheuermann's kyphosis. (Right) Reproduced from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010 The curve caused by Scheuermann's kyphosis is usually sharp and angular. It is also stiff and rigid; unlike a patient with postural kyphosis, a patient with Scheuermann's kyphosis is not able to correct the curve by standing up straight. Scheuermann's kyphosis usually affects the thoracic spine, but occasionally develops in the lumbar (lower) spine. The condition is more common in boys than girls and stops progressing once growing is complete. Scheuermann's kyphosis can sometimes be painful. If pain is present, it is commonly felt at the highest part or ""apex"" of the curve. Pain may also be felt in the lower back. This results when the spine tries to compensate for the rounded upper back by increasing the natural inward curve of the lower back. Activity can make the pain worse, as can long periods of standing or sitting. Clinical photos of an adolescent male show an abnormally rounded upper back. His severe kyphosis is most obvious when bending forward. Courtesy of Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children Congenital kyphosis is present at birth. It occurs when the spinal column fails to develop normally while the baby is in utero. The bones may not form as they should or several vertebrae may be fused together. Congenital kyphosis typically worsens as the child ages. Patients with congenital kyphosis often need surgical treatment at a very young age to stop progression of the curve. Many times, these patients will have additional birth defects that impact other parts of the body such as the heart and kidneys. () Clinical photo of a child with congenital kyphosis in his thoracic spine. () An MRI of his spine shows spinal cord compression. This can lead to neurological symptoms like weakness and numbness in the legs. Courtesy of Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children The signs and symptoms of kyphosis vary, depending upon the cause and severity of the curve. These may include: Tight hamstrings (the muscles in the back of the thigh) Rarely, over time, progressive curves may lead to: Shortness of breath or other breathing difficulties Mild kyphosis often goes unnoticed until a scoliosis screening at school—and this prompts a visit to the doctor. If changes to the patient's back are noticeable, however, it is usually quite troubling for both the parents and the child. Concern about the cosmetic appearance of the child's back is often what leads the family to seek medical help. Your doctor will begin by taking a medical history and asking about your child's general health and symptoms. He or she will then examine your child's back, pressing on the spine to determine if there are any areas of tenderness. In more severe cases of kyphosis, the rounding of the upper back or a hump may be clearly visible. In milder cases, however, the condition may be harder to diagnose. During the exam, your doctor will ask your child to bend forward with both feet together, knees straight, and arms hanging free. This test, which is called the ""Adam's forward bend test,"" enables your doctor to better see the slope of the spine and observe any spinal deformity. To assess for a curve, your doctor will ask your child to bend forward at the waist. Reproduced from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010 Your doctor may also ask your child to lay down to see if this straightens the curve—a sign that the curve is flexible and may be representative of postural kyphosis. These studies provide images of dense structures, such as bone. Your doctor may order x-rays from different angles to determine if there are changes in the vertebrae or any other bony abnormalities. X-rays will also help measure the degree of the kyphotic curve. A curve that is greater than 50 degrees is considered abnormal. If the curve is severe, your doctor may order pulmonary function tests. These tests will help determine if your child's breathing is restricted because of diminished chest space. In patients with congenital kyphosis, progressive curves may lead to symptoms of spinal cord compression, including pain, tingling, numbness, or weakness in the lower body. If your child is experiencing any of these symptoms, your doctor may order neurologic tests or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The goal of treatment is to stop progression of the curve and prevent deformity. Your doctor will consider several things when determining treatment for kyphosis, including: Nonsurgical treatment is recommended for patients with postural kyphosis. It is also recommended for patients with Scheuermann's kyphosis who have curves of less than 75 degrees. Your doctor may recommend simply monitoring the curve to make sure it does not get worse. Your child may be asked to return for periodic visits and x-rays until he or she is fully grown. Unless the curve gets worse or becomes painful, no other treatment may be needed. Specific exercises can help relieve back pain and improve posture by strengthening muscles in the abdomen and back. Certain exercises can also help stretch tight hamstrings and strengthen areas of the body that may be impacted by misalignment of the spine. NSAIDs, including aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, can help relieve back pain. Bracing may be recommended for patients with Scheuermann's kyphosis who are still growing. The specific type of brace and the number of hours per day it should be worn will depend upon the severity of the curve. Your doctor will adjust the brace regularly as the curve improves. Typically, the brace is worn until the child reaches skeletal maturity and growing is complete. () This patient has a 65° curve in the thoracic spine. () Although it cannot be seen on x-ray, the patient is now wearing a back brace that has helped to reduce the excessive curve. Reproduced from Pizzutillo PD: Nonsurgical treatment of kyphosis. Instructional Course Lectures, Pediatrics. Rosemont IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2006, pp. 181-187. Surgery is often recommended for patients with congenital kyphosis. Patients with Scheuermann's kyphosis who have curves greater than 75 degrees Patients with severe back pain that does not improve with nonsurgical treatment Spinal fusion is the surgical procedure most commonly used to treat kyphosis. Spinal fusion is essentially a ""welding"" process. The basic idea is to fuse together the affected vertebrae so that they heal into a single, solid bone. Fusing the vertebrae will reduce the degree of the curve and, because it eliminates motion between the affected vertebrae, may also help alleviate back pain. During the procedure, the vertebrae that make up the curve are first realigned to reduce the rounding of the spine. Small pieces of bone—called bone graft—are then placed into the spaces between the vertebrae to be fused. Over time, the bones grow together—similar to how a broken bone heals. Before the bone graft is placed, your doctor will typically use metal screws, plates and rods to increase the rate of fusion and further stabilize the spine. Exactly how much of the spine is fused depends upon the size of your child's curve. Only the curved vertebrae are fused together. The other bones in the spine can still move and assist with bending, straightening, and rotation. () Preoperative x-ray of a 17-year-old boy with a painful 80° curve caused by Scheuermann's kyphosis. () After spinal fusion and stabilization with plates and screws, the curve has been reduced to 38°.

J Am Acad Orthop Surg 2012; 20:113-121 If kyphosis is diagnosed early, the majority of patients can be treated successfully without surgery and go on to lead active, healthy lives. If left untreated, however, curve progression could potentially lead to problems during adulthood. For patients with kyphosis, regular check-ups are necessary to monitor the condition and check progression of the curve.

8fa1d6d7-efd1-486d-b1d3-2e6f235d62ac,"Three out of every four Americans will experience low back pain at some time in their lives. Most back injuries are the result of repetitive trauma to the spine after years of bending, twisting and lifting improperly. Even though your back may go out when you reach down to pick up a pencil, it’s not that one activity that caused the problem. It’s usually the straw that broke the camel’s back! Your spine consists of vertebrae stacked on top of each other, separated by discs which act as shock absorbers. Think of your discs as jelly donuts, with a gel-like substance inside that cushions the shock of pounding, running and bending. People most commonly experience back pain when they strain the low back muscles or ligaments. Sometimes small tears occur in the discs or the gel substance leaks out and puts pressure on surrounding nerves. You may also experience back pain from a variety of other causes. Your doctor will diagnose the source of your pain to decide upon the most effective strategies for healing. Preventing and Alleviating Pain and Strain on Your Back Your spine is not straight. It has three natural curves that actually make it ten times stronger! One of the most important things you can do to treat and prevent back pain is to maintain the natural curves of your back while standing, sitting and working. This is called good posture and body mechanics. Certain elements of fitness also play an important role in back health. Often when your back is hurting, you are forced into good posture and body mechanics because it’s the only way you feel comfortable. Be good to your back! Keep up the healthy habits and exercises taught to you by your doctor or therapist. If you are getting weaker, if your pain is increasing, if you feel numbness and tingling in your legs or buttocks, if pain radiates into your hip or leg, you should definitely see your doctor. There are a number of treatments that your doctor may suggest including medications, bracing, physical therapy, epidural injections, facet injections, trigger point injections or surgery. When standing, an imaginary vertical line should connect your ears, shoulders, hips, knees and ankles. Try to pull your shoulders comfortably back. Don’t lock your knees. Stand with your feet straight ahead or slightly turned out. Maintain a normal (not flat or exaggerated) curve in your low back. Remember when your mother said ""Don’t slouch! Stand up straight""? She was right! Sit in a firm, straight-back chair with your buttocks all the way back. Consider using a lumbar pillow or lumbar support to help you maintain your low back curve while sitting or driving. Do NOT sit or stay in the same position for prolonged periods of time. Every 15-30 minutes stand up and perform a back extension exercise. Stand with your hands in the small of your back, feet shoulder width apart and lean back until you feel a stretch. Repeat a few times. See picture at left. Check your chair at work. You should be able to rest your elbows on your arm supports. Reclining or leaning back reduces stress on the lumbar spine. If you need to recline, keep the curve in your low back. PRESERVE THE CURVE! To get out of a chair, slide forward without slouching, then stand up. Lie on your side with your legs comfortably bent. A pillow between your knees may make you more comfortable. Lie on your back with your legs straight. If that’s uncomfortable, try bending your legs and placing a pillow under your knees. When you get up from sleeping, roll onto your side first, then push yourself up with your arms. Keep an upright back. Avoid forward bending whenever possible. If you must pick up something from the ground, even something as light as a pen, use your legs (bending at your knees and hips) and keep your chest upright. Squat down or kneel on one knee to pick something up. Tighten your stomach muscles. Keep a wide base of support. If you must lean forward, bend where your legs meet your trunk (at your hips), NOT at your waist. Holds objects close to you. When you’re carrying an object, hold it close to you. When your arms are outstretched you are putting 10 times more stress on your back than when you are working close to your body. For example, squat down to pick up a child, hug him/her, then stand up together. Or pull a box to the end of the shelf and stand as close as possible to it before lifting it up. Avoid twisting. Twisting puts a lot of pressure on the discs in your spine. Always point your feet in the direction that you’re moving. Pivot with your legs instead of letting your back take the stress. For example, when shoveling snow, turn your hips and shoulders from one direction to the other, instead of standing flat-footed and twisting your back. Tightness in the following muscles can put a lot of extra strain on your low back: hamstrings (back of thigh), quadriceps (front of thigh) and hip flexors (front of thigh). Performing regular stretching exercises for these and other muscles can reduce pressure on your spine and help eliminate back pain. Strong muscles surrounding your spine can protect your back from injury. A physical therapist can teach you how to strengthen your stomach, lower and upper back muscles, as well as improve your leg, buttocks and arm strength so you don’t need to ""muscle"" things with your back. Overall stamina and muscle endurance promote back health. Cardiovascular exercise can increase the flow of blood and other nutrients to your back. Follow your doctor’s advice about which activities are best for you. You may want to avoid high impact activities such as jogging or aerobics while you’re healing from your injury. Too much fat weight, particularly around your stomach, can put extra stress on your back. Regular exercise and a healthy diet can get you back on track.

44031b8e-8cd2-412c-a9c6-b4d7413397f8,"If you suffer from , you know how this pain can affect your life every day. Spinal stenosis is a debilitating condition that causes excruciating pain to radiate from the lower back down the legs. It causes more pain while standing, rather than sitting. And, this pain is sometimes so intense as to make your daily life impossible. The best course of treatment you can find is a comprehensive pain management plan that addresses both acute symptoms of pain as well as the underlying cause. Even as you and your doctor work through a proper diagnosis and more interventional options, there are spinal stenosis exercises and stretches that can help. We’ll be focusing on low-impact activities to reduce pain, spinal stenosis exercises to strengthen the core, and stretches to relieve tension. It’s important to note that these spinal stenosis exercises should only be done after a thorough consultation with your doctor. Improper exercise can cause more pain and may make the condition worse. High impact activities or activities that require you to stand for long periods of time could also cause more pain. Additionally, the saying “no pain, no gain” does not apply here. These spinal stenosis exercises are meant to gradually and gently build strength and foster flexibility. Trying to gain strength while bones are pressing into a nerve may be next to impossible. The best spinal stenosis exercises either reduce tension through light stretching or activity, or help strengthen the core. Further, while isolated exercises like these can help increase flexibility and strengthen the muscles supporting the spine, some of the best spinal stenosis exercises work to increase strength and flexibility in the whole body. Low-impact exercises can help relieve pain and add length and strength to the spine. The supportive nature of these types of spinal stenosis exercises allows virtually anyone to access their benefits. These best ones include: Shorter and frequent walks, as long walks can exacerbate pain Remember that talking to your doctor is the first step in deciding which spinal stenosis exercises are right for you. Working through pain and pushing too hard can result in further injury, so take your time and listen to your body as you exercise. When people feel pain, their first inclination is often to stretch the area. However, many times pain develops from muscle weakness, and stretching exacerbates the problem. One possible solution then is to build core strength through yoga. Back pain is probably the most common example of this tendency, and it’s one of the best candidates for relief through yoga. Most types of back pain, including spinal stenosis, result from some combination of poor posture and sedentary living. By incorporating specific strengthening and stretching exercises into your routine, you could very well substantially reduce your pain. This process of stretching and strengthening core strength creates balance, reducing pain in areas of chronic discomfort, but also helping to rehabilitate injured muscles. The core muscles include those in the abdomen and back, however the core muscles aren’t just the superficial muscles that give a person six-pack abs. They’re also the muscles deep inside the body that, when strong, support the spine and hold the central core of the body together. Because many of these muscles lie so deep within the body, common exercises like crunches, that work only the top layer of stomach muscles, don’t work the core. We’ll explore some of those that do later in this post. Stretching the back can help bring space between the vertebrae to offer pain relief. Lie on your back with knees bent and feet on the floor. Inhale deeply, then on an exhale, bring your knees into your chest and wrap your arms around them. Breathe deeply and hold this position for 30 seconds. Release and repeat four to six times. If placing your feet on the floor with knees bent is too painful, this exercise can also be completed while lying on the side in the fetal position. Come to hands and knees with toes untucked, hands directly beneath your shoulders and knees below your hips. Aim your tailbone towards the wall behind you and the crown of your head to the wall in front of you. You should feel your low belly and abdomen engage when you complete these two actions. Inhale deeply, and on a long, slow exhale, sink your hips back to your heels, keeping your arms extended out in front of you. You can open your knees wide, bringing your toes to touch if that feels more comfortable, or you can keep your thighs together. If you feel pain or pressure on your knees as you sink back, place a folded blanket or a pillow behind your knees. You can also place a block between your ankles to lift your hips up but still allow you to rest. With each exhale, let your chest sink down towards the ground, resting either on your thighs or between your thighs if your knees are apart. Breathe into this stretch for five deep breaths, then slowly rise up. Repeat for pain relief as needed, four to six times per day. This spinal stenosis exercise can be completed standing, seated, or on all fours. Whichever you choose, let your breath initiate each movement. Stand with feet slightly wider than hip’s width distance. Bend your knees slightly and place your hands just above your knees. On an inhale, push your sitting bones out behind you like you are trying to close a drawer as your chest comes forward between your arms and your raise your face to the sky. Exhale and drop your tailbone down, as you push out of your hands and arch your upper back like a Halloween cat. Sit comfortably on a chair with feet flat on the ground, tailbone reaching down to the floor beneath the chair and crown of the head reaching to the sky. Place your hands on your knees, and on an inhale, stretch your sitting bones up and back as your chest reaches through your arms, curving your lumbar spine. Exhale and push away from your knees as you curl your tailbone under, arching your upper back. Start on hands and knees with hands directly beneath shoulders and knees below hips. Inhale and let your belly drop towards the ground as you open your chest forward and lift your face to the sky. Exhale, curving your tailbone down and forward as you push the floor beneath you away and arch your back. Whichever position you choose, make the movement as fluid and slow as you can, following your breath. Aim for five complete rounds of cat/cow twice daily. The following video shows how to do this pose safely. Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Inhale deeply. On the exhale, press your navel towards the floor, contracting the muscles of your abdomen. Hold your breath out (and this contraction) for ten seconds, then release. Complete this exercise five to ten times. Full sit-ups put too much pressure on the spine and are often performed incorrectly in a way that doesn’t provide much benefit. Curl-ups work the muscles of the lower abdomen without placing excess strain on the lower back. Lie on your back with knees bent and feet on the floor. Cross your arms over your chest. On an exhale and with a flat back, raise just your head and shoulders off the floor and hold for three seconds. Lower on the inhale. It is important to maintain a strong, supported back in this exercise, so think of letting your heart lead the movement instead of pushing with your lower back. As your strength increases, aim for two to four sets of ten curl-ups each. The following video from Elder Gym gives an example of how to do this safely. When rehabilitating an injury, it’s important to both stretch and strengthen. While muscle weakness may have contributed to the original trauma, weakness undoubtedly develops while the body rests as it heals. Yoga is particularly good for developing this balance of strength and flexibility.This deceptively simple posture gently stretches and strengthens the back while firing up the core. It’s a foundational posture in yoga, used in many beginner classes and is an excellent way to warm up the body for more rigorous postures at any level. Come to all fours, with the knees underneath the hips and wrists underneath the shoulders. Line the wrists up to the front edge of the mat, spread the fingers wide, and press firmly down into the base of your index finger. Inhale and reach the right leg straight behind you. If it feels good, extend the left arm, as well. Exhale, round the back and bring the knee toward the forehead. If using the arms, connect the elbow to the knee. Inhale and return to starting position. Repeat this exercise five to seven times before switching to the other side. Keep in mind that some yoga postures may stress the back or other areas of pain in your body. Practice with care and only do those exercises that feel good. These three exercises for spinal stenosis from Superior Physical Therapy is an informative video. In it, they demonstrate a few movements that can help reduce your symptoms. This standing pose stretches and strengthens the hamstrings while building core strength. Although one hand grazes the floor in the full expression of the pose, that hand ideally bears no weight. A good way to keep the core engaged is to leave the fingers dangling a few centimeters off the floor. Engaging the core in this way, triangle pose becomes a strong core-building posture. Stand tall at the front of the mat, feet firmly pressing into the ground. Step a few feet back with the right foot, lining the back edge of the foot up to the back edge of the mat. Line the front heel up with the arch of the back foot. Inhale, lift the arms up parallel to the floor, keeping the legs straight. Exhale and reach forward before lowering the left arm down toward the floor. If the floor is far away, feel free to rest the fingers on a block or the shin. To amplify the core-building effects, don’t rest the fingers on anything, instead engaging the core fully to maintain the body’s position. Stay here and breathe, keeping the heart open and torso long, as if pressing your body against an imaginary pane of glass behind you. Take five to seven breaths and then do the other side. Planks are another foundational posture, this is an excellent gentle, yet fiery way to build core strength. If you have weak wrists, you can use your elbows to prop you up during these poses, or use one or both knees on the ground if staying up is too difficult. The most important thing in these spinal stenosis exercises is to keep the core firm and your back straight. Start on all fours, hips over knees and shoulders over wrists. Straighten one leg and then the other, tucking the toes under your feet, so your body forms a long line. Engage through the abdomen and core, hugging the body in so it doesn’t sag. It’s common for people to dip the hips or lift them up too high to make the posture easier. Aim for a solid, straight line. You may want to practice in front of a mirror or with a friend to ensure proper form. Stay here and breathe for 30 seconds, working up to as long as three minutes. Start from a plank position, with the wrists underneath the shoulders and legs straight behind you, toes tucked under. Shift your weight onto the right hand and outer edge of the right foot, turning the body so it’s perpendicular to the floor. Stack the left foot on top of the right, or place it on the ground while keeping both legs straight. A modification is to bend the left knee and place the foot on the ground in front of your right knee. Lift the left arm up to the sky, keeping the gaze on the floor or gently turning the neck to gaze at the sky. Whichever option you choose, make sure it feels good in the neck. Stay here for three to five breaths. Repeat on the other side. 13-15. Physical therapy exercises for spinal stenosis Finally, this great video from a pair of shows three spinal stenosis exercises and techniques you can use to help ease your pain. If you suffer from spinal stenosis, exercise alone probably won’t help relieve your condition entirely. You may also need to incorporate physical therapy, chiropractic care, or even more interventional options to beat your pain. The first step you need to take is getting a proper diagnosis so you can get started on activities that will work right for you. Talk to a pain doctor today for more information.

c1fa0a47-36d9-469e-b02d-f99674c9e7d1,"How to improve gait and balance function in elderly individuals—compliance with principles of training How to improve gait and balance function in elderly individuals—compliance with principles of training , –() Most balance training regimens for elderly individuals focus on self-controlled exercises, although automatic postural responses after a balance perturbation are not under direct volitional control. We critically review the literature on this topic, and notice that several studies fail to comply with basic principles of training and therefore show little improvement in function. Some present the view that physical function in the too frail and too fit cannot be improved, which we instead argue would be the effect of nonspecific training programs. We propose a concept for balance training that incorporates voluntary exercises as well as perturbation and dual-task exercises to improve balance control. The program is performed on five different levels where levels 1–4 exercises focus on the skill to maintain balance and level 5 adds perturbation exercises that focus on the skill to recover balance as well as dual task exercises providing a cognitive load during execution of a balance motor task. Functional requirements for muscle strength and power are directly incorporated into the program. The feasibility of the concept has been demonstrated on elderly fallers. A randomized control trial is underway to investigate the effects on healthy elderly individuals. Further intervention studies using this concept are encouraged. Balance control is a foundation of our ability to move and function independently. A deterioration of balance function, as a consequence of disease or simply increasing age, will increase the occurrence of clinical balance problems as well as the risk of balance loss and falls. Falls are the leading cause of accidental death in the elderly population with more than 11,000 deaths as a result of falls each year [] and hip fractures being the leading fall-related injury that causes prolonged hospitalization []. Hip fracture survivors experience a 10 to 15% decrease in life expectancy and a significant decline in overall quality of life []. Early ambulation after hip fracture, however, has been shown to be directly predictive of extended survival [] indicating the importance of effective rehabilitation techniques that target balance function and early mobility. Unfortunately, a common view in the literature, as stated in a recent review study [], is that physical function in individuals who are either “too frail” or “too fit” cannot be improved with training implying that rehabilitation for some patients as well as preventive training of healthy individuals would be futile. A contrary interpretation would be that a number of studies, aiming to improve function, have not complied with basic principles of physical training and exercise by assuming that strength training per se improves balance function. This is a view that is supported in a Cochrane Review by Latham et al. [] of 62 randomized control trials including a total of 3,674 subjects showing no statistically significant effects of progressive strength training in elderly subjects on objective clinical measures of balance function (Berg Balance Score, Timed Up and Go, and Timed position holding), or on physical disability measures []. Additional support for the view that strength training does not improve balance function on its own is provided in a recent Cochrane Review by Gillespie et al. [] showing that successful interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in elderly individuals have been multidisciplinary/multifactorial and have incorporated muscle strengthening and balance training. Tai Chi as a balance intervention has been studied quite extensively ever since the now classical work by Wolf et al. suggested that Tai Chi training decreased the fear of falling, although it had little effect on computerized sway measures []. More recent studies have confirmed beneficial effects of Tai Chi participation on balance function including reduction in fear of falling [] as well as physical function and actual falls [, ]. However, results of Tai Chi training is commonly compared to untrained controls, simple stretching routines, wellness education programs, or nonspecific and nonfunctional balance interventions making it difficult to really assess whether Tai Chi is any better than a well-designed balance specific and functionally focused training regimen []. Furthermore, there is often a “spiritual magical aura” surrounding Tai Chi that subjects may or may not appreciate. Consequently, as pointed out by Li et al. [], “This calls for controlled and systematic evaluation of the characteristics of movement kinematics, kinetics, and neuromuscular activity in Tai Chi and the need for better understanding of the integration of muscular, skeletal, and neural functioning and their interplay in the execution of Tai Chi movements.” Such studies should put Tai Chi in the context of known principles of training reflecting physiological as well as psychological concepts that therapists can apply in the design of individually customized exercise regimens. Although the benefits of exercise with respect to general health, strength, and fitness as well as quality of life have been documented in the literature for decades, physical exercise as a technique in rehabilitation or as a measure to prevent injury is not always implemented correctly. Some published studies targeting balance training, particularly in the elderly population, have not fully complied with basic principles of training used in exercise prescription. Principles of physical training and exercise prescription include, e.g., awareness, continuity, motivation, overload, periodicity, progression, and specificity. These important concepts are well established and accepted in the exercise physiology literature (e.g., [, , , , ]), and any successful athlete must abide and live by these rules to maintain and/or improve function and performance. However, these fundamental principles of successful exercise prescription apply to anyone regardless of age, sex, or level of fitness [], even patients. Thus, an exercise intervention targeting a certain function provide a challenge/overload to the system and be progressive as well as specific to this function. Otherwise, a training effect should not be expected. As recognized by Welsch et al. [], the basic principles of prescribing exercise are also appropriate for persons with disease. The difference is the manner in which these principles are applied []. Although some studies have investigated the effect of exercise on balance impairment in the elderly, the training principles behind these programs are sometimes unclear. For example, a recent study of fall prevention performed training only in sitting assuming effects would transfer to standing. Because of the lack of specificity in this model, it is not very surprising that no effects of the intervention were found []. Other studies have had similar problems (e.g., [, ]), and few have realized the importance of perturbation exercises for improving balance function. Hu and Woollacott [, ], however, used a multisensory training model specific to balance function and the interaction between visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems and found specific improvements in balance function after a short training period (cf. [, , ]). More recently, there have been well-designed studies that include dual-task conditions as well as perturbations [, , ] or that utilize a custom designed program for each patient [], which by definition would improve specificity of the intervention as well as the effect of the intervention. A common misconception appears to be that strength or even cardiovascular training per se should improve balance function (e.g., [, , , , , , ]). There is undoubtedly a documented relationship between falls and muscle strength in the elderly (e.g., []). However, results are controversial, and other studies show minimal or even no differences in strength between fallers and nonfallers []. Although several studies have demonstrated improvements in balance function after strength training, it is usually related to tasks where muscle strength is a dominant and obvious component of the task (e.g., sit to stand, [, ], rapid backward walking []). In fact, balance improvement related to strength training appears to occur primarily in subjects with severely compromised strength and muscle function (e.g., [, , ]). In addition, several well-designed studies have not found an interaction between balance and strength (e.g., [, , ]). This illustrates the importance of an accurate definition of muscle strength and balance function. In the context of the current paper, strength is defined as the capacity to produce torque around a certain joint, whereas balance is defined as a task-specific multijoint skill that relies on the interaction of several physiological sensory systems, including the neuromuscular, visual, vestibular, and somatosensory ones. To be functionally useful, strength should preferably be designed into the balance training intervention, an approach taken in the current project. In addition, to comply with basic principles of training, the design of specific and functional balance training programs for any category of subjects requires an understanding of how voluntary and postural movements interact as well as how the postural control system reacts to balance perturbations. Because of the multilink structure of the human body, any voluntary movement by itself will impose a perturbation of posture. To compensate for this internal perturbation, our voluntary movements are preceded and accompanied by anticipatory postural adjustments. These involuntary “automatic” movements are smoothly incorporated into our movement repertoire to ensure accurate and harmonious motion [, ]. In fact, the activation of muscles controlling these postural adjustments precedes the activation of voluntary muscle activity as first demonstrated by Belenkii et al. []. The interaction between voluntary movements and anticipatory postural adjustments has since been studied extensively during different upper limb movements [–, , , , ], leg movements [, ] as well as trunk movements [, , –]. The postural synergies triggered before the onset of voluntary movements are flexible and task specific, i.e., a certain voluntary movement may be associated with different automatic postural adjustments depending on the context of the task [, , , ]. The execution of a voluntary step is preceded by an anticipatory postural adjustment that shifts body weight over to the upcoming stance leg []. To prevent a fall, a rapid step execution is a highly important skill that appears to deteriorate with increasing age [], in particular when tested under conditions of cognitive stress []. An example of anticipatory postural adjustments is shown in the upper row of Fig. . Note how the woman on the left in preparation of receiving the ball rolling towards her leans the upper body towards the left away from the right leg she plans to lift to stop the ball. The man on the right illustrates the lack of the ability to perform this preparatory movement. Note how he tends to fall towards the right leg when he lifts it without first shifting his weight over to the opposite leg. These postural synergies are trained through voluntary exercises, and they are the traditional target of most well-designed balance training regimes. Voluntary movements and external perturbations of posture External perturbations of posture, such as a slip or a trip, trigger automatic postural responses with a delay of about 100 ms, which act to restore equilibrium. The responses are specific to the size, type, and direction of the imposed perturbation [, , , , , , ]. Minor perturbations at the feet trigger what has been termed an “ankle-strategy,” i.e., muscles around the ankle create a torque that helps regain equilibrium. Larger perturbations will trigger a “hip-strategy,” which initiates specific hip movements that help maintain balance []. If the subject cannot regain balance, a step will be initiated indicating that the other strategies have failed to recover equilibrium, although when required, a step strategy can be initiated immediately (e.g., [, ]). These responses have been studied extensively in healthy human subjects [–, , , ] as well as in elderly [, , , , ] and in different patient populations [, , , , ]. Similar types of automatic responses occur after postural perturbations during locomotion [], during sitting [, ] as well as in standing cats [, ]. These recovery strategies are not under direct volitional control, and thus, they cannot be trained through voluntary exercises alone. In spite of this, most balance training programs only include voluntarily controlled exercises. Support for a contrarian view is found in recent reports on effects from Tai Chi training suggesting shorter reflex responses after long-term (1–3 years) training [], although such an effect was only inferred from past training. In an attempt to address some of the aforementioned concerns, a balance training program based on a framework of principles of exercise training and postural control has been designed. The program utilizes different types of balls, including large “Balance Balls,” as tools to target sitting and standing balance control. The concept, however, can be implemented with other training tools by a skilled instructor. The program is performed on five different levels where each level reflects different demands on the postural control system. Levels 1–4 include exercises that are focused on the skill to maintain balance (voluntary control), whereas level 5 also includes perturbation exercises that focus on the skill to recover balance (automatic postural corrections). The program is described as a concept with examples to indicate the kind of exercise and the type of skills they intend to develop as well as the overall level of difficulty a certain level should represent. The program should be implemented by an instructor or therapist who, based on each individual subjects’ background and current skill/fitness level, can assess at what level a subject should begin the training program to maximize compliance and outcome and maintain safety. Any form of physical training, either learning and perfecting a sport skill or rehabilitating after an injury or disease, is a process that incorporates both physiological and psychological factors. These factors must harmonize on an individual level for the training process to be successful. A very important role of the instructor is to monitor the progression of the training process on an individual level and to adapt the training program to optimize outcome and maximize performance. When needed, the instructor should be able to modify the execution of an exercise “on-the-fly” to customize the difficulty on an individual level. Factors that can be used to modify the demand of the task include open and closed eyes, stance width during standing and sitting, range of motion, movement speed (challenging power production), single and double leg support, bouncing on the ball, unstable support surface, etc. This process requires the interaction with an experienced therapist, instructor, or coach and/or should not be based on a “cookbook” approach to training. As in any type of training, for improvement to occur, it is crucial to maintain a progressive and specific training load. In addition, variability is important to keep subjects motivated and excited to pursue the training. The goal of each session in the current program is to constantly challenge the postural control system with exercises that incorporate elements related to the demands of normal activities of daily living. Such elements include single leg standing, weight transfer between feet, during feet in place, and change of support area as well as different reaching and bending movements of the trunk while standing and sitting. The concept of balance or body awareness should be incorporated throughout the exercise period. For example, subjects should be encouraged to feel how they are balanced when they are sitting and standing and also focus on smooth and comfortable movements while shifting their weight. Instructing them to focus on where they feel pressure under their feet, how it moves, and where body parts are located with respect to each other as well as the feet are important aspects of the training. Such visualization of balance may be most efficient when the subjects have no visual feedback, i.e., closed eyes. Thus, in addition to providing an increased level of balance challenge, visual occlusion allows the subject to focus on better feeling how they are balanced, thus enhancing the experience and interpretation of somatosensory and vestibular balance cues. Exercises can also be modified to include components more specific for vestibular and vestibulo-occular function. For example, subjects can be instructed to move their head while they are sitting and bouncing on the ball. Head movements can be pitch, yaw, or roll. During head movements, subjects can be instructed to focus on specific objects and even read text out loud to further enhance attention to the task. In addition, it is also important to promote skill awareness among the subjects. This simply means that subjects should be encouraged to understand the goal of an exercise with respect to balance control and to relate this goal to their personal skill level. Eventually, some subjects may be able to “coach” themselves and continue training on their own. The number of subjects that can be safely managed by one instructor depends on the skill level of the subjects as well as the difficulty of the exercises performed. Some exercises are by design challenging for balance, and in case a fall occurs, proper support and assistance from an instructor must be instantly available to eliminate risk of injury. It should be noted, however, that up to the point of balance loss, provided external support by the instructor should be avoided to allow the natural balance response to fully execute. Providing support “too early” may alter the response and decrease or alter the learning effect. It is important that the subject, when performing such challenging exercises, feels completely safe so that their confidence steadily builds during the training process. Examples of correctly provided support during challenging exercises are provided in Fig. . In a group setting for healthy elderly individuals, we have managed 10–12 individuals with one main instructor and one supporting instructor. Highly frail and/or unbalanced individuals will require one-on-one interaction for safe execution of challenging exercises. However, small groups of 2–4 individuals can be managed by one instructor once level 1–2 exercises can be safely performed, allowing the instructor to move around the group and assist one subject at a time to perform more challenging exercises. Each session should include an initial warm-up and stretch period and some strengthening/conditioning exercises as well as a cool down and relax period at the end where the instructor may reemphasize some of the important aspects of the session, especially with respect to body and skill awareness. The use of relaxing music or soothing sounds can be used to create a good ambient atmosphere during the session. Level 1: sitting and standing exercises with external support Exercises on this level may represent little challenge to the postural control system. The goal of the training at this level is mainly directed towards a cognitive understanding of the exercises and an improvement of self-confidence for exercises on higher levels. These exercises can also be used as safe “rest” after more difficult bouts of exercise. Some general effects on strength, coordination, and conditioning are expected. Everyone should progress through this level as soon as possible. However, elements from exercises at this level will be included also on the other levels. An example of a level 1 exercise is shown in Fig. , left middle row. Additional examples are provided below. Sit on ball, wide stance, with support with one hand from the wall or a fixed object. Repeat with narrow stance and support. Sit on ball, wide stance, with support, and shift weight left and right as far as possible. Repeat with narrow stance. Sit on ball and rotate trunk left and right as far as possible, with support. Sit on ball, wide stance, with support, and lift one foot at a time. Repeat in narrow stance. Level 2: sitting exercises without external support The training on this level mainly addresses balance of the upper body during sitting, and it will challenge postural control in a predictable and controlled manner through voluntary movements. Exercises are similar to level 1 but without external support (cf. Fig. , middle row right). For the purpose of activating relevant associated postural adjustments, which are the target of the training at this level, it is more beneficial to execute an exercise slowly with small amplitude rather than using external support because this will completely change the set of muscles that are recruited for balance control during the task. Thus, to progress to this level, the participants must perform exercises with no external support. Depending on the skill of the subject, these exercises can also be used as safe “rest” after more challenging bouts of exercise. Level 3: standing exercises including double leg stance and no external support Exercises on this level incorporate specific components that reflect balance requirements of common activities of daily living. This includes weight shifts laterally between the two feet as well as forward and backward (Fig. , lower row left). Assistance and support can be used in case anyone feels uncomfortable in the initial phase of the training, although when support is provided, the exercise would be at level 1. Similar to exercises at level 2, participants should be encouraged to perform exercises with no or only temporary external support. Subjects should be brought to this level of training as soon as their ability allows them to. Examples of exercises include: Wide parallel stance, roll ball in front of body from left to right with no weight shift between legs. Wide parallel stance, roll ball in a circle around the body with no weight shift between legs. Repeat with weight shift. Repeat in narrow stance. Level 4: standing exercises including single leg stance, gait, and no external support Exercises on this level are similar to level 3; however, they incorporate single leg support, an important component of functional independent ambulation (Fig. , lower row right). This level will also include walking exercises with turns and rotations as well as lateral and forward/backward walking. Assistance and support may be used in case anyone feels uncomfortable in the initial phase of the training. Examples of exercises include: Step stance, roll ball straight forward and then back, lift rear leg when forward, and vice versa. Multidirectional lunges: Step with right foot forward, yield slowly, and push back distinctly up to parallel stance. Repeat for right 45, 90, 135, and 180°. Keep ball on left side for support if needed. Repeat with left foot and ball on right side. To further challenge power production, a more demanding version of the same task can be performed with a faster rebound and no yield. Level 5: perturbation exercises, reactive and proactive responses Exercises on this level include different forms of external perturbations, expected as well as unexpected ones that require a proactive or reactive response by the subject. Perturbations requiring a proactive response by the subject may be applied during different forms of partner or group exercises through the exchange of objects such as different size and weight balls that may be rolling on the floor or handed over by another participant (Fig. , top row left). Exercises incorporating both reactive and proactive responses include, e.g., two participants standing back to back supporting a ball between them (Fig. , top row right). In addition, the instructor or a partner could also apply unexpected external perturbations that require a reactive response. Participants may also be exposed to exercises where they will be encouraged to resist a balance perturbation and avoid stepping, or to execute one or several steps as quickly as possible (Fig. , top row middle pictures). A rapid step execution is a very important protective reaction when balance is lost []. It is important to note that these exercises should be customized to each subject’s ability. They should be challenging but never dangerous thus building self-confidence and skill. However, note that subjects temporarily lose their balance when exercising at this level (cf. Fig. , middle and lower rows). This is required to trigger the postural responses that are the target of the training. An additional form of exercise on this level incorporates cognitive stress and specific requirements for attention while performing a motor task, commonly walking. For example, subjects may be walking and reading a text out loud (one at a time or everyone at the same time). At the same time, they must pay attention to commands provided randomly by the instructor to, for example, stop, take a step in a certain direction, etc. They may also receive a light push by the instructor simulating an external balance perturbation that they must react to. Exercises from level 2 with perturbations provided by the instructor or a partner. Sit and bounce on ball, get up to standing after bounce, and get up and walk after bounce. Resist light push at trunk or hip level and keep feet in place (center of mass perturbation). Repeat with step execution, one step or several small ones. Emphasize rapid response (Fig. , top row middle pictures). Walk across unstable surface (base of support perturbation; Fig. , lower two rows). The feasibility of this training concept has been tested in a pilot study on a group of elderly fallers []. Early results indicate improvements in functional status as well as postural control variables []. Compliance to the exercise program is excellent and participants have reported that they feel safe while performing the program and that the exercises are challenging. All subjects have stated that they would recommend the program to friends and family. Participants also reported that the training sessions provided a good group dynamic atmosphere favorable to socialization. A randomized controlled trial has been conducted to investigate effects of the proposed training program on gait and balance function in healthy elderly individuals. We believe the proposed training technique merits additional study in future clinical intervention trials. No authors listed (1998) American College of Sports Medicine Position Stand.

7b26774c-7d97-4fae-8f44-83afcf69321e,">> Interested in Volunteering? for more information Kyphosis (pronounced: kye-FOH-sis) is a condition affecting the back. It makes the back rounded so it looks hunched over. Sometimes the rounding is hard to see. Other times it's more noticeable. Some teens can't straighten their curve by standing up and some can. Some teens with kyphosis have back pain.  The signs of kyphosis often become obvious during the growth spurt that happens around puberty. This means someone is born with it. Even though it has been there since birth, sometimes it isn't noticed until a teen has done a lot of growing. Teens who slouch over a lot can develop a rounded back. The muscles and bones get used to being hunched over. Teens with this type of kyphosis can straighten their curve by standing up. Viewed from the side, normal vertebrae look like stacked rectangles. In Scheuermann's kyphosis, the vertebrae are triangles, or wedge shaped. This makes the spine hunch forward. Kids with this kind of kyphosis aren't able to straighten their curve by standing up straight. Doctors don't know exactly why some kids are born with this. This happens to many people, especially those who look down a lot of time, such as at schoolwork or a phone. Doctors don't know the exact cause, but it runs in families. examine the spine: while you stand, bend from the waist, and lie down get : to see the curve Someone with kyphosis will see an (a specialist who treats conditions involving the bones). The orthopedist will examine the spine, look at the X-rays, and recommend treatment. Postural kyphosis is treated with physical therapy to improve posture. Exercises can strengthen the back muscles to help them better support the spine. For congenital and Scheuermann's kyphosis, treatment options include: This means routine checkups to make sure the rounding isn't starting to cause problems. Treatment might not be needed. Most cases will stop progressing when teens are done growing. Sometimes specialists recommend a back brace. This brace is like a jacket that can be worn under clothes. It won't straighten the curve, but for some kids and teens it could keep the curve from getting worse. Some wear the brace only at night while others might wear it for 18–20 hours a day. The brace is usually worn until someone stops growing. Exercises that strengthen the muscles in the back and abdomen to better support the spine can sometimes help. Surgery isn't usually needed. But doctors might recommend a procedure called a spinal fusion for a severe case that causes pain, or to prevent problems in the future. If you have back pain or notice a rounded upper back, talk to your parent about seeing your doctor or nurse. Reviewed by: and Note: All information is for educational purposes only.

b9514dd8-58e2-4ba4-ad08-3500248dbd8a,"— Whether you’re looking to maximize muscle gains or improve your body composition and health, resistance exercise is essential to meeting your goals. While compound exercises work multiple muscle groups at a time, isolation exercises seek to stimulate only one muscle group in an effort to provide muscle growth. Though it’s best to include a combination of compound and isolation exercises in your fitness routine, this comprehensive list covers 103 isolation exercises for your whole body, including how to perform them. If you’re unsure whether an exercise fits your experience level or concerned about an underlying injury or health condition, it’s best to discuss your training plan with a qualified trainer. The , often referred to as quads, are the muscle group that comprises the front portion of your thigh. These muscles mainly serve to allow extension (straightening) of the knee joint. This group is made up of four muscles — the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, vastus medialis, and rectus femoris. These muscles are best stimulated by leg-pushing movements. While squats are technically a compound movement, placing the bar a bit higher on your back and narrowing your stance a little can serve to efficiently isolate the quads. The leg press serves as a great alternative to squats — not only for those just beginning their training journey but also advanced trainees. Just like with squats, keeping your stance a bit narrower will help activate your quads. With the front squat, the bar is placed just above the , which moves the center of gravity forward and makes the quads the prime mover for this exercise. While the split squat targets multiple muscle groups, it does a great job of hitting the quads. The movement is performed by putting one foot up on a flat bench behind you and squatting down with the forward leg. You can hold a dumbbell in each hand for added difficulty. It can also be performed with a loaded barbell or Smith machine as you become more advanced. The hack squat is essentially the opposite of the leg press. Instead of pushing against a weighted platform, you’re pushing against weighted pads that lie on your shoulders. Just as with the leg press and squat, keeping your stance narrow will help better isolate the quads. The leg extension is the gold standard for quad isolation exercises, as there’s minimal involvement of any other muscle groups. Most machines utilize a weighted pad that’s placed against your lower shin and pushed against to activate the quads. The goblet squat is another squat variation in which a kettlebell or dumbbell is held out in front of the body as you squat down. To better stimulate the quads, you can place a 2.5-pound (1-kg) or 5-pound (2.5-kg) plate under your heel and keep your stance a bit narrower. The are another major muscle group located on the backside of your legs. These muscles serve to flex the leg at the knee joint and also assist in extending the hips. They’re made up of three main muscles — the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris. These muscles are best stimulated by pulling and movements. The leg curl tends to be the gold standard when it comes to hamstring isolation exercises. While there are several variations, this movement uses a weighted pad that is placed just below the calf muscles and curled in toward your legs. While the Romanian deadlift stimulates some other muscle groups, the primary movers are the hamstrings. For this movement, a weighted barbell or dumbbells are held in your hands as you bend at the hips with a slight bend at the knees, providing an excellent stretch for the hamstrings. The glute ham raise is a unique piece of equipment that’s becoming more popular in training facilities throughout the world. When performed properly, it can efficiently isolate the hamstrings and glutes to provide maximum muscle activation and growth. The single-leg deadlift most commonly uses either a kettlebell or dumbbell held in the opposite hand of the hamstring you’re targeting. The weight is then lowered toward the floor while bending at the hips, allowing your non-working leg to track straight back and serving as a great stretch for the working hamstring. The exercise is performed on each side until the desired numbers of reps and sets are reached. The band leg curl is a great alternative when you don’t have access to a leg curl machine. For this movement, the band is secured to an anchor point. Next, lie on your stomach while wrapping the band just below your calf muscle. Curl it up toward your hamstring and slowly return to the starting position. The glutes, which are scientifically referred to as the and , make up a large part of your posterior leg musculature. These large and powerful muscles are responsible for the extension and lateral rotation of the hip joint. They’re best isolated with hip hinging and thrusting movements. The barbell hip thrust is one of the best exercises for stimulating the glutes. A loaded barbell, usually with padding, is positioned over the hips with your back braced against a low flat bench. A hip thrusting motion is then performed for the desired number of reps and sets. While the walking lunge stimulates multiple muscle groups, it can be an excellent exercise for working the glutes. Place either a loaded barbell on your back or dumbbells in your hands and perform a repetitive lunging motion while you pay close attention to muscle contraction of the glutes. () The cable pull-through is a unique alternative to the hip thrust when equipment isn’t available or you feel like switching things up. A rope attachment is fixed to a low cable. With your back facing the weight stack, grasp the rope in your hands between your legs. Resting your hands on your thighs, thrust the weight while paying close attention to the contraction of the glutes. The glute kickback is a readily available piece of equipment in most gyms and can be a fantastic choice for working the glutes. While the glute bridge requires some flexibility, no equipment is needed, so it can be performed at home. The movement is started by lying down with your feet flat and perpendicular to the floor. A thrusting motion is then performed to contract the glutes for the desired amount of reps. The calves are an important muscle group located on the back of your lower leg. They comprise two major muscles called the and . They’re mainly responsible for plantar flexion, which refers to the extension of the foot down away from the body, such as when jumping or running. The seated calf raise is one of the more common movements utilized to work the calves. Due to the angle at which the movement is performed, it predominantly targets the soleus muscle. The standing calf raise serves as a good complement to the seated calf raise. Given that this movement hits the calves from a different angle, it mainly targets the gastrocnemius muscle. The stair calf raise is a unique movement that can be performed anywhere you have access to stairs. The movement is performed similarly to a standing calf raise, extending your feet at the ankle joint and allowing your ankle to go below the surface of the step to get a good contraction. The Smith machine calf raise is similar to a standing calf raise, although the resistance is provided by a loaded Smith machine bar on your back. It’s helpful to perform the movement with your toes on a step platform, which allows your heels to track down to get a full contraction with each rep. The back comprises numerous muscles, both big and small, though the major muscles include the lats (), traps (), and erector spinae (lower back). These muscles are responsible for the movement of your spine, stabilizing the trunk, and coordinating the movement of your limbs. What’s unique about the back is that it’s best trained from different angles to maximize muscle gains. The pullup is a classic back exercise. When it’s performed correctly, it can isolate most of the back muscles. While there are different variations, the standard pullup starts by hanging from a bar with a medium width grip and pulling your body up with your back muscles until your chin is just above the bar. The lat pulldown is another bread-and-butter back movement. This movement mimics the motion of a pullup and is an excellent alternative, as the weight can be adjusted to match your level of strength and experience. The straight arm pulldown is a fantastic back isolation movement that provides a nice stretch at the top. This movement is performed similarly to a tricep pushdown, but the arms are kept straight, focusing on contracting the lats. This is a unique machine exercise that’s widely available in gyms. The movement is similar to that of a lat pulldown, but the individual handles allow for increased flexibility and even make it possible to perform the movement with one arm at a time. The bent over row is another classic back exercise that’s excellent for adding back thickness. The exercise is performed by starting with a loaded barbell or dumbbells in your hands, bending slightly at the hips and knees, and rowing the weight up toward your belly button. The inverted row is an excellent horizontal pulling exercise for hitting the mid-back. It’s best performed on a Smith machine set in a lower position, although if the movement is too difficult, you can raise the bar a bit to make it easier. The seated cable row is a classic horizontal back movement for building thickness and size. Make sure you keep an upright posture and get a full stretch at the end of each rep for maximal muscle stimulation. The incline dumbbell row is another alternative to the chest supported row machine. An incline bench is set at a 30–45-degree angle. You then sit on the bench backward with your chest facing the pad. Finally, you grasp a pair of dumbbells and row them up just until your upper arm is perpendicular to the pad. The good morning is a classic strength and conditioning exercise for building lower back strength, though it also hits the hamstrings and glutes to a good degree. It’s important to perform this movement with good form to reduce the risk of injury. The back extension is a widely available piece of equipment that’s great for targeting the lower back. As you become more advanced, you can hold a weight plate or dumbbell in your hand to make the exercise a bit more difficult. The superman requires no equipment and can be performed in the comfort of your own home. It’s an excellent exercise for targeting the posterior muscles, including the lower back. If you find it too difficult to raise both arms and legs at the same time, try alternating by first raising your left arm and right leg and then your right arm and left leg. Bird dogs are another tried-and-true exercise for strengthening the core. Also requiring no equipment, they’re a great addition to a home workout program. The dumbbell shrug is similar to the barbell shrug but allows for increased flexibility during the movement by utilizing a dumbbell in each hand. The machine shrug is a plate–loaded option that allows for efficient isolation of the traps. Seated dumbbell shrugs are an excellent way to eliminate the other muscles of the trunk and fully isolate the traps. They also reduce spinal stress, and therefore, may be a better option for those recovering from injury. The chest comprises two major muscles called the and . The pectoralis major is split into two parts called the clavicular head, which is the upper chest, and the sternocostal head, which is the lower portion of the chest. The main function of the chest muscles is to bring the arms toward the center of the body, also known as adduction. The incline barbell bench press is the gold standard for building upper chest mass. A barbell is loaded on an incline bench, slowly unracked, and pressed with a controlled movement, getting a full stretch at the bottom and peak contraction at the top. The incline dumbbell bench press involves a movement pattern similar to that of the previous exercise, but dumbbells are used instead of a barbell. This allows for more shoulder flexibility and may lead to better muscle contraction for some trainees. The Smith machine bench press utilizes a loaded Smith machine bar for resistance and can be performed either flat or on an incline. This method allows you to isolate the chest muscles by reducing the amount of stabilization needed by accessory muscles. The incline dumbbell fly is an excellent upper chest accessory exercise, as it allows for a full stretch at the bottom of the movement. Perform this movement on an adjustable bench set at a slight incline. Grasp a pair of dumbbells in your hands, and while lying on your back, extend your arms down with a slight bend in the elbows, allowing for a full stretch before returning to the starting position. The cable incline fly is similar to the dumbbell incline fly, but a cable crossover machine is used for resistance. An incline bench is set up inside a cable crossover, and loaded handles are brought together in a slow and controlled manner, allowing for a full contraction of the upper chest. The flat barbell bench press is a bread-and-butter movement for chest building that uses a loaded barbell set up on a flat bench for resistance. It’s performed by grasping the bar with a medium width grip, unracking the bar, lowering it to your mid-chest with a controlled motion, and pressing up to return it to the starting position. The dumbbell bench press involves a movement similar to that of the barbell bench press, but it uses dumbbells for resistance. This allows a greater range of motion resulting in improved isolation of the chest muscles. The machine bench press seeks to mimic the movement pattern of the traditional bench press but reduces the amount of stabilization required by other muscle groups, which allows for better isolation of the chest. The dumbbell fly is quite similar to the incline dumbbell fly but uses a flat bench instead of an incline bench. This better targets the lower portion of your chest muscle. The machine chest fly uses the same movement pattern as the dumbbell chest fly but provides a more even strength curve, meaning the resistance is more consistent throughout the exercise. The cable fly is unique in that it allows for greater flexibility in the angle at which the exercise is performed. Setting the cables a bit lower will target the upper pecs, while setting the cables slightly higher will hit the lower part of your chest muscles. The pushup is a classic bodyweight chest exercise that can be a great addition to your home workout program. The arms can be placed a bit wider to target the pecs, or slightly closer to hit the triceps. The shoulder muscles, also known as the , are made up of three distinct heads — the anterior head or front delts, lateral head or side delts, and posterior head or rear delts. The main function of the deltoids is to provide abduction at the shoulder joint, meaning moving the upper arm away and out to the side of your body. The exercises are broken into three categories based on the specific head of the delts that they target. The standing shoulder press is a classic movement for building shoulder mass, particularly for the front delts. This movement is performed by unracking a loaded barbell and pressing it over your head in a controlled motion. The standing dumbbell shoulder press mimics the movement of the barbell press but uses dumbbells for resistance. This allows for greater flexibility and may help eliminate the wrist discomfort that some people experience with barbells. The seated barbell shoulder press is quite similar to the standing version, although it relieves some of the trunk muscle from stabilizing the body, allowing for more isolation of the delts. The seated dumbbell shoulder press is a well-known bodybuilding movement for building shoulder mass. This movement is performed on an incline bench set to a nearly upright position. Dumbbells are then pressed above the head in a controlled motion for the desired number of reps. The machine shoulder press follows a movement pattern similar to those of other shoulder-pressing movements but uses an adjustable weight stack for resistance. Less stabilization is required than is with free-weight shoulder-press exercises, making this a great option for beginners. The Smith Machine seated shoulder press is similar to the seated barbell shoulder press, but the bar is fixed on the Smith Machine. Just like the machine shoulder press, this reduces the amount of stabilization required, making the movement slightly easier to perform. The barbell front raise efficiently targets the anterior or front delts. For this movement, a loaded barbell is grasped with an overhand grip and raised to eye level before steadily being returned to the starting position. The dumbbell front raise is quite similar to the barbell front raise but uses dumbbells for resistance, allowing slightly more flexibility. The dumbbell lateral raise is one of the more popular exercise selections when looking to hit the side delts. To perform this movement, a dumbbell is held in each hand and raised out to the side of your body with a slight bend in your elbows. The dumbbells are then returned to the starting position in a controlled motion. The cable lateral raise — like other cable movements — provides a steady resistance curve throughout the movement. This exercise uses a low pulley set up with a single D handle and an appropriate amount of weight. The barbell upright row is an excellent mass builder for the delts when performed correctly. A loaded barbell is grasped with a medium grip and pulled directly upward until your hands reach your shoulders or slightly above. The weight is then returned to the starting position in a controlled manner. The cable upright row is performed in a similar fashion to the previous exercise but uses a straight bar attachment on a cable pulley for consistent resistance throughout the movement. The dumbbell upright row provides a bit more flexibility than the barbell upright row. It’s a great option for those who experience wrist pain when doing the traditional barbell upright row. The cable face pull directly hits the rear delts when performed properly. To perform this movement, set up a cable pulley with a rope attachment at eye level. Pull the rope toward your face while flaring your elbows out to the side, ensuring a full contraction and full stretch during each rep. The seated face pull is the same a the traditional face pull but seated. This takes out some of the required trunk stabilization, making the movement slightly easier and allowing you to fully focus on the muscle contraction. Banded face pulls follow the same movement pattern as other face pulls but use a band for resistance. These are a great option for workouts taking place at home or in gyms with limited equipment. The dumbbell rear delt lateral raise is a favorite exercise among bodybuilders looking to target their rear delts. This movement is performed similarly to a dumbbell lateral raise, but instead of standing straight up, you’re bent over at the waist with a slight bend in the knees, targeting the rear delts. The rear delt machine fly is a commonly found piece of equipment in most gyms. To perform this movement, sit down facing the chest pad of the machine and making sure the machine arms are adjusted for the rear delt fly. Grab the handles, and with a slight bend in the elbows, extend your arms back behind you just until they pass your torso, then finally return your arms to the starting position. The arms comprise a few major muscle groups, including the and the , which make up the musculature of the upper arm, as well as several smaller muscles that make up the forearm. The biceps serve to flex the elbow and facilitate pulling movements, whereas the triceps main function is to extend the elbow joint and perform pushing movements. Meanwhile, the muscles in the forearm facilitate movements of the wrist and hands. The isolation exercises below are broken up into three groups — biceps, triceps, and forearms. The barbell curl is a classic movement utilized by bodybuilders and recreational athletes alike. To perform the movement, a loaded barbell is grasped with an underhand grip and curled up toward the face while keeping the upper arms parallel to the torso. The weight is then lowered back down in a controlled motion to get a full stretch at the bottom. The EZ bar curl is another popular exercise for bicep mass building, and it’s performed similarly to the barbell curl. The curved bar helps relieve some of the pressure on the wrist joint, making the movement slightly more comfortable to perform than with a barbell. The alternating dumbbell curl is performed with a pair of dumbbells, one in each hand. They’re then curled up, one at a time, and slowly lowered to the starting position. One benefit to this movement is that while one arm is being exercised, the other is at rest, allowing a slight period of recovery between reps. The two-arm dumbbell curl is similar to the previous movement but instead of alternating arms, you’ll complete the exercise by curling both arms up at once. The hammer curl is a slight variation of the two-arm dumbbell curl, but instead of using an underhand grip, the dumbbells are held with a neutral grip, meaning your hands face each other. This targets the forearms to a greater extent, as well as the biceps. The cable curl is an excellent exercise for isolating the biceps, as it provides constant tension throughout the movement. The exercise is performed by setting up a low pulley with a straight or EZ curl bar. The bar is then curled up similarly to a barbell curl, making sure to get a peak contraction at the top and a full stretch at the bottom. The incline dumbbell curl is a seated variation of the traditional dumbbell curl. This movement utilizes an incline bench set at an approximately 45-degree angle to help further isolate the biceps. While seated, a dumbbell is held in each hand and curled up in an alternating fashion before slowly being lowered back down to the starting position. The spider curl is a unique exercise that serves to stimulate a maximal stretch of the biceps at the bottom of the movement. To perform this exercise, you’ll face backward on an incline bench with your arms hanging down over top with a dumbbell in each hand. The dumbbells are then curled all the way up, and in a controlled motion, lowered back down, feeling a full stretch at the bottom. The preacher curl is another bread-and-butter bicep-building movement. For this exercise, a preacher curl bench is utilized. With the elbows positioned on the pad, an EZ curl bar or pair of dumbbells are grasped with an underhand grip, curled up, and lowered back down with a steady motion. The machine preacher curl is similar to the traditional preacher curl but instead of an EZ curl bar or dumbbells, a weight arm is used for resistance. Drag curls are a unique variation of the traditional barbell curl. The difference is that instead of curling the bar up and out, the bar is held close to your torso all the way to the top of the movement and while releasing it back down. Band curls are an excellent curl option for an at-home workout, or even to try something different at the gym. While standing on top of the middle of the band as an anchor, the band handles are grasped with an underhand grip and curled up, then back down, resisting the band tension throughout the movement. The cable pushdown is a staple in many exercise programs for its ability to efficiently isolate the triceps. This movement is performed on a high cable pulley, most commonly with a straight bar attachment. Facing the pulley and grasping the bar with an overhand grip, the bar is pushed down until just before it reaches your thighs and slowly returned to the starting position, keeping your arms close to your sides. The cable overhead extension hits the triceps from a different angle, promoting well-rounded growth throughout. To start, set the cable pulley to about chest height with your choice of rope or straight bar attachment. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip and your back facing the cable pulley, extend your arms up and over your head, pause briefly at the top, and steadily return to the starting position, getting a full stretch at the bottom. The barbell skull crusher is a classic mass-building movement for the triceps. To perform this movement, set up a flat bench and load a barbell or EZ curl bar with your working weight. Lie on the bench, extend the loaded bar over your head, and slowly lower the bar down toward your eyes or forehead, feeling a deep stretch at the bottom and returning the bar to the starting position in a controlled fashion. The dumbbell skull crusher is performed similarly to the barbell skull crusher, but dumbbells are used, allowing for more flexibility at the wrists. Dips are an excellent bodyweight triceps exercise that also targets the upper chest to a limited extent. To perform this movement, stand facing a dip station or parallel bars. Grasp the bars with your hands facing each other and raise yourself up by pushing with your triceps, then lower yourself down with a controlled motion, feeling a stretch at the bottom. Finally, raise yourself back up, ensuring a full muscle contraction at the top. This movement can also be performed with assistance, which uses a counterweight to make it slightly easier. Machine dips mimic the movement of traditional dips but use a weighted arm for resistance. In addition, this exercise is usually performed seated, allowing you to further isolate the triceps. The machine triceps extension is a widely available piece of equipment in most gyms. While seated, place your elbows on the pad and grasp the machine handles. Extend your arms down, getting a full muscle contraction at the bottom, and slowly return them up to the starting position, feeling a stretch at the top. The seated EZ bar extension is a free-weight version of the cable tricep extension. While seated, a loaded EZ curl bar is positioned behind the head and extended up, fully contracting the triceps at the top, and lowering it back down to get a full stretch at the end of the movement. Dumbbell kickbacks are a great finisher exercise for the triceps. To perform this exercise, grasp an appropriate dumbbell in one hand, placing the other hand and one knee on a flat bench. With a flat back, extend the dumbbell up and back using only your tricep muscle, then slowly return it to the starting position. Band pushdowns are an excellent at-home option for hitting the triceps. This exercise is similar to a cable triceps pushdown, but a band attached to an anchor point is used to provide resistance. The band tricep extension follows the same movement pattern as the cable overhead extension but uses a band for resistance, providing constant tension throughout the movement. The barbell wrist curl isolates the posterior, or backside, of the forearm. To perform this movement, grasp an empty or lightly loaded barbell with an overhand grip and curl it up toward your body, keeping your arms straight and moving only your wrists. The cable wrist curl is performed in the same fashion as the dumbbell wrist curl, though resistance is provided by a low cable pulley. The wrist roller is a fantastic forearm builder that can be made at home. A wooden dowel or metal bar is affixed with a rope, and a small weight is added to the other end. Grasping the bar or dowel with an overhand grip, your arms are extended out in front of you. Reel in the rope by spinning the bar, focusing on working the muscles of the forearm, then reverse the motion, letting the rope back out until it touches the floor. To perform the dumbbell wrist curl, start by kneeling down facing a flat bench. Grasp a light dumbbell and allow your hand and wrist to hang over the side of the bench. Curl the weight up, moving only your forearm and getting a full contraction at the top. The abs are made up of two main muscle groups — the and the . The ab muscles play an important role in stabilizing your core and providing movement of the torso. These exercises target the abs from a variety of angles, ensuring full isolation. The reaching situp puts a spin on the traditional situp by having you extend your arms and reach a bit further at the top of the movement, providing a maximal muscle contraction. The rope crunch is a unique ab exercise that uses a cable weight stack for resistance. To perform this movement, set up a cable pulley with a rope attachment set to medium height. Facing away from the weight stack, kneel down and grab the ropes in each hand. Crunch down, ensuring you get a full contraction at the bottom and deep stretch at the top. The V-up takes the traditional crunch and adds a step to make it a bit more challenging. To perform this exercise, lie on your back with your legs straight out. Initiate a crunching motion by raising your legs up and reaching toward your toes in a simultaneous motion, and steadily return to the starting position. The machine crunch is an alternative to the traditional crunch. It’s performed in a seated position as opposed to lying on your back. To perform the movement, select your desired working weight, and while seated in the machine, reach up to grab the handles. Perform a crunching motion by contracting your abs, then slowly return to the starting position, getting a full stretch at the top. The decline situp is performed on a decline bench, taking the traditional situp and making it much more challenging for maximal ab isolation. To perform the hanging leg raise, start by hanging from a pullup bar. Raise your legs up as high as possible while keeping them relatively straight, then slowly lower them back down to the hanging position. This movement can also be performed with the knees bent to make it a bit easier. The ab roller is a commonly found piece of gym equipment that can be used to build significant ab strength. To perform this movement, start on your hands and knees with the ab roller in your hands. Slowly roll the ab roller out until your arms are fully extended, then gradually return to the starting position. The Russian twist is a unique exercise that works both the rectus abdominus and obliques. To start the movement, sit on the floor with a medicine ball or dumbbell in your hands. Raise your legs and twist back and forth, moving the weight from one side of your body to the other for the designated time or reps. The plank is a static ab exercise usually completed for a set amount of time. To perform a plank, lie on a yoga mat with your elbows supporting your body and legs extended straight back behind you. Hold this position for the desired amount of time, usually 15–30 seconds is a good place to start. The side plank is similar to the traditional plank, though for this movement, you’re turned to your side, supporting your body with one arm and isolating the oblique muscles. Though compound movements may be viewed as superior given that they simulate multiple muscle groups at once, isolation exercises are an equally important part of any strength training program. To create a balanced training program, it’s best to incorporate a variety of exercises for each muscle group, including a mix of compound and isolation movements. As always, it’s important to speak with your medical provider before starting an exercise program, especially if you have any underlying conditions. If you’re unsure about how to tailor your training program to your experience level and needs, consider enlisting the help of a personal trainer. — Medically reviewed by Whether you despise pushups or are looking to build size and strength to work your way up to the standard variety, we’ve put together a list of 12… 14 Plank Variations You Haven’t Tried, but Need to ASAP Want a strong core, back, legs, and glutes?

85fe09ec-1892-46d2-b1e1-2f639e128472,"Whether a popular opinion or not, not many trainers support the idea of doing crunches for ab training. But why are so many experts against crunches? Here are 9 reasons why you should reconsider doing crunches: Sure, if you do them with proper formcrunches can be harmless. But most people are not doing them right. Doing crunches in both a safe and effective manner require a good deal of body awareness and anatomical knowledge. It’s far too easy to pull a muscle, slip some disc in your spine, or create more subtle (but unpleasant) problems that won’t show up immediately. Many instructors will tell you to “flatten” your spine to the floor when doing crunches. This makes sense to some degree because it protects you from major injury. But unfortunately, it also trains your body to stay in that flattened position. The spine has curves for a reason. Any real core training will take into account those curves and find ways to support the spine without having to compromise the natural integrity of its form. On the other end of the spectrum are those who don’t flatten their spine, but also don’t understand the transverse abdominus and its role in maintaining a  spine. These people will often release the spine too much (over extending the curve of the lower back) which results in major issues (and points right back to reason #1). Crunches reinforce bad habits that result in poor posture. Many people unconsciously “tuck their butt under” and “hold in their abs” as a result of too much bad ab training. Again, this reinforces conditioning that disrupts the natural curves of the spinal. The end result to all this “ab strengthened” a really STRONG bad posture. And since the whole body is connected: Tucked bottoms result in flattened spinal curves which usually bring the shoulders slumped downward, the head forward, and starts to slowly work on that “old lady hump” in the back that nobody wants. You can always tell when someone does too many crunches almost immediately by their posture alone. 4. They over-focus on surface muscles instead of deep core muscles. While it’s true that these are your “six pack” muscles, they are not the most important muscles for true core strength. You can have very “strong abs” and still end up with poor core support. If all you care about is how your stomach looks, by all means, keep crunching away. But if you want real strength that supports the body in motion (and is critical for living a pain-free life), go deeper and work your . 5. They often create tension and restriction in the hips. Most individuals tuck their butt under as they do crunches. This again overworks surface muscles, disengages more core muscles, tightens hip flexors, and can create tension in the hips. The habit of tucking also produces unwanted results in the hip joint that can also manifest as lower back pain. Ever watch someone do a lot of crunches? More often than not you’ve seen the strained look in their face and the taught tension in their neck. Another indication that crunches forget that the connection of the entire spine, doing more harm than good. As already mentioned, crunches neglect deeper core muscles, critical aspects of the spine, as well as the role our core plays in the whole body. True core training acknowledges that the whole body is connected. Working for a six pack at the neglect of everything else is dangerous and a waste of time. ‘Nuff said. Exercise should be engaging. If not we don’t stay with it. Working in a way that keeps our mind active is important. Enjoying what we do makes the difference between fit-for-life and fit-until-I-run-out-of-steam-and-possibly-at-the-cost-of-my-thyroid-and-adrenals. 9. For anyone who has diastic recti, they will only make things worse. This is a very common condition for women who have given birth. It’s is a disorder defined as a separation of the  into right and left halves. It often goes “undiagnosed” and most women who have it think they just need to lose weight or tone their tummy as the result is a protruding pooch. But doing crunches will only aggravate the situation more. For real results, check out . Even if crunches weren’t dangerous, restrictive, and ineffective there are so many other options that provide true core training. So… do you do crunches?

724a69c1-fccd-4315-ba88-896afd58dbc5,"100 North Mario Capecchi DriveSalt Lake City, Utah 84113-1100(801) 662-1000www.primarychildrens.org Kyphosis (pronounced: kye-FOH-sis) is a condition affecting the back. It makes the back rounded so it looks hunched over. Sometimes the rounding is hard to see. Other times it's more noticeable. Some teens can't straighten their curve by standing up and some can. Some teens with kyphosis have back pain.  The signs of kyphosis often become obvious during the growth spurt that happens around puberty. This means someone is born with it. Even though it has been there since birth, sometimes it isn't noticed until a teen has done a lot of growing. Teens who slouch over a lot can develop a rounded back. The muscles and bones get used to being hunched over. Teens with this type of kyphosis can straighten their curve by standing up. Viewed from the side, normal vertebrae look like stacked rectangles. In Scheuermann's kyphosis, the vertebrae are triangles, or wedge shaped. This makes the spine hunch forward. Kids with this kind of kyphosis aren't able to straighten their curve by standing up straight. Doctors don't know exactly why some kids are born with this. This happens to many people, especially those who look down a lot of time, such as at schoolwork or a phone. Doctors don't know the exact cause, but it runs in families. examine the spine: while you stand, bend from the waist, and lie down Someone with kyphosis will see an (a specialist who treats conditions involving the bones). The orthopedist will examine the spine, look at the X-rays, and recommend treatment. Postural kyphosis is treated with to improve posture. Exercises can strengthen the back muscles to help them better support the spine. For congenital and Scheuermann's kyphosis, treatment options include: This means routine checkups to make sure the rounding isn't starting to cause problems. Treatment might not be needed. Most cases will stop progressing when teens are done growing. Sometimes specialists recommend a back brace. This brace is like a jacket that can be worn under clothes. It won't straighten the curve, but for some kids and teens it could keep the curve from getting worse. Some wear the brace only at night while others might wear it for 18–20 hours a day. The brace is usually worn until someone stops growing. Exercises that strengthen the muscles in the back and abdomen to better support the spine can sometimes help. Surgery isn't usually needed. But doctors might recommend a procedure called a for a severe case that causes pain, or to prevent problems in the future. If you have back pain or notice a rounded upper back, talk to your parent about seeing your doctor or nurse. Reviewed by: and Note: All information is for educational purposes only.

a4e75ca3-1c96-4cfe-9191-b0bd67523f66,"Kyphosis (kye-FOH-sis) makes a person's spine rounded so the back looks hunched over. Everyone has some rounding of the spine. But a larger rounding than normal can cause health problems like pain and breathing trouble. Doctors sometimes treat kyphosis with back braces and physical therapy. A larger curve might need surgery. The spine is called “the backbone” but it's not just one bone. It's made of lots of small (called ) that are stacked and connected by a type of elastic tissue called cartilage. This gives us the flexibility to bend, stretch, balance, and walk. The stacked vertebrae are slight rounded, making the upper back curve out a little bit.

ef62bd96-8d10-4a1d-a1a9-e7244d932461,"— — Kyphosis, also known as roundback or hunchback, is a condition in which the spine in the upper back has an excessive curvature. The upper back, or thoracic region of the spine, has a natural slight curve. The spine naturally curves in the neck, upper back, and lower back to help absorb shock and support the weight of the head. Kyphosis occurs when this natural arch is larger than normal. If you have kyphosis, you may have a visible hump on your upper back. From the side, your upper back may be noticeably rounded or protruding. In addition, people with kyphosis appear to be slouching and have noticeable rounding of the shoulders. Kyphosis can lead to excess pressure on the spine, causing pain. It may also lead to breathing difficulties due to pressure put on the lungs. Kyphosis in older women is known as dowager’s hump. Kyphosis can affect people of any age. It rarely occurs in newborns since poor posture is usually the cause. Kyphosis from poor posture is called postural kyphosis. Scheuermann’s disease, which occurs in children and has no known cause , or the loss of bone strength due to age The following conditions less commonly lead to kyphosis: Seek treatment if your kyphosis is accompanied by: Much of our bodily movement depends on the health of the spine, including our: Getting treatment to help correct the curvature of your spine may help you reduce the risk of complications later in life, including arthritis and back pain. Treatment for kyphosis will depend on its severity and underlying cause. Here are some of the more common causes and their treatments: A child may receive physical therapy, braces, or corrective surgery. Typically, tumors are only removed if there’s concern for spinal cord compression. If this is present, your surgeon may try to remove the tumor, but frequently this destabilizes the bone. In such cases, a spinal fusion is often also necessary. It’s essential to treat bone deterioration to prevent kyphosis from worsening. Medications can great this. can help. You won’t need aggressive treatments. The following treatments may help relieve the symptoms of kyphosis: can help build strength in the core and back muscles. may increase body awareness and build strength, flexibility, and range of motion. can relieve extra burden on the spine. may help, especially in children and teens. For most people, kyphosis doesn’t cause serious health problems. This is dependent on the cause of the kyphosis. For example, if poor posture is causing kyphosis, you may experience pain and breathing difficulties. Your goal will be to improve your posture long term to decrease pain and other symptoms. — — Medically reviewed by Posture exercises help you to strengthen the muscles in your back and stand a little taller.

02796c6c-bf27-40e8-927c-1c59fa919f03,"A Guide to Injury Prevention for Olympic Weightlifters listed in , originally published in Republished with permission from  As a dedicated Olympic athlete, nothing is more disruptive than a threatening injury. An injury, more often than not, can set your progress back substantially and evaporate all of your hard work. However, this depends on the nature of the injury. That being said there are exercises that you may have overlooked within your current exercise program. You could (or should) integrate more effective but safer workouts into your routines so you can minimize the probability of injuries. Having a very active lifestyle does often result in wear and tear. This is the primary burden of practicing Olympic weightlifting. It comes with the territory and while it seems unavoidable, we believe that we can help. All injuries fall into one of two categories, traumatic and cumulative are generally derived from repetitive wear and tear. A cumulative injury can be vastly amplified and it is more likely to continuously re-occur if your form is poor when performing exercises in the wrong posture. A cumulative injury is common among weightlifters. Someone who practises Olympic weightlifting most often strains when performing a snap or clean and jerk. These strains can cause damage to the muscle tissue of an individual. Due to the nature of a tear, weakened tissue can be torn again, this time much easier. This is why Olympic weightlifters often gain cumulative injuries; can also occur. People who practise Olympic weightlifting actually perform exercise that applies pressure on to the shoulders of their skeleton. This is why high intensity exercise or movement practised by Olympic weightlifters increase the probability of shoulder dislocation. Obviously, Olympic weightlifting is a dangerous sport because it requires great amount of exerted force from an athlete. Without correct form and posture, activities can often result in the occurrence of traumatic injuries. Cumulative injuries are far common for Olympic weightlifters. They occur more often than traumatic injuries, which are far more common within contact sports such as Rugby. The repetitive nature of Olympic weightlifting is what causes these injuries. This is why we have addressed the two most common injuries. We intentionally developed this article with additional depth and evaluation so you can minimize damage while practising a variety of exercises. Before we begin, I must emphasize the fact that not enough empirical evidence has been conducted to categorically identify injury prevention methods for a sport as new as Olympic weightlifting, especially in contrast to alternative sports and activities. For example, for a sport like long distance running there has been extensive research conducted by sport scientists who have successfully identified injury prevention exercises while also gathering substantial evidence that reinforces the need for injury prevention methods in not only long distance running, but all physical exercise. We can only conjecture a methodology for Olympic weightlifting based on a propensity for logic as well as an emulation of conventional principles from similar sports. By doing this we can deduce methodologies that will reduce the possibility of injury and prosper practitioners of Olympic weightlifters. A study conducted by the by reinforces this notion. They agree that limited research is endangering Olympic weightlifters careers and physiology. Within their study they conclude that “Since little has been studied regarding possible risk factors to injuries, further research is therefore warranted to explain why athletes get injured and how to prevent injuries.”While Asa and Syartholm’s conclusion is warranted, there has been progress within the field injury prevention. A substantial enquiry about the injuries incurred by a Olympic weightlifters was published by Calhoun (1999). ‘Injury rates and profiles of elite competitive weightlifters’ is a study that collected and analysed medical injury records of resident athletes also during numerous training camps to generate an injury profile. The study concludes, “The injuries typical to elite weightlifters are primarily overuse injuries, not traumatic injuries compromising joint integrity. These injury patterns and rates are similar to those reported for other sports and activities”. Not only does the study reference the probability of an Olympic weightlifter contracting a cumulative injury, it also highlights the points of weakness. These points of weakness include the knees, shoulders and lower back. During Calhoun’s study he deduced that for every 1000 minutes of physical engagement, a Olympic weightlifter will suffer an average of 3.30 lower back injuries. The physical strain brought about by posture, pressure and regiment of Olympic weightlifting is problematic. This is why we have devised a guide of injury prevention exercises that will not only minimize the chances of injury for Olympic weightlifters, but also maximize performance during training and eventual competition. During this article we will provide injury prevention exercises that can prevent the three of the most common injuries that Olympic weightlifters encounter. These include: PPS (Patellofemoral pain syndrome) within the knee; Due to the mature of Olympic weightlifting these injuries occur often. However, follow these injury prevention exercise guides to minimize the threat of injury and carry on practizing your passion. Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PPS) occurs over a long period of time and it is your atypical injury incurred by an Olympic weightlifter. Olympic weightlifting involves a variety of pressuring movements such as squats, jerks and snatches. All of these movements place a huge amount of pressure on the kneecap. The kneecap’s scientific name is the patella. The patella is a small flat triangular bone that is embedded in a tendon in the front of the knee. It slides along a groove across the front of the femur (thigh bone). It acts as a protective casing that protects the knee joint but it also adds leverage to the tendon by increasing its angle. This can be damaged when subjected to large amounts of pressure that can be exerted by incorrect positioning or involuntary movement. Practising Olympic weightlifting via an improper mannerism can onset PPS. Early symptoms usually start with a minor ache when moving. It can then develop into a hindrance for even the most basic of everyday tasks, that are completely non-weight bearing. PPS can also be caused by pre-determined weaknesses in the inner quadriceps as well as a lack of muscular stability within your hip flexors. Now that we understand the anatomical arrangement of the patella and how Olympic weightlifting can certainly damage it, we will explain how to prevent such injuries. Firstly, ensure that you have the appropriate footwear before practising Olympic weightlifting. This should go without saying. Always consult a doctor if you begin to experience knee pain, they are a leading authority in physically therapy and they can correctly diagnose you. There are many knee related injuries and treatment varies depending on the type of injury that you have sustained, do not presume it is PPS. By incorporating a range of valuable stretches and strength exercise into your normal day-to-day gym routine, you will undoubtedly prevent the onset of injury in both a minor and major way. Incorporating these exercises also have many physical benefits that will also optimize your performance. Muscles work in synchronization with their muscle groups. Therefore, any patella orientated stretches will directly correlate with the rest of your leg muscles and make you limber in your performance. Some of the exercises below would be ideal for Olympic weightlifters to practice. They will certainly prove beneficial: Isometric exercises are a type of strength training in which the joint angle in muscle and muscle length does not change during contraction. One isometric exercise that stretches the quadriceps while building isometric strength and endurance in the legs muscle group surrounding the patella is a wall sit. To perform an effective wall sit you should follow these instructions; Start with your back against a wall with your feet apart at shoulder width. Your feet should be in front of the wall by a short distance of two feet (If you are feeling any pain use a medicine ball as a make weight); Slowly slide your back down the wall till your thighs are parallel with the ground; Adjust the placement of your feet so your knees are vertically parallel with your ankles. Measure the position of your knees by making sure they are not poking over the top of your toes; Moreover, make sure that your back is positioned properly. It should be flat against the wall; Hold this position for 30 seconds. Afterwards, rest 30 seconds and repeat the exercise three times over; Increase the duration of your hold by 5 seconds each time to stimulate your quadriceps. This will increase their strength and provide a secure scaffold to your patella. The wall sit is a great isometric exercise because it directly addresses a direct cause of PPS. By strengthening the muscle groups within your leg you are less likely to gain an injury on your knee. It also benefits your performance by increasing the strength and explosiveness of your quadriceps that are instrumental in moves such as the clean and jerk. Finally, the wall sit is easy to practise and requires minimal resources. If you are experiencing pain, make sure to use a medicine ball and know your limits. An adductor stretch targets the group of muscles that reside on the inside of the thigh. The groin is just one of these muscles. These muscles work to pull the thigh inward while also stabilizing your pelvis. By doing this you will be able to withstand more pressure on your lower skeleton while subtracting the amount of tension exerted on your knees during lifting. This will certainly minimize your chances of injury while also making your more confident in your performances. A very effective adductor exercise is the side lying stretch. Here are some instructions to complete an effective and safe side lying stretch.  Start by placing yourself in a comfortable position. Use a yoga mat to ensure you are completely comfortable. This will enable you to focus on perfecting your stretch; Start of by lying on your right hand side and bend your right knee so your torso is stabilised and you have balance; Rest your head on your right hand. Lift your leg upward. Once your leg is elevated you can hold it in position. You can either hold your knee. However, if you want to maximize your stretch you should hold your foot. Straighten your leg and hold for 20 seconds. This will stimulate the muscles around your pelvis as well as the adductor muscles; Swap sides and repeat again. If you want to maximize your workouts increase the time that you hold your straight leg by 10 seconds. While it is not comparable in practice to isometric stretches, it is comparative in its effectiveness when preventing PPS injuries. An adductor stretch is an injury prevention exercise for Olympic weightlifters because it stabilizes and strengthens your pelvis and other leg muscles. By securing these points, you will be able to minimize the amount of pressure placed other parts of your legs like the patella. The Iliotibial Band (ITB) is a thick band of fibrous tissue that runs down the outside of your leg from your pelvis to the knee. Buttock and hip muscles are also attached to it. The ITB dictates how your hip and buttock muscles move. It also helps stabilize the bones within your knees including your patella bone. It is essential as an Olympic weightlifter to practise Iliotibial band exercises. The tightening of the ITB can make subtle changes to the way the knee moves, resulting in knee pain. This can often lead to maltracking that disables the kneecap from providing leverage. This will most certainly hinder Olympic weightlifting progress. A very effective ITB exercise is a clamshell. Here is the correct way to complete a clamshell exercise. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on your mat; Place a pillow between your knees and lengthen your spine; Exhale as you engage your inner thighs while squeezing the pillow; Inhale as you release the pressure without letting the pillow drop through your legs; Make sure that your tailbone stays towards the mat by keeping your spine long; Perform 10 squeezes. Make sure that your pelvis is steady and engage your inner thighs by removing the pillow. As you can surmise, this exercise does not directly target the Iliotibial band. Instead it is an  injury prevention exercise that is designed to strengthen the pelvis. Your pelvic region connects the spine to the lower limbs. It is a bridge and it has to be secure. As an Olympic weightlifter you need to ensure that you are strong from the very top to the bottom of your posture. Without a strong skeleton you are likely to gain an abrupt injury in your lower limbs. Glute stretches are also very important for Olympic weightlifters because they help improve flexibility, relieve back and knee pain while also preventing substantial injuries on these areas. Tightness in your glutes can often be a factor in knee pain because it can cause uneven weight distribution on your knees. Just by performing a few glute stretches each morning and night, you will ironing the creases of your glute muscles and relieving pressure from the patella. Follow these instructions to correctly loosen your glute muscles of any excess stiffness.  Sit in a chain and cross one leg so that your foot rests on the opposite knee; Gently lean forward until a stretch is felt in the buttock of the crossed leg. Hold this for 30 seconds; Repeat 3 times, twice a day before and after a exercise; Once you feel comfortable, push down on your knee to increase the glutes stretch; Progress further by leaning away from the side you are stretching. As you can see, it is very easy to complete this exercise. You need a limited amount of resources, time and effort. In all honesty, you will be reciprocated 10 fold. You will be preventing possible injuries while also limbering your glutes. It is also a time to relax and reflect on your progress and training. Whether you are an Olympic weightlifter or not, you will benefit from retrospection. Another exercise that is very similar to the previous exercise, the figure 4 glute stretch is a glute bridge. While it requires a lot more physical effort, it still stimulates the same muscle areas, the glutes. We already understand what how the glutes can minimize the risk of PPS. By performing a glute bridge you can also do the very same. Here is how to effectively perform a glute bridge. Lie face upwards, on the floor. Bend your knees and position your feet so that they are flat on the ground. Keep your arms at your side with your palms pressed to the floor as well; Lift your hips off the ground until your knees, hips and shoulders form a straight line; Squeeze your glutes hard and keep your abs drawn inwards so you do not over extend your back during the exercise; Hold your bridged position for a couple of seconds before easing your body back towards the mat. By doing this you are maximizing the strength of your glutes while also preventing any injuries to your patella. A glute bridge is also an effective bodyweight exercise. It will stimulate and strengthen your maximus, medius and minimus. These muscles have a large part in the practice of squats. As an Olympic weightlifter you will squatting under bars a lot. By strengthening your maximus, medius and minimus, you will increase the strength that you need to lift heavier weights in cleaner motion. In summary, to avoid PPS you need to distribute your weight accordingly. By using these stretching and strengthening exercises you can condition your body to share weight between points of pressure when weightlifting. You are addressing the issue before it becomes disruptive to your training. Another common injury among Olympic weightlifter is shoulder impingement pain. It is a condition where your shoulder rotator cuff tendons are intermittently compressed during shoulder movements. This can often cause injury to the shoulder tendons that results in painful shoulder movements. Impingement is often caused by impact of bone into rotator cuff tendon. Once the impact has occurred, the rotator cuff becomes inflamed and swollen. Your rotator cuff will be trapped or pinched under the acromion. This is because a rotator cuff tendon sits under the subacromial bursa (a lubrication sack). The subacromial bursa helps protect the tendons from touching the bone. It also provides enough moisture for the tendons to glide over the bone and not get trapped. Olympic weightlifters often exert a lot of pressure on their shoulders when completing movements such as the snatch. It would be wise to practise injury prevention exercises on your shoulders if you are doing any kind of weightlifting. Here are some exercises that will help to develop strong and flexible shoulders. However, the likelihood of contracting a shoulder issue as an Olympic weightlifter is very likely. It comes with the territory. If you do gain a shoulder impingement injury, here are some relief exercises that can nullify your pain. To easily recover from shoulder impingement pain you should practise a multitude of exercises that focus upon a range of motion. This range of motion should lubricate the subacromial bursa while also re-conditioning your rotator cuff to sharp movements. To complete this exercise you will need 3-5 lb weights or a household object that you can easily grasp. Gently rotate your arm in a circular motion while keeping your arm and shoulder relaxed; Rotate your shoulder cuff clockwise for 2-3 minutes; Then you should rotate your shoulder cuff counter clockwise for 2-3 minutes; Your shoulder should feel loosened. If not, repeat again. This exercise can also be completed in a household environment. All you need to complete this exercise is a bath towel. Place the hand of the effected shoulder at the lower end of the towel, behind your back; Pull your lower arm up your back by pulling up with your higher arm; This will naturally lift your lower hand and put a small amount of pressure on your effected arm; Hold this stretch for five seconds and then return to the starting position by pulling down your lower arm; Repeat 10 times and then make sure to switch arms. To compete this exercise you will need a weighted bar or even a household object like a broom. This makes it easier for you to treat injuries because they are cost efficient and simple to follow. A good posture consists of a tight core, upwards chest and downward shoulders; Make sure your shoulders are in line with your palms; Keep your arms perfectly straight and raise the bar up directly over your head; Hold this position for 5 seconds and then slowly bring it back down to your starting position. A lumbar spine injury is the most typical injury that is contracted by Olympic weightlifters. Earlier in this article, I shared a statistic from Calhoun’s paper, Injury rates and profiles of elite competitive weightlifters. The stat said that every 1000 minutes a personal trainer gains an average of 3.30 lower back injuries. This makes perfect sense. There is a lot of pressure exerted on the lower back on of an Olympic weightlifter. For this very reason, I have suggested many hip and glute strengthening exercises as blockades for other joint injuries. By strengthening your lower back you can reinforce your skeletal structure so it will withstand the force of heavy weights while also avoiding a lumbar spine injury. The lumbar spine is located in the lower back below the cervical and thoracic sections of the spine. This area of the spine consists of five vertebrae. These lumbar are numbered from L1 to L5. These vertebrae contain spinal cord tissue and nerves that control communication between the bran and legs. Without these nerves your body would not work in complete oscillation. As well as this, damage to the lumbar spinal cord subsequently affects the hips and groin area while also impacting the lower abdominals and flexions within an individual’s thighs, as well. To put it concisely, in extreme cases lumbar spine injuries have been known to immobilize athletes. As an Olympic weightlifter, you need the strength of your lower back and the mobility of your hips and legs. A lumbar spine injury can hinder all these important factors. Therefore, preventing a lumbar spine injury is of the upmost importance. I have gathered some exercises that will make sure you avoid such an instance. These exercises are better described as lumbar spine stabilization exercises. You can stabilize your frame by making it both stronger and more limber. Follow these exercises and you will be doing your body and sporting interest, a great service. Ways to Prevent Lumbar Spine Injury within the Lower Back This is a passive exercise that requires little effort. Start by lying on the floor with your knees bent and your feet on the floor; Proceed to slowly straighten either one of your legs; Make sure your heel is facing the ceiling while supporting the back of your thigh with both of your hands; Proceed to complete the exercise with your opposite leg; If you have any trouble straightening your leg, you should rest it against the wall to create a static position with a healthy amount of pressure. You may be wondering why a hamstring stretch can help any issues concerning the lumbar vertebrae in your spine. The explanation is fairly simplistic. Tightness in the hamstring or any upper leg muscles can lead to a limited range of motion in your pelvis. This can increase pressure across the lower back while also corrupting your posture. By stretching your hamstrings you can lengthen your muscles and avoid any stress on your lower back. This exercise requires an exercise ball and safe space to practise. An exercise ball bridge is considered an advanced stabilization exercise that utilizes an exercise ball so the individual can practice unconventional movements that remedy any abnormalities in the lower spine. Start by lying in the floor with both feet propped up an exercise ball; Find a neural spine position and hold it as you slowly tighten your buttock muscles; By tightening your buttock muscles you will lift your hips off the floor by 2 to 3 inches; Repeat this exercise till you feel a light burning sensation in your hips. Exercise ball treatment options are very effective because they are designed to help minimize lower back pain. They strengthen your core body muscles while stabilizing your spines. They are essentially balance exercises that inadvertently strengthen your back muscles. Believe it or not, aerobic exercise is a very effective way to re-condition your lower back. It is very useful to the maintenance of your lower back. By completing a rehabilitation course, primarily devised of aerobic exercises, you are less likely to experience lower back pain. Aerobic exercise also improves your functionality and this can be instrumental in the avoidance of lower back issues. One example of aerobic exercise that is very engaging is water therapy exercises. Practising aerobics within water provides effective conditioning while also minimizing stress on the lower back. This is due to the buoyancy of water counteracting gravity. This nullifies the usual compression on an individual’s spine. This makes a person ‘un-weighted’ within the water and an individual can become more mobile. It also makes exercises less painful which makes water aerobics the perfect physiotherapy. To reduce the lower back pain you must practise exercises that provide mobility to your hips. If you are already experiencing pain in your lower back, you should be fine due to your increased mobility. This is a conventional water aerobic exercise that will increase your mobility and strengthen your hips. If you struggle gaining balance, you can hold yourself against the side of the pool; Make sure to perform this exercise both sides with both legs. This exercise helps create strength in your lower back muscles. Start by reaching one of your arms to the front of your body; When returning your arm to the back of your body in a swift motion, pull the water back so you can feel its resistance; Repeat this exercise 10 to 15 times on both sides of your body. Both of these water aerobic exercises utilize the water’s resistance to both strengthen and stimulate either the hips or lower back muscles. By completing these exercises you are lowering the chances of gaining a lumber spine injury. Also, by strengthening your spine you are less likely to injure your lower limbs as well. By practising any of your exercises you are reinforcing your skeletal structure. Olympic weightlifters need a strong and stable form so they can lift with positive form and posture. This article is republished with permission from https://origympersonaltrainercourses.co.uk/blog/guide-injury-prevention-olympic-weightlifters/ Good general article and applicable suggestions to all sports. however the best ways to help prevent injuries in Olympic weightlifting and frequently overlooked is the training of assistance exercises. basically this means to progressively train the various compound movements involved in the complete lifts (i.e snatch/ clean and jerk).In fact this is as important to successful and progressive lifting as the execution of the two lifts themselves. All joints/muscles/connective tissues etc should be warmed prior to training and flexibility maintained and improved through stretching programmes such as PNF (proprioceptor neuromuscular facilitation).I was an Olympic weightlifting coach and fully qualified refereee with the BWLA (formally British amateur weightlifting association) for over 20 years and ran a centre of excellence, training and coaching over 40 olympic athletes, running seminars in sports performance, anatomy/physiology and sports nutrition.

Most everyone knows that good posture is important, but good posture doesn't apply just to sitting and standing. The muscles and ligaments of your back relax and heal themselves while you sleep. In order to protect your back, good posture is important while sleeping. Little scientific research exists on which mattress is best for back pain or for maintaining a healthy back. The mattress that's right for you lets you wake up feeling rested and free of pain or soreness. Unless you have a condition that may require a certain type of mattress, you should choose a mattress that provides support for the natural curves of your spine and is comfortable. The best mattress is one that allows you to sleep soundly and without pain. If you sleep with a partner, you should have enough space to move into a comfortable sleeping position. Consider replacing your mattress every 9 to 10 years. If you have a back problem, ask your healthcare provider or physical therapist to recommend the type of mattress that would be best for you. Pillows are not just for your head and neck. Depending on your sleeping position, additional pillows can help keep your spine in the proper position. The pillow for your head should support the natural curve of your neck and be comfortable. A pillow that's too high can put your neck into a position that causes muscle strain on your back, neck, and shoulders. Choose a pillow that will keep the neck aligned with the chest and lower back. Your pillow should be adjustable to allow you to sleep in different positions. Replace your pillows every year or so. Regardless of your sleeping position, try to keep your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned: If you sleep on your back, a small pillow under the back of your knees will reduce stress on your spine and support the natural curve in your lower back. The pillow for your head should support your head, the natural curve of your neck, and your shoulders. Sleeping on your stomach can create stress on the back because the spine can be put out of position. Placing a flat pillow under the stomach and pelvis area can help to keep the spine in better alignment. If you sleep on your stomach, a pillow for your head should be flat, or sleep without a pillow. If you sleep on your side, a firm pillow between your knees will prevent your upper leg from pulling your spine out of alignment and reduce stress on your hips and lower back. Pull your knees up slightly toward your chest. The pillow for your head should keep your spine straight. A rolled towel or small pillow under your waist may also help support your spine. Insert pillows into gaps between your body and the mattress. When turning in bed, remember not to twist or bend at the waist but to move your entire body as one unit. Keep your belly pulled in and tightened, and bend your knees toward the chest when you roll. Keep your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned when turning as well as when sleeping.  ",131,exercises for better posture,-12.098063468933105,48

But a larger rounding than normal can cause health problems like pain and breathing trouble. Doctors sometimes treat kyphosis with back braces and physical therapy. A larger curve might need surgery. The spine is called “the backbone” but it's not just one bone. It's made of lots of small (called ) that are stacked and connected by a type of elastic tissue called cartilage.

efe12b9a-ed16-49f2-95ab-fb3a0b9910f9,"How to Get a Full-Body Strength Training Workout at Home Medically reviewed by — Strength training, also called weight training or resistance training, is an important part of any fitness routine. It helps make you stronger and also builds muscle endurance. With strength training, you move your body against some type of resistance, such as: also known as resistance tubing or workout bands like cable machines, single-exercise machines, or multi-gym systems Strength training is a versatile type of workout that you can do almost anywhere. While it’s a popular exercise option at many gyms, you can also build a robust strength training program that you can do in the comfort and privacy of your home. This article will help you understand what you need to get started with an at-home strength training routine, along with examples of exercises that you can include in your workout plan. Research has shown that strength training can benefit your health and fitness in many different ways. According to the , strength training may help: burn calories more efficiently, even after you’ve exercised reduce the symptoms of many chronic conditions, including , , , and A home-based exercise routine can be a super easy and convenient way of fitting in a workout without having to hit the gym. There’s no traveling or waiting for machines or equipment. There are no gym fees or expensive equipment needed. You can exercise on your own schedule, no matter the time of day or night. You can work out without feeling self-conscious. There’s no pressure to keep up with those around you or to push yourself beyond what’s comfortable. Once you’re ready to start putting together your strength training workout, the first step is to find a place in your home where you can exercise comfortably. You’ll want to find an area that has enough room for you to move your arms and legs freely. You don’t need to invest in much equipment, but if you do want to purchase a few items, here are some that may be helpful: Instead of using dumbbells or a kettlebell, you can improvise by using water bottles, sandbags, or canned goods in place of the weights. If you’re just getting started with strength training, you may want to find a strength training workout for beginners online. This can help you learn how to do different exercises with the right form, and also warm up and cool down correctly. Before starting your workout, do a warmup routine for at least 5 to 10 minutes. This can include brisk walking, jogging on the spot, or movements that work your legs, arms, and other major muscle groups. Once your muscles are warmed up and ready to move, you can start by doing a series of bodyweight exercises. You don’t need any equipment for bodyweight exercises, except an exercise mat if the floor is too hard. With each of these exercises, use smooth, steady, and controlled movements. A basic lunge works the muscles in your lower body, including your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Start by standing up tall, feet shoulder-width apart. Step forward with your right foot, and lower your hips toward the floor until your right leg is at a 90-degree angle and your left knee is parallel to the ground. Make sure your front knee doesn’t go beyond your toes. Then step your right foot back to meet your left, and repeat this movement with your left leg. Repeat 10 to 12 times, then rest briefly and do another set. Lunge variations include , , , and side lunges. If you’re new to strength training, start off by raising your arms overhead without any weight. Once you can do this exercise with good form, you can add light dumbbells, and increase the weight as you build strength. This exercise not only works your glutes and leg muscles, it also works the muscles in your core, back, and shoulders, as well as your triceps. Stand with your feet slightly wider than your hips and your arms alongside your body. Slowly lower your hips down into a squat position. Press up to come back into standing and raise your arms overhead. Planks are an excellent exercise for improving your core strength and stability. This exercise can also strengthen the muscles in your back, chest, and shoulders. Rest on your forearms and toes only, keeping your body in a straight line with your buttocks clenched and your abdominal muscles engaged. Try to hold this position for 30 seconds. If that’s too hard, start with 20 seconds. As you gain strength and fitness, try to hold the plank position for 1 minute or longer. Once you’re ready for a more challenging version of the plank, you can try lifting one leg at a time while you’re holding the plank position. Standard pushups work the chest muscles (pectorals), as well as the shoulder muscles, triceps, and abdominals. Start in a plank position with your palms directly under your shoulders. Keeping your back flat and bracing your core, lower your body by bending your elbows until your chest almost touches the floor. Immediately push your body back up to the starting position. Repeat 8–12 times. Start with 1–2 sets, and build up to 3 sets as you get stronger. A less challenging version of the pushup can be done by putting your weight on your knees instead of your toes. More challenging pushup variations include , , and . The following two exercises use dumbbells. Start with a 5-pound dumbbells. As you build up your strength, you can switch to using 8- or 10-pound dumbbells. You can also use canned goods or water bottles in place of dumbbells. Just be sure to grip them firmly to avoid injury. This exercise targets the muscles in your shoulders and arms, and can also strengthen your core and chest muscles. Pick up the dumbbells and raise them to shoulder height. Your palms can face forward or toward your body. Raise the dumbbells above your head until your arms are fully extended. Pause in this position for a few seconds, and then bring the dumbbells back to shoulder height. This exercise works your triceps as well as your shoulder muscles. Bend your torso at a 45-degree angle, and bend your elbows so they form a 90-degree angle. Then straighten your arms out directly behind you, engaging your triceps as you go. You can either do one arm at a time, or both together. If you’re a beginner, start with 1–2 sets of 8–12 reps, and build up to 3 sets as you get stronger. Resistance bands are another great tool for your strength training workout. They’re lightweight and versatile, and a has shown they work your muscles just as well as free weights or weight machines. This exercise works the muscles in your back, shoulders, and arms. Stand with your arms extended out in front of you at chest height. Hold a resistance band tautly with both hands. The band should be parallel to the ground. Keeping your arms straight, pull the band toward your chest by moving your arms outward to your sides. Initiate this movement from your mid-back. Squeeze your shoulder blades together, and keep your spine straight, then slowly return to the starting position. This exercise works the muscles in your hips and legs. You’ll need a light- to medium-resistance band to do this exercise. Loop the resistance band around both your ankles. You can use a chair or wall for balance. Keeping a straight line in your body, pull your left leg back as far as you can, keeping it as straight as possible. Complete 12 reps with your left leg, then repeat with your right leg. Complete 2 sets on each side to start, and work up to doing 3 sets as you build up your strength. This exercise works your quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, and glutes. Like a leg press on a weight machine, this exercise makes you work against gravity. Lie on your back and lift your feet off the ground. Bend your knees, creating a 90-degree angle. Flex your feet, pointing your toes upward. Wrap the resistance band around your feet and hold the ends. Press your feet against the bands until your legs are fully extended. Finish your workout by cooling down for about 5 to 10 minutes. This allows your breathing and heart rate to transition into a resting state. Options include walking on the spot and gentle stretches. Doing 30 to 45 minutes of strength training two to three times a week is an excellent way of building lean muscle mass, burning calories, and boosting your metabolism. This, in turn, can help you burn body fat and make weight loss easier. In addition, strength training can strengthen your bones and joints, lower your risk of chronic diseases, improve flexibility, posture, and balance, and boost your mood and energy levels. Many strength training exercises can be done in the comfort and privacy of your home, using just your body weight or basic, low-cost equipment as resistance. If you have any health concerns or an injury that makes exercising difficult, talk to your doctor or a certified personal trainer before you start an at-home strength training routine.

86c44ee6-33d1-4b6d-8586-bfacdae63a7d,"What is Military Neck & How To Fix It Naturally With Best Pillows and Exercises? The military neck is a specific medical condition that relates directly to the health of your cervical spine. In this specialized condition, straightening of the cervical curve or spine has been seen which sometimes results in pain and other disorders. Doctors suggest that a normal curve of a cervical spine is of ‘C shaped’ which is termed as lordosis. However, the normal curve as seen in an X-ray report can be distorted based on several factors. ‘Loss of Lordosis’, is one specific condition that is related to diseases like degeneration of disc or chronic arthritis. As per the observations from senior orthopedic surgeons, it has been noted that the ‘loss of lordosis’ (commonly referred to as a military neck) is caused as a result of a total alteration of the spine structure in a human body. This is generally seen in people who work with poor neck posture for a prolonged period of time. Sometimes, the extreme condition is also referred to as cervical kyphosis or hypolordosis as it relates to the straightening of the cervical curve or military neck. Studies reveal that this is the main cause of getting the military neck. It is important to know that, the military neck is not a painful condition in all cases. While in many cases straightened neck is seen without pain (or very little pain); it can cause immense discomfort as well as pain to many other patients. The problem is generally caused due to pulling of the spine and muscle spasms like in case of whiplash injury or accident. It is therefore important to note that for patients suffering from military neck, the cervical spine should be restored in its original condition as soon as possible so that they do not suffer from chronic painful conditions. Various treatment options are available due to advances in medical sciences and doctors have jotted down the necessary impact of such a correction procedure. These remain to be: Allowing and helping the patient to take care of normal chores as such Bringing back life and support for patients who had been immobile for quite some years in the past Symptoms of the military neck (also called as straight neck syndrome) can be multifarious. Patients suffering from such chronic conditions can experience severe pain concerning the upper and lower back area. Some patients can even complain of nausea and terrible headache/migraines as well. While some patients experience severe military neck pain, it has been observed that such a typical risky medical condition can also give rise to severe immobility. In order to take care of or fix such chronic military neck symptoms, it is recommended to go through an X-Ray. X-Ray plate-based image can help you to diagnose the intensity of the curve and your doctor can actually plan out for a structured process of treatment after careful examination. Orthopedic surgeons when consulted, agree to the fact that a military neck X-ray is just a preliminary step to ensure that you suffer from the military neck. If the treatment plan is not planned carefully at a time, this severe condition can give rise to the following symptoms: Based on such symptoms, it is clear that a structured process of treatment is essentially required for patients suffering from the loss of curve problems in the cervical region. Although for few patients military neck surgery may be suggested, it is a fact that for many others surgery might not be the only option available. Correction of the cervical spine in favor of a surgery based treatment is only suggested when the doctor feels it is the last option. Otherwise, proper diagnosis along with initial treatment stages can help cure the problem to a much extent. Below are some of the best treatment methods that can be utilized to naturally help you fix the straight neck problem. Tips for Correcting The Straight Neck Problem Naturally It is quite evident that correcting the cervical curve for a patient suffering from a military neck, can be a boon in disguise as it helps the patient to return to a normal course of life. Non-surgical treatment options which include injections, medicines, therapies, as well as exercises, can help a lot as it brings back the patient on a normal schedule very fast. During the initial phase, a military neck treatment can be therapy based. This can include as well. Giving physical support to the patient is very much required so that it can enable the patient to participate in normal activities as well. Studies reveal that military neck exercises are of great help for patients and can act as one of the best ways to correct the curve fast in the most natural way. Therefore in order to get immediate relief from military neck or straight neck condition a patient should get in touch with the physical therapist. A physiotherapist can guide you all the way to perform best cervical spine exercises that can heal your no-curve in the neck or straight neck problem fast without any risk. A medical neck traction device in addition to military neck wrap is also sometimes recommended in order to get temporary relief from straight neck conditions. Using a reliable under your neck can well support the entire back including the cervical spine and discs to get it restored naturally in a few weeks. Remember that, medical traction devices or support systems are particularly useful in promoting the normal cervical curve. Although it allows a perfect biomechanical advantage to the patients, for certain patient’s condition remains to be precarious and they need to undergo spinal surgery if required. Maintaining a good posture, especially while working on a computer is most essential so that you can help heal your straight neck curve faster. Wearing is especially recommended for this. While buying and using support or a brace to correct the straight neck curve, make sure that the medical device or a support bracket is bought from a branded shop after the consultation of your doctor. As such there are various different varieties of straight neck pillows that can help the problem of straight neck syndrome. Therapeutic pillows for the military or straight neck are most of the time suggested for suffering patients. Specially designed neck traction pillows like Therapeutica Sleeping Pillow provides necessary traction as well as maximum support to patients with abnormal or no curve. Little below we have complied down all different types of pillows that can actually help the patients suffering from military neck symptoms. Surgical options for correction of the cervical spine when suggested (as the last option) need to be executed under strict medical supervision. It has been noted that such surgeries are very often complicated which can give rise to other side effects. It is desirable for the patient to gather useful information about the doctor performing the surgery on the person. Credentials of the doctor are mostly very important in order to give the patient a better quality of life in the long run. Pre-surgery or post-surgery care regime needs to be incorporated in case the patients expect a speedy recovery. In most of the cases, doctors suggest regular physio-therapies of the neck as well as shoulder based exercises. Walking on the flat ground needs to be followed after a few days, the surgery is performed on the patient to get faster recovery. A qualified orthopedic or neurosurgeon can be of much help as they can take care of an immediate treatment regime as well. However, treating the military neck problem by using the best military neck pillow is one of the best treatment procedure which should not be ruled out. Studies showed that the military neck is many times caused due to an unsupportive pillow that does not provide proper support to the cervical region while sleeping or resting. Using at a time or using a too high pillow for your neck can also result in straight neck syndrome. Buying the best supportive pillow for your military neck is, therefore, an ultimate solution to cure the problem effectively. This will not only help in treating the condition naturally but also ensure that you sleep comfortably at the end of the day without affecting your cervical region further. A military neck pillow can be classified into two main types: These types of pillow are generally meant for providing support and comfort to the military neck with pain. The pain caused can be due to bad posture problems or muscle spasms. Neck rolls for the straight neck can be used 2-3 times in a day to provide relaxation to the stiffed neck muscles and straight curvature of the cervical spine. A therapeutic pillow such as is generally suggested for people who suffer from a military neck without pain or very little pain. These pillows are well designed for your neck region to provide additional support to your neck and shoulders while sleeping. Not only it promotes good sleeping posture but also it ensures that your head is properly aligned by preventing it from moving too far or forward from the pillow. Based on the severity of military neck pain, a specific type of pillow should be chosen to ensure that you get maximum relief from inflammation and spasms. People with very little pain can buy an inflatable pillow that comes with both the qualities. These can well maintain the shape as well as height so that you maintain the correct posture while sleeping. Overall, opting for the right type of pillow for a military neck can be the best natural way that promotes a faster recovery for you. Ensure that you combine it with specific exercises and stretching to get better results. While easing the pressure in the neck region, this all helps the spine to regain its natural curve once again to make your life better. Tags: , , , What Causes Left Side Head, Neck and Shoulder Pain?

01a6a54b-19fe-4ff6-b35c-a734d3b86609,"Medically reviewed by — It’s time to ditch the dumbbells, kick the kettlebells to the curb, and forget about those weight-training machines. OK, maybe not permanently, but at least long enough to add something new to your fitness routine: TRX training techniques. Invented by a former U.S. Navy SEAL, the TRX (short for total-body resistance exercise) turns every exercise into a challenge for your core by using two simple resources: gravity and your body weight. All you have to do is anchor the TRX straps to a secure spot — think a weight machine, a door frame, or monkey bars if you’re getting creative. Depending on the exercise, you’ll use your feet or hands to hold onto the straps. In general, a part of your body will be suspended above the floor. be leaning into or away from the straps to create resistance and destabilization. Knocking your balance out of whack gives you no other option but to adjust, which means engaging your and firing up your shoulders and hips to maintain control throughout the movement. Even better? The straps roll up into practically nothing, so it’s a take-anywhere, do-anywhere workout — provided you have somewhere stable to serve as your base. Ready to hang tough and build SEAL-worthy strength? Give these 44 TRX moves a try! Here’s how you pump up the plain ol’ . Hook your toes through the TRX stirrups so the tops of your feet face the floor. Lift your body up so your weight rests on the palms of your hands. Keeping core tight, bend elbows to lower chest between hands. You’ll feel your chest and shoulders working as you press back up to the starting position. Forget lying down to perform the typical chest press. Stand facing away from the anchor, with feet shoulder-width apart. Grab the handles with an overhand grip and extend arms in front of you at shoulder height. Lean forward so your body is at a slight angle. Bend elbows and lower chest between hands. You’ll engage your chest and arms as you push yourself back up to the starting position. Row, row, row your way to a fitter physique. Lie directly underneath the TRX. Bend knees and plant feet on the floor. Reach up to grasp the handles, palms facing each other, arms fully extended, as you lift your body a few inches off the floor. Keeping elbows close to your sides, bend elbows to pull torso up toward the handles until your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. Lower to return to the starting position. You’ll put your biceps and back to as you raise and lower your torso, slowly and with control. You can also perform this exercise with straight legs, heels grounded to the floor, and your body at a diagonal. Target those tris with this no-frills move. Kneel facing the anchor and grab the handles with an underhand grip. Stretch arms straight out in front of you and hold them shoulder-width apart. Bend elbows to lower your upper body toward the floor until your hands are in line with your ears — this is when you’ll start to feel those triceps burn. Return to the starting position. This move is the key to a strong back. Grab the handles with palms facing each other. Lean all the way back until weight is on your heels, arms are extended in front of you, and body forms a diagonal. Squeeze shoulder blades together and keep core tight as you bend elbows and pull torso up to meet hands. Lower to return to the starting position. If you’re a pro at the regular low row (see No. 5), challenge yourself by row with one arm at a time without losing your form — and get ready to feel the burn. If anyone knows a thing or two about sculpting rock-solid shoulders, it’s superstar swimmer Natalie Coughlin. And as it turns out, she’s a fan of TRX — she even shared some of her go-to moves, including this three-in-one exercise. This move includes three different grips to keep your mind and body guessing. Your plan of action: Row with your palms up for a few reps (Natalie suggests 3 reps per grip), switch to rowing with palms facing each other for a few reps, and then turn palms down for a few reps. Another of Coughlin’s favorite TRX moves, this shoulder strengthener is also known as a reverse fly (though “alligator” is more catchy, if you ask us). Stand facing the anchor and grab the handles with an overhand grip. Lean back until your body forms a diagonal line and the TRX straps are taut. Pull your body up as you pull back and up with right arm and back and down with left arm. Rotate torso to the right as you do so — you’ll put your shoulders and back to work as your obliques help stabilize your movements. Return to the starting position and repeat on the other side. Work those tris with this simple but challenging move! Set yourself up like you did for the push-up — facing away from the anchor point, feet shoulder-width apart. Grab the handles with an overhand grip. Shift weight to the balls of your feet as you extend arms out in front of you at eye level. Bend elbows until hands are behind your head, elbows framing either side of your face. Return to the starting position. The movement is small but super effective, and you’ll fire up your triceps with every rep. You might look a bit like a frog in motion, but you’ll definitely feel the burn in your upper body and core as you bring your knees to meet your elbows. Slip your feet into the stirrups so that tops of feet face the floor. Lower your body into a push-up. As you press back up into plank position, bring knees in toward elbows, allowing legs to draw apart. Hold for a few seconds, then return to the starting position. If there’s any exercise that will make you feel like you have wings, this is it. Stand facing away from the anchor with feet shoulder-width apart. Grab the handles with an overhand grip and extend arms in front of you at shoulder height. Lean forward so your body is at a diagonal. With control, spread arms out to a T (but keep elbows bent) as you lower your chest closer to the floor. This is where you’ll activate those chest muscles. Reverse the movement to return to the starting position. Stand facing the TRX anchor point and grab one handle in each hand, palms facing up. Lean all the way back until your arms are extended and the strap is taut. To activate your biceps, bend elbows (without letting them drop) until hands frame your temples, slowly pulling body up as you do so. Return to the starting position — and then ask for two tickets to the gun show, please. The push-up and the pike. Each is stellar on its own, these two movements are (we paraphrase Jack Johnson, of course). Get into your suspended plank position, perform a push-up, and then lift hips into a pike. Your body should look a bit like an upside-down V. Your abs will work overtime to bring you up and out of this motion. Be sure to keep legs straight and feet together throughout the movement. The real question is: fly? Stand facing the anchor with feet hip-width apart. Grasp the TRX handles and extend arms overhead into a Y, palms facing forward. Lean back on heels until your body forms a diagonal line. Pull your arms down in front of you until your palms nearly touch. Leading with hips, pull your body back up to standing, spreading arms back into a Y as you do. You’ll feel your back muscles working as you move from the “down” position to the Y position, and your abs will help you maintain stability throughout the movement. Tick, tock, tick, tock: The countdown is on for a super fit upper body, and this move gets you one step closer. Grab the handles with an overhand grip and lean forward until your body forms a diagonal line, weight on toes. Brace core and bend elbows, keeping them close to your body — you’ll remain in this “down” position throughout the exercise. Keeping left arm bent, extend right arm to the side until right elbow and wrist are almost in line with shoulder. This is when your shoulders, back, and biceps will start to burn. Reverse the movement to return to the starting position. Repeat with left arm. Continue alternating. Power pulls make for powerful bodies, especially since this move includes a rotation to fire up your abs and obliques in addition to your upper body Stand facing the anchor with a wide stance. Hold one TRX handle in your left hand at chest height, left elbow high and pointing behind body. Extend right arm so it’s in line with the TRX. As you lean back, extend left arm and rotate torso to the right to reach right arm out and slightly behind you. Reverse the movement to return to the starting position. Ready to set those abs on fire?Get in the starting position for a TRX chest press (see No. 2). As you fall forward, reach arms up until they’re in line with the rest of your body. This is where your abs and shoulders come in handy. Reverse the movement to return to the starting position. This move suits our fitness needs to a T, with a flying motion that strengthens the upper back and sculpts the shoulders to perfection. Facing the anchor, stagger your stance (right foot should be a few inches in front of left) and grasp one handle with each hand. Lean back so that weight is on your left foot and the TRX straps are taut, arms extended in front of chest. Pull against the TRX, shifting weight to your right foot as you open your arms into a T position. Return to the starting position. While you won’t exactly feel like you’re golfing when performing this move, it involves a swinging movement that challenges your upper body in a new way. Facing the anchor point, assume a wide stance and grab one TRX handle in each hand with an overhand grip. Keeping weight on your heels, bend forward at hips and reach arms forward at chest height. Look forward throughout the move. Rotate your torso, extending right arm behind you while you extend left arm in front of you. Reverse the movement to repeat on the other side. If regular lunges have become a piece of cake, up the ante with this move. In addition to working your lower body like a traditional lunge, it’ll test your balance and stability. Facing away from the anchor point, place left foot in both TRX stirrups and plant right foot firmly on the floor. Lower into a lunge, extending left leg behind you, without losing the bend in your knee. Return to the starting position and repeat on the other leg. You’ll feel your lower body and abs working hard to complete the movement and stabilize your body at the same time. Regular squats are essential to build a strong lower body. Add a TRX to the mix to help improve your form or even to give you some stability and support (if you need it). Stand facing the TRX, holding both handles in front of your waist with elbows bent by your sides. Lower into a squat, extending arms in front of you at eye level. Push yourself back up to the starting position. Get your hammies in on the action! Lie faceup with arms extended by your sides. Place heels in the stirrups and press down to secure them. Keeping core tight, lift hips off the floor. Pull heels in toward hips in a smooth and controlled motion — there’s no swinging here! Straighten legs to return to the starting position. 23. Single-leg hamstring pull-in (single-leg hamstring curl) Isolate the strength-training movement to one leg at a time, and boom — you’ve got a pretty killer variation on the regular hamstring exercise. Start as you would to perform the hamstring pull-in (see No. 22). Instead of pulling both heels toward your hips at the same time, alternate legs. Isolating each leg will make this move even more challenging. It might have a pretty name, but this is one tough leg exercise. Stand facing the anchor and grab the TRX handles, keeping elbows bent by your sides. Raise right knee until thigh is parallel to the floor. Squat low, simultaneously swinging right leg behind and across your body until you can place right toes on the floor to the left of your left foot. Return to the starting position. You’ll fire up your entire lower body as you move through this movement. Don’t limit your lunges to the typical backward and forward varieties. The side movement engages your hip adductors, which help your glutes and quads move properly. Stand facing the anchor, feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a TRX handle in each hand in front of your waist, elbows bent by your sides. Plant right leg firmly on the floor and take a big step to the side with left leg, bending left knee as you lower your body into a side lunge. Push back to the starting position and repeat on the other leg. : Quads, glutes, calves, hamstrings, adductors While challenging on their own, these two moves make an even more powerful pair. Perform the curtsy lunge (No. 24) immediately followed by the lateral lunge (No. 25). Now’s the time to multitask your way to fitness! This move’s a whole lot like the curtsy lunge but with a bonus: a knee-up movement that really makes you feel the burn throughout your legs. Stand facing the anchor. Hold the TRX handles out in front of you, palms facing each other. Bend your elbows and position them by your sides. Bring right knee up in front of you, until upper leg is at a 90-degree angle. Lower into a squat, bringing right leg back behind left, without letting right leg touch the floor. Reverse the movement and return to the knee-up position. Triceps, abs, hip flexors, quads, hamstrings Thought regular mountain climbers were tough? Try flipping your body and use your arms to hold yourself up from behind, engaging your entire body as you push through the movement. Sit underneath the TRX and hook your heels into the stirrups. Place palms on the floor behind you with fingers pointed toward feet. Lift your body off the floor, keeping a slight bend in your elbows. Bring right knee in toward chest, extend back to the starting position, and immediately repeat with left knee. Alternate as quickly as you can without losing form. Give a regular suspended plank a little extra push by getting your legs and hips in on the action. Get into regular suspended plank position. Keep core tight and separate legs as wide as you can without losing your form — this is when you’re putting your hips to work. Pause for a few seconds before returning to the starting position. Quads, glutes, calves, hamstrings, hip flexors, abs, shoulders, delts A truly excellent total-body move, this exercise will work you from your head to your toes. Stand with legs shoulder-width apart and grasp the handles in front of you. Lower into a squat as you extend arms up in front of you. Explode up to standing, spreading arms to form an overhead V. Quads, calves, glutes, outer thighs, hamstrings, lower back, abs For sprinter-worthy legs (ever notice how muscular their quads are?), add this move to your routine. You’ll fire up your entire lower body and use your core strength to stabilize yourself throughout the movement. Stand facing the TRX anchor and grasp the handles in front of your chest. Lean forward, shifting weight to the balls of your feet until the straps become taut. Bend your left knee in front of you. Keep core engaged and drive right knee forward until right thigh is parallel to the floor. Pause at the top, then return to the starting position. If regular glute bridges are the key to a superior posterior, just imagine what added instability can do for the rear view. Hint: It’ll make your hamstrings and glutes work even harder and pull your back muscles into the equation. Lie on your back and place your heels in the stirrups. Bring heels close to hips until your legs form a 90-degree angle. Extend arms out beside you and lift hips until upper body is at a diagonal. Lower back to the starting position. Abs, glutes, quads, hamstrings, shoulders, chest, upper back Walking — even running — on air isn’t just for science fiction anymore. Flying through this move will get your heart rate soaring, torch some serious calories, and set your muscles on fire. Slip your feet into the stirrups and settle into your trusty plank position. Just as you would with your feet on the floor, alternate bringing each knee to your chest. Speed up without losing control over your movements — a much bigger challenge when your feet are dangling! Shoulders, chest, arms, abs, glutes, legs Ah, burpees. The exercise everyone loves to hate, made even more challenging for some serious strong-body benefits. Adjust the TRX strap so that it hangs at mid-calf. Place your right foot in the stirrup behind you. Lower your body into plank position but keep your free left foot suspended next to right foot. Lower into a push-up and, as you raise your torso back up, pull left foot to your chest as you return to standing. Since traditional single-leg squats can be struggle city for a lot of us, we’re pretty thrilled that this move provides as much (or as little) assistance in the stabilizing department as we might need. Stand facing the TRX, holding both handles in front of your waist, with elbows bent by your sides. Lift left leg out in front of you so it’s parallel to the floor. Lower into a squat on your right leg, extending arms in front of you at eye level. Push yourself back up to the starting position. You’ll feel your lower body working as you lower down and push back up. Chest, triceps, obliques, quads, lower back, shoulders, core (plus, it opens up your hips) Regular aren’t for the faint of heart. Add a destabilizing element — that’d be having your feet suspended behind you — and you’ve got one amazing shape-up move on your hands. Start in plank position with one foot in each TRX stirrup. Lower your body into a push-up, bringing right knee to right elbow — this is when you’re firing up your obliques. Return to the starting position. Repeat with left leg. Another two-in-one stunner, this move combines an excellent lower-body move with a super effective upper-body exercise. Stand facing the TRX, holding both handles in front of your waist, with elbows bent by your sides. Lean back, extending arms in front of you at eye level. Lower your body into a squat, using the TRX straps to help you keep your balance. Push back up to the starting position, and then pull body up and toward the anchor as you bend your elbows and bring chest closer to palms. Return to the starting position. Shoulders, chest, arms, abs, glutes, legs, obliques In case you’ve mastered the single-leg burpee (or you’re just up for a new challenge), try body-rocking move. The “scorpion” part of this movement targets your obliques, working to whittle your middle and build a super strong core. With one foot hooked into the stirrups behind you, perform a single-leg burpee as usual. After the push-up portion, remain in plank position. Bring your free leg under and across your body, then swing it back around to move it over and your body. Return to standing. For a basic but challenging way to work the TRX into your routine, pump up your planks with a little (more) instability. Face away from the anchor and slip your toes into the stirrups so your feet face downward. Just as you would for a regular plank, lift your upper body onto your forearms. Challenge yourself to hold the position as long as you can without compromising your form. Who knew swinging around could make you break such a sweat? Face away from the TRX, place your feet in the stirrups, and get into plank position. Keeping legs together throughout the movement, swing them over to the left, bending knees toward left elbow and engaging obliques. Swing legs back into plank position and then over to the right elbow in one fluid motion. Return to plank position. Spin your torso (right round) for a strong midsection. Stand facing the anchor point and grab the TRX straps with both hands. Position your legs in a wide stance and lean back until the straps are taut in front of you. As you pull your body up, twist to the right, keeping arms straight and core tight. Return to the starting position and repeat on the left side. TRX + yoga = a match made in fitness heaven. Lie on your left side and place both feet in the stirrups. Stack your elbow under your shoulder. Lift yourself into a side plank. To make it harder,reach your free hand under your torso to the floor behind your body. Looking for yet another variation? Try lowering your hip to the floor and raising it back up into the side plank. Hold for a few seconds at the top, and then repeat. Assume the position! Plank position, that is. Place your feet in the stirrups and lift your body into a plank. Keeping legs and arms straight and core tight, lift your hips into an inverted V. Lower back to the starting position. You’ll feel your abs working and your shoulders struggling to hold you up as you lift and lower your hips. Why not turn a crunch into a biceps exercise? With the TRX, you totally can! Sit facing the anchor and grab the handles with an underhand grip. Lie down with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, arms extended up in front of you. Keep your core tight and lift your shoulders and back off the floor, simultaneously curling your hands toward your shoulders. Lower to return to the starting position.

50cab58c-96ed-449e-9f76-7a6b49ad3e20,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). A normal spine, when viewed from behind appears straight. However, a spine affected by kyphosis has a forward curvature of the back bones (vertebrae) in the upper back area, giving an abnormally rounded or ""humpback"" appearance. This is sometimes known as roundback or a dowager's hump. Kyphosis is a curvature of the spine measuring 50 degrees or greater on an X-ray. The normal spine can bend from 20 to 45 degrees of curvature in the upper back area. Kyphosis is a type of spinal deformity. A child can be born with kyphosis (congenital) or it can be caused by the following conditions: Brittle bone disease (osteogenesis imperfecta). A condition that causes bones to fracture with minimal force. Scheuermann disease. A condition that causes the vertebrae to curve forward in the upper back area. The cause of Scheuermann disease is unknown and is commonly seen in males. Postural kyphosis. The most common type of kyphosis. It generally becomes noticeable in adolescence and can be associated with slouching versus a spinal abnormality. Exercise is used to help correct posture. The following are the most common symptoms of kyphosis. However, each person may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include: The head bends forward compared to the rest of the body When bending forward, the height of the upper back appears higher than normal Back pain, pain down the legs, and changes in bowel and bladder habits are not commonly seen in people with kyphosis. If you have these types of symptoms, see your healthcare provider. The symptoms of kyphosis may look like other spinal conditions or deformities, or may happen because of an injury or infection. Always talk with your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. The healthcare provider makes the diagnosis of kyphosis with a complete medical history, physical exam, and diagnostic tests. For a child, the healthcare provider will want to have a prenatal and birth history of the child. They will also ask if other family members are known to have kyphosis. The healthcare provider also will ask about developmental milestones since some types of kyphosis can be associated with other neuromuscular disorders. Developmental delays may require further medical evaluation. A diagnostic test that uses invisible electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues, bones, and organs onto film. This test is used to measure and evaluate the curve. With the use of a full-spine X-ray, the healthcare provider measures the angle of the spinal curve. A treatment plan can often be made based on this measurement. A nuclear imaging technique that uses a very small amount of radioactive material, which is injected into the bloodstream to be detected by a scanner. This test shows blood flow to the bone and cell activity within the bone. A diagnostic procedure that uses a combination of large magnets and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body. This test is done to rule out any associated abnormalities of the spinal cord and nerves. This is an imaging test that uses X-rays and a computer to make detailed images of the body. A CT scan shows details of the bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans are more detailed than general X-rays. Early detection of kyphosis is important for successful treatment. Healthcare providers, and even some school programs, regularly look for signs of kyphosis in children. Treatment will depend on your symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. The goal of treatment is to stop the progression of the curve and minimize deformity. Treatment may include: The child will need observation and repeated exams. Progression of the curve depends on the child's skeletal growth and maturity. Curve progression often slows down or stops after the child reaches puberty. If the child is still growing, the healthcare provider may prescribe a brace. The type of brace and the amount of time spent in the brace will be discussed with you by your healthcare provider. In rare instances, surgery is recommended when the curve measures 75 degrees or more on X-ray, and bracing is not successful in slowing down the progression of the curve. Possible complications of kyphosis depend on the type of kyphosis your child has. With Scheuermann kyphosis, there may be pain with activity or with long periods of sitting or standing. Severe kyphosis can harm how the lungs work. Kyphosis is a type of spinal deformity. Kyphosis is defined as a curvature of the spine measuring 50 degrees or greater on an X-ray. A child can be born with it (congenital) or it can be caused by certain conditions. The most common symptoms may include difference in shoulder or shoulder blade height, the head bends forward, and tight hamstring muscles. : The goal of treatment is to stop the progression of the curve and minimize deformity Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider: Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.

8b8b78d0-26e8-4665-8a38-4233166eacc2,"Try This: 15 Free-Weight Exercises to Consider and Why You Should Medically reviewed by — Machines and cables and dumbbells, oh my! The gym floor is chock-full of equipment to choose from, but where should you start? Although machines have their place — they’re great for beginners as they assist with form and allow you to lift heavier — free weights can give you more bang for your buck. Free weights include any weight you can pick up and move around, such as dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells. Unlike machines, where the movement — and you — are fixed, free weights allow you to work in any range of motion you’d like. This requires you to work against gravity and use those stabilizer muscles to engage. Below, we’ve curated 15 free-weight exercises for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. Are you ready to get lifting? Before you start a new workout regimen, think about how to maximize your time and effort. Are you looking to build strength, gain size, or increase your endurance? Decide what your goal is and create your regimen accordingly. To build strength and size, stick with high weight, low reps, and more rest between sets. For endurance, go for lighter weights, higher reps, and less rest between sets. Whatever your goal, aim to work out 4 or 5 days per week. You can get a good workout in 20 minutes or in an hour, so don’t worry about duration as much as the quality and composition of your routine. Avoid training the same muscle groups hard 2 days in a row; recovery is super important to progress. In general, you’ll want to perform harder, full-body exercises, , before more targeted, smaller movements, like bicep curls. Choose heavy, challenging weights — whatever that means for you — if your goal is to gain strength and size. Opt for lighter (but still challenging at the end of your set) weights for more of an endurance approach. If you don’t perform exercises with proper form, you could miss out on benefits of the movement, or, in more serious cases, cause injury. Practice the movement with your body weight before you add additional weight. Once you’ve thought these points through, begin with one of routines below. If you’re new to lifting weights, don’t fret. This beginner-friendly free-weight routine is a great place to start. As a beginner, focus on working up to 3 sets of 10–12 reps of each of these exercises with as light of a free weight as you need. Rest for 1 minute between sets. When this gets easy, choose a heavier free weight. After you’ve upped your weight several times and feel strong in the movements below, move on to the intermediate routine. Glute bridges are a key exercise to strengthen the posterior chain, or the back of your body. This exercise hits many of the same muscles as a squat would without placing undue stress on your lower back. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Position a dumbbell just above your hip bones, holding it in place with your hands. Brace your core and push up through your heels, hiking your hips up to the sky and squeezing your glutes as you go. At the top, your body should form a straight line from shoulders to knees. Pause here, then release back to starting position. A lunge is a unilateral lower body exercise, meaning it works one leg at a time. It’s a great movement to promote leg strength, as well as balance. It can also help remedy strength discrepancies from side to side. Practice this movement with just your body weight to ensure that you’re stable. When you’re ready, use lightweight dumbbells to start. Hold one dumbbell in each hand with your arms down by your side and your feet shoulder-width apart. Lift your right foot off the ground and take a big step forward, bending your knee and lowering your body as you go. Stop when your right thigh is parallel to the ground. Ensure that your chest stays proud and your shoulders stay back throughout the movement. Push up from your right foot, returning to starting position. Improve your balance and posture and strengthen your entire upper body with the overhead shoulder press. Start with two lightweight dumbbells, ensuring that you have the movement down before working on building strength. If you feel your lower back straining or your torso moving to push the weight overhead, try splitting your stance to provide more balance, or try a lighter free weight. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand. Bring the weights up to the fronts of your shoulders, palms facing out. Keeping your core braced and torso upright, push the dumbbells up, extending your arms as you go. Pause at the top, then release, bending your elbows and letting the weights come back down to above the shoulders. An accessible exercise for beginners, the row also hits all of those important posture muscles, like your: You’ll just need one dumbbell. Choose a moderate weight to start. Position yourself next to a bench, table, or other elevated surface, bracing yourself with your torso slightly bent. Split your stance and hold a dumbbell in your free hand. Row up, pulling your elbow up and back and squeezing your shoulder blade. Essentially a chest press on the ground, a floor press is a great exercise to teach bench press to beginners because you can feel your shoulder and back engagement with your upper body flat across the floor. The main muscles worked in the floor press are your: Lie with your back and feet flat on the ground with a dumbbell in each hand. Position your upper arms at a 45-degree angle to your body with the dumbbells in the air. Pause at the top, the return to starting position. If you’re no stranger to weightlifting, or if you’ve graduated from the beginner routine, try the intermediate routine below. Complete 3–4 sets here, with a minimum of 8 reps and a maximum of 15. Regardless of how many reps your programming is calling for, you should barely be able to complete the last one with proper form. Adjust your weight accordingly if this isn’t the case. Touted as , squats have a plethora of benefits. Not only will they strengthen some of the largest muscles in your body, they’ll help you perform everyday tasks with ease. Weighted squats can actually be considered a full-body exercise, but they target muscles like your: Choose a lightweight barbell to start, as you’ll have to safely load it onto your shoulders from the floor. Once you can back-squat more than 30 or so pounds, transition to a squat rack to ensure that you can set up and squat safely. Load a barbell onto your shoulders, positioning your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Initiate the squat by sitting back in your hips, then bending your knees. Keep your chest up and gaze ahead. When your thighs hit parallel, pause and push up back to starting position. Deadlifts are a super beneficial exercise to incorporate into your routine, but nailing correct form can take some practice. Because it hits muscles from head to toe, the strength benefits are nearly unmatched. Again, start light here until you can execute with proper form. Deadlifts have a reputation for stressing the lower back. Place a barbell on the ground and stand right behind it, feet shoulder-width apart. Hinge at the waist with a straight back, bend your knees, and grip the barbell. Roll your shoulders down and back, inhale and pull the barbell up by straightening your legs. Once your legs are straight and the barbell is resting against your body, sit back in your hips, bend your knees, and return the barbell to the ground. A progression on the single-arm dumbbell row, the bent-over row takes it up a notch with no added support and two dumbbells instead of one. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with extended arms. Hinge at your waist 45 degrees, keeping your back straight and neck neutral. Bracing your core, pull your elbows up and back, squeezing your shoulder blades at the top. Pause here, then release back to starting position. Challenge your chest in a different way with the floor chest fly. You really need to be in tune with what muscles are initiating the movement here to ensure that you’re executing with proper form. Lie on your back, knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Position a dumbbell in each hand and extend your arms out so your body forms a T shape. Your palms should be facing up toward the ceiling. Keeping a slight bend in your elbow, brace your core and pull the dumbbells up toward the center of your body, using your chest muscles to do so. When the dumbbells touch in the middle, pause and release back to starting position. A progression on the overhead shoulder press, the Arnold press — made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger — requires a bit more finesse. It targets the front of the shoulder a bit more. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Bend your elbows like you’re doing a bicep curl, bringing the dumbbells to your shoulders with your palms facing your body. This is the starting position. Brace your core and begin to rotate your palms out while you simultaneously extend your arms above your head. Pause here, then release back to starting position, rotating your palms back toward your body as you go. When you can solidly complete the beginner and intermediate routines, give the advanced routine a go. Here, you’ll challenge more of your balance, stability, and strength. Aim for 3–4 sets of 8–15 reps, upping the weight accordingly. Take your row up a notch with the renegade version, which combines a plank with a row. Start with lighter dumbbells here until you get the form — and endurance — down. Assume a high plank position but grip a dumbbell with each hand. The dumbbells should be positioned parallel to your body. Maintaining a strong core, row up with your right arm, pulling the elbow up and back and squeezing the shoulder blade. Keep your chest square to the ground. Release and return to starting position, then row up with your left arm. Up the ante with a single-leg dumbbell deadlift. It’ll give you the same benefits of a deadlift with extra core work. You won’t be able to go quite as heavy, but the added balance work will still challenge you. Put your weight in your right foot and with a soft knee, begin to hinge forward at the waist, kicking your left leg up behind you. Keep your chest and your back straight. Keep hinging forward until your left leg is parallel to the ground. Your hips should stay square to the ground throughout this movement. Challenge your balance and strength again with the Bulgarian split squat, a can’t miss exercise for leg strength. Stand about 2 feet in front of a knee-level bench or step. Position the top of your right foot on the bench with your left foot far enough in front of the bench where you can comfortably lunge. Brace your core, keep your chest proud, and lower down on your left leg, bending your knee. Stop when your thigh is parallel to the ground. Push up through your left foot to return to starting position. One of the “Big 3” weightlifting exercises, the barbell bench press is one of the best upper body exercises for overall strength. Go conservative on your weight unless you have a spotter with you. Lie with a flat back on a bench with the barbell positioned at chest level. Grip the barbell at a shoulder-width distance. Bracing your core and engaging your shoulders, inhale and push the barbell up off the rack, then lower it until it skims your chest. Push back up to starting position in an explosive movement, exhaling as you go. A front squat targets the quads a bit more than a regular squat. It also requires more core strength as the weight is shifted to your front instead of on your back. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Bend your elbows and bring the weights to a resting position on your shoulders, with one end set on it for stability. Resting the dumbbells here, squat, sitting back in your hips. Push up through your heels to return to starting position. Choose a goal, start at an appropriate level, and watch your results come.

There are different types which would require different treatments. You may not need any treatment. Kyphosis is a spinal condition. In people with kyphosis, the spine curves outward more than it should. As a result, the upper back looks overly rounded. The curvature can make people looked hunched or slouching. People sometimes call it hunchback or round back. The spine has natural curves. These curves support our posture and help us stand straight. But excessive curvature can affect posture and make standing difficult. Most of the time, kyphosis doesn’t cause health problems or need medical treatment. But it may make you feel self-conscious about how you look. In severe cases, kyphosis can cause pain or breathing problems. Severe kyphosis may require surgery to correct. Kyphosis appears more often in teenagers, whose bones are growing rapidly. But it can develop any me. It may also develop in older adults. As people age, the vertebrae lose flexibility, and the spine may begin to tilt forward. The three most common types of kyphosis are postural kyphosis, Scheuermann’s kyphosis and congenital kyphosis. The most common type of kyphosis, postural kyphosis usually happens during the teenage years. Slouching or poor posture stretches the ligaments and muscles holding the vertebrae (spinal bones) in place. That stretching pulls the vertebrae out of their normal position, causing a rounded shape in the spine. Has a flexible curve — changing position changes the curvature. Happens to teenagers and affects girls more than boys. This type is named after the radiologist who first identified the condition. It happens when the vertebrae have a different shape. Instead of being rectangular, the vertebrae have a wedge shape. The wedge-shaped bones curve forward, making the spine look rounded. Appears more often in teens and affects boys more than girls. Can be more severe than postural kyphosis, especially in people below average weight. Causes a rigid, not flexible, curve — changing position won’t change the curve. Can be painful, especially during activity or when standing or sitting for a long me. Congenital means a condition you are born with. People with congenital kyphosis were born with a spine that didn’t develop properly before birth. Typically needs surgery at a young age to stop the curve from getting worse. May be present along with other birth defects that affect the heart and kidneys. Kyphosis happens in about 0.04% to 10% of school-age kids (up to one in 10 children, or as many as 5.6 million in the U.S.). Scheuermann’s kyphosis makes up most of those cases. Most people with kyphosis receive a diagnosis when they are 12 to 17 years old. Boys have Scheuermann’s kyphosis about twice as ofen as girls do. Poor posture, leaning back in chairs, carrying heavy bags. Problem that developed in the spine before birth. Age, since the spine starts to curve more as people get older. The main symptom of kyphosis is having rounded shoulders or a hump in the upper back. Tight hamstrings (muscles in the back of the thigh) can also be a symptom. People who have a more severe curve may have other symptoms, including: Pain or stiffness in the back and shoulder blades. Shortness of breath or other breathing trouble due to the spine pressing against the airways. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 11/06/2020.

It exists as part of the normal spine alignment and may measure up to forty-five degrees. Studies looking at chest radiographs in normal individuals have shown that this number can increase with age. Curvatures in the coronal plane (side to side plane) are not part of the normal spine alignment and when they exist, with a minimum of 10 degrees, it is called . A variety of causes and conditions may result in excessive kyphosis, however, the types that are seen most frequently include postural kyphosis and Scheuermann’s kyphosis. Postural kyphosis usually becomes noticeable during adolescence and occurs more commonly in girls than in boys. Parents may perceive an abnormal prominence in the young person’s posture, or it may be detected during a routine visit to the pediatrician. Illustration of a normal spine with forward bending. Illustration of increased prominence from Kyphosis with forward bending. As with other forms of kyphosis, diagnosis is made on the basis of physical examination - the patient stands perpendicular to the orthopaedist who can then assess the curve - and with radiographs (). Postural kyphosis is distinguished by the lack of rigidity in the spine and the lack of structural abnormalities of the vertebral bodies on radiographs. Most patients with postural kyphosis can achieve good results—correction of the curve to within the normal range—with education in proper posture and participation in an exercise program. In the small percentage of patients who do not respond to this treatment, the orthopedist may prescribe the use of a brace until the curve is corrected or the child reaches skeletal maturity. Results of this treatment vary with the patient’s willingness to wear the brace as advised and commitment to a physical therapy regimen. Radiograph of a patient wearing brace demonstrating correction Scheuermann’s kyphosis is a condition characterized by excessive kyphosis and structural change of the vertebrae. Patients with this deformity have a curve that is more rigid than that seen in postural kyphosis. Radiographs reveal irregularities in the spinal discs in at least three adjacent levels. As with postural kyphosis, the condition is usually diagnosed in adolescence. When left untreated, Scheuermann’s kyphosis can progress. Accompanying pain and cosmetic deformity can also be anticipated. For the young patient with Scheuermann’s kyphosis and a small curve, one that is less than 50 degrees, treatment by bracing can be effective. Physical therapy alone is not usually effective in these individuals. Surgery may be indicated in those patients with large curves (>70 degrees) and or pain. The orthopedic surgeon restores physiologic alignment to the spine by performing one or more of the following: excising abnormal discs, fusing the affected vertebrae together, and placing instrumentation in the spine as needed to maintain correct posture while the spine heals. Surgery through the back of the spine is frequently the procedure of choice, however, patients with a large rigid curve, in addition to the posterior procedure, may also require an anterior approach through the chest. The radiographs of a 14-year-old girl with Scherermann's Kyphosis measuring 85 degrees who underwent spinal fusion with instrumentation correcting her spine to 36 degrees. With increasingly sophisticated surgical techniques and instrumentation, surgical treatment for kyphosis is easier to recover from than ever before. Patients who require only one posterior procedure (incision in the back) are up and out of bed the next day. For those who undergo a second anterior procedure, the incision is made through the chest or thoracoscopically and recovery may be more gradual. Patients may not need to wear a brace following surgery and generally experience minimal loss of motion. General anesthesia is used during these surgeries and hospitalization lasts between 5-7 days depending on the extent of surgery and age. Physical therapy after surgery is generally recommended and the requirement varies with age. In patients with good bone quality, excellent results can be achieved. Success is defined as a solid fusion that eliminates pain and in which the correction of the curve is achieved and maintained, providing a balanced spine. As noted, postural kyphosis and Scheuermann’s kyphosis are just two types of kyphosis that require treatment. Other types include: , a developmental defect which is present at birth , which is associated with other neuromuscular disease such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and polio , which occurs with serious injury , which can occur following surgery to remove the posterior arch of a vertebra, as in the treatment of spinal stenosis or tumors Post-menopausal women may develop excessive kyphosis with vertebral wedging as the result of the reduction in bone density that accompanies . In patients with this condition, kyphosis is difficult to correct. However, measures can be taken to prevent early development by good perimenopausal counseling and medication, which may be obtained through the .

Scoliosis is a very common type of spinal deformity or abnormality. These days, more and more people, most especially children and teenagers, suffer from this kind of condition. However, only a few of us are actually aware of the important facts about scoliosis. So what is scoliosis and what are the different scoliosis symptoms? Scoliosis is defined medically as an abnormal curvature of the spine or the backbone of the body. The spine usually has normal curves when it is viewed from the side. However, this should appear straight when it is looked at the front or the back. There are actually different kinds of spinal curves. These curves include kyphosis, which is a spinal curve viewed from the side that shows a forward bending. Nevertheless, kyphosis is considered normal once it is located at the middle or the thoracic portion of the spine. Another type of curve is called lordosis. Lordosis is a curve that is also seen from the side; however, the spine is now bent backward. Lordosis is normally located at the upper cervical spine and as well as the lower or lumbar region of the spine. Nonetheless, people who suffer scoliosis develop additional curves on either side thus causing the bones to twist on each other. This forms a shape in the spine that is similar to the letters “C” and/or an “S”. According to recent statistics, scoliosis is approximately two times more common in girls than in boys. This can affect about 2% of females and only 0.5% of males. Just like what is mentioned earlier, this condition is common among individuals aged 10 years and older. Nevertheless, this can still affect anyone regardless of age and gender. Studies have also proven that scoliosis is hereditary. This means that parents who have scoliosis can pass this condition to their children. However, the severity of the curve in parents does not affect the severity of the condition in their children. In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is usually unknown or idiopathic. The particular type of scoliosis is actually described based on the age when the scoliosis developed. If the condition occurs to a person who is less than 3 years old, then it is called as the infantile idiopathic scoliosis. If the scoliosis develops between ages 3 to 10 years old, then it is already considered juvenile idiopathic scoliosis. For people ages 10 years and older, this is commonly called as the adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Approximately more than 80 percent of people with scoliosis are idiopathic in nature and the majority of these are among adolescent girls. One of the most common symptoms of scoliosis is the noticeable abnormal curve of the spine. This is usually a mild change and can be first noticed by a family member. The change in the curve of the spine happens very gradually, which is why some may find it difficult to observe not until the condition is already severe. This is the reason why most scoliosis is only seen during school screening examinations. Some of the indicative signs of scoliosis are the abrupt changes of the fit of clothing to the body. Some can find their pant legs to be longer on one side compared to the other, which is affected by the change in posture brought about by scoliosis. Scoliosis can also make the head look off center and/or the hip or shoulder to be higher than the opposite side. An obvious curve on one side of the rib cage can also be observed due to the twisting of the vertebrae and the ribs. This can likewise cause shortness of breath and as well as chest pain. Most cases of scoliosis do not cause any pain; however, there are also some types that can produce severe back discomfort. However, this should be assessed first by the doctor in order to make sure that it is indeed caused by scoliosis. Below are the summarized symptoms of scoliosis in the body. • The shoulders are not equal in height. One shoulder blade is more prominent than the other. • The head is not centered directly above the pelvis. • A prominent hip is noticeable • There is presence of uneven wrists • The rib cage is at different heights • There are evident changes in the appearance and texture of the skin overlying the spine such as dimples, hairy patches and color changes. • There is also leaning of the entire body to one side In order to test these symptoms and to diagnose scoliosis, several tests can be performed such as the Adam’s Forward Bend Test, wherein the person is asked to lean forward with feet together and bend 90 degrees at the waist. This way, the examiner can easily view the angle or the symmetry of the trunk that is created by the curves of the spine. This test; however, cannot determine accurately the exact degree or severity of the condition. Nevertheless, X-rays, CT scans or MRI can be done in order to evaluate the condition thoroughly. These are some of the facts about scoliosis, which includes some of its common causes, symptoms and diagnostic procedures.

Continue reading as we explore more about kyphosis, what causes it, and how it can be treated. Many people find the word “dowager” offensive because it has been a negative and insulting way to refer to older women. Using appropriate medical terms for health conditions is important because outdated and hurtful terms generalize and stereotype individuals with medical conditions. Kyphosis, for example, can actually affect individuals of any gender or age. The has a natural curvature. These curves help us to stand upright and stay balanced while doing so. Kyphosis happens when the angle of the spine is out of the typical range. The condition can vary in seriousness. Generally speaking, the greater the curve of the spine, the more severe the symptoms are. Although rare, more severe symptoms can occur as the spine continues to curve over time and compress other parts of the body, such as the lungs, nerves, and digestive tract. increased trouble with physical tasks such as walking, looking upwards, or getting up from a sitting position digestive issues, such as or A variety of factors can lead to the development of kyphosis. They include: slouching or hunching, such as at a computer or in front of a TV carrying heavy loads on your back, such as a backpack full of books Postural kyphosis is a common form of kyphosis that’s generally mild. People with postural kyphosis can often correct the condition by . Some spinal injuries, such as , can damage the spine and affect its curvature. Underlying bone or spinal conditions can also lead to kyphosis, particularly in older populations. Some examples of these conditions include and . Curvature of the spine begins to increase naturally with age. It’s estimated that the prevalence of kyphosis in older adults ranges from . In addition to bone and spinal conditions, other factors that naturally occur with aging can contribute to the development of kyphosis, including: This can affect the muscles and ligaments in the back as well as posture and positioning. Studies have that weakened back muscles, specifically the spinal extensors, are correlated with an increased kyphosis angle in women older than 60. Decreased input from the senses, which can include things like vision, touch, and spatial awareness, can also posture and positioning of the head or neck. Sometimes kyphosis can occur as a congenital condition. This happens if the spine doesn’t develop properly prior to birth. Kyphosis can also occur when the spine doesn’t develop properly during a growth spurt. This is called . Instead of rectangular-shaped vertebrae, people with this condition have vertebrae that are more triangle-shaped. This causes increased spinal curvature. Cancer of the can lead to weakening of the vertebrae, possibly contributing to kyphosis. Additionally, and treatments for cancer can have a similar effect. To diagnose kyphosis, your doctor will first perform a physical examination. They’ll record your height, examine your back, and may also press on your spine to see if there’s any pain or tenderness. Then, they’ll ask you to bend forward with your arms hanging down freely, like you’re reaching to touch your toes. This helps them to better see the curve of your spine. You may also be asked to lie down. This can aid your doctor in determining if your kyphosis is caused by bad posture or by a structural problem in the spine. The spine may straighten while lying down in people with postural kyphosis. An can help determine the amount of curvature in the spine. If your doctor wants more detailed images, they may also use a . In cases of severe kyphosis, your doctor may perform other tests to see if your condition is affecting other parts of your body. These can include tests that evaluate lung and nerve function. In some people, mild kyphosis may not cause symptoms. But if you start to notice an increase in pain, numbness or weakness, or spinal curvature, make an appointment with your doctor. There are several treatment options for kyphosis, depending on your overall health and the severity of your condition. Your doctor will work with you to develop an appropriate treatment plan. If you’re concerned about your kyphosis and don’t already have a primary care provider, you can view doctors in your area through the . For people with postural kyphosis, attention to good , such as sitting up straight, can help correct the spinal curvature. Ergonomics may also help. Getting regular can help strengthen the muscles in your back. can help you to increase flexibility and strengthen the muscles in your back and core.

If you have an underlying condition such as , your doctor will focus on treating it to prevent your kyphosis from getting worse. Using a back brace can help keep spinal curvature from worsening, particularly in younger people who are still growing. Your doctor will let you know when and for how long you should wear the brace. Your doctor may recommend that you work with a physical therapist to perform exercises and stretches that can help improve your condition. People with severe kyphosis or complications from kyphosis may need surgery to reduce the curve in their spine. This is often performed using . The outlook for kyphosis can depend on several factors. These include your overall health, your age, and the severity of the condition. If it’s detected early, many people who have kyphosis can go on to live active lives and may not require surgery. Regular doctor’s appointments may be necessary to monitor the condition and make sure that spinal curvature isn’t worsening. Kyphosis can worsen with age, which is why early detection is so important. Severe kyphosis can cause complications, such as problems with movement or balance and breathing difficulties. These cases may require treatment with surgery. Kyphosis is a condition where the spine curves at an increased angle, causing a rounding or hump to form around the upper back or shoulders. There are many possible causes of kyphosis, including aging, poor posture, and spinal conditions. In the past, kyphosis was referred to as “dowager’s hump”. However, this isn’t a medical term and is no longer acceptable to use. Even though kyphosis is common in older adults, it can occur in people of all ages.

It usually consists of two curves, the original abnormal curve and a compensatory curve in the opposite direction. Scoliosis may be functional, structural, or idiopathic. Functional or postural scoliosis usually occurs as a result of a discrepancy in leg length and corrects when the patient bends toward the convex side. Structural scoliosis is related to vertebral bone deformities and thus does not correct with posture changes. Idiopathic scoliosis (the most common kind) may be transmitted as an autosomal dominant or multifactorial trait. scoliotic, adj. Scoliosis affects approx. 7 million people in the U.S. A curve of 10° affects approx. 3% of all individuals. Curves less than 20° are approx. equal in males and females. Scoliosis is most common during late childhood, esp. in girls.Scoliosis rarely produces any symptoms until it is well established; then backache, fatigue, and dyspnea from ventilatory compromise may occur.Diagnosis is based on physical examination, anteroposterior and lateral spinal x-rays, and by using the Cobb angle to measure the angle of curvature.Scoliosis may be treated with a thoracolumbar orthosis to straighten the abnormal spinal curvature and prevent it from twisting, or, when the Cobb angle exceeds 50°, with corrective orthopedic surgery, e.g., the placement of a supportive rod along the spine or spinal fusion.Muscle strengthening exercises should be done daily when the patient is in and out of the brace. Follow-up assessment and brace adjustment should be done periodically. As the skeleton matures, brace wear is gradually reduced to nighttime use only. Surgery is indicated when scoliosis progresses despite bracing. Postoperative visits are required for several months to monitor correction stability. Provisions are made to assist the adolescent and family to meet the psychosocial needs associated with the illness. The patient and family are taught about treatment management (cast-care, brace-use, traction, electrical stimulation, or surgery), exercises, activity level, skin care, prevention of complications, and breathing exercises. When necessary, preoperative teaching is provided, including preanesthesia breathing exercises, postoperative use of an incentive spirometer, surgical pain management, and prevention of thromboembolic or other complications. Following surgery, all general patient care concerns apply.Upon discharge, home-health care may be needed, and the school-age child or adolescent will require education in the home until he or she is able to return to school. Activity and activity limitations are explained, and diversional activities suggested. The patient is encouraged to provide self-care as much as possible. Wearing one's own clothes, washing and styling one's own hair, and applying make-up improve morale. Educational and support resources are discussed with the patient and family. Pediatricians, pediatric nurse practitioners, school nurses, and other health professionals caring for children should include screening for scoliosis during physical examinations. Scoliosis due to fibrous scar tissue contraction resulting from necrosis. Scoliosis present at birth, usually the result of defective embryonic development of the spine. Scoliosis in the lumbar spine caused by tilting of the pelvis caused by a hip disorder. Scoliosis following empyema and retraction of one side of the chest. Scoliosis caused not by actual spinal deformity but by another condition such as unequal leg lengths. The curve reduces when the other condition is ameliorated. Scoliosis due to habitually assumed improper posture or position. Scoliosis caused by infection or inflammation near the spine, resulting in local muscle spasm. Scoliosis due to weakening of the spinal muscles. Structural scoliosis caused by congenital or acquired neurological disorders. Scoliosis caused by tilting the head to compensate for visual defects or for extraocular muscle imbalance. Scoliosis caused by bony deformity of the spine. Scoliosis of the lumbar spine, usually away from the side of pathology. The body is attempting to move a nerve root away from a bulging intervertebral disk herniation. Scoliosis caused by the patient’s assumption of a laterally bent posture to reduce symptoms of sciatica. Scoliosis due to a difference in the length of the legs. An irreversible scoliosis that has a fixed rotation. The vertebral bodies rotate toward the convexity of the curve; the rotation results in a posterior rib hump in the thoracic region on the convex side of the curve.

050876f6-0076-4ac5-ab0e-18f3b68fead8,". The management of low back pain is a major health and economic concern in the U.S. As one of the leading causes of physical limitation in the U.S, low back pain is a chief source of incapacitation, suffering and expense. The medical costs, not including disability claims, directly attributed to low back pain exceeded $24 billion in 1990 (Lahad, Malter, Berg, & Deyo, 1994). It is also recognized that the cause of this health problem is very difficult to establish because of the irregular nature of its occurrences in individuals and the unclear etiology of low back pain. Although the effectiveness of exercise as a prevention strategy and intervention for low back pain has recently been challenged (Lahad et al., 1994), this awareness actually suggests the need for more controlled studies that may eventually lead to the development of new and improved exercise designs that prove to be viable interventions. This article will review much of the framework about what is known about this mystery and address practical issues for the fitness instructor, personal trainer and health educator. The term low back pain refers to pain in the lumbosacral area of the spine encompassing the distance from the 1st lumbar vertebra to the 1st sacral vertebra. This is the area of the spine where the lordotic curve forms. The most frequent site of low back pain is in the 4th and 5th lumbar segment. 1. At some time in their life, 60% to 80% of the population will have low back pain (Cailliet, 1988) . Of those experiencing low back pain, 30% to 70% will have recurrent episodes. 2. Recovery is anywhere between 3 days and 6 weeks for 80% to 90% of acute assaults of back pain and becomes a chronic problem for 5% to 10% of the sufferers (Frymoyer, 1988) . 3. Male and female individuals are affected equally (Helliovaara, 1989). 4. There is evidence that 12% to 26% of children and adolescents experience low back pain although most cases of low back pain occur in persons between that ages of 25 and 60 yr, peaking at about 40 yr (Plowman, 1992). Low back pain and disability does not progressively increase with age and does not correspond to age-related changes of disc degeneration. It is not clear why low back pain peaks at about the fourth decade of life. 5. The majority of the population suffering from low-back pain cope with it themselves, not seeking medical treatment. 6. There is no definitive indication than any treatment for low back pain is superior than others, with evidence only showing interventions providing modest success for unknown duration (Lahad et al., 1994). 7. Persons missing work for longer than 6 months, because of low back pain, have a 50% probability of ever returning to work. Long absence from work is more dependent on socioeconomic and job-related influences, and not physical severity (Waddell, 1987). With chronic pain, Waddell expounds that the disability may become increasingly associated with emotional distress, depression, failed treatment, and the adoption of a sick role, all of which are resistant to traditional medical management. 8. Due to the lack of scientifically validated guidelines for the treatment and prevention of low back pain, the determination of exercise programs has largely been guided by empirical knowledge. 9. Most clinicians agree that the treatment of low back pain should focus on known deficiencies. Typically these sufferers lack normal levels of flexibility, muscular strength, and muscular endurance in various muscles of the trunk, including the lumbar and abdominal muscles. Often times these patients are overweight and deconditioned. Therefore, the role of exercise in the treatment and prevention of low back pain should be to correct or improve these deficiencies. The Importance of Exercise to Care for Low Back Pain In other parts of the body the use of exercise to improve strength, mobility, coordination, and endurance have been well recognized (Jackson & Brown, 1983). These facets of exercise are not well understood in relation to back pain. Jackson and Brown propose the following reasons to prescribe exercise for back pain: 1) to decrease pain, 2) to strengthen muscles, 3) to decrease mechanical stress to spinal structures, 4) to improve fitness level, 5) to prevent injury, 6) to stabilize hypermobile segments, 7) to improve posture, and 8) to improve mobility. Much emphasis has been placed on muscular strengthening exercises to add stabilization and support to the trunk area. Several arguments can be made to justify this rationale for the treatment and prevention of low back pain. For instance, the degree of stability and support of the trunk area is largely dependent on the strength of the supporting structures, the muscles. Improper vertebral alignment can result from weak back extensor muscles which may lead to undue loading on the spine. Stronger muscles can enhance the spine's ability to withstand various degrees of external loads. The fact that patients with low back pain exhibit decreased levels of trunk extension, trunk flexion, and lateral flexion strength, when compared to non-suffering persons, suggests a need to alleviate this dissimilarity. In industry, workers with high levels of muscular strength are less prone to back injury. It should be emphasized that the greatest losses in strength have been found in the trunk extensor muscles (Addison, 1980). In healthy normal persons, a natural imbalance is expected to exist with the lumbar extensors being stronger than the lumbar flexors. The trunk extensors in a healthy person are approximately 30% stronger than the trunk flexors (Foster & Fulton, 1991). Investigations suggest adequate flexibility of the oblique, hamstring, hip flexor and low back muscles is necessary for a healthy lower back (Foster & Fulton, 1991; Plowman, 1992). Patients with low back pain often exhibit consequential limitations in several movements of the pelvis and trunk. The flexibility of the lumbar spine provides for a functional mechanical advantage, while tight or shortened back muscles adversely affect spinal mechanics (Farfan, 1975). A lack of pelvic mobility, due to tightness in the hip flexors, could limit pelvic mobility and cause strain on the lumbar spine. In addition, tight hamstring and hip extensor muscles could reduce the lordotic curve, which may impair spinal loading. However, specific measures to define adequate flexibility for the reduction or prevention of low back pain have not been fully elucidated. A convincing relation exists between low back pain and decreased muscular endurance. Devries (1968) found differences in EMG fatigue curves between those in whom back pain did and did not develop during prolonged postural stress. From his findings he suggested the association of muscular deficiency and low muscular endurance with low back pain. Magora (1974) also reported that occupational postural disorders, where prolonged maintenance of a particular posture occur, were a causal factor to low back pain. A clear distinction in the value of muscular strength and muscular endurance should be accentuated, since it is known that muscular endurance fitness training may be affected without a corresponding result being seen in muscular strength. It has been shown that patients with low back pain have decreased levels of muscular endurance in the lumbar extensors (Biering-Sorenson, 1984). It has also been reported that abdominal muscular endurance in patients with low back pain is less than those in the normal health population (Foster & Fulton, 1991). Therefore, these investigations support the application of endurance exercises that incorporate the back extensors as well as the abdominal muscles. Since aerobic fitness is highly associated with overall fitness and weight management, the importance of aerobic fitness to help reduce low back pain is signified, though conclusive evidence of any protective role is incomplete. This association is not as strong of a cause-effect relation that is seen with decreased levels of muscular strength, flexibility and muscular endurance with low back pain. The exact mechanism for reduced pain with aerobic exercise is not clear, since the intensity of the muscular contractions is not considered intense enough to strengthen the muscles. Aerobic fitness may help prevent any undesirable changes to the body associated with spinal inactivity, musculature weakness, and neuromuscular health. Also, the intervetebral discs are avascular (have few blood vessels) by the age of maturation, and thus rely on osmosis for disk nutrition. A well-functioning circulatory system has been shown to increase the transport of nutrients into and waste products out of the disc (Plowman, 1992). The justification of an all-around fitness program to enhance aerobic conditioning, muscular strength, flexibility and muscular endurance is well-documented in the discussion above. Adherence to well-established principles of conditioning such as specificity of exercise, progression, and overload need to be established, dependent on the fitness level, age and health of the client. Another key training concern is with range of motion. Muscular strengthening exercises of the extensor muscles often do not provide a full range of motion for this muscle group. A good example is prone torso lifts on the floor. The failure to take the lumbar extensors through the full range of motion, not incorporating the muscle fibers to their fullest, is a definite limitation. Resistance equipment manufactures have attempted to address the biomechanical concerns of range of motion and resistance throughout the exercise. However, it has been established that the eccentric contraction phase of the trunk extensors needs to be addressed for healthy back function (Floyd & Silver, 1950), which some pieces of equipment seem to ignore. Attempt to incorporate a variety of exercises and pieces of equipment if available. It has yet to be shown with objective research that one type of resistance exercise is superior to another (Borenstein & Wiesel, 1989). Another area of concern with trunk exercises is pelvic stabilization to minimize the involvement of the hamstring muscle group during lumbar extensor movements. Without pelvic stabilization, it has been suggested that lumbar extension exercises will allow the hip extensors to perform most of the work (Pollock et al., 1989). Fischer and Houtz (1968) have shown that the hamstrings and gluteals exhibit greater electrical activity than the lumbar extensors in unilateral hip extension performed in the prone-lying position. The trunk exercises (full range of motion exercises for the lumbar extensors and flexors) should be performed a minimum of two times per week. In addition, strengthening activities for the lower extremities (leg curl for the hamstrings, leg extension for the quadriceps), upper back (rows and lat pulls for the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and rhomboids) should also be incorporated. Flexibility exercises to safely stretch the lumbar extensors, hip extensors and hip flexors should be incorporated two or more times per week. Care should be take that these stretches are performed after the body is properly warm-up. (Note: a comprehensive review on flexibility is presented in IDEA Today, June 1993). The cardiorespiratory guidelines established by the American College of Medicine are appropriate to follow (see ACSM guidelines) for the aerobic exercise prescription. Low impact activities, which avoid ballistic lumbar flexion, are preferred (Foster & Fulton, 1991). Foster and Fulton also indicate the rowing machines should be used cautiously due to persons with disk problems. Low back pain is a universal health problem. There is much more to learn from research about its treatment and prevention. As health/fitness educators, you must acknowledge to your clients that there is no cure-all exercise or medicine for this epidemic size problem. However, with an approach towards total body health and fitness, which includes the mind/body connection, you will be employing a most successful theme for possible management, prevention or restoration of healthy back function and quality of life. Side Bar (Back Illustration with following description) The spine is made up of 24 vertebrae, cushioned by tough, fibrous, and gelatinous intervetebral discs, arranged in three curves that form a natural S-shape. Your head is supported by the cervical spine. The ribs which protect the internal organs are attached to the thoracic spine. The lumbar spine, which is the site of low back pain and the workhorse of your spine, absorbs nearly all of your torso stress when you stand, sit or move. When the cervical curve, thoracic curve, and lumbar curve are properly aligned, you are less vulnerable to injury and pain. Side Bar (Causes of Back Pain) Although not fully understood, low back pain problems are usually linked to two areas: 1) lifestyle, which includes stress, lack of exercise and poor posture, and 2) physical injury or disease. Stress can be a precursor to low back pain by upsetting your nervous system, causing your muscles to go into spasm. Discovering effective coping techniques will not only help you deal better with stress, but relieve or help prevent low back pain. Bending, lifting and twisting movements can all lead to muscle strains and ligament sprains, most likely associated with acute low back pain. The intervetebral discs tend to dry out and degenerate as you age. Poor posture may accelerate this process. Disks losing their shock-absorbing capacity may lead to nerve irritation and injury. Another degenerative health problem associated with age and indicated in low back problems is osteoarthritis. When back pain or soreness strikes, adhering to proper sitting, standing and sleeping postures is especially critical. Keep your back active, often changing positions when you're standing, sitting, and lying down. This will help distribute the workload to all the muscles of your back. If there is an increase or sustained duration of the pain you may need to see a health care specialist. Consult your physician if the back pain is the result of an impact injury or accident. Back pain that interferes with sleep or daily activities may need professional care. And if you have shooting pains, numbness or weakness in your legs you certainly need to consult your physician. ACSM Guidelines Frequency of training 3-5 days per week Intensity of training 60-90% of maximum heart rate or 50-85% of maximum oxygen uptake or 50-85% of heart rate reserve Duration of activity 20-60 minutes of continuous aerobic activity Mode of activity Any activity that uses large muscle groups, can be maintained continuously, and is rhythmical and aerobic in nature Resistance training Strength training of a moderate intensity, sufficient to develop and maintain fat-free weight should be an integral part of an adult fitness program.

Put it in neutral. When it comes to sleep, neutral means a position that supports the funky way your spine is shaped—forward curves at the neck and lower back and a backward sway in the middle. Just as theres good standing posture, the neutral position is good sleeping posture. A purchase like this deserves time and thought More about sleep Thats why theres all the fuss over finding a and that keep your spine correctly aligned and stress-free. “Imagine holding your wrist backward for a period of time. Its unnatural and uncomfortable,” says Roger Smith, DO, a Harvard Medical School sleep expert. “Without the proper support, your spine feels the same way.” Heres how to find neutral. If you have , a small flat pillow under your knees may help your back curve naturally. A pillow between your knees can help to keep the pressure off of your hips. If you must sleep in this back-unfriendly way, a flat pillow under your tummy can help keep the spines natural curves.

9125153d-567a-42ce-b8b2-d3a075b147ef,"An interview with HSS surgeons John S. Blanco, MD; Daniel W. Green, MD; and Roger F. Widmann, MD Avoiding and maintaining good posture are universal concerns among parents today. Many of these parents may be surprised to know that small curves are a normal part of spine anatomy. But children whose curvature exceeds a limited range of variation–curving to either the right or left side in an “S” shape—do require medical attention, and may be diagnosed with scoliosis. Together with , another type of curvature, scoliosis comprises a significant proportion of spinal deformity diagnoses seen by pediatric orthopedists. Scoliosis is diagnosed as one of three types: idiopathic, of unknown origin; congenital scoliosis, in which the bones are asymmetrical at birth and the vertebrae may be partially formed (hemivertebra) or wedge-shaped; and neuromuscular scoliosis, in which the scoliosis is symptomatic of a systemic condition such as , muscular dystrophy, or paralysis. —the most frequently seen form of the condition—may first be recognized during a routine pediatrician’s visit or in a school screening. “School screenings are an important safeguard for many children, especially for children who may not have a regular healthcare provider.” notes , Associate Attending Orthopedic Surgeon at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS). While children with idiopathic scoliosis may not experience any pain, parents may see cosmetic signs of the condition, such as a shoulder that appears higher than the other or protruding ribs on one side, owing to a twisting aspect of the spine. Patients with idiopathic scoliosis are further categorized by age: infantile scoliosis, affecting children from birth to three years of age; juvenile scoliosis from 3 to 9 years of age; and adolescent scoliosis, from 10 to18 years of age. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is seen more frequently in girls than in boys. In all its forms, early diagnosis of scoliosis is a primary goal. Treatment is guided by the specific scoliosis type, the amount of growth the child has left, the degree of the deformity, and anticipated progression of the condition. “Children with infantile and juvenile scoliosis have the greatest risk of curve progression, as well as the greatest risk of developing secondary pulmonary complications from scoliosis,” explains , Chief of Pediatric Orthopedic Surgery at HSS. Case Study: a 15 year old male with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. (pdf) Neuromuscular scoliosis is rarely diagnosed at birth, since it is an acquired form of scoliosis in which development and progression of the scoliosis is often dependent upon the severity of the underlying medical condition, such as cerebral palsy. Children with suspected idiopathic scoliosis should see a pediatric orthopedist who can confirm the diagnosis with physical examination and . A curve of greater than 10 degrees on x-ray is considered to be scoliosis. At HSS, in children younger than ten years of age, an of the entire spine is recommended. According to Dr. Green, “In some cases, even though the vertebral bones may be healthy, the spinal cord may not be.” MRI images can help the orthopedist detect the presence of other problems such as syrinx—a cyst in the spinal cord, or tethered cord, in which the spinal cord is abnormally attached to the bony spine. Case Study: an active 14 year old girl with juvenile idiopathic scoliosis. (pdf) Treatment for scoliosis is focused on slowing or preventing progression of the curve and on cosmetic improvement. For patients with smaller curves, those greater than 10 degrees and up to 20 degrees, the pediatric orthopedist may recommend continued observation. For curves in the range of 20-40 degrees, in a growing child, bracing can be very effective. Children with more advanced scoliosis, those with a curve of 45 degrees or more, may be candidates for surgery, requiring either the placement of growing rods or spine fusion. “In younger patients with significant growth remaining, growing rods may be preferable,” says Dr. Green. In this procedure, two adjustable rods are anchored to the spine to hold it in proper alignment. As the child grows, the rods can be adjusted in length. “Growing rods are also very effective in that the child’s lungs and chest cavity can continue to grow along with the spine. In addition, spinal fusion can be delayed until the child is significantly older,” says Dr. Widmann. Traditional scoliosis surgery is usually reserved for older children, using instrumentation to bring the spine into alignment and bone grafts to effect a fusion of the spine that maintains the correction. In order to decrease the risk of neurologic injury, at HSS sophisticated nerve monitoring is conducted throughout the surgery. “This monitoring provides us with almost instant feedback, allowing the surgical team to adjust the deformity correction as needed or, if need be, to change the implants,” explains Dr. Green. “Surgery generally results in both excellent correction of the curve and excellent improvement in spinal alignment,” says Dr. Widmann. Left untreated, a curve that continues to progress can eventually have a negative impact on both heart and lung function. Moreover, according to Dr. Green, at later stages surgeries are both lengthier and tend to have a less satisfactory cosmetic result. Scoliosis surgery generally involves a four to six day hospital stay, and most children are back to school within three to four weeks. Young athletes are usually back to competitive athletics in four to six months following surgery. Mature patients with curves less than 45 degrees are not candidates for spinal fusion surgery, since many of these curves will progress slowly or not at all during adult life. Curves measuring greater than 50 degrees are generally managed surgically, since these curves may progress up to one degree per year after maturity is reached. This can present problems for the patient later in adult life. According to Dr. Green, the future of scoliosis treatment is promising: Numerous interesting research initiatives are underway to improve our spine instrumentation for children and teenagers with scoliosis. In addition, genetic tests may be available in a few years that will help us predict which children will progress to have severe deformities and which ones won’t. Researchers are also trying to find a way to surgically modulate a mild curve at an earlier stage and prevent it from progressing—or even reverse the condition. Even now, advances in treatment are available at HSS. The Hospital is one of the few centers in the Northeast U.S. to receive approval to use Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib prostheses (VEPTR). This device is used to treat thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS), a congenital condition in which severe deformities of the chest, spine, and ribs prevent normal breathing as well as lung growth and development. By straightening the spine and separating the ribs, the VEPTR device can prevent deterioration of thoracic function and control spinal deformity.

fcb33f4c-7c31-4021-bed9-62ec0a6e679a,"Injuries resulting in a forward curvature of the spine: diagnosis and treatment options As its name suggests, post-traumatic kyphosis is a condition that results from serious injury, such as a fall from a height, a motor vehicle accident, a horseback riding accident, or even a bounce off a wave while boating. When the impact from such events causes fractures and/or dislocation of the vertebrae (disks of the spine), a kyphotic deformity - an abnormal curve of the spine - can develop, especially if the injury is not treated promptly. To understand the effect of these injuries, it can be helpful to think of the healthy spine as a series of bony blocks, the vertebrae, which are connected by facet joints that permit movement in the spine. Disks sit between the vertebrae and provide cushioning and protection. The spinal cord runs through the spinal canal, a passage created by the vertebrae. Post-traumatic kyphosis may occur from the lower lumbar spine (in the lower back) to the cervical spine (in the neck). Figure 1: Diagram detailing the sections of the spine, with the neck (cervical) section at the top. [] When viewed from the side, a curve of the spine that measures between 40-50 degrees is considered to be a normal part of spine alignment. In patients with post-traumatic kyphosis, however, the curve may exceed the normal range, usually in a small segment of the spine. This occurs when fractures of the vertebrae cause wedging and the normally block-shaped vertebrae become angulated, resulting in a spinal deformity, pain, and a limited range of motion. , an attending orthopaedic surgeon at , describes two types of patients with post-traumatic kyphosis: those who require care in the acute phase, immediately after trauma, and those who seek treatment after the spine has healed in an abnormal alignment. In patients who are seen immediately following trauma, pain is the primary symptom. “Because trauma patients often have multiple injuries, including those affecting the head, neck, and abdomen, it’s important that they undergo a complete evaluation - including a neurologic assessment - before we begin any intervention,” Dr. Rawlins says. Tools used to evaluate the patient include: images to determine the presence and type of fracture to assess any encroachment on the nerves that could give rise to related motor or sensory symptoms , if the extent of the patient’s injury is not clear on routine x-ray images and the orthopedist suspects that a fracture-dislocation has occurred. For those whose injury has healed in an abnormal alignment, back pain may be accompanied by an inability to stand erect, as well as associated neck pain that results from efforts to do so. “In an attempt to compensate for their kyphosis, patients may also develop abnormal lordosis, an excessive arching of the lower spine and the cervical spine in the neck, and overuse of the muscles to maintain alignment,” Dr. Rawlins explains. Some patients may also develop early satiety, a feeling of fullness that occurs more quickly than normal when eating. This sensation occurs when the abdominal contents are squeezed against the diaphragm due to the abnormal curve of the spine. Because post-traumatic kyphosis can progress if the injury heals without intervention, the goal for patients in the acute phase is to correct the spinal alignment as soon as it is safe to do so. Treatment recommendations are based on a variety of factors, including the type of fracture (some kinds of fractures make the patient more susceptible to kyphosis), the site of the fracture, the extent of angulation in the affected part of the spine, and the size of the patient. If non-surgical treatment is recommended, the orthopedist will put the patient in a brace to support the spine as it heals, and physical therapy is initiated to alleviate pain, strengthen surrounding muscles, and improve posture. However, if the kyphosis is significant, surgery may be recommended to avoid the long-term consequences of kyphosis, including pain, hyperextension, and overuse injuries from lordosis in the neck and the lower back. “The goal of surgery is to alleviate pain, restore the spine to proper alignment, and improve neurologic function,” explains Dr. Rawlins. Surgical treatment for post-traumatic kyphosis is accomplished through spinal fusion and stabilization with instrumentation. In patients who are in the acute phase of their injury, the surgeon usually performs a posterior spinal fusion, approaching the area through the back. Patients who have a kyphotic deformity that has healed in this position may require an anterior-posterior approach, in which the surgeon makes one incision in the front of the body and another from the back, in one or two stages. Figures 2 & 3: X-rays showing a female patient with a compression fracture as the result of a boating accident. Figure 2 (left) shows the wedged, angular vertebrae in the center of the image, as noted by the white arrow. Figure 3 (right) shows the corrected vertebrae after treatment with spinal fusion and instrumentation. “In addition to fusion, some patients may require an osteotomy - a cut through the bone - in order to restore proper alignment,” Dr. Rawlins says. The orthopedic surgeon may also need to remove bone fragments from the spinal canal to help protect the spinal cord and relieve any associated pain. Throughout treatment and recovery, patients are monitored to ensure that any neurologic symptoms are detected and addressed promptly. With increasingly sophisticated surgical techniques and instrumentation, surgical treatment for kyphosis is easier to recover from than ever before. In the absence of other injuries, patients who have had the posterior procedure only may be up and out of bed the next day. For those who undergo an anterior and posterior procedure, recovery may be more gradual. To help maintain alignment during healing, the patient may wear a brace for up to three months. Physical therapy after surgery is generally recommended and the requirement varies with age. Patients who undergo fusion can expect some reduction in the range of motion in their back, but the degree to which this occurs varies widely and is partly dependent on the number of levels of the spine that are fused. Future improvements in the treatment of post-traumatic kyphosis are likely to lie in techniques that improve the rate at which fusions heal, according to Dr. Rawlins. Biologic proteins that increase and enhance fusions are currently the focus of numerous clinical trials.

Just about every U.S. military commander embraces this time-honored military mantra. In his column for Joint Force Quarterly, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., describes how he sees the current and future fight. Noting the significant implications for how the joint force will fight, he writes, ""it [is] probable that future conflicts will most often be transregional and fought across multiple domains and functions. Driven by this assumption, one of my highest warfighting priorities is to improve our ability to integrate joint capabilities in a transregional, multidomain, and multifunctional fight."" (1) In response to the Chairman's guidance, the Joint Staff quickly implemented a Globally Integrated Exercise (GIE) framework that promises to enhance training against the most challenging threats. To fully realize the CJCS vision for fully integrated transregional, multidomain, and multifunctional capabilities across the joint force, however, the GIE framework should include a new Transregional Capstone Exercise (TCE) incorporating all geographic combatant commands (GCCMDs) and functional combatant commands (FCCMDs). While the joint force has shown steady progress toward exercising in multiple domains and across multiple functions within regional theaters, large-scale transregional exercising remains in its infancy. This article highlights the transregional threat that the exercise should address, delineates some basic requirements, proposes four training objectives, and addresses three potential challenges to implementation. Transregional Threats and Response Militaries must now operate in a complex and dynamic world where several multifaceted real-world threats may affect an ever-growing battlefield. Not only do state actors such as Russia, China, and Iran have the capability to conduct transregional operations, but a variety of nonstate actors, such as the so-called Islamic State, al Qaeda, and a multitude of transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), also threaten to disrupt the international order across traditional combatant command boundaries. While globalization trends have connected countries around the world, they have also enabled threat networks and violent extremist organizations (VEOs) to operate on the global stage. In Admiral Kurt Tidd's 2017 posture statement for U.S. Southern Command, he states that some criminal networks in his area of responsibility are globally integrated enterprises with profit margins that rival Fortune 500 companies. These networks smuggle precursor chemicals and fentanyl from China into Central America and Mexico in order to make extremely potent heroin that causes overdose epidemics in the United States. There are networks that transport large cocaine shipments to the United States, West Africa, Europe, and Australia, while others make tremendous profits by illegally mining gold in Guyana, Peru, and Colombia. Other networks kidnap, money launder, and extort--all moving illicit goods across the globe. (2) Combatant commanders face some subset of five key challenges (competing long-term with China and Russia, while deterring and countering North Korea, Iran, and VEOs), referred to as the ""2+3"" in their geographic region or functional area. (3) Speaking at the annual Air Force Association conference in 2016, General Dunford observed that such threats increasingly operate across the regional combatant command structure. (4) For managing these threats, he recommended improving the ability of the Secretary of Defense to work across both geographic and functional combatant commanders and strengthening the Joint Staff. (5) As early as 2013, a Joint Staff J7 Deployable Training Division paper on mission command and cross-domain synergy noted that, while leadership often discusses the benefits of cross-CCMD activities, the U.S. military has not fully understood or addressed challenges in cross-CCMD coordination. Moreover, how the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) would establish authorities, responsibilities, and processes with necessary Joint Staff support required for globally integrated operations outlined in the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO) had not yet been tested. (6) The J7 paper poignantly imagined reallocation processes for critical resources such as munitions, intelligence, support, strategic lift, and cyber assets as limiting to mission success in a global fight. (7) While some initial progress in this area has been made, there are, no doubt, many other challenges the Department of Defense (DOD) has not considered that a global TCE could reveal. A TCE involving all GCCMDs and FCCMDs would give Secretary James Mattis and General Dunford a realistic, in-time transregional training platform to prepare for conflict against the five key challenges. A total of five TCEs spread over time as part of the GIE framework would focus on each challenge--Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and VEOs on a global scale--to focus training and allow sufficient time for planning. Currently, there are a handful of exercises that do, in fact, attempt to exercise transregionally with more than one CCMD. In February of 2017, the 3-week Austere Challenge exercise included four CCMDs: U.S. European Command, U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and U.S. Strategic Command. (8) U.S. European Command Commander General Curtis M. Scaparrotti described the exercise as a complete success, stating that the exercise validated the ability to rapidly respond together with decisive and overwhelming success in Europe and to enable other CCMDs. (9) Austere Challenge is a good initial step toward transregional exercising; however, it is time to build on that success by moving toward a new exercise built on the premise that conflict with the 2+3 will affect the entire force to some degree. Exercise Program Requirements As part of the Joint Training Policy, the Chairman's Exercise Program (CEP) is designed to improve capability and readiness of U.S. military forces to conduct joint operations through regularly scheduled strategic, national-level exercises that look at plans, policies, and procedures under different simulated crisis situations. (10) The CEP further stipulates that DOD entities conduct exercises for a multitude of purposes to include joint training, theater-engagement activities, mission and plan rehearsal, concept analysis, lessons learned evaluation, doctrine validation, and interagency integration. (11) A TCE, as part of the GIE framework, would fall under and embrace all facets of the CEP with special emphasis on joint training, concept analysis, and doctrine evaluation. Implementing the Joint Training Policy, the annual Chairman's Training Guidance is a clear call for leadership to shift their way of thinking about training and exercising. It directs the joint force to conduct ""exercises involving multiple CCMDs, the Joint Staff, and appropriate CSAs (Combat Support Agencies) oriented on the priority strategic challenges [2+3] and homeland defense."" These exercises should ""strengthen the 'connective tissue' between leaders and organizations, validate assumptions, examine globally integrated operations and other mature concepts, test key ideas, and confirm the joint force can execute assigned missions."" (12) Each TCE would incorporate all essential characteristics outlined in the Chairman's Training Guidance. Mainly, the TCE would reflect the strategic environment, emphasize global integration across the five key challenges, span the range of military operations, and enable innovation. (13) If designed properly with concrete objectives, the TCE would strengthen the connective tissue between key leaders by addressing both higher level collaboration of the Joint Staff with OSD and horizontal coordination among CCMDs that will be needed in crisis. TCE Objectives To realize the Chairman's transregional training guidance, a TCE should accomplish four specific training objectives directed toward supporting one of the five key challenges scenario to give GCCMDs and FCCMDs realistic training against a benchmark competitor. These objectives include exercising command and control constructs, improving situational awareness on transregional problems across GCCMD boundaries, improving cross-CCMD coordination, and stress-testing communications systems. Global Command and Control. Exercising command and control as a training objective in a global scenario is needed to address shortfalls in DOD's ability to integrate operations under the current regional command construct. General Dunford does not believe that the current organizational and command and control constructs are ready for the current or future fight. (14) He states what is truly required is ""global integration."" (15) In attempting to address mission command and synergy challenges, the J7 recommended incorporating OSD into exercises as a best practice: ""Where applicable, exercise the agility of OSD as the establishing authority together with the [Joint Staff] under crisis conditions to plan and direct responsive and synchronized cross-combatant command operations."" (16) To best train for this objective, a TCE's primary training audience should be at the Tier One level and include the Secretary of Defense, CJCS, Joint Staff, and all CCMDs. The Tier One level of training is designed to prepare national-level organizations and combatant commanders and their staffs at the strategic and operational levels of war to integrate interagency, nongovernmental, and multinational partners in highly complex environments. The Joint Training Policy advocates integrating a diverse audience into exercises in order to identify ""core competencies, procedural disconnects, and common ground to achieve U.S. unity of effort."" (17) Understanding that the Secretary and CJCS will likely be unable to clear their schedules for the entire duration of the exercise, a global command and control objective would also test the ability of these leaders, as well as combatant commanders, to synchronize and coordinate information while traveling or attending to real-world schedules. This would differ sharply from current exercises where typically a role player is appointed to play the Secretary and CJCS and updates occur at regular intervals, an unlikely scenario during a major crisis. Common Situational Awareness. Global participation would test not only command and control, but also coordination among nine unified CCMDs as the joint force strives to meet the second objective of improving situational awareness on transregional problems across GCCMD boundaries. This second objective would be useful to determine how the joint force would collectively contribute to shared awareness amid a multitude of defense and commercial options for building a common operating picture or common intelligence picture. While Global Command and Control System-Joint is the program of record intended to provide a one-stop shop for joint planners to build awareness, most combatant commanders gravitate toward some sort of tailored system for their region for a variety of reasons. Google Earth, All Partners Access Network, CENTRIXS (Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System), and BICES (Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems) are all examples of systems currently in use to build a common operating or common intelligence picture. Classification, bandwidth, manpower management requirements, and compatibility considerations can be evaluated in an exercise environment and lessons learned applied to doctrine development or acquisition programs. Cross-CCMD Coordination. Once common awareness is established, the joint force should be stressed to use that information in a coordinated fashion against the adversary. Hence, a third training objective to improve cross-CCMD coordination is needed to bridge the gap from information to action. In the joint concept on rapid aggregation, the J7 recommends that CCMDs become increasingly collaborative and interdependent in both planning and execution: ""They must expand virtual and physical collaboration among commands to allow for shared situational understanding and for the collective capacity of multiple commands to quickly combine and solve problems."" (18) Communications Systems Stress. Finally, each TCE should stress communication systems. An exercise could then validate communications systems architecture, including satellites, information servers, multinational collaboration networks, and email services, when all CCMDs are straining communications infrastructure simultaneously. Admiral Tidd capitalized on a unique opportunity to stress-test communications when he found himself required to travel for other obligations during PANAMAX 2016, an exercise that brings together land, sea, and air forces in a joint and combined operation focused on defending the Panama Canal. The staff coordinated multiple video teleconferences that patched into Joint Training Center Norfolk headquarters and CENTRIXS from a variety of locations, including one occurrence while airborne. This unintended inject, though fraught with challenges, provided great realistic training and lessons learned to the CCMD. A proposed TCE could only satisfy the four proposed training objectives with full participation from the primary training audience. Full participation is needed to test a variety of dilemmas that leaders may face, such as how the CJCS and Secretary will prioritize assets to CCMDs when every CCMD would be making requests at the same time for the same challenge or threat. Conducting this exercise once every 2 years would efficiently train key leaders and their staffs during their command tenures and provide valuable lessons learned to improve the ability to fight transregionally. Challenges Too Hard to Integrate with Existing Exercises. Some may say a biennial exercise that includes all GCCMDs and FCCMDs is unrealistic given the often frantic operations tempo and fiscal constraints that burden DOD. At present, this is true. However, reevaluating existing exercises and either canceling or integrating them into the capstone exercise could alleviate much of the additional burden of a new mandatory requirement for the Joint Staff and CCMDs. Development of a TCE should follow the lessons learned from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In the wake of the Crimea crisis, NATO quickly went from about 100 to 300 exercises per year and reached the limit of the Allies' ability to support them. Instead of adding additional exercises, NATO is now focused on increasing their realism, flexibility, and robustness. This change in thinking has allowed for NATO to plan and execute faster.(19) Likewise, a TCE provides an opportunity for combatant commanders to set aside redundant training exercises while keeping the intent of higher guidance providing a ""less-ismore"" training option for the CCMD. The first full biennial capstone exercise should not be executed until 2020 to provide planners adequate lead time to plan and schedule the exercise across DOD. Furthermore, a TCE would have to be assigned priority event status to ensure prioritization throughout DOD. Once scheduled far in advance, planners should be able to schedule other events around an established battle rhythm that runs a TCE every other year, on even years, starting in 2020. Scheduling and Resources. Others might argue that a TCE is just another exercise requirement that takes away time they could spend on real-world issues and that there is not enough time and resources to do both. DOD and other agencies are indeed faced with fiscal challenges that have resulted in the United States having the smallest Army, Navy, and Air Force since World War II. (20) At the same time, with the plethora of exercises already being executed, finding a time that would work across the joint force would be difficult. To address this concern, the Joint Staff and CCMDs should first establish a culture that recognizes the value of a TCE and set it as a top training priority in order to solidify support for aggressive exercise participation. Rotating through the five key challenges in a variety of scenarios could further validate the legitimacy of the exercise, as it would allow assigned CCMDs synchronizing responsibilities to exercise against a variety of benchmark threats. Despite the resource challenges, ensuring the Secretary, Joint Staff, and all GCCMDs and FCCMDs participate in the exercise is central to achieving proposed training objectives, especially command and control and communications stress-testing. Each GCCMD and FCCMD's unique capabilities and geographic expertise should be represented in the exercise, and this would indeed pose the greatest challenge to scheduling and execution. To address the resourcing issue, it is important to put a mark on the calendar as soon as possible to enable Global Force Management processes time to allocate any shift in resources. The Joint Staff and CCMDs will also need to quickly determine required staff to serve as role players and determine how best to meet this need. Options for building the necessary training elements could include assigning select staff a temporary duty assignment, employing modular training teams, hiring short-term contractors, or creating computer system simulations. For an exercise of this scale, new collaboration mechanisms among training elements might be required, as physical space to house a training element of this magnitude would likely not permit complete collocation. The key to addressing all of these challenges would be sufficient time for planning. Not Enough Doctrine to Exercise. Another argument against incorporating a TCE into the training schedules of GCCMDs and FCCMDs is the lack of transregional joint doctrine. The Joint Training Policy for the U.S. Armed Forces states that training must be based on approved joint doctrine unless the training is being used primarily for concept development. (21) Currently, there is not a sufficient amount of cross-CCMD doctrine. When combined with the need to determine the resourcing described above, this would indeed be a formidable challenge for joint force planners. It is important to note, however, that this exercise could be a fire starter to generate and/or validate joint doctrine in development. Each successive TCE would aid doctrine development by feeding a cycle of assessment. As a starting point for development, exercise planners could aim to test some of the ideas put forward in the Globally Integrated Operations CCJO. This concept advocates eight key elements among which mission command, global agility, and flexibility in establishing joint forces could be tested in a TCE. (22) While mission command may be preferable in most situations, complex conflicts with near-peer adversaries may require integrating mission command with centralized control mechanisms required for employment of nuclear weapons or other national capabilities. Training objectives on global agility could test the joint force's ability to shift resources between CCMDs as strategic dilemmas emerge and help validate existing posture. Lastly, the CCJO insight on flexibility in establishing joint forces should be tested. It notes that while current joint forces are typically organized around geographic or functional considerations, the future force may have to consider that ""this might be done globally"" or as a ""joint task force operating across multiple non-contiguous geographic areas to accomplish its mission against a single threat."" (23) The Chairman has stated that his warfighting priority is to improve the military's ability to integrate joint capabilities in a transregional, multidomain, and multifunctional fight. While the joint force has shown steady progress toward exercising in multiple domains and across multiple functions within regional theaters, transregional exercising remains immature. The joint force needs to institutionalize biennial TCEs that incorporate all GCCMDs and FCCMDs as a key element to realizing the Chairman's highest warfighting priority. A TCE should test command and control constructs, improve situational awareness on transregional problems across GCCMD boundaries, enhance cross-CCMD coordination, and stress-test communication systems as primary training objectives. These objectives reflect current shortfalls and are needed to prepare the joint force to face any of the 2+3 challenges. Though implementation of a TCE will be met with challenges from competing priorities, scheduling, resourcing, and nascent transregional doctrine, overcoming these challenges will set the joint force on a trajectory to defend the United States against the transregional threats of tomorrow. Without this exercise or another like it, critical shortfalls in joint force capability to address these threats will persist. Smartly adding TCEs within the GIE framework will help realize the Chairman's vision for the future joint force and help him fulfill his statutory responsibilities to advise, direct, assess, and execute joint operations against the most challenging transregional threats. Using a TCE, we can train the way we fight so we will fight the way we train. Notes (1) Joseph F.

Scoliosis is a condition of the spine in which the spine curves sideways in an ""S"" shape, either to the right or left side. This different from the condition known as , where the spine has an abnormal, forward-oriented curvature. Anteroposterior (front-to-back) view of the spine (in standing position, demonstrating scoliosis in the thoracic and lumbar spine. Lateral (outer side) view of the spine in standing position, demonstrating kyphosis (forward curvature) in the thoracic spine. View an animation on adult and juvenile scoliosis. There are three basic types of scoliosis: idiopathic, congenital and neuromuscular. Idiopathic scoliosis is where the cause or origin is unknown. This is the most common type. Congenital scoliosis is where the bones in the spine are abnormally curved at birth. Neuromuscular scoliosis is where the curvature is a symptom of a separate, systemic condition, such as , muscular dystrophy, or paralysis. These conditions are all types of what is termed ""structural scoliosis,"" where incorrectly formed bones create an S-curve in the spine that is fixed and cannot be straightened by adjusting body position. ""Nonstructural scoliosis"" (also known as ""functional scoliosis"") is where the curvature is temporary and not caused by a malformed vertebare in the spine but by a separate condition that affects posture, such as or a . Scoliosis can affect the spine in any of its three major sections: Diagram showing the sections of the healthy spine, with the neck (cervical) section at the top, followed below by the thoracic and lumbar sections, the sacrum and the coccyx (tailbone). The curvature shown in the left image is the normal curve of the spine when it is viewed from the side (not scoliosis). Scoliosis affects girls much more than boys, by a ratio of about 8 to 1. 5% of children or adolescents with scoliosis require bracing or surgery. 30% of scoliosis patients have a family hisory of scoliosis. Scoliosis is primarily diagnosed in children and adolescents, although it can develop in adults later in life. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the type of scoliosis seen most frequently by spine surgeons and comprises 80% of all spinal deformities. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis a condition that develops in children between the ages of 10 and 18, in which the spine is curved sideways in one or more areas with no known cause. It affects girls more frequently than boys. Yes. Although scoliosis develops most frequently in childhood or adolescents, adults may also be diagnosed with scoliosis. In adults, it may be due either to the progression of a curve that existed in their youth, or as a result of a or . Learn more about adult scoliosis by reading Scoliosis In Adults: Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatments. Progression of adult scoliosis from age 14 (top left) to age 46 (lower right). A sideways curvature of the spine is the key symptom of all forms of scoliosis. This is usually revealed when a shoulder, waist, hip other body part on one side is higher than the other. Scoliosis rarely causes pain in children an adolescents. Back pain, however, is a common symptom for people who develop scoliosis as an adult. When a child or teenager with scoliosis does experience back pain, this is usually a sign that they have some additional condition. Typically, scoliosis is first noticed by a child’s pediatrician, family member or school nurse. As an initial screening method, healthcare professionals use the Adams forward-bending test to look for the presence of any asymmetry of the torso or shoulder blades, or for protrusion of the shoulder blades. The medical evaluation for scoliosis includes a physical exam and spinal imaging. This photo shows a pronounced curve, revealed during an Adams forward-bending test. A doctor may also use scoliometer to measure the amount of trunk inclination (the curve) or rotation (twisting of the spine). A child or adolescent with a curvature measuring 7 degrees or greater will be referred to an orthopedist for further evaluation and monitoring. A diagnosis for scoliosis is made when the curvatue that exceeds 10 degrees. To assess the curve further, images or low-dose radiation images are taken from the front and side views. Parents who are concerned about exposing their child to radiation during medical imaging should consult a doctor to learn whether EOS imaging is an appropriate alternative to traditional X-rays. EOS imaging has several safety and diagnostic advantages, especially for children or teens who may need to have multiple images taken over time to monitor the progression of their scoliosis. These include: radiation levels significantly lower than that of traditional X-rays simultaneous image captures of full-body frontal and side views in less than twenty seconds. two dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) orthopedic images can be produced to assist with diagnosis and treatment EOS images of a patient with scoliosis: 2D anteroposterior (front-to-back) and lateral (outer side) X-ray views, and 3D anteroposterior rendering of the spine and pelvis. Treatments may be surgical or nonsurgical, and they also vary depending on the type of scoliosis a person has, and the age at which they develop it. Treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis determined by the degree of the spinal curve at the time of diagnosis and by the anticipated progression of that curve. Mild cases may not require any treatment. More significant cases may be treated nonsurgically, using braces, or with spine fusion surgery. Nonsurgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis For curves measuring less than 25 degrees, the orthopedist may recommend frequent monitoring to see if additional intervention becomes necessary. Young people with curves between 25 and 45 degrees may be candidates for treatment with bracing. While bracing does not correct the curve, it has been shown to stop progression in up to 75% of patients. Bracing is considered a success when progression is halted and maintained within 6 degrees of the original measurement of the curve. In most cases, patients wear a brace for 22 to 23 hours a day, removing it only for hygiene and sports activities. However, some patients may only require the use of a brace at night. A variety of braces are available and selection is based on how many curves are present and where on the spine the curve or curves are. Some models provide support at the pelvis, front, back, and neck, where others provide support throughout the torso and underarms. While many braces are rigid, flexible braces have been developed in recent years. This type of brace, which is only appropriate in patients with single curves, is worn as a vest and allows the patient to participate in some sports activities A patient wearing a rigid, flexible brace, allowing participation is some sports activities. Patients continue to wear the brace until they have stopped growing and skeletal maturity is reached. At that point, A weaning process follows in which the number of hours the brace is worn per day is gradually reduced over a period of six months to a year. This allows the supportive muscles in the back and trunk to become stronger after a period of inactivity. Physical therapy is also recommended, both during bracing and weaning. Surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis Patients with curves that continue to progress beyond 50 degrees, either with or without bracing, generally require surgical intervention. There are different surgical methods, but the most common type of surgery is a posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation (artificial implants). In this procedure, the orthopedic surgeon makes an incision from the back and essentially ""welds"" the vertebrae together using bone chips. autografts – taken from elsewhere in the patient's own body allografts – sourced from donors through a bone bank The spine is then held in alignment by hooks, screws or other instrumentation. Once the fusion is complete, the implants no longer serve a function but are left in place to avoid the need for additional surgery. Postsurgical X-ray images of the corrected spine, with a posterior (rear) view at left and a lateral (outer side) view at right. Some patients may be candidates for minimally invasive spine fusion surgery. This refers to muscle-sparing approaches to the spine that use small incisions as access portals. They are often performed using live X-ray or imaging for guidance, as well as robotic surgery (also called robotic-assisted surgery). In minimally invasive spine surgery, the surgeon will approach the spine from one of three positions, dependending on the patient's age, symptoms, spine alignment, and the anatomy of the nerves and blood vessels. These positions are: In most cases, access to the spine is established by using a series of dilators that split the muscle to create a working portal. The size of this portal will vary depending on the surgeon and the specific spine surgery being performed. Using these techniques, however, spine surgery access portals can now be as small as 1.2 centimeters (about a half an inch). When the spine needs to have screws and rods inserted to hold it in position (called instrumentation), this can also be performed through small incisions with the assistance of intra-operative X-rays, CT scans or robotic guidance. Most spinal fusion patients stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 days and are standing within two days. Children and teens can usually return to school in 4 to 6 weeks, begin low-impact exercise at three months, and full activity at six months. The complete healing process may take 6 to 12 months. Patients who undergo combined anterior and posterior spine procedures may have a slightly longer stay in the hospital. Neverthess, recovery times from modern scoliosis spine surgeries are significantly shorter than they were decades ago, when people sometimes spent weeks or months in the hospital in a body cast or in traction. Rare complications of spinal fusion can include infection and spinal cord abnormalities or injury. However, at HSS, multiple precautions are taken during surgery to protect the patient, including administration of antibiotics during surgery to help guard against infection and continuous monitoring of sensory and motor function of the spinal cord. Spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis provides significant spine curvature correction, cosmetic and posture benefits, but does cause some inflexibility in the spine. Fusion surgery generally yields very good results, with a correction rate of between 60% to 100%, depending on curve flexibility and location. Spinal fusion does result in some loss in range of motion, however. The extent of that loss varies depending on the section of spine corrected and the number of vertebrae that are fused.

45cca204-8f98-4bfa-a476-8fdf905400e7,"Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: Diagnosis, Treatments and Results An interview with Drs. Oheneba Boachie-Adjei and Han Jo Kim Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the type of scoliosis seen most frequently by spine surgeons and comprises 80% of all spinal deformities. How does surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis work? What is the expected scoliosis surgery recovery time? Frequently asked questions about adolescent idiopathic scoliosis Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis a condition in which the spine is curved sideways in one or more areas [Figure 1], with no known cause. This different from that in the condition known as , where the spine has an abnormal, forward-oriented curvature [Figure 2]. It affects girls more frequently than boys. Figure 1: Anteroposterior (front to back) view of the spine (standing) demonstrates scoliosis in the thoracic and lumbar spine. Figure 2: Lateral (side) view of the spine (standing) demonstrates kyphosis in the thoracic spine. Despite its name, the condition does not affect teenagers only. The term ""adolescent"" is used to apply to all patients whose scoliosis condition develops when they are between the ages of 10 and 18. Other, non-idiopathic forms of scoliosis can also affect children and teenagers in this age range. These include: congenital scoliosis, in which spinal deformities are present from birth neuromuscular scoliosis, in which the scoliosis symptomatic of a systemic condition, such as , muscular dystrophy, or paralysis ""Idiopathic means that there is no known cause for this condition,"" explains , Chief Emeritus of the Scoliosis Service. ""However,"" adds , Spine Fellowship Director and Fellowship Committee Chair, ""research has revealed genetic markers for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis that can show us which curves are likely to progress and require treatment."" Typically, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is first noticed by the child’s pediatrician, family member or school nurse. As an initial screening method, healthcare professionals use the Adams forward-bending test to look for the presence of any asymmetry of the torso or shoulder blades, or for protrusion of the shoulder blades [Figure 3]. Figure 3: This photo shows a pronounced curve, revealed during an Adams forward-bending test. A scoliometer is used to measure the amount of trunk inclination (the curve) or rotation (twisting of the spine). Adolescents with a measurement of 7 degrees or greater are referred to an orthopedist for further evaluation. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis rarely causes pain. For this reason, back pain symptoms in a young person with scoliosis may be a sign of an additional condition. To assess the curve further, images or low-dose radiation images are taken from the front and side views [Figures 4, 5]. Side-bending X-rays may also be taken to assess the flexibility of the curve or curves. Sometimes these images reveal two curves: the first curve to appear in the spine (the primary curve) and the compensatory curve that the patient develops through his or her effort to maintain an erect posture. Figures 4 (left) & 5 (right): Anterior to posterior (front to back) and lateral (side) X-rays showing a scoliosis curve from the back and side, respectively. Treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis determined by the degree of the spinal curve at the time of diagnosis and by the anticipated progression of that curve. Mild cases may not require any treatment at all. More significant cases of this type of scoliosis may be treated nonsurgically, using braces, or with spine surgery, depending on the individual patient. For curves measuring less than 25 degrees, the orthopedist may recommend frequent monitoring to see if additional intervention becomes necessary. Young people with curves between 25 and 45 degrees may be candidates for treatment with bracing. While bracing does not correct the curve, it has been shown to stop progression in up to 75% of patients. Bracing is considered a success when progression is halted and maintained within 6 degrees of the original measurement of the curve. Candidates for bracing are generally younger patients – prepubescent and skeletally immature as measured on the Risser test (a staging system that measures maturation of the hip bone). A measurement of 0 to 2 indicates that the growth is expected to continue. Skeletal maturity is achieved in female patients who reach a level of 4 and in male patients who have reached a level of 5. The absence of any change in height over a period of 6 to 12 months is another indicator of skeletal maturity. In most cases, patients wear a brace for 22 to 23 hours a day, removing it only for hygiene and sports activities. However, some patients may only require the use of a brace at night. A variety of braces are available and selection is based on how many curves are present and where on the spine the curve or curves are. Some models provide support at the pelvis, front, back, and neck, where others provide support throughout the torso and underarms. While many braces are rigid, flexible braces have been developed in recent years. This type of brace, which is only appropriate in patients with single curves, is worn as a vest and allows the patient to participate in some sports activities [Figure 6]. Figure 6: A patient wearing a rigid, flexible brace, allowing participation is some sports activities. Patients continue to wear the brace until skeletal maturity is reached. A weaning process follows in which the number of hours the brace is worn per day is gradually reduced over a period of six months to a year. This allows the supportive muscles in the back and trunk to become stronger after a period of inactivity. Physical therapy is also recommended, both during bracing and weaning. Patients with curves that continue to progress beyond 50 degrees, either with or without bracing, generally require surgical intervention. How does surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis work? There are different surgical methods, but the most common type of surgery is a posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation (artificial implants). In this procedure, the orthopedic surgeon makes an incision from the back and essentially ""welds"" the vertebrae together using bone chips. autografts – taken from elsewhere in the patient's own body allografts – sourced from donors through a bone bank During the healing process, which takes 6 to 12 months in an adolescent, the spine is held in alignment by hooks, screws or other instrumentation. Once the fusion is complete, the implants no longer serve a function but are left in place to avoid the need for additional surgery [Figures 7 & 8]. Figures 7 (left) & 8 (right): Postsurgical posterior and lateral X-rays of the same patient shown in Figures 4 & 5: results achieved with a posterior approach. Posterior, anterior and thorascopic surgical approaches Depending on the nature of the curve and its location, the orthopedic surgeon may need to perform a fusion from the front (anterior), the back (posterior) or both. When both approaches are needed, the procedure may be performed either as a single operation or in stages. Currently, however, this surgery is most commonly performed using a posterior-only procedure. Figures 9 & 10: Presurgical posterior and anterior X-rays – scoliosis requiring anterior approach. Figures 11 & 12: Postsurgical posterior (lower left) and lateral (lower right) X-rays – results achieved with an anterior approach. Some patients may also be candidates for thoracoscopic surgery, in which incisions are made from the side of the torso. As with the posterior and anterior approaches, instrumentation corrects the curve and the rotation of the spine. ""The thoracoscopic approach offers the advantages of smaller incisions and shorter fusions, which in turn preserves more mobility in the spine following surgery,"" Dr. Boachie explains. Thoracoscopic surgery is appropriate primarily for larger and rigid thoracic curves that require anterior release to increase flexibility. However, Dr. Kim says, ""with the introduction of pedicle screws, posterior-only surgery has become the main method of treatment for most curves, large or small."" A newer approach to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a non-fusion procedure termed the ""tethering"" procedure. In Vertebral body tethering (sometimes also called ""spinal tethering""), a thoracoscopic approach as described above is performed, and screws are placed within the specific vertebrae. Then, instead of using rods, a thick cord is placed to connect the screws, functioning as a tether. Tension is applied to help a growing child's spine develop with a straighter orientation. Not all patients are candidates for this procedure. Usually, candidacy is dependent on a patient's curve magnitude, age, skeletal maturity and curve type. The results of this procedure have not been researched as extensively as fusion procedures, however, short-term studies demonstrate that it can be successful in selective cases. Figures 11 & 12: Photos of an adolescent girl with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in the thoracic section of the spine, before (left) and after (right) surgery. The surgery provides significant spine curvature correction, cosmetic and posture benefits, but does cause some inflexibility in the spine. Fusion surgery generally yields very good results, with a correction rate of between 60% to 100%, depending on curve flexibility and location. ""These young people, who are usually otherwise healthy, tend to tolerate the surgery very well,"" says Dr. Boachie. Spinal fusion does result in some loss in range of motion. The extent of that varies depending on the section of spine corrected and the number of vertebrae fused. Rare complications can include infection and spinal cord abnormalities or injury. However, at HSS, multiple precautions are taken during surgery to protect the patient, including administration of antibiotics during surgery to help guard against infection and continuous monitoring of sensory and motor function of the spinal cord. What is the expected scoliosis surgery recovery time? Following surgery, most patients remain in the hospital for 3 to 5 days (slightly longer for those who undergo combined anterior/posterior procedures) and are on their feet in two days. Pain medication is continued for a few weeks and the majority of young people are back in school within 4 to 6 weeks. Some exercise, such as swimming and low-impact aerobic exercise, may be resumed within three months and patients may return to full activity within six months. Different Surgeons have different specified approaches to post-operative management. Frequently asked questions about adolescent idiopathic scoliosis My 14-year old child was diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis. The doctor measured her curve as 20 degrees and said her bones are nearly fully grown. She does not have pain and the curve is hardly noticeable but we are concerned. Will it continue to increase and become a big problem later in life? Once your daughter is skeletally mature (when her bone growth is complete), the curvature of the spine from idiopathic scoliosis will not increase. It is unlikely to be a problem, but she should be re-evaluated every 2 to 5 years to monitor the curve progression. I've heard that electrical stimulation can be used to correct scoliosis. Why doesn't my doctor recommend this? While use of this technique has been reported, there is insufficient clinical evidence to suggest that it offers a benefit to patients with idiopathic scoliosis. I'm scheduled to undergo surgery for scoliosis and am worried about damage to my nervous system. What are the risks of injury? When performed by experienced orthopedic spine surgeon and surgical team, surgery for scoliosis considered very safe. Maintaining and protecting nervous system function is one of the surgeon’s highest priorities. In general, for uncomplicated adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the reported risk of nerve injury with surgery is between 0.7% and 1%. In adult patients, the rate of injury ranges between 1% and 5%. Intraoperative spinal cord monitoring will help detect early changes in cord function during surgery. What are the chances that a 15-year-old teenager who gets scoliosis surgery will need additional surgery later in life? If spine surgery has been properly performed in a teenager, the chance that he or she will require revision surgery in the short- or medium term is very low. More than 98% of patients do well. Surgical complications are quite rare, and most patients leave the hospital within a week after surgery without pain or other problems with wound healing or with the instrumentation used to correct the spinal curve. The need for further surgery in the future will depend on the type of instrumentation that was used and the sagittal (sideways) alignment of the spine. Location of the area in which instrumentation was placed is also significant. Formerly, revision surgery in the long term was more common in patients with long fusions to the lower portion of the lumbar spine (the vertebrae closest to the pelvis). It appears that the current use of current segmental instrumentation systems that take into account the restoration and maintenance of spinal alignment is reducing the chance that (longer-term) revision surgery will be necessary. What are the advantages of an anterior versus a posterior scoliosis surgery? The terms anterior (from the front and, sometimes also, side of the body) and posterior (from the patient’s back) refer to the approach the surgeon takes in reaching the area of the spine to be treated. Most curves can be treated with a posterior procedure in which the surgeon uses segmental instrumentation and fusion. This type of surgery generally works best for thoracic curves and for double curves. A posterior approach is easier for the surgeon and offers the advantage of allowing two rods to be placed which obviates the need for external immobilization with a brace or other device. Traditionally, some special curves – such as thoracolumbar and lumbar deformities – have been treated with anterior approach because it offers the advantage of fusing the fewest levels possible, and the ability to derotate the spine and provide three-dimensional correction of spinal deformity. Spine surgeons have applied anterior instrumentation to thoracic curves, but this not a popular practice these days.

f4fdb8ff-1c99-4250-85c0-5e7db2016d8b,"from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Spinal Deformity in Children with Myelomeningocele Myelomeningocele, or spina bifida cystica, is a birth defect that occurs in the early weeks of fetal development. It is the most common and most serious type of spina bifida, a neural tube defect that occurs in about 1500 babies born each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and the National Birth Defects Network. In babies with myelomeningocele, some bones of the back (vertebrae) do not develop properly and do not close completely around the spinal cord. As a result, portions of the spinal cord, nerves, spinal fluid, and surrounding tissues push through the incomplete backbone and are exposed. These tissues often form a sac that sticks out of a baby's back. The myelomeningocele opening or sac can form anywhere along the back, and most often occurs in the lower back area. Infants typically lose nerve functioning below where the defect occurs in the spine. In many cases of myelomeningocele, infants and children have sensation loss, paralysis, and bowel and bladder problems. The paralysis can lead to deformities of the legs, feet, and back. Many children with myelomeningocele develop more severe deformities of the spine, such as scoliosis. This article focuses on the treatment of spinal deformities associated with myelomeningocele. Because children with myelomeningocele can have a range of medical issues, treatment involves a team of doctors and health professionals from different medical specialties working together to provide care. It is known that taking folic acid reduces the risks for neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because these types of defects develop so early in pregnancy, doctors today advise prospective mothers to take folic acid prior to becoming pregnant, as well as during pregnancy. As a result, the incidence of neural tube defects like myelomeningocele is declining. The development of a spinal problem, or curvature, is prevalent in the more severe cases of myelomeningocele. The three most common types of spinal deformity are: (sideways curvature of the spine to the left or right). Scoliosis in children with myelomeningocele often results from a lack of neuromuscular control — not being able to consciously control movement. (exaggerated round back). Kyphosis can develop from muscle imbalances in a child's trunk that are associated with paralysis. (exaggerated sway back). Lordosis can occur when a child's hip muscles are tight, causing the pelvis to push forward and an exaggerated swayback to develop. Instead of a straight line down the middle of the back, a spine with scoliosis curves sideways. A child with myelomeningocele requires the ongoing care of several medical specialists. An orthopaedic surgeon manages any bone or muscle problems that interfere with the child's ability to function A neurosurgeon monitors the health of the child's brain and spinal cord A urologist manages any bowel and bladder problems A physical rehabilitation doctor helps customize braces and/or make any necessary wheelchair modifications Treatment for a spinal curvature is led by a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, but because these children have wide-ranging medical needs, the entire medical team must be involved to ensure the best outcome. Most children with myelomeningocele use wheelchairs due to partial or complete paralysis in their legs. A spinal curvature can cause sitting imbalances that put too much pressure on certain areas and result in skin problems. For example, a kyphosis curve may force a child to lean forward and rely on his or her hands for constant support. Without the use of his or her hands, the child is not able to perform many daily activities. In addition, the kyphosis prominence may press against the back of the wheelchair causing pressure sores that become hard to heal. The orthopaedic surgeon will examine the child's curvature and assess any problems with sitting balance, skin breakdown, or daily function. Images of the spine help the doctor evaluate the condition and position of the child's bones. An x-ray will also show the doctor how severe the curve is. To determine the right treatment, the doctor will measure the degree of the curve as it appears in an x-ray. In general, curves measuring 20° or more are considered serious and require treatment. Curves greater than 45° to 50° will likely need surgery to restore a more normal posture. These tests provide clear images of soft tissues and help the doctor to evaluate the health of the spinal cord. Many spinal deformities in children with myelomeningocele will worsen. As a spinal curvature progresses, risks for skin and functional problems increase. In addition, severe curves can collapse space in the chest, which can potentially cause heart and lung problems. If a child is still growing and the spine curvature is flexible, the doctor may recommend wearing a brace. Although bracing cannot straighten a spinal curve, it may slow down the curve progression and allow the child more growth before surgery is required. Braces need to be custom-made so that they fit the child and do not cause any skin irritation or other problems. If a child has a shifted pelvis that affects balance, the wheelchair can be modified to improve posture. Like bracing, wheelchair modification can improve a child's function and slow the progression of a curve, but it should not be viewed as a cure. If bracing and/or wheelchair modifications are not effective at controlling the progression of spinal curve, or if a child comes to the doctor with a severe curvature of the spine, surgery may be necessary. The operation for a spinal curve is a spinal fusion. The basic idea is to realign and fuse together the curved vertebrae so that they heal into a single, solid bone. Screws, rods, hooks, or wires will keep the bones in place. Spinal fusion can: Straighten the spine to improve posture and alleviate the need for the child to use their hands and arms to support their upper body Avoid pressure points from developing due to uneven sitting that can cause the skin to break down An eight-year-old girl with a 100° scoliosis curve. X-rays show the curve before and after spinal fusion surgery. Courtesy of Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children A 14-year-old boy with extensive kyphosis before and after surgery. The x-ray shows the instrumentation used to straighten his spine. Courtesy of Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children The surgical treatment of children with spinal deformities associated with myelomeningocele can be difficult because of additional medical problems, such as hydracephalus, skin conditions, and urinary tract infections. However, careful preoperative planning with a team of medical professionals, as well as new fusion implant designs, can result in successful outcomes.

0edf6f1e-aa0e-4c89-b85d-0a659123bdec,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Kyphosis is a deformity of the backbone (spine). It’s when the bones of the spine (vertebrae) in the upper back curve outward more than they should. A child with kyphosis has a back that is abnormally rounded or humpback. The condition is more common in girls than in boys. A normal spine when looked at from behind appears straight. It can have a curve of 20° to 45°in the upper part of the back. With kyphosis, the curve can be 50°or more. A child can be born with kyphosis. Or he or she can develop it because of other health reasons. These include: Brittle bone disease (osteogenesis imperfecta), which causes bones to break easily Scheuermann disease, which causes the vertebrae to curve forward in the upper back Kyphosis can also be caused by slouching. In such cases, it is called postural kyphosis. This is the most common type. It’s often first noticed in the teen years. These are the most common symptoms of kyphosis. Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each child. They can include: The head bends forward compared with the rest of the body Upper back looks higher than normal when the child bends forward Tight muscles in the back of the thigh (hamstring) The symptoms of kyphosis may seem like other back problems. Or they may be a result of an injury or infection. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Your child’s healthcare provider can diagnose kyphosis with a complete health history of your child, a physical exam, and certain tests. He or she will want to know if there is any family history of kyphosis. He or she will also ask about developmental milestones since some types of kyphosis can be linked to other neuromuscular problems. This test can make images of internal tissues, bones, and organs. It can measure the angle of your child’s spinal curve. Treatment is often based on this measurement. This test can rule out any infection or broken bones in your child’s back. This test uses a combination of large magnets, radiofrequencies, and a computer to make detailed images of organs and structures within the body. It can rule out any other problems of the spinal cord and nerves. This test uses X-rays and a computer to make detailed images of the body. Finding kyphosis early is important for successful treatment. If the condition is left untreated, it can lead to problems with lung function. Healthcare providers, and even some school programs, routinely look for signs of kyphosis in children. Your child may need some other tests such as pulmonary function testing to see if there is any impact on your child's breathing. Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. The goal of treatment is to stop the curve from getting worse and prevent deformity. Treatment may include: Your child will need to see his or her healthcare provider regularly. Whether the curve gets worse depends on the amount of skeletal growth, or how skeletally mature your child is. Curving of the spine often slows down or stops after a child reaches puberty. Pain is commonly treated with over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen. If your child’s kyphosis is because of slouching, certain exercises can fix his or her posture. If your child is still growing, he or she may need a brace for some time. In rare cases, your child may need surgery when the curve measures 75° or more and bracing has not slowed down the progression of the curve. Kyphosis is a problem with the spine. It’s when the bones of the spine in the upper back curve outward more than normal. A child can be born with kyphosis. Or he or she can develop it because of other health problems. Slouching can also lead to it. A difference in shoulder height and a forward bent head can be signs of kyphosis. Depending on the cause of kyphosis, your child may need a brace, exercises, or even surgery. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s healthcare provider: Know the reason for the visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you for your child. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help your child. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your child’s condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if your child does not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice. Children's Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Center Care Team",131,exercises for better posture,-13.994455337524414,79
7489d88d-c0b6-449a-bf77-2c4e4dad135f,"from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Congenital scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that is caused by a defect that was present at birth. It occurs in only 1 in 10,000 newborns and is much less common than the type of scoliosis that begins in adolescence. Children with congenital scoliosis sometimes have other health issues, such as kidney or bladder problems. Even though congenital scoliosis is present at birth, it is sometimes impossible to see any spine problems until a child reaches adolescence. As the spine forms before birth, part of one vertebra (or more) may not form completely. When this occurs, the abnormality is called a hemivertebra and can produce a sharp angle in the spine. The angle can get worse as the child grows. This abnormality can happen in just one vertebra or in many throughout the spine. When there is more than one hemivertebra, they will sometimes balance each other out and make the spine more stable. A single hemivertebra in the lower back shown in a 3-D image from a computed tomography (CT) scan. Note the four normal rectangular vertebra below the single triangular-shaped hemivertebra (arrow). This wedged vertebra creates the deformity that would not have otherwise been there. During fetal development, the spine forms first as a single column of tissue that later separates into segments that become the bony vertebrae. If this separation is not complete, the result may be a partial fusion (boney bar) joining two or more vertebrae together. Such a bar prevents the spine from growing on one side after a child is born. This results in a spinal curve that increases as a child grows. The combination of a bar on one side of the spine and a hemivertebra on the other causes the most severe growth problem. These cases can require surgery at an early age to stop the increased curvature of the spine. In addition to scoliosis curves, a child's spine may also develop compensatory curves in order to maintain an upright posture. This occurs when the spine tries to make up for a scoliosis curve by creating other curves in the opposite direction above, or below, the affected area. The vertebrae are shaped normally in compensatory curves. Congenital scoliosis is often detected during the pediatrician's examination at birth because of a slight abnormality of the back. Scoliosis is not painful, so if the curvature is not detected at birth, it can go undetected until there are obvious signs -- which could be as late as adolescence. A child may suspect that something is wrong when clothes do not fit properly. Parents can discover the problem in early summer when they see their child in a bathing suit. Tilted, uneven shoulders, with one shoulder blade protruding more than the other In rare cases there may be a problem with the spinal cord or nerves that produces weakness, numbness, or a loss of coordination. This 4-year-old girl's body shifts to the left. One hip looks higher than the other and her waistline is not the same shape on the two sides. The standard screening test for scoliosis is the forward bending test. Your child will bend forward and your doctor will observe your child from the back, looking for a difference in the shape of the ribs on each side. A spinal deformity will be most noticeable when your child is in this position. With your child standing upright, your doctor will check to see if the hips are level, the shoulders are level, and that the position of the head is centered over the hips. He or she will check the movement of the spine in all directions. To rule out the presence of a spinal cord or nerve problem, your doctor may check the strength in your child's legs and the reflexes in the abdomen and legs. Although the forward bending test can detect scoliosis, it cannot detect the presence of congenital abnormalities. Imaging tests can provide more information. Images of your child's spine are taken from the back and the side. The x-rays will show the abnormal vertebra(e) and how severe the curve is. Once your doctor makes the diagnosis of congenital scoliosis, your child will be referred to a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon for specialized care and further tests. This adolescent girl's curve and the hemivertebra causing it show up clearly on x-ray. A CT scan can provide a detailed image of your child's spine, showing the size, shape, and position of the vertebrae. To see the vertebrae better, your doctor may have a 3-D image made from the CT scan. This looks like a photograph of the bones. This 3-D image from a CT scan shows hemivertebrae, as well as a fused, boney block. Your doctor will do an ultrasound of your child's kidneys to detect any problems. Because an MRI can evaluate soft tissues better than a CT scan, an MRI will be done to check for abnormalities of the spinal cord at least once for every patient. There are several treatment options for congenital scoliosis. In planning your child's treatment, your doctor will take into account the type of vertebral abnormality, the severity of the curve, and any other health problems your child has. Your doctor will determine how likely it is that your child's curve will get worse, and then suggest treatment options to meet your child's specific needs. A child with a small curve that seems to be unchanging will be monitored to make sure the curve is not getting worse. Although it does not happen in every patient, congenital scoliosis curves can get bigger as the spine grows and the deformity of the back becomes more noticeable. It is likely that a curve in a young child will get worse because younger children still have a lot of growing to do. Your doctor will follow the changes of your child's curve using x-rays taken at 6- to 12- month intervals during the growing years. Physical activity does not increase the risk for curve progression. Children with congenital scoliosis can participate in most sports and hobbies. Braces or casts are not effective in treating the curvature caused by the congenitally abnormal vertebrae, but they are sometimes used to control compensatory curves where the vertebrae are normally shaped. have curves that have significantly worsened during the course of x-ray monitoring are developing a neurological problem due to an abnormality in the spinal cord An important goal of surgery is to allow the spine and chest to grow as much as possible. There are several surgical options. In this procedure, the abnormal curved vertebrae are fused together so that they heal into a single, solid bone. This will stop growth completely in the abnormal segment of the spine and prevent the curve from getting worse. A single hemivertebra can be surgically removed. The partial correction of the curve that is achieved by doing this can then be maintained using metal implants. This procedure will only fuse two to three vertebrae together. This x-ray was taken of the same patient after her surgery to remove the hemivertebra and fuse the curved vertebrae with a metal implant. Growing rods do not actually grow but can be lengthened with minor surgery that is repeated every 6 to 8 months. The goal of a growing rod is to allow continued growth while correcting the curve. One or two rods are attached to the spine above and below the curve. Every 6 to 8 months, the child returns to the doctor and the rod is lengthened to keep up with the child's growth. When the child is full grown, the rod(s) are replaced and a spinal fusion is performed. Young children usually recover quickly from surgery and are discharged from the hospital within 1 week. Depending on the operation, a child may need to wear a cast or brace for 3 to 4 months. Once they are healed, children are allowed to participate in most of the activities that they had previously participated in. Congenital scoliosis detected at an early age is one of the most challenging types of scoliosis to treat. The curves can be large to begin with and because children have so much growth ahead of them, the chance of severe curve is high. Although fusion of vertebrae at an early age results in the spine and trunk being shorter than they would have been, children can have outstanding results and achieve normal, or near-normal, function.

Many people have some curve in their spine. But a few people have spines that make a from side to side in the shape of the letter ""S"" or the letter ""C."" If this curve is severe, it can cause pain and make breathing difficult. The good news is that most cases of scoliosis are mild, and the curves don't increase a lot over time. In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is not known. Scoliosis usually starts in the preteen years. Scoliosis that is severe enough to need treatment is most common in girls. Scoliosis most often causes no symptoms until the spinal curve becomes large. You might notice these early signs: Your child has one shoulder or hip that looks higher than the other. Your child's head does not look centered over the body. Your child has one shoulder blade that sticks out more than the other. Your child's waistline is flat on one side, or the ribs look higher on one side when your child bends forward at the waist. The doctor will check to see if your child's back or ribs are even. If the doctor finds that one side is higher than the other, your child may need an X-ray so the spinal curve can be measured. A curve in the spine may get worse as your child grows. Many experts believe screening your child for scoliosis is important so that any curve in the spine can be found early and watched closely. Mild cases of scoliosis usually do not need treatment. The doctor will check the curve of your child's spine every 4 to 6 months. If the curve gets worse, your child may need to wear a brace until he or she has finished growing. In severe cases, or if bracing doesn't help, your child may need to have surgery. Scoliosis and its treatment can be a severe strain on your child. Wearing a brace can feel and look odd. It also limits your child's activity. Your child needs your support and understanding to get through treatments successfully. Your child may be more likely to have scoliosis if someone in your family has had it and if your child is a girl. Your child's chances of scoliosis increase if: One of the bones in your child's spine has moved forward out of place compared to the rest of the spine. Your child's arms or legs are missing or are abnormally short. Your child has a disorder that affects the nerves, muscles, or bones. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is not known. This is called idiopathic scoliosis. It develops mostly in the preteen and teen years. It often runs in families. There are two types of scoliosis: nonstructural and structural. Nonstructural (functional) scoliosis involves a curve in the spine that is reversible because it is caused by a condition such as: Structural scoliosis involves a curve in the spine that is irreversible. It is usually caused by an unknown factor (idiopathic) or a disease or condition such as: Disorders that were present at birth (congenital), such as , in which the spinal canal does not close properly; or a disorder that affects the formation of bones. These curves can be harder to correct. They often get worse as the child grows, especially during the teen years. Nerve or muscle disorders, such as , , or . In children and teens, typically does not cause symptoms and is not obvious until the curve of the spine becomes moderate or severe. It may first become noticeable to a parent who observes that the child's clothes do not fit right or that hems hang unevenly. The child's spine may look crooked, or the ribs may stick out. The child's head is not centered over his or her body. One shoulder blade may stick out more than the other. The ribs are higher on one side when the child bends forward from the waist. Most of the time scoliosis does not cause pain in children or teens. When back pain is present with scoliosis, it may be because the curve in the spine is causing stress and pressure on the spinal discs, nerves, muscles, ligaments, or facet joints. It is not usually caused by the curve itself. Pain in a teen who has scoliosis may be a sign of another problem, such as a bone or spinal tumor. If your child has pain with scoliosis, it is very important that he or she see a doctor to find out what is causing the pain. Some other conditions, such as , cause symptoms similar to scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis, the most common type, does not have a known cause. Children who have this type of scoliosis usually first develop symptoms in the preteen years. Most cases of scoliosis are mild, involving small curves in the spine that do not get worse. Small curves usually don't cause pain or other problems. Usually a doctor examines the child every 4 to 6 months to watch for any changes. In moderate or severe cases of scoliosis, the curves continue to get worse. During periods of growth, such as during the teenage growth spurt, the curves may get worse. Mild to moderate curves often stop progressing when the skeleton stops growing. Larger curves may get worse throughout adulthood unless they are treated. Things that may point to the potential increase in a include: The age of the child and the development stage, or maturity, of his or her skeleton when scoliosis is diagnosed. The less mature the skeleton is when scoliosis starts, the greater the chance that scoliosis will get worse. Skeletal age, as determined by the Risser sign, is also used to find out the risk that the curve will get worse. The size of the curve. The larger the curve, the greater the risk that it will get worse. The location and shape of the curve. Curves in the upper back are more likely to get worse than curves in the lower back. Girls are more likely than boys to have larger curves and more severe scoliosis. As scoliosis gets worse, the bones of the spine move toward the inside of the curve. If it happens in the upper part of the spine, the ribs may crowd together on one side and spread apart on the other side. The curve may force the spinal bones closer together. The spinal bones on the outer edge of the curve may also get thick. Although it is uncommon, babies can be born with scoliosis (congenital) or can develop it during the first 3 years of their lives (infantile scoliosis). Scoliosis that is present at birth or that develops in infants may be worse in the long run than scoliosis that develops later in life. This is because the more growing the skeleton has to do, the worse the curve may get. But in some cases congenital curves do not get worse. And some curves that are present during infancy get better on their own without treatment. Things that increase a person's risk for scoliosis include: Family history. Scoliosis is known to run in families. Being female. Girls are more likely than boys to have a significant curve that requires treatment. A spinal bone that is pushed forward (forward displacement), usually in the lower back (spondylolisthesis). Other disorders related to tissue development while in the womb. Call your doctor to have your child evaluated for scoliosis if: You notice that something about your child's posture looks unusual. Examples are ribs that stick out, one shoulder that is higher than the other, one hip that is higher than the other, and an uneven waistline. You observe that your child's clothes don't fit properly or that his or her hems don't hang evenly. A school screening program recommends that your child see a doctor. If you suspect that your child has a spinal curve, ask a health professional to look at it. Early detection could lead to early treatment and could prevent a curve from getting worse. If the results of a school screening program suggest that your child may have a spinal curve, follow up with your doctor. Most curves that are found through school screening programs are normal variations in the spine or mild scoliosis, and these curves usually need only regular observation. The following health professionals could identify and monitor scoliosis: A doctor who specializes in surgery of the bones () may be consulted if the person has a moderate curve or if the curve is getting worse. The orthopedic surgeon will evaluate the curve and may recommend bracing or surgery. A health professional who fits people with specially designed assistive devices (orthotist) can build and fit a custom brace. Scoliosis testing usually begins with a history and physical exam. This includes the forward-bending test, a simple test in which the child bends forward at the waist, arms hanging loosely and palms touching, and the examiner looks for unevenness in the child's back or ribs. A can be used to measure and estimate the rotation of the spinal curve. If the findings of the history and physical exam show a significant spinal curve, an of the spine may be taken to get a more precise measurement of the spinal curve. Skeletal age, as determined by the Risser sign, is also a helpful measure to find out the risk that the curve will get worse. If someone in your family has scoliosis, your children should be checked regularly. Neurological testing may be done on children who have scoliosis to see if they have certain disorders that are often associated with scoliosis, such as or . Screening means doing a simple test to see if more testing might be needed. Some states require screening for scoliosis by law. But experts don't agree with whether or not to screen for scoliosis. Screening can lead to early treatment and may prevent curves from getting worse. But screening can also lead to more testing or treatment for children who would not have needed it. Some experts believe that children should be screened for scoliosis regularly throughout their preteen and teen years. If you are concerned about screening for scoliosis, talk to your child's doctor. The goal of treatment for scoliosis is to prevent the spinal curve from getting worse and to correct or stabilize a severe spinal curve. Fortunately, few people who have spinal curves require treatment. The type of treatment depends on the cause of scoliosis. Scoliosis that is caused by another condition (nonstructural scoliosis) usually improves when the condition, such as muscle spasms or a difference in leg length, is treated. Scoliosis that is caused by a disease or by an unknown factor (structural scoliosis) is more likely than nonstructural scoliosis to need treatment. This includes either routine exams by a doctor to check for any curve progression or the use of a brace to stop a spinal curve from getting worse. Children typically have these checkups about every 4 to 6 months. Surgery can usually decrease the curve and stabilize the spine so the curve does not get worse. Treatment is based on the child's age, the , and the risk of progression. The risk of progression is based on age at diagnosis, the size of the curve (as measured using ), and skeletal age (which can be determined by the Risser sign). Mild curves are usually checked by the doctor every 4 to 6 months until the bones stop growing, to be sure the curves aren't getting worse. Moderate curves may need to be braced until the bones stop growing, to keep the curves from getting worse. Severe curves or moderate curves that are getting worse may need surgery. Most cases of scoliosis are mild and do not require treatment. The timing of surgery for scoliosis in children is controversial. Spinal fusion stops the growth of the fused part of the spine, so some experts believe that surgery should be delayed until the child is at least 10 years old and preferably 12. But even after surgery the rest of the spine will continue to grow normally in children who are still growing. Scoliosis cannot be prevented. Treatment is aimed at preventing the curve from getting worse. If your child or teen has been diagnosed with mild scoliosis, it is important that a doctor check the child's spine every 4 to 6 months to see whether the curve is getting worse. Most spinal curves do not progress to the point where treatment is needed. But it is important to check for curve progression, because early treatment can often stop it. Treatment for moderate or severe scoliosis can dramatically impact your child's life. If your child has scoliosis, it is important that your family be sensitive to the difficulty of having scoliosis and . A scoliosis clinic, where other children are being treated, can provide a supportive environment for your child. When back pain is present with scoliosis, it may be that the curve in the spine is causing stress and pressure on the spinal discs, nerves, muscles, ligaments, or facet joints. It is not usually caused by the curve itself. Some people may use nonprescription medicines such as naproxen or ibuprofen to treat back pain. While these medicines may relieve symptoms of back pain temporarily, they do not heal scoliosis or back injuries. And they don't stop the pain from coming back. Surgery may be used to treat severe scoliosis. The goal of surgery is to improve a severe spinal curve. The result will not be a perfectly straight spine, but the goal is to balance the spine and to make sure the curve does not get worse. Surgery usually involves stabilizing the spine and keeping the curve from getting worse by permanently joining the vertebrae together. Things that are considered before surgery include: The size, direction, and location of the . Whether other treatment, such as bracing, has failed. Your child has a moderate to severe curve, and the curve is getting worse. Your child has pain or trouble doing his or her daily activities. The main type of surgery for scoliosis involves attaching rods to the spine and doing a . Spinal fusion is used to stabilize and reduce the size of the curve and stop the curve from getting worse by permanently joining the vertebrae into a solid mass of bone. Other techniques are sometimes used, including instrumentation without fusion, which attaches devices such as metal rods to the spine to stabilize a spinal curve without fusing the spine together. This is only done in very young children when a fusion, which stops the growth of the fused part of the spine, is not desirable. The child usually has to wear a brace full-time after having this surgery. The timing of surgery for scoliosis in children is controversial. Spinal fusion stops the growth of the fused part of the spine. So some experts believe that surgery should be delayed until the child is at least 10 years old and preferably 12. But even after surgery the rest of the spine will continue to grow normally in children who are still growing. Surgical treatment in children and teens usually requires several days in the hospital and limitations on activity for about a year. Treatment other than surgery for scoliosis includes observation. In a child who is still growing, a mild spinal curve may need only regular checkups every 4 to 6 months to see if the curve is getting worse. There is no evidence that corrective exercises, electrical stimulation, or spinal manipulation are effective treatments for scoliosis. For children with moderate curves, the research shows that generally works to keep curves from getting worse as the child grows. The more the child wears the brace, the better it works. But wearing a brace can be emotionally hard on preteens and teens, who don't like to feel different. So family support is important. A common reason for bracing not working well is that the child doesn't wear it as prescribed, usually because he or she is embarrassed. A brace can also be uncomfortable. Here's how family members and your child's friends can help: Encourage your child to talk about what he or she needs to feel comfortable during brace fittings. For example, fittings include chest measurements. Allow your child to request a same-sex technician, if one is available. This can help your child feel more involved and at ease during treatment. Treat the brace like a tool that's helping your child. Try to make it just a routine part of your child's—and your family's—life. Encourage your child to learn all he or she can about scoliosis and how the back brace can help. This knowledge may help your child deal with questions, or even teasing, at school and elsewhere. Encourage your child to talk about the brace with friends. Listen to your child when he or she talks about his or her concerns. Ask your child how you and his or her friends can help. Show your child how to find online forums where preteens and teens talk about their experiences with a back brace. These forums can help give your child the courage to keep going. Your child can take part in online discussions and learn all kinds of advice, from what kinds of clothes work best to what to say on a date. Observe your child's frame of mind. If you think your child may feel isolated or depressed because of the back brace, ask your doctor for help. U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2018).

9ecdf3b4-2fc2-4b23-a6bc-237d2f6d57cd,"Scoliosis treatment using spinal manipulation and the Pettibon Weighting System™: a summary of 3 atypical presentations Scoliosis treatment using spinal manipulation and the Pettibon Weighting System™: a summary of 3 atypical presentations , Article number:  () Given the relative lack of treatment options for mild to moderate scoliosis, when the Cobb angle measurements fall below the 25–30° range, conservative manual therapies for scoliosis treatment have been increasingly investigated in recent years. In this case series, we present 3 specific cases of scoliosis. Patient presentation, examination, intervention and outcomes are detailed for each case. The types of scoliosis presented here are left thoracic, idiopathic scoliosis after Harrington rod instrumentation, and a left thoracic scoliosis secondary to Scheuermann's Kyphosis. Each case carries its own clinical significance, in relation to clinical presentation. The first patient presented for chiropractic treatment with a 35° thoracic dextroscoliosis 18 years following Harrington Rod instrumentation and fusion. The second patient presented with a 22° thoracic levoscoliosis and concomitant Scheuermann's Disease. Finally, the third case summarizes the treatment of a patient with a primary 37° idiopathic thoracic levoscoliosis. Each patient was treated with a novel active rehabilitation program for varying lengths of time, including spinal manipulation and a patented external head and body weighting system. Following a course of treatment, consisting of clinic and home care treatments, post-treatment radiographs and examinations were conducted. Improvement in symptoms and daily function was obtained in all 3 cases. Concerning Cobb angle measurements, there was an apparent reduction in Cobb angle of 13°, 8°, and 16° over a maximum of 12 weeks of treatment. Although mild to moderate reductions in Cobb angle measurements were achieved in these cases, these improvements may not be related to the symptomatic and functional improvements. The lack of a control also includes the possibility of a placebo effect. However, this study adds to the growing body of literature investigating methods by which mild to moderate cases of scoliosis can be treated conservatively. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether curve reduction and/or manipulation and/or placebo was responsible for the symptomatic and functional improvements noted in these cases. Idiopathic scoliosis is estimated to affect about 2–3% of adolescent females age 10–16 years [–]. Scoliosis is a postural deformity characterized as a lateral curvature of the spine greater than 10°, measured by the Cobb method on standing upright spine radiographs []. While most cases of scoliosis are classified as idiopathic [], a minority of scoliosis cases are traced to structural anomalies [], such as wedged vertebrae or abnormal soft tissue development. In addition to lateral curvature, scoliosis is also recognized in the sagittal plane. One of the potential causes of sagittal plane scoliosis is Scheuermann's Disease. Scheuermann's Disease is characterized by wedging greater than 5° at 3 consecutive vertebral levels []. Although a distinct cause is unknown, it is postulated to arise from an injury to the vertebral growth plate during the adolescent period, causing cessation of further development []. Scheuermann's Disease can lead to thoracic hyperkyphosis, which may ultimately place increased strain at the thoracolumbar and cervicothoracic junctions. This is supported by evidence of increased disc pathology at transitional areas like the midthoracic (T7–T8) spine and thoracolumbar junction (T11-L1) []. Although a growing amount of literature has tested conservative treatments for idiopathic scoliosis [–], conservative treatments for scoliosis secondary to bony or soft tissue developmental disorders have not been widely tested in the chiropractic literature. This paper discusses the results of 3 clinical patients with scoliosis and their respective case histories, treatment, and results. The first case describes the treatment of a patient with a past history of surgical stabilization. While there is some information available regarding chiropractic treatment of scoliosis, we could find no published reports detailing treatment of a scoliosis patient while surgical hardware was still in place. The second case involves a male with scoliosis secondary to Scheuermann's Disease. Finally, the third case details the history and treatment of a female with a rare left thoracic-right lumbar scoliosis pattern. A 37-yr-old female presented to a private spine clinic with a chief complaint of episodic neck and back pain. The subject began care while her daughter was being treated for scoliosis in the same clinic. She presented with a past medical history including previous diagnosis and treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Her previous treatment included spinal fusion and Harrington rod instrumentation. Preoperatively, a 58° right thoracic scoliosis was found between T6 and T11. Harrington rod instrumentation reduced the scoliosis to 26°. We were unable to review her medical records pre and post arthrodesis. Although her family history identified a possible genetic component with her daughter's medical history, her preceding family history was negative for scoliosis. The subject initially filled out a Functional Rating Index. This index, described and tested by Feise et al [], is a combination of the Neck Disability Index and the Oswestry Back Pain Index. This form provides a valid and reliable self-rated assessment of functional improvement in daily activities. On static visual posture examination, a moderate anterior right shoulder, a protruding right scapula, and a right rib hump were identified. These visual postural findings are used as screening indicators so that unnecessary radiographic studies are not undertaken. Adam's test confirmed the right rib hump on forward bending. This test is classically used in the primary care setting to screen for scoliosis, although its reliability has been called into question []. The radiographs series consisted of lateral cervical and lumbar views, as well as opposing frontal views. The lateral films were taken to calculate the amount of cervical lordosis, forward head posture, and lumbar lordosis. The cervical lordosis was measured from an angle between 2 lines intersecting the posterior C2 and C7 vertebral bodies. The lumbar lordosis was taken from the angle formed by the intersection of 2 posterior tangent lines drawn from the back of L1 and L5. Preliminary evidence suggests that correcting the sagittal spine before reducing the scoliotic curvature may promote a longer lasting correction [, ]. In this case, the initial cervical lordosis measured 23° from C2 to C7, the initial forward head posture measured 31 mm, and the lumbar lordosis measured 31°. Analysis of forward head posture was performed by drawing a vertical line from the posterior inferior corner of C7 upward []. The distance from this line to the posterior superior corner of C2 is measured in millimeters. The initial standing AP radiograph showed a right thoracic scoliosis of 35°, shown in Figure . This measurement was taken from a Cobb angle drawn between the superior endplate of T6 and the inferior endplate of T11. We used a sectional view of the thoracolumbar spine to reduce positional distortion commonly encountered on full-spine films []. The film was taken at a 72"" film to focal distance (FFD) to reduce magnification distortion. For radiographic analytical purposes, we used the positioning and analysis methods outlined by Harrison et al [, –]. These methods have shown good to excellent reliability in terms of patient positioning, and inter- and intra-examiner reliability. Initially, the patient self-rated her back and neck pain as a 7/10 on a numerical pain rating scale. The Pettibon corrective procedures [] were used in this patient's care plan. The goal of these procedures is to promote a normal [–] sagittal spinal contour. A specific treatment plan was created based upon a trial treatment involving the Pettibon procedures. The patient received bilateral cervical spine traction-type manipulation to mobilize several cervical spinal joints, and then was immediately fitted with a 4-lb Pettibon Headweight. The patient walked on a treadmill for 10 minutes while wearing the headweight. After 10 minutes, a follow-up lateral cervical radiograph was taken while wearing the headweight. The purpose of this lateral stress view is to evaluate the potential improvement in cervical lordosis and reduction in forward head posture. Cervical lordosis and forward head posture are again measured on these stress views to evaluate response to treatment. Although earlier studies suggest that a 23° cervical lordosis may also be normal [–], newer research identifies a cervical lordosis closer to the 40° range [, , ] Despite this evidence; the concept of a normal cervical lordosis remains a debatable issue. Once it was determined that the patient could benefit by the proposed treatment, a plan was developed and implemented specifically for her. Her plan included once-weekly office visits, with an emphasis on home care exercises to promote patient independence. Each visit consisted of warm-up procedures, manipulation, and rehabilitative exercises. The warm-up procedures consisted of Pettibon Wobble Chair Exercises, shown in Figure . The Pettibon Wobble Chair is a chair designed to isolate the lumbar spine so that core training may take place. The goals of the chair are to promote lumbar stability, muscular coordination, and increase flexibility. However, the benefits of the chair itself remain to be investigated. The Wobble Chair exercises are performed by holding the head and shoulders still, moving only the pelvic girdle. The exercises consist of a front-to-back motion, a side-to-side motion, and clockwise/counterclockwise circles. Each exercise was performed 20 times, for a total of 80 repetitions at each office visit. Side-posture lumbopelvic adjustments were delivered bilaterally to mobilize the sacroiliac joints. Cervical spine manipulation was performed by hand in accordance with the radiographic findings. The cervical spine manipulative procedures can be found in the osteopathic literature []. The rehabilitative included the use of a 4-lb anterior Pettibon Headweight, a right low shoulderweight, and a left high shoulderweight. An illustration of the weighting system is shown in Figure . During each office visit, the subject wore the headweight and shoulderweights while standing or walking. This exercise was performed for 10 minutes following the manipulative procedures. The patient was instructed to wear the headweight and shoulderweights at home for 20 minutes twice daily. Positional traction, on 2 triangular foam blocks placed at the cervicothoracic and thoracolumbar junctions, was performed once daily immediately before bed for 20 minutes. After 8 visits in 8 weeks, post radiographs were taken to quantify changes in the sagittal and frontal spinal curves. Additionally, the subject filled out a follow-up Functional Rating Index to compare to the original. The Functional Rating Index score dropped from a 33% disability rating to 8%, and the numerical pain rating scale, rated a 7.0/10 at the onset of care, dropped to a 0/10. The average numerical pain rating scale score over the 8-week span was 3.3 out of 10. On the post-treatment anteroposterior radiograph, the Cobb angle from T6–T11 was reduced from 35° to 22°. Her cervical lordosis measured 40°, while her forward head posture reduced to 13 mm. The follow-up radiographs were taken at the beginning of the 9 visit prior to treatment, one week after the previous treatment. A 30-yr-old African-American male presented to a private spine clinic with a chief complaint of chronic mid thoracic pain. The patient had a previous medical diagnosis of Scheuermann's Disease. Moderate wedging was found on previous lateral lumbar and thoracic radiographs at the levels of T7–T10. The patient reported having the back pain consistently over the last 8–10 years, with recurrent episodes of intense myospasms occurring in the paraspinal musculature at the thoracolumbar junction. The patient had been previously managed unsuccessfully with prescription NSAIDS, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy consisting of cryotherapy, electric stimulation, and postural isotonic exercises. The patient could not recall any childhood traumatic events that may have contributed to the vertebral wedging asymmetry. The subject initially filled out a Functional Rating Index []. We used this form to provide an objective assessment of functional improvement in daily activities. On static visual posture examination, a moderate high and anterior left shoulder and a right rib hump were identified. The paraspinal thoracolumbar musculature had also been significantly developed. Although these factors are not differential for Scheuermann's Disease, they do represent postural abnormalities often associated with scoliosis. Palpatory findings included marked areas of spasticity over the right latissimus dorsi, the left trapezius, the left quadratus lumborum, and the left rhomboid muscles. Standing anteroposterior and lateral cervical and lumbar radiographs were obtained and analyzed for regional alignment as previously described. Gross radiographic visualization showed a postural swayback positioning, where the pelvis shifts anterior in relation to the thoracic cage. This may result from activation of the pelvo-ocular reflex to compensate for a forward head position []. The initial absolute rotation angles (ARA) from C2–C7 on the lateral cervical view [] and L1–L5 on the lateral lumbar view [] were drawn and measured. Prior to treatment, these angles measured 32° and 55°, respectively. According to Harrison et al, the normal lumbar lordosis should measure 39.7°, with a majority of the lordosis comprised in the L4-S1 region []. Prior to treatment, the forward head posture measured 22 mm, compared to an average normal of <20 mm []. The vertical axis line (VAL), measured from the anterior portion of the sacral base, should intersect the T11/T12 area []. In this case, the patient's VAL was 56 mm anterior to this interspace, consistent with a swayback type of posture. In the coronal views, a left thoracic scoliosis was found between the levels of T1–T5 measuring 22°. Nothing remarkable was found on the AP lumbopelvic. The patient began an initial treatment plan consisting of 3 weekly visits for 4 weeks. The goals of this initial treatment plan were very specific, including restoring normal sagittal cervical and lumbar curves, reducing forward head posture, and reducing the swayback posture. The initial 4 weeks of care consisted of manipulative and rehabilitative therapy designed to improve the static alignment of the sagittal spine. These methods are part of the Pettibon system []. The first 12 visits entailed the same procedures in the same order. To begin each visit, the patient performed a series of exercises on a Pettibon Wobble Chair. This chair is consists of a multiplanar seat that allows the user to perform specific spinopelvic motion patterns. Clinical observation by the authors suggests that these exercises seem to make the manipulative treatment easier on the patient. In this case, manipulative treatment included bilateral cervical manipulation and anterior thoracic manipulation to mobilize any restricted cervical and/or thoracic segments. Following the manipulative treatment, the patient was fitted with a Pettibon Headweight containing 4 lbs on the front of the forehead. The patient walked for 15 minutes while wearing the headweight. After 15 minutes, the patient laid supine on a pair of high-density foam blocks to promote a normal sagittal spinal contour. This was done while lying on an intersegmental traction table for 7 minutes. The patient was prescribed specific home care exercises to be performed daily between visits, and was instructed to walk with the Pettibon Headweight for 20 minutes twice daily on non-clinic days, and lie on the high-density foam blocks for 20 minutes every night immediately before bed. After 4 weeks, post treatment lateral cervical and lateral lumbar radiographs were taken to quantify improvement in sagittal alignment. The post lateral cervical showed a 32° cervical lordosis and 5 mm of forward head posture. The post lateral lumbar showed a 44° lumbar lordosis, while the vertical axis line fell 30 mm from the T11/T12 interspace. The 4-week functional rating index improved from a 70% disability to 50% disability, while the numerical pain rating scale dropped from a 9/10 to an 8/10. Given the presence of bony deformity, we felt that significant time must be spent reducing the asymmetrical loading in the thoracic spine for coronal correction to be achieved. Therefore, the frequency of visits remained at 3 times per week over the next 20 weeks. Over this 20-week period of care, the manipulative treatment remained the same. However, several new rehab procedures were added. The patient still wore the headweight for 15 minutes immediately following the manipulative treatment. After the headweight, the patient worked out on the Pettibon Wobble Chair while simultaneously performing cephalad traction, demonstrated in Figure . Following this procedure, a specific isometric exercise was performed on a Pettibon Linked Trainer. This exercise, shown in Figure , is designed to isolate the right rhomboid muscle. Theoretically, the linked trainer stabilizes the scapula, thereby functionally changing the origin and insertion of the rhomboid. This form of exercise has been previously illustrated with practitioner assistance []. Typically, the function of the rhomboid is to retract the scapula. However, when the scapula is stabilized, now the muscle may effectively pull on its proximal attachment, that being the spinous processes from T5–T8. Therefore, by switching the action of the muscle, our goal was to use the rhomboid to help reduce the left thoracic scoliosis. The patient was instructed to perform this exercise by pulling and holding for 10 seconds, repeating this process until the muscle is sufficiently fatigued. Finally, lateral traction was performed on the thoracic scoliosis using a high-density foam block while in a side-lying position. This block was placed beneath the apex of the scoliotic curvature for 15 minutes. Home care exercises remained the same. However, the frequency of the exercises was dropped to 3 times per week instead of daily. At the conclusion of the 20 weeks, post treatment AP cervicothoracic and lumbopelvic radiographs were taken to quantify improvement. The Cobb angle of the left thoracic scoliosis from T1–T5 reduced to 14°. A comparative view of the pre and post AP cervicothoracic views is shown in Figure . A 20-week functional rating index score dropped to a 28% disability rating, while the numerical pain rating scale dropped to a 6/10. A 23-year-old female presented with bilateral diffuse neck and lumbodorsal pain, and right-sided scapular and shoulder pain. The pain was constant and sharp in nature with radicular pain into the right arm and elbow. At age 12, her primary care physician diagnosed her with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. At that time, the treatment plan was mainly comprised of observational methods, such as radiographs, visualization, and MRI. About one year before presenting to the primary author's clinic, she was referred for physical therapy by an orthopedic surgeon, which produced little subjective benefit, according to the patient. On visual examination, a prominent left posterior rib hump was identified. In the frontal plane, she also displayed a marked high left shoulder with anterior rotation. Left anterior pelvic rotation was also well visualized. Given these preliminary findings, along with the positive past history of scoliosis, radiographic imaging was ordered to locate and calculate the nature and severity of the scoliosis. Initial standing 14"" × 17"" sectional radiographs showed a 37° left thoracic scoliosis, measured from the superior endplate of the T3 vertebra and the inferior endplate of the T7 vertebra. She also had a 26° right lumbar scoliosis measured from the superior endplate of T10 and the inferior endplate of L3. In the sagittal plane, her initial cervical lordosis measured 18°, while her lumbar lordosis measured 50°. The patient began a treatment plan of 3 visits per week for 4 weeks, followed by once weekly visits for 12 weeks. Goals for the first 4 weeks of treatment included: 1) improvement of sagittal spine alignment, 2) reduction in pain and symptoms, and 3) functional improvement. A specific treatment routine was followed at each visit for the first 12 visits. Each visit began with spinal warm-up exercises performed on a Pettibon Wobble Chair™. The patient then received a brief (less than 15 minutes) session of deep tissue massage therapy applied to the postural muscles. Following these procedures, manipulative intervention took place. The manipulative techniques are collectively taught within the Pettibon technique [], and were employed according to this methodology. First, a posteroanterior high-velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) procedure was applied to mobilize the thoracolumbar region. This was followed by anterior thoracic manipulation to mobilize the cervicothoracic region. A side-lying sacral manipulation was performed bilaterally to mobilize the sacroiliac joints and the lumbosacral joint. Cervical manipulation was performed only on those visits where a supine leg check revealed evidence of leg length inequality (LLI). In the cervical region, an HVLA thrust was applied cranially, thus creating a traction-type adjustive force compared to more traditional shear- or rotary-type cervical manipulative procedures. All of the manipulative techniques are well illustrated and explained by Gibbons and Tehan []. The patient received cervical manipulation in 8 of the first 12 visits. Immediately following the manipulative intervention, the patient performed her spinal rehabilitative care. In her case, a 4-lb Pettibon Headweight was worn on the front of the head for 10 minutes while maintaining a standing position. Finally, the patient ended each of these visits with the supine positional traction for 7 minutes. The patient was instructed to perform the headweight twice daily between visits for 20-minute intervals. She was also given a set of foam blocks to lie on at night for 20 minutes immediately before bedtime. After this initial 4-week treatment period, a follow-up radiographic series was obtained, along with a follow-up Functional Rating Index. Comparative radiographic analysis showed a reduced Cobb angle of 29° from T3–T7 and 18° from T10-L3. The sagittal cervical lordosis improved to 32°, while the lumbar lordosis decreased to 45°. The follow-up Functional Rating Index score dropped from 48% to 28% disability. Following this treatment period, clinical visits dropped to once weekly over the next 12 weeks. During this time, the Pettibon Linked Trainer™ was incorporated into her treatment plan. The Linked Trainer™ exercises were performed after the anterior headweighting procedure at each visit. Dynamic cervical traction was also applied while performing the Pettibon Wobble Chair™ exercises, immediately prior to the spinal manipulative therapy. Finally, a side-lying traction procedure was added to her treatment to help lengthen the soft tissue structures on the concave side of the spinal curvatures. A triangular foam block was placed under the patient's left side, below the apex of the thoracic curvature, while a 25-lb weight was placed above the apex of the lumbar curvature. The patient assumed a left side-lying position during this traction session. This traction maneuver followed the anterior headweighting and the Linked Trainer™ exercises. This procedure was performed for 40 minutes at each office visit as well as at home once daily. The frequency of headweight use at home dropped to 3 days weekly instead of daily. After 12 weeks of the foregoing treatment, the patient was again re-evaluated using static spinal radiography and the Functional Rating Index. Radiographic analysis demonstrated a 21° left thoracic scoliosis from T3–T7, and a 15° right lumbar scoliosis from T10-L3. Her Functional Rating Index score further reduced to an 18% disability. The patient was asked to continue once daily home treatment consisting of the side-lying traction procedure for 40 minutes, and supine positional traction 20 minutes immediately before bedtime. She was also instructed to continue wearing the anterior headweight at home 3 days a week for 15 minutes per day. After 10 months under this home care regimen, the patient presented for a second follow-up evaluation. At this time, her Functional Rating Index reduced to an 8% disability, while her sagittal cervical and lumbar curves marginally improved to 34° and 42°, respectively. Her left thoracic scoliosis was further reduced to 18°, and her right lumbar scoliosis was maintained at 15°. Therefore, after a total of 4 months of active treatment and 10 months of weekly home care rehabilitation, her spinal curvatures were reduced a total of 19° in the thoracic curvature and 21° in the lumbar curvature. Her pre- and post- radiographs are shown in Figure . Detailed reviews by Harrison et al [–] and Rhee et al [] suggest that preserving a normal sagittal spinal contour may be important for long-term health. De Jonge et al [] described how correction of lateral scoliotic curvatures caused a spontaneous restoration of the sagittal spinal curves, suggesting that loss of sagittal spinal curves may somehow be related to scoliotic curvatures. Scoliosis places otherwise symmetrical muscle groups under longstanding, isometric, asymmetrical loads [–], which may compromise circulation within the muscle, ultimately leading to myofascial trigger points and chronic inflammation []. Weinstein et al [] reported that scoliosis patients may retain high levels of function in later life, but do report higher instances of chronic back pain. In addition to higher instances of chronic back pain, significant psychological issues may arise from concern over cosmesis and conventional treatment. Freidel et al [] measured the self-perceived quality of life in women with scoliosis using the SF-36 questionnaire. They concluded that the psychosocial aspects of scoliosis and scoliosis treatment should be addressed in the treatment of this group of patients. Similarly, Sapountzi-Krepia et al [] described the psychological distress that adolescents encounter while going through bracing treatment for scoliosis. A case-control study by Danielsson et al [] identified a potential negative impact on the ability to function sexually due to conventional treatment restraint or self-consciousness of physical appearance. Aside from back pain and psychological disturbance, several studies also suggest that scoliosis affects more than the musculoskeletal system. Curvatures of the thoracic spine are associated with restrictive lung disease due to ribcage deformity and decreased chest wall compliance []. Chest wall compliance is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the Cobb angle down to 10°, and vital capacity is reduced by decreased chest wall compliance directly [, ]. Exercise endurance is also inversely diminished with increasing Cobb angle, even in patients with normal resting vital capacity []. Thoracic scoliosis may also cause shortness of breath and recurrent respiratory infections [, ]. Indeed, scoliosis affects more than the musculoskeletal system. Concerning coronal Cobb angle measurement for scoliosis, manual radiographic measurement has consistently shown good to excellent inter- and intra-observer reliability [–]. Previous studies demonstrate a manual Cobb angle measurement error on full-spine radiographs of 2.5 – 4.5° [–]. However, to achieve this low error, it is imperative that the same end vertebrae, same protractor, and same endplates are consistently chosen. Importantly, these measurement errors were extracted from data collected on full-spine radiographs. Patient positioning can significantly negatively impact measurements on full-spine radiographs []. The Cobb angle measurements in our study were taken from sectional radiographs, which reduce the positional distortion caused by inconsistent patient positioning. It is unknown to what extent the use of sectional radiography has on Cobb angle measurement error, if any. The treatments outlined here required home care exercises, as described earlier. However, these exercises, which take up a combined 60 minutes per day, can be done in private, away from scrutiny by peers, neighbors, or relatives. This is in contrast to bracing treatment, where the brace must be worn at least 18 hours per day to achieve a good clinical result []. We placed the headweight, shoulderweight, and hipweights in areas designed to reduce our patient's specific spinal distortion patterns on radiograph. The patient was evaluated radiographically while wearing the headweight and shoulderweights to determine optimal position and weight. Our repeated clinical observation has demonstrated that patients may visually appear to improve with a shoulderweight in a certain position. However, they can look dramatically different on radiograph (migration away from the vertical axis) than they appear in visual posture analysis. This is consistent with recent failed attempts to objectify visual posture analysis as a valid clinical tool []. It is prudent to develop alternative methods of evaluation to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure to patients. Because of the anterior wedging from T7–T10 in case #2, it is not surprising that over time a thoracic hyperkyphosis and swayback developed in this patient. As a result, marked anterior weight bearing of the head was required to maintain a horizontal eye level, thus satisfying the postural reflexes [–] Additionally, the marked forward head posture elicits the pelvo-ocular reflex, causing a forward shift of the pelvic girdle under the forward head position []. Therefore, the postural distortions seen in this case may represent compensatory changes over time as a result of thoracic buckling, a posture known to commonly cause increased mechanical stress at the spinal transition areas [, ]. Correcting these compensatory postural changes proved to be a challenge, given that the impetus for them (the anteriorly wedged thoracic vertebra) could not be immediately, if ever, changed. However, within the confines of the Hueter-Volkmann law, we postulate that sustained correction of the asymmetrical mechanical spinal loading may theoretically help these vertebrae to remodel to some degree. Although the forward head posture is a compensatory reaction to the hyperkyphosis, the cervical spine soft tissue has likely remodeled to the forward head posture, given the likely duration of its existence []. Therefore, we felt that direct correction of the forward head posture must also be achieved to improve overall sagittal alignment, given the neurological control and importance of head position on upright spinal position []. This hypothesis remains to be definitively evaluated. The significance of cases #2 and #3 lies in the location of the scoliotic curvatures. In the vast majority of cases, double major curvatures usually maintain a right thoracic/left lumbar pattern. In this case, the pattern was reversed, showing a left thoracic/right lumbar scoliosis. Several authors have previously discussed the unique presence of a left thoracic – right lumbar curvature pattern. McCarver et al [] showed that only 1% of 550 patients with idiopathic scoliosis had double major curvatures consisting of a left thoracic – right lumbar configuration. Winter and Lonstein [] maintained that any left thoracic curvature should be further evaluated for neurological abnormalities, such as neurofibromatosis, spina bifida, or syringomyelia. Finally, Schwend et al [] also concluded that additional testing was necessary in left thoracic curvatures, given an observed higher incidence of neurological clinical signs. Case #3 seems to correlate these findings given the left thoracic scoliosis secondary to Scheuermann's Disease. It is important to note, however, that treating the Scheuermann's Disease itself was not our aim. Rather, our goal was to reduce the thoracic scoliosis secondary to it. We are not attempting to show that this treatment may affect the Scheuermann's Disease. In this case, however, additional testing was conducted at the initial time of discovery of the scoliosis. Further, my initial neurological examination also failed to produce any remarkable neurological findings. Recently, several authors have discussed the relationship between the sagittal spinal contour and scoliosis [, , , ]. Harrison et al [–] have discussed the pathophysiologic changes associated with the loss of the sagittal curves. Based on this evidence, we decided that it was important to the long-term outcome to address these spinal parameters. Cases #1 and #2 present what appears to be inconsistent findings. Case #1 initially had a 23° cervical lordosis, below asymptomatic 31–40° range identified by McAviney et al [], and the normal 34° identified by Harrison et al []. However, case #2 displayed a 32° initial cervical lordosis despite having a thoracic hyperkyphosis. In case #1, the patient had 31 mm of forward head posture. Since forward head posture reduces the magnitude of the cervical lordosis [, ], a 23° cervical lordosis may not be normal for this patient. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that sagittal balance may more closely correlate to symptoms than sagittal alignment [] Cervical lordosis by itself may not provide an accurate assessment of normal for each patient. Therefore, we suggest that both the cervical lordosis and forward head posture be weighed before a patient's cervical spine may be considered ""normal."" In contrast, case #2 had a both a normal cervical lordosis and forward head posture (32° and 22 mm, respectively). Therefore, we classified this patient's cervical spine as normal, despite the thoracic hyperkyphosis. We feel that the 55° lumbar hyperlordosis is a direct compensation for the swayback posture created by the thoracolumbar vertebral remodeling. This is consistent with the post treatment reductions in the swayback posture and lumbar lordosis. In the Pettibon system, most of the manipulative treatment is not administered on a vertebral segmental basis. Rather, it is delivered to a specific region of segments so that the entire region may be mobilized. The goal of manipulative therapy in the Pettibon system is to mobilize several vertebral joints so that the rehab procedures can target the joints while they temporarily have an increased range of motion []. The purpose of the Pettibon Weighting System™ is to artificially alter the centers of mass of the head, trunk, and pelvis, causing reactive corrections by the postural reflexes [–]. The goal of postural reflexes is to maintain efficient body stance and locomotion using the least energy expenditure possible [, , ]. In the present cases, each patient was instructed to continue with their home exercise routine on a once weekly basis in attempts to maintain the change in spinal configuration. The procedures that comprise the Pettibon system have been previously examined in specific clinical cases [, ]. Although these techniques have been investigated for preliminary treatment of idiopathic scoliosis [], they have not, until this point, been used in cases of scoliosis due to structural deformity or left thoracic primary curvatures. Given the perceived results of the cases outlined here, it is worthy of future investigations in such cases. However, case reports and case series designs do not provide substantive evidence of therapeutic effectiveness. This remains the realm of properly conducted prospective clinical trials. Conservative treatment for scoliosis needs to be examined much more closely in the biomedical literature, as side effects [–] and compliance issues [] make conventional treatments such as bracing less attractive to patients and parents of minor patients. In this case series, we reported the clinical results for 3 distinct types of scoliosis patients. While no firm conclusions relative to cause and effect can be made from these results, the moderation of the spinal curves may have merit. Although reductions in self-rated disability and pain scores were reported, they may not be attributable to the improvement in spinal alignment. Further investigation is required to determine the potential benefits of sagittal spine alignment in the correction of scoliosis and other health benefits.

The primary cause of scoliosis remains unknown. The lack of such understanding has hampered development of effective preventive methods for management of this disease. A long-held assumption in pathogenesis of AIS is that the upright spine in human plays an important role in induction of scoliosis. Here, the variations in the sagittal curve of the scoliotic and non-scoliotic pediatric spines were used to study whether specific sagittal curves, under physiological loadings, are prone to 3D deformation leading to scoliosis. To this end, finite element models of the S shaped elastic rods, which their curves were derived from the radiographs of 129 sagittal spinal curves of adolescents with and without scoliosis, were generated. Using the mechanics of deformation in elastic rods, this study showed that the 3D deformation patterns of the two-dimensional S shaped slender elastic rods mimics the 3D patterns of the spinal deformity in AIS patients with the same S shaped sagittal spinal curve. On the other hand, the rods representing the non-scoliotic sagittal spinal curves, under the same mechanical loading, did not twist thus did not lead to a 3D deformation. This study provided strong evidence that the shape of the sagittal profile in individuals can be a leading cause of the 3D spinal deformity as is observed in the AIS population. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) manifests as a three-dimensional (3D) deformity of the spinal column that occurs around puberty. Several factors such as genetics, biomechanics, morphology of the vertebral bones, intervertebral disc, and muscle physiology, hormones, environmental factors, and neural system deficiencies are considered as the underlying cause of the spinal deformity in AIS. While each of these factors explained part of the pathogenesis of this disease, none have proved to be its main or primary cause. As experimental studies suggest, the role of the mechanical loading of the upright spine in pathogenesis of the disease cannot be ignored. The unique shape of the human spine has been hypothesized to relate to the induction of scoliosis. The dorsal loading of the upright spine in human was proposed to result in spinal instability and has been suggested as the biomechanical causation of scoliosis. A shift in the position of the center of mass around puberty results in asymmetric loading of the thorax. This causes rotation of the spinal segments away from the sagittal plane which in turn results in an increased differentiated loading of the anterior and posterior aspects of the vertebrae, causing asymmetric growth and bone deformation under the Hueter-Volkmann law. While the mechanism of deformity in AIS is widely accepted, the underlying mechanisms that trigger instability in the spine and excessive rotation, leading to scoliosis in 2–4% of the pediatric population, are not well explained. The mechanics of deformation in elastic rods are explored experimentally and analytically. These concepts have been successfully explained the physics of various topological transformation in DNA and proteins (., from a loop to a twisted loop). In a previous topological classification of the spinal curves in AIS patients, two distinct axial deformation patterns of the scoliotic spines were observed: if a non-scoliotic spine projects into a straight line from the top view (axial view), the scoliotic spine has either a or a projection. The projection can be conceived as a loop (by connecting the two ends) whereas the projection presents a twisted loop or a lemniscate shape. Figure  demonstrates these two different projection patterns. As these two axial projections (Fig. ) were associated with different sagittal curves in the scoliotic classification, the question was raised that whether the variation in the sagittal curves of the pediatric spine dictates the patterns of spinal deformation and can be the leading cause of the 3D spinal deformity . scoliosis. In this study, finite element analysis (FEA) of two-dimensional (2D) elastic rods was conducted to determine the deformation patterns of the rods as a function of variations in the 2D curve geometry, while the mechanical loading and material properties were the same across the models. The geometry of the 2D rods were determined from the two-view spinal X-rays of 126 right thoracic AIS patients and three age- and sex-matched non-scoliotic adolescents. It was hypothesized that the patterns of 3D deformation of 2D elastic rods (spine sagittal profiles) relate to the 3D patterns of the spinal deformity in the AIS patients with the same sagittal curves. The study’s workflow is shown in Fig. . The study steps include: 1- classification of 126 scoliotic 3D spinal curves, 2- developing the finite element models of the curved elastic rods using the sagittal spinal curve of the scoliotic cluster centers and the average of three non-scoliotic spines. 3- Comparing the patterns of deformation between the actual spinal deformity in the patient subtypes and the simulated curved rods deformations. Figure  shows the five subtypes of the 126 right thoracic AIS patients resulted from the clustering of the 3D spinal curves: Type 1: n = 30, Type 2: n = 29, Type 3: n = 18, Type 4: n = 26, and Type 5: n = 23. The five subtypes’ sagittal, frontal, and axial views of the spinal curves are shown in Fig. , respectively. The average of the non-scoliotic spinal curves is also superimposed on Fig. . The axial and frontal projections of the non-scoliotic spine were close to a straight line (Fig. ). The five scoliotic subtypes were divided into two subgroups based on the patterns of axial projections: Group I included Types 2 and 4 that have a loop shaped axial projection (Fig. ). In these patients the kyphotic (concave) segment of the curve was shorter than the lordotic (convex) section (6 ± 2 vertebrae versus 11 ± 2) and the inflection point of the curve moves to the mid thoracic section (see Methods section). Group II included Types 1, 3, and 5 that have a lemniscate axial projection (Fig. ). In these patients the kyphotic part of the curve was longer than the lordotic section (12 ± 2 versus 5 ± 2 vertebrae) and the inflection point of the sagittal curve moves to the lower thoracic/ upper lumbar area. In the non-scoliotic cohort the kyphotic section is longer than the lordotic section (12 ± 2 versus 4 ± 1 vertebrae), but the inflection point is slightly lower compared to the position of the inflection point in Group II. Figure  shows the results of the FEA of the five sagittal subtypes and the non-scoliotic spines. The final shape of the deformed rod (blue dotted line) was superimposed on the original shape of the rods (black dotted line), in the frontal, sagittal, axial, and 3D views (Fig. ). All rods developed two curves in the frontal planes under the aforementioned loading (Fig. ). The axial shape of the deformed rods with the geometry of the Types 2 and 4 scoliotic subtypes (Group I) was loop shaped. The axial shape of the deformed rods with the geometry of the Types 1, 3, and 5 scoliotic subtypes (Group II) were lemniscate. The axial shape of the “non-scoliotic” deformed elastic rod was loop shaped but deformed in the opposite direction of the axial projection of the Group I curves. The axial deformations (differences between the final and initial positions of each point on the rod) of the rods representing the sagittal subtypes and non-scoliotic spines are superimposed in Fig.  to allow a better comparison between the deformation patterns of the Group I AIS (Types 2 and 4), Group II AIS (Types 1, 3, and 5), and the average of the three non-scoliotic adolescents. The deformations are normalized to the maximum deformation in the Z direction. Group I rods showed a looped shaped axial deformation (also Supplementary Materials Fig. ) and Group II rods showed a lemniscate axial deformation (also Supplementary Materials Fig. ). The axial deformation of the non-scoliotic rod was distinctively different from Group I and Group II (also Supplementary Materials Fig. ). The ratio of the average displacement in the X direction to the Y direction was: Type1 = 0.004, Type2 = 0.05, Type3 = 0.004, Type4 = 0.06, Type5 = 0.006, and non-scoliotic = −0.01. The average deformation shape of the rods in non-scoliotic, Group I, and Group II are shown in Fig. . In the non-scoliotic curve, the rod deformation remained in one plane and no twist in the rod was observed (Fig. ). The curved rods in Group I (Types 2 and 4) showed one twist in the (Fig. ). Rods in Group II (Types 1, 3, 5 models) showed two twists (Fig. ). The global torsion of the non-scoliotic deformed curved (Fig. ), average Group I deformed curve (Fig. ), and average Group II deformed curve (Fig. ) were −3.4e-4(m), 0.0015(m), and 0.0112(m), respectively. The 3D deformation of the additional rods, resulted from interpolating the sagittal curves in Group I (Types 2 and 4), sagittal curves in Group II (Types 1, 3, and 5), and the three non-scoliotic curves are presented in the Supplementary Materials. Pattern correlation between the scoliotic subtypes and non-scoliotic deformation of the rods The results of the pattern correlation of the 3D deformation (X, Y, Z coordinates) of the rods between Types 1–5 and non-scoliotic 3D deformations are shown in Table . The 3D deformations in Group I were strongly correlated; Types 2 and 4, r = 0.89, 95%CI [0.71–0.88], p = 0.00. The 3D deformations in Group II were strongly correlated; Types 1 and 3 and Types 1 and 5, r = 0.99, 95%CI [0.99–0.99], p = 0.00, and Types 3 and 5 r = 0.98, 95%CI [0.96–0.98], p = 0.00. The correlation between the 3D deformation in Groups I and II was non-significant (Types 1 and 4, Types 3 and 4, and Types 4 and 5) or moderately correlated (Types 1 and 2, Types 2 and 3, and Types 2 and 5) (Table ). 3D deformation of the AIS clusters were significantly correlated to the 3D deformation of the non-scoliotic spines, however the correlation was not as strong as the within AIS groups correlations (Table ). The pathogenesis of the spinal deformity development in AIS is not well understood. Here, concepts in mechanics of elastic rods were used to show that the variations in the sagittal curve relate to the 3D deformation patterns of the spine in AIS. Finite element models of the 2D curved elastic rods, representing different sagittal types in 126 AIS patients and three non-scoliotic adolescents, showed that deformation pattern of the curved elastic rods changes as a function of the rod’s curvature and associates with the patterns of 3D spinal deformity in AIS patients with the same sagittal curves. This finding provided evidence that the sagittal curve of the spine is a leading cause of spinal deformity in AIS. Several biomechanical factors have been related to the mechanism of the spinal deformity development in AIS. Slender vertebrae and discs in AIS patients, compared to the non-scoliotic age-matched adolescents, is believed to increase the spinal flexibility and lead to spinal deformity in AIS. The sagittal profile in AIS patients was reported to be more posteriorly inclined which increases the posteriorly directed shear force in AIS compared to the age-matched non-scoliotic adolescents contributing to the spinal instbility. Morphological parameters of the vertebrae and discs were related to the progression rate of scoliosis. It has been also suggested that the mechanical loading of the upright spine can be the primary cause of scoliosis. The axial loading of the spine is higher in quadrupeds than bipedal’s spines. In bipedals a less axially supported spine, which probably contributes to easier upright locomotion, may be impacted by other spinal loadings e.g. shear and make the spine less stable. The current analysis showed, in an elastic rod, without considering the differences in the spinal components (discs, vertebrae) and without generalizing the vertebral alignment, and under the same external loadings, some sagittal subtypes do not twist and deform in only one plane (Fig. ) whereas other sagittal curve types are prone to scoliotic-like 3D deformation with one or two twists in the spine (Fig. ). The 2D shape of the rod changed the acting forces and moments on the rod resulting in variation in the deformation patterns, underlining the role of the spinal sagittal curve in development of spinal deformity. The classification of the 3D centerlines in this study resulted in identifying a clear axial classification of right thoracic AIS: loop and Lemniscate shapes (previously presented as and shaped, respectively) (Fig. ). These shapes are also shown in other biological and mechanical systems. We also showed these two axial curve patterns, within the right thoracic cohort, can guide the fusion level as they determine the location of the changes in the axial rotation of the vertebrae thus the number of true 3D spinal curves. These findings may allude to the fact that the patterns of deformation of the spine in the transverse view, as determined in this study, can explain important differences between the scoliotic curves and can be used as an axial classification of the scoliotic curve. 3D elastic deformation has been observed in many natural and physiological systems such as proteins and DNAs. A looped DNA can twist and transform to a lemniscate shape as a function of bending rigidity of the strands when the system’s energy attains a critical level. The fundamentals of these deformations are explained analytically using Kirchhoff’s theory of elastic rods. In analytical examination of the spinal deformity in AIS, mechanical phenomenon such as 2D buckling of the rods have been used to explain the mechanics of spinal deformation previously. However, considering the 3D deformation of the spine in AIS, the mechanics of 2D buckling fails to explain essential aspects of the curve progression. By taking into account the sagittal curve of the spine, bending and compression stresses apply on the spine as a result of the gravitation load. Here, a torsional moment also was included to simulate the previously reported shift in the center of mass at the onset of curve development in AIS patients. This torsion was essential to break the symmetry of the system and initiate the 3D deformation. The result of the current simulation shifts the current beliefs about the mechanism of the spinal deformation in AIS from 2D buckling to 3D elastic deformation under bending and twisting. Understanding the mechanism of spinal deformity development in AIS is the first step in efficient management of the disease that aims to prevent the deformity development or reverse the deformation process. Modeling the spine as elastic rods assists with understanding the intra-patient differences, which can be useful in clinical management of the scoliosis. As it is shown before, different deformation patterns in elastic rods can be observed by changing the mechanical loading, material stiffness, boundary conditions, or geometry of the rod. It has been shown that a gradual increase in the twist and torsional energy can change the coiling pattern resulting in a twist in the rod. This phenomenon can explain the differences between the curve patterns in Group I and Group II. Group I patients present with one twist in the curve, smaller torsion, and larger lateral deviation as opposed to the Group II patients with two twists, smaller lateral deviation (coiling radius), and high torsion (Fig. ). As it was shown previously, due to the differences between Group I (Type 2 and 4) and Group II (Types 1, 3, and 5), the patients’ response to the spinal fusion surgery may vary, thus different surgical fusion lengths should be selected for these two groups: Longer fusion in Group I patients is required to stabilize the longer curve as opposed to the patients in Group II where spontaneous correction of the second curve can be expected as a response to the primary curve derotation and correction. By showing the relationship between the sagittal curve types and deformation patterns in elastic rods, the importance of the spinal sagittal curve correction in both conservative and surgical treatments of AIS were emphasized which was in line with the previous observations. Reversing the 3D spinal deformation by derotation and frontal translation of the spine in AIS does not adequately address the condition as here we showed that variation in the sagittal profile could initiate the deformity and is the underlying cause of the deformity. As the variation in sagittal profiles is an important factor in 3D deformation of the spine (Fig. ), it stands to reason that adjustments in the sagittal plane as part of the curve correction process, both conservatively and surgically, are critical. Quantitative differences between the simulated deformations of the curved elastic rods and the deformation of the spine in patient groups with the same sagittal curve were expected. Due to the simplifications of the model (., the isotropic homogeneous material properties, ignoring the differential stiffness between the upper and lower sections of the rod (thoracic and lumbar), assuming a zero angle at the L5 (sacral slope)) quantitative differences in the simulated rods and actual 3D spinal deformation were observed; yet of deformations were similar. Moreover, T1 was fixed in the axial plane while in reality both frontal and sagittal imbalances are shown as part of the curve progression mechanism and the postural compensation of the trunk . This study purposefully used a reduced order model of the spine to test the theoretical role of the spinal sagittal shape in 3D scoliotic deformation without including any other assumption on intra-patient variations. The mechanics of the 3D deformation of elastic rods showed that the 3D deformation patterns of the spine can be a characteristic of the curvature of the sagittal spine. However, it is important to notice that this finding does not refute the possibility of forming such sagittal profiles or variation in the mechanical loading (deformation) in individuals as a result of variations in the discs and ligaments material properties or width and height of the vertebral body. Genetics can tie into the development of various sagittal alignment as it may impact the discs, ligaments, and muscles biomechanics, growth rate, or simply the postural differences between individuals. Both rapid growth of the spine and rapid rise of estrogen level during puberty, and the link between the estrogen and increased ligament laxity can be linked to the onset of the spinal deformation at that age particularly in the female patients. The current analysis only investigated the role of the sagittal profile in development of 3D spinal deformities. The factors leading to variations in the loading characteristics of the sagittal profile, related to the geometry, growth rate, and mechanical properties of the spine, remain to be explored. Finally, in the current study only right thoracic curves, the most common type of AIS, were included. Future studies that include other curve types are warranted. In conclusion, the finding of this study reduced the question of why scoliosis happens to why variation in the sagittal spinal profile occurs in the pediatric population. With large dataset on the pediatric population before the onset of the spinal deformity development, the current analysis can be used as a risk assessment tool to predict the risk of spinal deformity development in the pediatric population. This can open a new line of research that aims to prevent the spinal deformity development by determining the spinal loading patterns (the sagittal alignment and flexibility of the immature spine) at a higher risk of 3D deformation in pediatric population. Conservative methods to protect the spine during this phase can be explored. This new approach can introduce a changing paradigm in the clinical care of idiopathic scoliosis by shifting the clinical care from the deformity correction to prevention in this patient population. Classification and identifying unique sagittal profiles in AIS patients The institutional review board (IRB) at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia approved all the study procedures as detailed in the method section. The research process was performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations underlined in the approval. As the study was performed retrospectively, a waiver of consent/parental agreement was granted by the IRB. A total of 126 right thoracic AIS patients were included retrospectively. The inclusion criteria were adolescent between 12–16 years old, a main thoracic curve (most common AIS curve type) exceeding 20° Cobb angle with an apex above T11-T12 intervertebral disc, no previous spinal surgery, no neuromuscular disorders, and no musculoskeletal conditions other than scoliosis. Three non-scoliotic adolescents were included as the control cohort. The non-scoliotic subjects were verified by both clinical examination and two-view radiographs of the spine and did not develop scoliosis at the follow-ups after growth spurt. 3D reconstructions of the orthogonal spinal radiographs were generated for all the subjects using the method described in Humbert .. A previously validated algorithm was used to extract the centroid of the vertebral bodies. A K-mean classification, with a prior knowledge of the number of clusters, was used to classify the isotropically normalized 3D spline (X, Y, Z coordinates) resulted from connecting the vertebral bodies centroids. The sagittal profiles of the non-scoliotic spines were also isotropically normalized to the unit height. The average sagittal profiles of each AIS cluster was used to create the geometry of the 2D curved ( elastic rods in the finite element models. The sagittal profiles of the clusters were grouped based on their axial projection patterns; Group I: loop shaped projection and Group II: twisted loop or lemniscate projection (Fig. ). Additional sagittal profiles were generated by interpolating between the sagittal profiles of the clusters in Group I and between the sagittal profiles of the clusters in Group II. This step was added to include additional curves and test the sensitivity of the 3D deformation patterns of the rods to variations in the sagittal curves. The global torsion of the average deformed curves in the non-scoliotic groups, Group I, and Group II were calculated by the method described in Based on the sagittal view, the number of vertebrae was counted in the two sections of the spine with different curvatures i.e. spinal convexity and concavity in the sagittal plane. The point at which the sign of the curvature changed or the center of the section over which the sign of the curvature changed was considered as the inflection point. 2D elastic rods with unit length, circular cross section with a radius of 1e-3, Young modulus of 1000 PA, and a Poisson ratio of 0.3, with isotropic material properties were generated. A small torsion around the Z-axis, +1e-4 Pa, was applied to simulate the asymmetric trunk weight distribution. The X, Y, Z displacement of the rod at L5 level were fixed. The X and Y displacements at T1 were fixed but the vertical (Z direction) displacement was allowed. The gravity was applied at T1-L5 vertebral centers according to the previously validated experimental data for FEA of the spine (Table ). The FEA was performed for the rods with the sagittal geometry of the scoliotic subtypes and the interpolated sagittal curves, and for the average of the non-scoliotic curves and the individual non-scoliotic spines. The 3D deformation was normalized to the maximum deformation in the Z direction. The 3D shapes of the deformed 2D rods were compared between the models in Group I and Group II as well as between the non-scoliotic model and the two AIS groups. 3D pattern correlation related the X, Y, Z coordinates of the deformed rods between the models by calculating the covariance matrix of the 3D deformation patterns to compare the inter- and intra-group correlations between the 3D deformations.
