Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system. It can cause various neurological symptoms, including problems with reading. Some common symptoms of MS include difficulty with visual perception, muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling sensations.

There is no cure for MS, but it can be managed with medications and therapy. Treatment options may include medication to reduce inflammation in the central nervous system, physical therapy to improve muscle strength and coordination, and cognitive therapy to address problems with learning and memory.

In terms of specific questions regarding reading problems, it depends on the severity and type of issue. Some common ones include double vision, blurred vision, difficulties with comprehension and retention of information, and problems with fine motor skills in the hands.

It is important for individuals experiencing reading problems as a result of MS to speak with their healthcare provider for guidance on treatment and management options.",95,Reading problems in MS,-0.008793794550001621,0

The symptoms can include blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), optic neuritis, involuntary rapid eye movement and occasionally, a total loss of sight. Problems with vision can result from damage to the optic nerve or from a lack of coordination in the eye muscles. The optic nerve connects the eye to the brain. Inflammation or demyelination in the optic nerve causes optic neuritis, which is experienced as a temporary loss or disturbance in vision and possibly pain behind the affected eye. Typically, vision returns partially or fully within a few weeks. While it is quite rare for a person with MS to become totally blind, it is not at all uncommon for an individual to have recurrent episodes of optic neuritis over the course of the disease, usually in one eye at a time. Damage to the optic nerve can result in a blurring of vision, which may or may not totally resolve over time. Colour vision requires a great many nerve fibres from the eye for accurate transmission and is particularly susceptible to changes from demyelination. Optic neuritis can cause a large, noticeable “blind spot” in the centre of the visual field, and the person experiences a visual image with a dark, blank area in the middle. This is called a central scotoma and is not correctable with either eyeglasses or medication, although steroids may be helpful in the early, acute phase. Diplopia (double vision), the experience of seeing two of everything, is caused by weakening or incoordination of eye muscles. This symptom is typically treated with a short course of steroids. Patching one eye while trying to drive or read will stop the double image; however, permanent patching of the eye will slow the brain’s remarkable ability to accommodate to the weakness and produce a single image in spite of the weakened muscles. Some physicians are prescribing eyeglasses with special prisms that help to minimise double vision. Upon examination, the physician may detect a rhythmic jerkiness or bounce in one or both eyes. This relatively common visual finding in MS is nystagmus. Nystagmus does not always cause symptoms of which the person is aware.

3862be26-794e-4fe9-b6e9-9934a5f2122e,"— — is an immune system disease that affects the central nervous system. With MS, inflammation damages myelin, the protective covering around nerve cells. The resulting lesions, or scar tissue, interfere with the transmission of nerve signals. Symptoms of MS can include vision problems, numbness of the limbs, and balance issues. Dizziness and vertigo are common symptoms of MS though most people don’t have them as their first symptoms. Read on to learn more about these symptoms and what to do about them. Many people with MS experience episodes of dizziness, which can make you feel lightheaded or off-balance. Some also have episodes of vertigo. Vertigo is the false sensation of whirling or spinning of yourself or the world around you. According to one , about 20 percent of people with MS experience vertigo. Dizziness and vertigo contribute to balance problems, which are common in people with MS. Ongoing dizziness and vertigo can interfere with daily tasks, increase the risk of falls, and can even become disabling. Vertigo is an intense sensation of spinning, even if you’re not moving. It’s similar to what you feel on a twirling amusement park ride. The first time you experience vertigo can be very unsettling, even frightening. Vertigo may be accompanied by and vomiting. It can continue for hours, or even days. Sometimes, dizziness and vertigo are accompanied by vision problems, tinnitus or hearing loss, or trouble standing or walking. The lesions that result from MS make it difficult for nerves within the central nervous system to send messages to the rest of the body. This causes MS symptoms, which vary according to the location of the lesions. A lesion or lesions in the brain stem or cerebellum, the area of the brain that controls balance, may cause vertigo. Vertigo can also be a symptom of a problem with the inner ear. Other possible causes of dizziness or vertigo include certain medications, blood vessel disease, migraine, or stroke. Your doctor can help you rule out other possible causes of vertigo. When vertigo occurs, the following steps can help you stay safe and feel more comfortable: Avoid stairs and don’t attempt to drive until you’re sure the vertigo has passed. If vertigo strikes during the night, sit up straight, turn on soft lighting, and remain still until you feel better. Vertigo may return when you turn the light off and lie down. A comfortable recliner may help. Over-the-counter (OTC) anti-motion sickness medications may be all you need. These are available as oral tablets or as skin patches. If dizziness or vertigo becomes chronic (long-lasting), your doctor may prescribe more powerful anti-motion sickness or anti-nausea medications. In cases of severe vertigo, your doctor may suggest a short course of corticosteroids. Also, physical therapy may be helpful in improving balance and coordination. The balance issues caused by dizziness and vertigo increase the risk of injury due to falls. This is especially true for people whose MS symptoms already include trouble walking, weakness, and fatigue. A few safety measures around the home can help reduce this risk: Clear your home of tripping hazards, especially throw rugs. Most importantly, be sure to sit down when you feel dizzy or feel the spins coming on. Tell your doctor if you have MS and experience frequent bouts of dizziness or vertigo. They can examine you and rule out other problems to determine if MS is the cause of the issue. Whatever the cause ends up being, your doctor can recommend a course of treatment to help you feel better. — — Six Talking Points to Bring Up at Your Next Appointment for MS Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

d8b232a9-4b56-4cb0-998a-f938b484eeef,"— Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the brain and spinal cord where your immune system attacks the myelin coating that surrounds and protects your nerves. Nerve damage causes symptoms such as numbness, weakness, vision problems, and difficulty walking. A small percentage of people with MS also have hearing problems. If it becomes harder for you to hear people talking in a noisy room or you hear distorted sounds or ringing in your ears, it’s time to check in with your neurologist or a hearing specialist. Hearing loss is the loss of of hearing. Hearing loss isn’t common for people with MS, but it can happen. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, about of people with MS have hearing loss. Your inner ear converts sound vibrations on the eardrum into electrical signals, which are carried to the brain via the auditory nerve. Your brain then decodes these signals into the sounds you recognize. Hearing loss could be a sign of MS. Lesions can form on the auditory nerve. This disturbs the nerve pathways that help your brain transmit and understand sound. Lesions may also form on the brain stem, which is the part of the brain involved in hearing and balance. Hearing loss can be an early sign of MS. It can also be a sign that you’re having a relapse or flare of symptoms if you have had transient hearing loss in the past. Most hearing loss is temporary and improves when a relapse has subsided. It’s very rare for MS to cause deafness. SNHL makes soft sounds hard to hear and loud sounds unclear. It’s the most common type of permanent hearing loss. Damage to the nerve pathways between your inner ear and your brain can cause SNHL. This type of hearing loss is much more common in people with MS than other forms of hearing loss. Sudden hearing loss is a type of SNHL where you lose 30 decibels or more of hearing over a period of a few hours to 3 days. This makes normal conversations sound like whispers. suggests that 92 percent of people with MS and sudden SNHL are in the early stages of MS. Rapid hearing loss can also be a sign of an MS relapse. Usually, hearing loss in MS affects one ear only. Less often, people lose hearing in both ears. It’s also possible to lose hearing in one ear first and then in the other. If this occurs, your healthcare provider may evaluate you for other diseases that could look like MS. Tinnitus is a common hearing problem. It sounds like a ringing, buzzing, whistling, or hissing in your ears. Usually aging or exposure to loud noises causes tinnitus. In MS, nerve damage disrupts the electrical signals that travel from your ears to your brain. That sets off a ringing sound in your ears. Tinnitus isn’t dangerous but can be very distracting and annoying. There currently is no cure. A few other hearing problems linked to MS include: increased sensitivity to sound, called hyperacusis difficulty understanding spoken language (receptive aphasia), which is not actually a hearing problem The only treatment for hearing loss is avoiding triggers. For example, heat can sometimes trigger a flair up of old symptoms such as hearing problems in people with MS. You may find you have more trouble hearing in hot weather or after exercising. Symptoms should improve once you’ve cooled down. If heat affects your hearing, try to stay indoors as much as possible when it’s hot outside. A white noise machine can drown out ringing to make tinnitus more bearable. See a doctor if you’ve lost hearing or you hear ringing or buzzing sounds in your ears. Your doctor can evaluate you for causes of hearing loss, such as: Also, see the neurologist who treats your MS. An MRI scan can show whether MS has damaged your auditory nerve or brain stem. Your doctor can prescribe steroid drugs when you have an MS relapse to improve hearing loss if it is in the early stages. Your neurologist or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor may refer you to an audiologist. This specialist diagnoses and treats hearing disorders and can test you for hearing loss. You can also find an audiologist through the or the . Hearing aids can help with temporary hearing loss. They’re also a treatment for tinnitus. You can buy a hearing aid on your own, but it’s best to see an audiologist to get it properly fitted. An audiologist might also recommend an induction loop to filter out background sounds in your home to help you hear more clearly. Medications like tricyclic antidepressants are sometimes prescribed to help with tinnitus symptoms. Though MS can cause hearing loss, it’s rarely severe or permanent. Hearing loss may be worse during MS flares and should improve once the flare is over. Your doctor can prescribe medications to help you recover faster and may refer you to an ENT specialist or audiologist for further testing. — Cog Fog: How to Deal with This Frequent MS Symptom © 2005-2021 Healthline Media a Red Ventures Company.

f62e58e6-ef98-4715-beaf-b9933b3ac20a,"Visual problems are common among those with MS and are often a first sign of the disease. Optic neuritis is often the first symptom of MS. This occurs when inflammation and demyelination are present along the optic nerve (the nerve that connects the brain to the eye). A diagnosis of optic neuritis may suggest MS, but does not necessarily indicate that a person has or will develop MS. Symptoms of optic neuritis include the acute onset of any of the following: Rarely are both eyes affected simultaneously with optic neuritis in MS. Pain with eye movement usually accompanies or precedes visual loss, and visual loss tends to worsen over the course of a few days before improving. Almost 55 percent of people with MS will have an episode of optic neuritis (according to WebMD). Many functions are involved in seeing an object. Two major components needed for effective vision are (1) the ability to correctly image what is seen and (2) the proper coordination of the muscles that surround the eye and control its movements. Either or both of these functions can be affected by MS. The most common problems are decreased or blurred vision (caused by ), double vision (), and shaking, involuntary movements of the eyes (). While optic neuritis results from inflammation and demyelination along the optic nerve, double vision and involuntary eye movements are the result of lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. Inflammation along the optic nerve or in other areas of the brain and spinal cord is thought to be the cause of MS relapses, and if severe enough, is often treated with steroids (described later). However, as with other symptoms, visual problems in MS can also be brought on by fatigue, an increase in temperature, stress, and infection. Managing these symptoms may help to improve any associated visual problems. Full loss of vision, decreased vision, or blurred vision frequently affects only one eye of a person with MS who is experiencing optic neuritis. Colors may appear washed out, and night vision may be particularly difficult. Sensitivity to contrasts in light or the presence of holes ( or “blind spots”) may also occur. Occasionally, optic neuritis will cause pain upon movement of the affected eye. Diplopia, also known as “double vision,” occurs when the muscles that control a particular eye movement are weakened and not coordinated. Although annoying, double vision usually resolves on its own without medical treatment. When diplopia comes on suddenly, it could indicate an acute attack. Less common than diplopia, another disorder stemming from muscle weakness and loss of coordination around the eye is nystagmus. This is the uncontrolled side-to-side (horizontal) or up-and-down (vertical) movements of the eye. It can be asymptomatic (causing no visual problems) or severe enough to disturb vision. Objects may appear to jump or move unpredictably as the two eyes no longer coordinate well with each other. Nystagmus can be more of a nuisance than a major problem and is usually temporary. Some individuals with MS may experience a , a disorder that causes a blind spot to appear in the center of vision. A different disorder, homonymous , occurs rarely, causing vision to be lost on the right or left visual fields of both eyes. Whenever a visual problem arises, an ophthalmologist or neuro-ophthalmologist should be consulted. At times, the doctor may decide that the best treatment is to wait for the inflammation to go down and to see if the visual symptoms disappear on their own, reserving steroid treatment for more severe attacks. If the symptoms are severe, intravenous steroid treatment may be used to reduce the inflammation and accelerate the recovery process. The same steroid treatment used to treat other types of MS relapses is often effective in shortening the duration of visual problems. These are usually given via intravenous injection (IV) for a few days, but steroids may also be given orally. An example of high dose steroids would be 1,000 mg of Solu-Medrol® (IV methylprednisolone). Steroids may be administered two ways. As mentioned, a high dose of Solu-Medrol may be given through intravenous injection (IV), and this is often given daily for three to five days during an attack. Deltasone® (oral prednisone), Decadron® (oral dexamethasone), or Medrol® (oral methylprednisone) in a pill form may also be administered orally for several days after IV treatment, or they may be taken alone without an earlier IV treatment. While these corticosteroids may shorten MS attacks and help one to recover more quickly, no convincing evidence has been shown that corticosteroids can affect the long-term course of MS. Acthar® Gel (ACTH given via injection) is another option for treating MS relapses. Another line of action is through disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Presently, 10 disease-modifying therapies are FDA-approved for treating the relapsing forms of MS. Several studies have shown that these can reduce the number and severity of attacks, which in turn reduces the development of visual difficulties. Several non-pharmaceutical options are also available to help cope with visual changes. For instance, an eye patch is sometimes used to treat diplopia (double vision) when necessary, such as when driving or reading. An ophthalmologist may also offer additional ideas or treatments for specific visual symptoms. Examples include using yellow lenses to tone down light for those experiencing a light sensitivity, or prisms in eye glasses to redirect the image. In other instances, a patient may find ways to simply adjust – as by turning the head to allow better alignment of the eyes. If visual problems persist, an ophthalmologist who specializes in low vision can help provide low-vision devices that include magnification and computer modifications. He or she can also design a variety of helpful strategies for managing daily activities. Individuals with MS experiencing visual problems are often comforted by the fact that these symptoms are usually temporary. As with other MS symptoms, as noted earlier, please keep in mind that visual problems in MS may also be worsened by stress, fatigue, infection, certain medications, or an increase in temperature. When possible, avoiding situations that could worsen the symptoms of MS will also help to minimize the occurrence of visual issues.

That means the system designed to keep your body healthy mistakenly attacks parts of your body that are vital to everyday function. The protective coverings of nerve cells are damaged, which leads to diminished function in the brain and spinal cord. is a disease with unpredictable symptoms that can vary in intensity. While some people experience fatigue and numbness, severe cases of MS can cause , vision loss, and diminished brain function. Common early signs of multiple sclerosis (MS) include: Visual problems are one of the most common symptoms of MS. Inflammation affects the optic nerve and disrupts central vision. This can cause , , or loss of vision. You may not notice the vision problems immediately, as degeneration of clear vision can be slow. Pain when you look up or to one side also can accompany vision loss. There are variety of with MS-related vision changes. MS affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the body’s message center). This means it can send conflicting signals around the body. Sometimes, no signals are sent. This results in . Tingling sensations and numbness are one of the most common warning signs of MS. Common sites of numbness include the face, arms, legs, and fingers. Chronic pain and involuntary muscle spasmsare also common with MS. One study, according to the , showed that half of people with MS had chronic pain. or spasms () are also common. You might experience stiff muscles or joints as well as uncontrollable, painful jerking movements of the extremities. The legs are most often affected, but back pain is also common. Unexplained fatigue and weaknessaffect about in the early stages of MS. occurs when nerves deteriorate in the spinal column. Usually, the fatigue appears suddenly and lasts for weeks before improving. The weakness is most noticeable in the legs at first. Dizziness and problems with coordination and balance can decrease the mobility of someone with MS. Your doctor may refer to these as problems with your gait. People with MS often feel lightheaded, dizzy, or as if their surroundings are spinning (). This symptom often occurs when you stand up. A dysfunctional bladder is another symptom occurring in up to of people with MS. This can include , strong urges to urinate, or . Urinary-related symptoms are often manageable. Less often, people with MS experience , , or . Sexual arousal can also be a problem for people with MS because it begins in the central nervous system — where MS attacks. About half of people with MS will develop some kind of issue with their cognitivefunction. This can include: and other emotional health problems are also common. Major depression is common among people with MS. The stresses of MS can also cause , , and a condition called . This involves bouts of uncontrollable crying and laughing. Coping with MS symptoms, along with relationship or family issues, can make depression and other emotional disorders even more challenging. Not everyone with MS will have the same symptoms. Different symptoms can manifest during relapses or attacks. Along with the symptoms mentioned on the previous slides, MS can also cause: MS isn’t necessarily hereditary. However, you have a higher chance of developing the disease if you have a close relative with MS, according to the . The general population only has 0.1 percent chance of developing MS. But the number jumps to if you have a sibling or parent with MS. Heredity isn’t the only factor in determining MS. An identical twin only has a 25 percent chance of developing MS if their twin has the disease. While genetics is certainly a risk factor, it’s not the only one. A doctor — most likely a neurologist — will perform several tests to , including: neurological exam: your doctor will check for impaired nerve function eye exam: a series of tests to evaluate your vision and check for eye diseases magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): a technique that uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of the brain and spinal cord (also called a lumbar puncture): a test involving a long needle that’s inserted into your spine to remove a sample of fluid circulating around your brain and spinal cord Doctors use these tests to look for damage to the central nervous system in two separate areas. They must also determine that at least one month has passed between the episodes that caused damage. These tests are also used to rule out other conditions. MS often astounds doctors because of how much it can vary in both its severity and the ways that it affects people. Attacks can last a few weeks and then disappear. However, relapses can get progressively worse and more unpredictable, and come with different symptoms. Early detection may help prevent MS from progressing quickly. If you don’t already have a neurologist, the can help you find a physician in your area. Misdiagnosis is also possible. A found that nearly 75 percent of surveyed MS specialists had seen at least three patients over the past 12 months who had been misdiagnosed. MS is a challenging disorder, but researchers have discovered many treatments that can slow its progression. The best defense against MS is seeing your doctor immediately after you experience the first warning signs. This is especially important if someone in your immediate family has the disorder, as it’s one of the key risk factors for MS. Having someone to talk to can also make a big difference.

98778d3e-1086-47e5-b7e1-d3e5c6d067cc,"Medically reviewed by — — If you or a loved one has , you already know about the symptoms. They may include muscle weakness, trouble with coordination and balance, vision problems, thinking and memory issues, and sensations such as numbness, prickling, or “pins and needles.” What you may not know is how this autoimmune disease actually affects the body. How does it interfere with the messaging system that helps your brain control your actions? Nerve damage can occur anywhere in the spinal cord and/or brain, which is why MS symptoms may vary from person to person. Depending on the location and severity of the white blood cell attack, symptoms may include: MS attacks tissues in the brain and spinal cord, known as the (CNS). This system includes the complex network of nerve cells responsible for sending, receiving, and interpreting information from all parts of the body. During daily life, the spinal cord sends information to the brain via these nerve cells. The brain then interprets the information and controls how you react to it. You can think of the brain as the central computer and the spinal cord as a cable between the brain and the rest of the body. Nerve cells (neurons) carry messages from one part of the body to another through electrical and chemical impulses. Each has a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. The are thin, web-like structures that branch out from the cell body. They act like receptors, receiving signals from other nerve cells and transmitting them to the cell body. The , also called a nerve fiber, is a tail-like projection that serves the opposite function of the dendrites: it sends electrical impulses out to other nerve cells. A fatty material known as covers the axon of the nerve cell. This covering protects and insulates the axon much like the rubber shell that protects and insulates an electric cord. Myelin is made of up (fatty substances) and proteins. In addition to protecting the axon, it also helps nerve signals travel quickly from one part of the body to another, or to the brain. MS attacks myelin, breaking it down and interrupting nerve signals. Scientists believe that MS begins with . Infection-fighting white blood cells that are triggered by some unknown force enter the CNS and attack the nerve cells. Scientists speculate that a latent virus, when activated, may cause the inflammation. A genetic trigger or an immune system malfunction may also be to blame. Whatever the spark, the white blood cells go on the offensive. When inflammation spikes, MS is activated. Attacking white blood cells damage the myelin that protects the nerve fiber (axon). Imagine a damaged electrical cord with wires visible, and you’ll have a picture of how the nerve fibers appear without myelin. This process is called . Just like a damaged electrical cord may short out or create intermittent surges of power, a damaged nerve fiber will be less efficient at transmitting nerve impulses. This can trigger the symptoms of MS. If you get a cut on your arm, the body forms a scab over time as the cut heals. Nerve fibers also form scar tissue in areas of myelin damage. This tissue is stiff, hard, and blocks or obstructs the flow of messages between nerves and muscles. These areas of damage are typically called or and are a major signal of the presence of MS. In fact, the words “multiple sclerosis” mean “multiple scars.” During a period of inflammation, attacking white blood cells can also kill cells. Glial cells surround nerve cells and provide support and insulation between them. They keep nerve cells healthy and produce new myelin when it’s damaged. However, if glial cells are killed, they’re less able to keep up with repair. Some of the new research for an MS cure is focused on transporting new glial cells to the site of myelin damage to help encourage reconstruction. An MS episode or period of inflammatory activity can last anywhere from a few days to several months. In , the person usually experiences “remission” with no symptoms. During this time, the nerves will try to repair themselves and may form new pathways to get around the damaged nerve cells. Remission can last from months to years. However, do not show as much inflammation and may not show any remission of symptoms, or at best will only plateau and then continue to cause damage. There is no known cure for MS. However, current therapies can slow the disease and help control symptoms.

f307b75e-0d1f-4711-9c14-92b05f1b8049,"The Difficulties of Keeping Your Job When You Have Multiple Sclerosis — Multiple sclerosis can reduce productivity and affect cognitive abilities, forcing people with MS to cut back their hours, quit their jobs, or retire early. “I continued working with my company for four years after diagnosis and finally had to quit. It’s been an absolute nightmare and two years later I’m still battling for disability.” That’s how Anna Stokes described how multiple sclerosis has affected her productivity and ultimately her life in the workplace since she received a diagnosis in 2012. The former data entry/special projects manager is not alone. Recent shows fatigue and cognitive impairment as the two main reasons why an employee with multiple sclerosis (MS) has to change their job, reduce hours, or retire early. The implication from the research is that MS affects employment status before physical disabilities even set in. Some complain of fatigue and cognitive difficulties. Other neurological symptoms that can affect employment include speech impairments, vision problems, and transportation difficulties. Krista Brennan, a former IT executive and college professor, struggled with fatigue and cognitive difficulties as MS stole her career. “All was OK, but when I had to give up my teaching job, that hurt. It was my passion,” Brennan told Healthline. “I don’t feel sorry for myself. I’ve worked a lot longer than others have. I’m fortunate.” “These reports are consistent with other data which highlight that the so-called ‘invisible’ symptoms of fatigue and cognitive impairment on employment and work productivity in persons with MS can have more of an impact than an obvious physical disability,” Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. “Strategies such as flexible work schedules and other accommodations may mitigate these impairments,” emphasized Giesser. Work capacity is significantly affected by these invisible symptoms. One from Europe with 16,000 participants showed work capacity declined by as much as 74 percent. Fatigue and cognitive difficulties were the top two reasons. in the United Kingdom recently confirmed that cognitive impairment is common and occurs across a range of thinking domains among those with MS. The study looked at the extent of cognitive impairment in those with MS using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, a touch-screen program. In all, 90 people with MS were evaluated in working memory, executive function, processing speed, attention, and episodic memory. Executive function was the most frequently impaired domain, affecting 55 percent of the participants. Disease duration and severity correlated closely with performance across all domains. Patients with symptoms of depression were also more likely to have impaired processing speed. Data suggests that lost work productivity due to MS or the need to retire early is the largest single factor contributing to nonmedical costs of MS. Loss of income is also associated with a corresponding increase in disability claims for governmental programs and insurance providers. Nonmedical costs include short-term and long-term absence from work, reduced work hours, changing the type of work to a less physically challenging and stressful nature (usually at lower pay), and early retirement. Although the costs vary by person, these factors result in reduced productivity and substantial income loss for those with MS. In 2016, a confirmed that the main cost component for progressive MS patients is loss of productivity, up to 67 percent of their cost of illness. Compared with employees without MS, those with the disease had more than six times the number of sick-leave days. The annual cost for disability to employers were nine times greater for MS employees. Researchers in Australia looked at estimating MS-related productivity and losses. MS patients were present at work more often than they were missing work. The authors noted the importance of presenteeism being included in employment outcomes. But of the 740 employees with MS, 56 percent experienced work loss due to MS in the previous four weeks. This resulted in an annual per person loss of $4,985 in U.S. dollars. Other costs to employers include the loss of quality employees. “I had to leave my job because of MS,” Kathy Reagan Young, a long-time marketing executive who received a diagnosis in 2008, told Healthline. “I need to be able to work from anywhere, like a hospital bed or, more often, my recliner.” Employees with MS are protected by the American Disabilities Act (ADA) and in California, the Fair Employment and Housing Act. Employers who don’t make a reasonable effort to accommodate an employee with complications from MS can pay big fines. “MS is a disability. It’s a major life function,” said Jack Schaedel, partner and co-chair of Labor and Employment Practice at Scali Rasmussen, a law firm in Los Angeles. “Unlike most antidiscrimination law, where you have to treat people the same, this one says you have to make a reasonable accommodation for the employee to perform their job,” Schaedel told Healthline. “Reasonable accommodations don’t impose undue hardship. It can’t be just that it costs you more or you don’t have an A-plus worker anymore. Hardship is where you fail and others fail because of you.” Under the law, it’s the responsibility of the employer to figure how to help the worker be productive. Adjustments might be making a workspace more comfortable, using hands-free apps, dictation, or providing an assistant to carry things or type. “One’s job might be to give a lecture. Their job is not to carry their books to the lecture hall,” said Schaedel. Schaedel added that it’s the individual and not the disease that is the focus. “If the business can’t accommodate the employee, then they can’t,” said Schaedel. “But if they can, they must.” When an employee receives an MS diagnosis, Schaedel suggests the company work with them to figure out how to proceed. “Ask the employee what they need to do their job,” he said. Many with MS seek relief from fatigue and cognitive impairment in the form of prescription drugs, lifestyle changes, and alternative treatments. One treatment growing in popularity is . Medical marijuana is legal in California, but employers don’t need to allow it based on the in a 2008 California Supreme Court case. In 2013, the Department of Justice granted exemptions to Washington and Colorado, where recreational marijuana is legal, by saying “they will defer the right to challenge their legalization laws at this time.” This hands-off policy was reversed in January by the Trump administration. Patients can legally take prescription medications while working. This includes codeine, lorazepam, Xanax, and other drugs commonly prescribed for MS symptoms, as long as they don’t interfere with their work. MS causes people with the disease to redefine their lives. “I haven’t given up,” said Stokes, who moved from Arizona back home to North Carolina after her diagnosis. “I’ve attempted to teach myself stained glass this year and [on the] days I’m able to do so, it’s a nice mental getaway. It helps combat my feelings of worthlessness after being financially independent and a former avid outdoors enthusiast.” Stokes told Healthline she also attends a local mental healthcare facility for group therapy using meditation as a form of stress relief. After changing her diet and way of living, her energy and clarity returned. She went back to school for another degree and currently helps her husband with his marketing business. “Not what I used to do, but it’s what I do now,” she said. As a result of her improved health, Brennan recently started a consulting company, , to guide people through intermittent fasting, something she has used to clear up her fatigue and thinking problems. Young became an MS advocate. She started an and found a whole industry of patient advocacy that she’s now building a career around. “I want to help other chronically ill patients find legit work from home, patient advocacy opportunities, and share training on how to build an online business as well,” she said. Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

7a31b320-0fb9-4fa1-a497-2a9254ab33fc,"— — (MS) is a condition where the body’s immune system attacks healthy tissue in the central nervous system (CNS). Areas affected include the: Several types of multiple sclerosis exist, but doctors don’t currently have a definitive test to determine if someone has the condition. Because there isn’t a single diagnostic test for MS, your doctor may run several tests to rule out other possible conditions. If the tests are negative, they may suggest other tests to find out if your symptoms are due to MS. However, innovations in imaging and continued research on MS in general have meant improvements in diagnosing and treating MS. The CNS acts as the communication center in your body. It sends signals to your muscles to make them move, and the body transmits signals back for the CNS to interpret. These signals could include messages about what you’re seeing or feeling, such as touching a hot surface. On the outside of the nerve fibers that carry signals is a protective casing called myelin (MY-uh-lin). Myelin makes it easier for nerve fibers to transmit messages. It’s similar to how a fiber-optic cable can conduct messages faster than traditional cable. When you have MS, your body attacks myelin and the cells that make myelin. In some cases, your body even attacks the nerve cells. vary from person to person. Sometimes, symptoms will come and go. Doctors associate some symptoms as being more common in people living with MS. These include: difficulty thinking, such as affected memory and problems focusing vision problems, including blurred vision and pain with eye movement If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. MS isn’t the only condition that results from damaged myelin. There are other medical conditions your doctor may consider when diagnosing MS that could include: , like collagen vascular disease Your doctor will start by requesting your medical history and reviewing your symptoms. They will also perform tests that can help them assess your neurological function. Your neurological evaluation will include: Your doctor may also order blood tests. This is to rule out other medical conditions and vitamin deficiencies that could be causing your symptoms. Evoked potential (EP) tests are those that measure the brain’s electrical activity. If the test shows signs of slowed brain activity, this could indicate MS. Testing EP involves placing wires on the scalp over specific areas of your brain. You’ll then be exposed to light, sounds, or other sensations while an examiner measures your brain waves. This test is painless. While there are several different EP measurements, the most accepted version is the visual EP. This involves asking you to view a screen that displays an alternating checkerboard pattern, while the doctor measures your brain’s response. (MRI) can show abnormal lesions in the brain or spinal cord that are characteristic of an MS diagnosis. In MRI scans, these lesions will appear bright white or very dark. Because you can have lesions on the brain for other reasons, like after having a stroke, your doctor must rule out these causes before making an MS diagnosis. An MRI doesn’t involve radiation exposure and isn’t painful. The scan uses a magnetic field to measure the amount of water in the tissue. Usually myelin repels water. If a person with MS has damaged myelin, more water will show up in the scan. This procedure isn’t always used to diagnose MS. But it’s one of the potential diagnostic procedures. A involves inserting a needle into the spinal canal to remove fluid. A laboratory professional tests the spinal fluid for the presence of certain antibodies that people with MS tend to have. The fluid can also be tested for infection, which could help your doctor rule out MS. Doctors may have to repeat diagnostic tests for MS several times before they can confirm the diagnosis. This is because MS symptoms can change. They may diagnose someone with MS if testing points to the following : Signs and symptoms indicate there’s damage to the myelin in the CNS. The doctor has identified at least two or more lesions in two or more parts of the CNS via an MRI. There’s evidence based on a physical exam that the CNS has been affected. A person has had two or more episodes of affected neurological function for at least one day, and they occurred a month apart. Or, a person’s symptoms have progressed over the course of one year. The doctor can’t find any other explanation for the person’s symptoms. Diagnostic criteria have changed over the years and will likely continue to change as new technology and research comes along. The most recent accepted criteria were published in 2017 as the revised The International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis released these criteria. One of the more recent innovations in diagnosing MS is a tool called optical coherence tomography (OCT). This tool allows a doctor to obtain images of a person’s optical nerve. The test is painless and is much like taking a picture of your eye. Doctors know that people with MS tend to have optic nerves that look different from people who don’t have the disease. OCT also allows a doctor to track a person’s eye health by looking at the optic nerve. Is the diagnostic process different for each type of MS? Doctors have identified a number of MS types. In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS revised the descriptions of these types based on new research and updated imaging technology. Although the diagnosis of MS has initial criteria, determining the MS type a person has is a matter of tracking a person’s MS symptoms over time. To determine the type of MS a person has, doctors look for It’s estimated that of people with MS are initially diagnosed with , which is characterized by relapses. This means new MS symptoms appear and are followed by a remission of the symptoms. About half of the symptoms that occur during relapses leave some lingering problems, but these may be very minor. During a remission, a person’s condition doesn’t get worse. The National MS society estimates that of people with MS have . Those with this type experience a steady worsening of symptoms, usually with fewer relapses and remissions early in their diagnosis. People with this type of MS have early incidences of relapse and remission, and symptoms worsen over time. A doctor may diagnose a person with (CIS) if they have an episode of neurologic symptoms associated with MS that lasts at least 24 hours. These symptoms include inflammation and damage to myelin. Having just one episode of experiencing a symptom associated with MS doesn’t mean a person will go on to develop MS. However, if the MRI results of a person with CIS show that they might be at higher risk for developing MS, the new guidelines recommend starting disease-modifying therapy. According to the , these guidelines have the potential to reduce the onset of MS in people whose symptoms are detected in the very early stages. — — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

e040706c-e80a-4333-9649-d34897998cf4,"Medically reviewed by — — is a neurodegenerative and inflammatory immune condition that causes problems throughout the body. It’s caused by a breakdown of the protective cover (myelin sheath) around the nerves. This makes it hard for the to communicate to the rest of the body. The exact cause of MS is still unknown, but doctors do understand the long-term effects and symptoms of MS. Read on to learn more about the effects of MS on your body. According to the , tend to show up in adults 20 to 40 years of age. Women are also diagnosed with MS at least as men. MS is thought to be an autoimmune disease and a progressive neurodegenerative condition. However, and there’s currently no cure, only treatments to manage the symptoms. What we do know is that it affects the nervous system and gradually impacts the whole body. The body’s immune cells attack healthy nerve tissue over time, affecting the body’s internal systems to respond healthily. Most of the problems described above are primary symptoms associated with MS. This means that they’re directly caused by the nerve damage resulting from attacks to the myelin sheath. Some primary symptoms can be treated directly by trying to slow the nerve damage and prevent MS attacks. However, once nerve damage exists, secondary symptoms can arise. Secondary MS symptoms are common complications of primary MS symptoms. Examples include that result from weak bladder muscles, or a loss of muscle tone that results from an inability to walk. Secondary symptoms can often be treated effectively, but treating the source of the problem can prevent them altogether. As the disease progresses, MS will inevitably cause some secondary symptoms. Secondary symptoms can often be well-managed with medication, physical adaptation, therapy, and creativity. When someone has MS, their body’s immune system slowly attacks its own myelin sheath, which is composed of the cells that surround and protect the nervous system including the spinal cord and brain. When these cells are damaged, the nerves are exposed and the brain has difficulty sending signals to the rest of the body. The disconnection between the brain and the organs, muscles, tissues, and cells served by the damaged nerves causes symptoms such as: and other changes in the brain can be a direct result of MS or an indirect result from the difficulty of coping with the condition. In , nerve damage can cause tremors, seizures, and cognitive problems that closely resemble other neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia. are often the first sign of MS for many people. Double vision, blurriness, pain, and problems seeing contrast can begin suddenly and affect one or both eyes. In many cases, vision problems are temporary or self-limiting, and likely result from nerve inflammation or fatigue of the eye muscles. Although some people with MS experience permanent vision problems, most cases are mild and can be effectively treated with steroids and other short-term treatments. Rarely, people with MS may experience hearing loss or deafness caused by damage to the brainstem. These types of hearing problems usually resolve on their own, but can be permanent in some cases. According to the , up to 40 percent of people with MS have speech problems. These include: Such effects often occur during relapses or times of . Other speech problems can include changes in voice pitch or quality, nasality, and hoarseness or breathiness. Speech problems can be caused by breathing difficulties that are brought on by weak or damaged nerves that control muscles in the chest. Difficulty controlling the muscles involved in breathing can begin early in the disease and worsen as MS progresses. This is a dangerous yet rare complication of MS that often can be improved through work with a respiratory therapist. Swallowing problems are less common than speech difficulties, but can be far more serious. They may occur when nerve damage weakens muscles and hinders the body’s ability to control the muscles involved in swallowing. When , food or drink can be inhaled into the lungs and increase your risk for infections, such as . Coughing and choking when eating and drinking can be signs of swallowing problems and should be evaluated immediately. Speech or language therapists can often help with trouble speaking and swallowing. Many people with MS experience effects to their limbs. Damage to the myelin sheath often results in pain, tingling, and numbness of the arms and legs. Problems with hand-eye coordination, , , and gait may occur when the brain has trouble sending signals to the nerves and muscles. These effects may start slowly and then worsen as nerve damage progresses. Many people with MS first feel “pins and needles” and have difficulty with coordination or fine motor skills. Over time, limb control and ease of walking may become disrupted. In these cases, canes, wheelchairs, and other assistive technologies can aid in muscle control and strength. People with MS are at higher risk of developing due to common MS treatments (steroids) and inactivity. Weakened bones can make individuals with MS susceptible to fractures and breaks. Although conditions like osteoporosis can be prevented or slowed through physical activity, diet, or supplementation, weak bones can make MS balance and coordination problems even riskier. A growing body of evidence suggests that may play an important role in the development of MS. Although its exact impact on individuals with MS isn’t yet well understood, is vital to skeletal health and immune system health. MS is thought to be an immune-mediated disease. This means that the body’s immune system attacks healthy nerve tissue, which causes nerve damage throughout the entire body. Immune system activity seems to result in the inflammation responsible for many MS symptoms. Some symptoms may flare up during an episode of immune system activity and then resolve when the episode or “attack” ends. Some research is investigating whether suppressing the immune system with medication will slow the progress of MS. Other therapies try to target particular immune cells to prevent them from attacking the nerves. However, may make people more vulnerable to infection. Some nutrient deficiencies may affect immune health and worsen MS symptoms. However, most MS physicians only recommend when a specific nutrient deficiency is present. One common recommendation is a — this also helps prevent osteoporosis. and bowel functions commonly occur in MS. Such issues can include: In some cases, diet and physical therapy or self-care strategies can reduce the impact of these problems on daily life. Other times, medications or more intense intervention may be necessary. The use of a catheter may occasionally be necessary. This is because nerve damage affects how much urine those with MS can comfortably hold in the bladder. This can result in spastic bladder infections, , or . These problems can make urination painful and very frequent, even overnight or when there’s little urine in the bladder. Most people can effectively manage bladder and bowel problems and avoid complications. However, serious infections or hygiene problems may arise if these problems are left untreated or unmanaged. Discuss any bladder or bowel issues and treatment options with your doctor. MS doesn’t directly impact the reproductive system or fertility. In fact, many women find that offers a nice reprieve from MS symptoms. However, the reports that 2-4 out of 10 women will experience a relapse during the postpartum period. However, , such as difficulty experiencing arousal or orgasm, is common in people with MS. This can be caused by nerve damage or by MS-related emotional problems such as depression or low self-esteem. Fatigue, pain, and other MS symptoms can make sexual intimacy awkward or unappealing. However, in many cases, sexual problems can be addressed successfully through medication, over-the-counter aids (such as lubricant), or a bit of advanced planning. Circulatory system problems are rarely caused by MS, although weak chest muscles can lead to shallow breathing and low oxygen supply. However, lack of activity due to depression, difficulty using muscles, and a preoccupation with treating other problems may prevent people with MS from focusing on the risk of cardiovascular disease. A study published in the journal found that women with MS have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular problems such as heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. However, physical therapy and regular physical activity may help alleviate MS symptoms and reduce cardiovascular risk. While there’s no cure for multiple sclerosis, a wide variety of medications, herbal remedies, and dietary supplements may help alleviate symptoms. can also modify the disease by preventing its progression and overall effects on your body. MS affects everyone differently. Each person experiences a unique set of symptoms and responds to treatments individually. Therefore, you and your doctors should customize your treatment regimen to address your MS symptoms specifically and alter it as the disease progresses or relapses. A carefully designed treatment plan can help make MS more manageable.

Problems with vision, balance, coordination, and fatigue are among the most common symptoms. Approximately people worldwide have MS. There’s no US national registry, but it’s estimated to affect about . Blood tests are often an effective way to eliminate or confirm other diagnoses. Blood tests can help your doctor rule out conditions such as that trigger some of the same symptoms as MS. This puts your doctor one step closer to making an accurate diagnosis. Since symptoms come and go, and there isn’t one test that provides a conclusive diagnosis, it can take a long time to diagnose MS. shows a great deal of promise, but more clinical studies are needed. While the wait may be frustrating, each test will help eliminate or confirm other potential causes for your symptoms. A number of conditions cause symptoms similar to those of MS. All of these should be investigated. Some, like (PML) virus and , can be identified with an MRI. Blood tests can help provide clues to other MS mimics, such as: Tingling or numbness in your arms, hands, legs, and feet are common symptoms of both MS and . Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection that can spread to the central nervous system. With Lyme disease, you’re likely to also have a skin rash. While not 100 percent accurate, and Western-blot blood tests can detect the presence of Lyme disease infection in the blood. Although some symptoms are the same, the treatments for MS and Lyme disease are different. Early-stage Lyme disease can often be cured with a course of oral antibiotics. is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that can affect your central nervous system. Symptoms that lupus and MS share include: Like MS, there isn’t a single test for lupus. A blood test that is positive for and other antibodies may indicate lupus or some other autoimmune disease, but not MS. Treatment for lupus depends on your symptoms. , better known as Devic’s disease, is a rare immunological disorder that is strikingly similar to MS. The two conditions share many symptoms, including: A test called the NMO-IgG blood test will be negative in people with MS, but positive in of people with Devic’s disease. Devic’s disease doesn’t respond to the same disease-modifying medications as MS. It can be treated with steroids and other immune-suppressing drugs. Certain vitamin deficiencies, such as a lack of , can cause symptoms that mimic those of MS. , common in both B-12 deficiency and MS, is damage to the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers within the central nervous system. Symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency include numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, weakness, and fatigue. Copper, , and deficiencies can also cause neurological symptoms. A simple blood test can check the levels of essential vitamins in your blood. Your doctor can walk you through treatment plan with supplements and dietary changes. To reach the diagnosis of MS, your doctor must find: damage in two distinct areas of the central nervous system that the areas of damage developed at two different points in time Generally, a series of tests are needed to meet the criteria for diagnosis. In addition to symptom history and blood tests, your doctor might also order the following tests. An is painless, noninvasive, and can produce detailed images. Performed both with and without contrast dye, an MRI can identify lesions on the brain and spinal cord. The images can show if the lesions are old, new, or currently active. In addition to diagnosis, an MRI can help monitor disease progression. Although can’t rule out or confirm MS, it can help with diagnosis. Spinal fluid is obtained from a needle inserted between the bones of your lower spine. In people with MS, the spinal fluid sometimes contains elevated levels of IgG antibodies or proteins called oligoclonal bands, which could also be caused by some other diseases. About of people with MS have no spinal fluid abnormalities. This involves staring at a screen with an alternating checkerboard pattern. This helps determine if there’s any impairment of your optic nerve pathways. After diagnosis, the next step is to discuss treatment options with your doctor. There’s a growing list of disease-modifying drugs designed to reduce relapses and slow disease progression in relapsing MS. These drugs haven’t been shown to work for progressive types of MS. These powerful drugs must be taken consistently to be effective, and they can have serious side effects. Be sure to discuss the pros and cons of each with your doctor. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, can also be treated. Your doctor can refer you to local resources to learn about MS. You may find it helpful to join an MS support group, either or in person. Although everyone’s experiences with MS are different, it might help to share your experiences with others. There’s no cure for MS, so management is a lifetime commitment. In addition to your general doctor, you’ll also need a neurologist on your healthcare team to evaluate symptoms and monitor disease progression. Sometimes MS can lead to severe disability, but most people continue to have a good quality of life and can expect a normal lifespan. — — Medically reviewed by Multiple sclerosis can be difficult to diagnosis.

716fa67c-c2ec-456b-b741-d4024e948371,"| | By Amy Perrin Ross, APN, MSN, MSCN, CNRN Neuroscience Program Coordinator Loyola University Chicago MS Center Member, MSAA Healthcare Advisory Council Sexual Dysfunction: A Less-Discussed Symptom of MS Sexuality and intimacy have a significant impact on the quality of life for nearly everyone, including those with a chronic disease such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, sexual dysfunction may be one of the more invisible symptoms of the disease. It is important to recognize and understand the factors that contribute to sexual dysfunction in order to adequately address it. Both men and women may experience sexual dysfunction. Some studies suggest it affects between 40 to 80 percent of women and 50 to 90 percent of men. Other studies suggest that sexual dysfunction increases over time in people with MS and may be associated with some of the emotional and psychological problems that they may also experience. People are at times reluctant to discuss sexual dysfunction with their MS-care team, as they may feel awkward discussing things that seem so personal. In order to address these problems as one would address other symptoms, they first must be recognized and discussed. Cognitive impairment is common in MS, affecting as many as 50 percent of individuals with MS, and is not necessarily associated with advanced stages of disease. The onset of cognitive impairment in MS is usually not easy to pinpoint. Some people notice distinct changes in their mental functioning that can be attributed to the disease, while others are unaware of how their cognitive limitations may be affecting relationships. Some of the cognitive functions typically affected in people with MS include: information processing; perceiving; attending/responding to incoming information; information-processing speed; cognitive flexibility, such as attending to multiple stimuli at the same time (“multi-tasking”); problems with storage, manipulation, and retrieval of information; and executive function, which includes planning, working memory, attention, and problem-solving. Cognitive impairment may affect sexual function and relationships in many ways. Partners may become frustrated if the person with MS becomes easily distracted during intimacy. Distractions such as children in the home, music, and television may interrupt intimate moments if the person with MS is not able to filter out these distractions and remain focused on his or her partner. Planning for sexual activity may be complex and overwhelming to the person with MS, and he or she may choose to avoid it all together. Verbal fluency and word finding may also be a problem leading to a partner who feels he or she is not wanted or respected. Fatigue may worsen both cognitive function and the quality of sexual relations as well. Once cognitive impairment has been identified in a person with MS, what can be done to treat this condition? First, people with relapsing forms of MS should be encouraged to begin or remain on an effective disease-modifying therapy (DMT), if advised by his or her doctor. Based on these agents’ ability to inhibit inflammation and the accumulation of brain lesions, it is likely that they exert some degree of neuroprotection that may limit the progression of cognitive impairment. Evidence suggests that exercise training in people with MS has the potential to improve many aspects of cognitive performance. Exercise has been proposed to have positive effects in reducing inflammation and neurologic damage in people with MS. Counseling is vital to assist the couple dealing with cognitive challenges affecting sexual function. Patients can be referred to an occupational therapist to assist with adaptation of certain skills or to a psychosocial therapist for assistance with coping and stress reduction. Depression is another psychological disorder seen frequently in people with MS that often impacts sexual function. People with MS who are depressed may have a decreased libido, difficulty with certain sexual positions, and fear of developing relationships. Men may also experience erectile dysfunction. The best treatment for depression is usually psychotherapy along with medication and exercise. Seeking strength in spiritual beliefs can also help. Depression can also affect care partners and may increase as disability increases. Care partners need to recognize and treat depression to effectively participate in intimate relations. Anxiety can affect sexual function as well, and care partners are also at risk. When anxiety impacts sexual function, both of these symptoms can worsen. Intimacy may be defined as anything that makes one feel closer to another, particularly in a personal and private way. People with MS who are experiencing emotional or psychological difficulties may find intimacy particularly challenging. Depression, anxiety, and cognitive dysfunction are all likely to interfere with attempts at intimacy. Recognizing and treating the underlying cause is the best way to enhance intimacy. Emotional and psychological impairment affects quality of life, which includes intimate and sexual relationships. Recognizing these impairments in people with MS and their care partners is the first step to a healthy sexual relationship. Quality of life can be impacted and treatment for many of the underlying emotional and psychological causes of sexual dysfunction should be investigated. With early recognition and treatment, a healthy and satisfying sexual relationship is certainly possible. Orton SM, Herrera BM, Yee IM, et al.

cca598de-ee64-465f-9eac-d51fe1d40a0e,"Selma Blair Says She Probably Lived with MS for 15 Years Before Diagnosis Actress Selma Blair recently revealed that she has multiple sclerosis — and that she had symptoms for about 15 years before receiving a diagnosis. Blair, who has starred in films like “Hellboy” and “Legally Blonde” wrote on her Instagram this week that she “is disabled.” “I have . I am in an exacerbation,” Blair wrote in an Instagram post. “By the grace of the lord, and will power and the understanding producers at Netflix, I have a job. A wonderful job. I am disabled. I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken gps.” Blair said she was diagnosed in August but had symptoms years earlier. “I have probably had this incurable disease for 15 years at least,” she wrote. In fact, Blair actually fits many of the demographics at higher risk of the disease. The actress’ news has put a spotlight on a condition that can still be confusing for patients and physicians alike. MS isto affect women than men, and most symptoms first appear when a person is between 20 and 40, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. About 1,000,000 Americans have MS, which also affects over 2.3 million individuals across the globe, reports. Multiple sclerosis, also known as MS, is a neurological disease that impairs communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Difficulty with coordination and balance, as well as blurred vision, are common symptoms of the disease. Dr. Daniel M. Harrison, a neurologist and interim division director of the Maryland Multiple Sclerosis Center, said an accurate diagnosis can be made in the majority of cases when a patient undergoes proper evaluation and testing. “The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is made based on a combination of a patient’s clinical signs and symptoms, and the results of supportive testing,” he said. But sometimes, symptoms are not as obvious, added Dr. Philip De Jager, PhDa director of the Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care and Research Center at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York. “There is no test that tells you whether you have MS. It remains a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning we have to rule out all other possibilities,” he said. Harrison noted that MS is an autoimmune condition that occurs when inflammation causes a loss of myelin (the insulation around nerve cells). This damages the nerve cells and their supporting structures in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Having a family history of MS or another autoimmune condition significantly increases your chance of having MS, Harrison said. Vitamin D deficiency, especially in childhood, also plays a clear role and likely works together with a genetic predisposition for MS. “More controversially, exposure to some viral infections, perhaps also in childhood, may also work together with a genetic predisposition to help trigger the development of MS,” he explained. Some people experience MS “attacks” but recover from them; others accumulate disabilities over time, noted De Jager. While vision changes, weakness, numbness, and imbalances are common symptoms, each patient’s symptoms can vary greatly. Signs of MS vary, and can also include movement control issues, alterations of reflexes, muscle tone changes, slow moving limbs, and poor limb coordination. Sensory pathways can also be affected, so a patient may experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, pain, temperature, vibration, or position. Lower acuity of vision, missing visual fields and altered pupil reflexes are also symptoms. “If the parts of the brain that control eye movements are affected, we will often find misalignments in the way that the left and right eyes move together,” he added. Sometimes, patients can experience cognitive symptoms, such as memory impairment, language dysfunction, or concentration difficulties. Kathy Costello, associate vice president of health care access for the National MS Society, explained that MS is a progressive disease. “The disease course and severity are different for each person who is diagnosed,” she said. For about 85 percent of patients, MS includes times when they will experience symptoms, followed by a period when symptoms may seem to disappear. “Over time, these individuals generally have fewer relapses, but the disease course changes to being predominantly progressive, with a worsening of symptoms and potentially an increase in disability over time,” she said. The other 15 percent of people who have MS experience a primary progressive form of the disease, which means their symptoms worsen and accumulate. These patients don’t have relapses or remissions. “When a patient experiences such an event, they will often have supportive findings on their physical examination, which should trigger the ordering of an MRI,” Harrison said. An MRI scan of the brain and spinal cord will show signs of both current and previous regions of inflammation and loss of myelin. If the patient’s symptoms and findings on MRI are sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for MS, the diagnosis can be made at this point, he said. In some cases, spinal fluid testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. “Since MS can affect almost any part of the brain and spinal cord, the symptoms of MS can be very similar to many other neurologic conditions, so it is very difficult to know someone has MS solely based on their symptoms,” he explained. A thorough physical examination and use of the proper diagnostic procedures will help a physician determine if MS is a concern, or, if there is another neurologic or non-neurologic explanation for the symptoms. “If anyone is experiencing neurologic symptoms, they should seek medical attention for them and undergo a proper evaluation by their physician,” Harrison added. Harrison said there are many treatments available for MS, including more than 10 treatments for relapsing MS, which is just one variation of the disease. The treatments can drastically reduce a patient’s chance of having future episodes, new MRI activity, and disability accumulation. Last year, the FDA approved a treatment for primary progressive MS, which is a rarer form of the condition. The newer treatment helps to reduce the disability from further progressing. Treatments on the horizon include those that possibly may be able to restore health, repair myelin, and reverse symptoms. MS cannot be prevented, though some research is examining the potential of vitamin D use in those with a family history, as a way to prevent the disease from forming. “Despite the benefits of the treatments we currently have for MS, many patients can still experience lifelong symptoms, some of which can be disabling,” Harrison said. Actress Selma Blair’s MS diagnosis puts a spotlight on a confusing and sometimes misunderstood disease. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease that impairs communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Difficulty with coordination and balance, as well as blurred vision, are common symptoms of the disease. About 400,000 Americans have MS, which also affects about 2.1 million individuals across the globe, reports. It is more likely to affect women than men, and first symptoms often occur between the ages of 20 to 40.

3f5ae03a-ec1f-4d20-a8d4-3b69e64b50d9,"Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis: What You Need to Know — — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease. The body’s immune system mistakenly attacks a substance that surrounds and protects the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. This substance is called myelin. Myelin allows signals to move quickly and smoothly through the nerves. When it’s injured, the signals slow down and miscommunicate, causing the symptoms of MS. MS diagnosed in childhood is called pediatric MS. Only of people with MS are diagnosed before the age of 16, and receive the diagnosis before they’re 10. Symptoms of MS depend on which nerves have been affected. Since the myelin damage is spotty and can affect any part of the central nervous system, the symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from person to person. In children, MS is almost always the relapsing-remitting type. This means the disease alternates between relapses, in which someone develops new symptoms, and remissions, in which there are only mild or no symptoms. Flares can last days to weeks, and remission can last months or years. Eventually, though, the disease can progress to permanent disability. Most symptoms of MS in children are the same as in adults, including: eye problems, including vision loss, pain with eye movement, and double vision Usually symptoms like weakness, numbness and tingling, and vision loss only happen on one side of the body at a time. Mood disorders occur frequently in children with MS. Depression is the most common, occurring in about of children with MS. Other frequent conditions include: Approximately of children with MS have cognitive impairment or trouble with their thinking. The most frequently affected activities include: executive functions like planning, organizing, and decision-making Some symptoms are more frequently seen in children but rarely in adults. These symptoms are: The cause of MS in children (and adults) is unknown. It isn’t contagious, and there’s nothing that can be done to prevent it. However, there are several things that seem to increase the risk of getting it: MS isn’t inherited from parents, but if a child has certain combinations of genes or a parent or sibling with MS, they’re slightly more likely to develop it. This virus that sets off MS in children who are susceptible to it. However, many children are exposed to the virus and don’t develop MS. MS is found more often in people in northern climates where there’s less sunshine than around the equator. Our bodies need sunlight to make vitamin D, so people in northern climates tend to have lower vitamin D levels. Researchers think this between MS and low vitamin D. In addition, low vitamin D levels increase the risk of a relapse. Cigarette smoke, both firsthand use and secondhand exposure, has been shown to increase the risk of developing MS. Diagnosing MS in children can be difficult for several reasons. Other childhood diseases can have similar symptoms and are hard to differentiate. Because MS is so uncommon in kids and teenagers, doctors may not be looking for it. There isn’t a specific test for diagnosing MS. Instead, a doctor uses information from the history, exam, and several tests to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. To make a diagnosis, a doctor needs to see evidence of MS in two parts of the central nervous system at two different times. A diagnosis can be made after only one episode with abnormalities seen on MRI if there’s evidence of MS in the spinal fluid and all other possible causes of symptoms and MRI findings are ruled out. The tests a doctor may use to diagnose MS include: A doctor will ask detailed questions about the kinds and frequency of the child’s symptoms and perform a thorough neurologic examination. An MRI shows whether any parts of the brain and spinal cord are damaged. It can also show if there’s inflammation in the optic nerve between the eye and the brain, which is called optic neuritis. For this procedure, a sample of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord is collected and examined for signs of MS. This test shows how fast the signals move through the nerves. These signals will be slow in children with MS if there’s a history of optic neuritis. This is a test that takes a picture of the optic nerve and can look for thinning. This can pick up a history of optic neuritis that might not have caused any symptoms. Although there’s no cure for MS, there are treatments aimed at reducing new lesions and relapses and slowing progression of the disease: Steroids can reduce inflammation and lessen the length and severity of relapses. Plasma exchange, which removes the antibodies attacking the myelin, can be used to treat a relapse if steroids don’t work or aren’t tolerated. Specific symptoms can be treated with other medications to improve quality of life. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can also be helpful for children with MS. The eating plan of someone with MS is important to prevent relapses, especially in children. found that children eating a diet high in fat, particularly saturated fat, were more likely to have a relapse. Eating more vegetables seemed to lead to fewer relapses. The study showed no association either way with an increase in carbohydrates, cholesterol, dairy, fiber, fruit, iron, or sugar. It’s possible that excess fat intake could trigger increased inflammatory chemicals or affect gut microbiota. Another suggested a link between low iron intake and pediatric MS cases. Though more research is needed to further understand the link between food and pediatric MS, a healthy diet could be a factor in reducing relapses and symptoms. Here are some foods and nutrients thought to improve an MS diet for children: A healthy balance of complex carbs, healthy fats, protein, fruits, and plenty of vegetables promotes general health. Foods rich in iron include leafy green vegetables like spinach, beans, chicken, turkey, and fortified whole grain breads and cereal. These can be found in supplements and foods like salmon, flaxseed, and walnuts. Omega-3 fatty acids to lower relapse rates in adults with MS. Low vitamin D to a higher incidence of MS. Fatty fish like salmon and cod, canned tuna, egg yolks, mushrooms, fortified foods, and vitamin D supplements are good choices. Dark, leafy greens and other veggies high in fiber can help stabilize blood sugar and . Spinach, broccoli, and kale are also great sources of calcium and iron. excessive salt ( to lower cognitive function) gluten, if found to be intolerant ( exist between celiac disease and MS, so testing for intolerance is recommended) Having MS as a child can cause emotional and social challenges. Living with a serious chronic disease may negatively affect a child’s: friendships and relationships with others the same age It’s important that a child with MS has access to school counselors, therapists, and other people and resources that can help them through these challenges. They should be encouraged to talk about their experiences and problems. Support from teachers, family, clergy, and other members of the community can also help children successfully manage these issues. Life expectancy and outlook for children and teens with MS MS is a chronic and progressive disease, but it isn’t fatal and doesn’t usually lower life expectancy. This is true no matter how old you are when it starts. Most children with MS eventually progress from relapsing-remitting type to irreversible disability. The disease usually progresses more slowly in children and teens, and significant impairment develops about than when MS begins in adulthood. However, because the disease starts at a younger age, children usually need permanent assistance about in life than those with adult-onset MS. Children tend to have more frequent flares than adults during the first few years after diagnosis. But they also recover from them and go into remission more quickly than people diagnosed as adults. Pediatric MS can’t be cured or prevented, but by treating the symptoms, addressing emotional and social challenges, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, a good quality of life is possible. — — What to Expect When Your Child Starts Treatment for MS The Caregiver’s Guide to Multiple Sclerosis in Children © 2005-2021 Healthline Media a Red Ventures Company.

Multiple sclerosis, often called MS, is a disease that affects the —the brain and spinal cord. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve cells have a protective covering called myelin. Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS gradually destroys myelin in patches throughout the brain and spinal cord, causing muscle weakness and other symptoms. These patches of damage are called lesions. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. Generally, MS follows one of four courses: , where symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressive. ""Progressive"" means it steadily gets worse. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where the symptoms are progressive at first and are relapsing later. The exact cause is unknown, but most experts believe that MS is an autoimmune disease. In this kind of disease, the body's defenses, called the , mistakenly attack normal tissues. In MS, the immune system attacks the central nervous system—the . Experts don't know why MS happens to some people but not others. There may be a link, because the disease seems to run in families. Where you grew up may also play a role. MS is more common in those who grew up in colder regions that are farther away from the equator. Symptoms depend on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are damaged and how bad the damage is. Early symptoms may include: You may feel weak and stiff, and your limbs may feel heavy. You may drag your leg when you walk. Your vision may be blurred or hazy. You may have eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. You may feel tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, or numbness. You may feel a band of tightness around your trunk or limbs. You may feel lightheaded or dizzy or feel like you're spinning. Diagnosing MS isn't always easy. The first symptoms may be vague. And many of the symptoms can be caused by problems other than MS. MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure that you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your central nervous system. The doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An is often used to confirm the diagnosis, because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with this test. During a relapse, to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to keep down the number of attacks and how severe they are and to slow the progression of the disease. (This is called disease-modifying therapy.) You may find it hard to decide when to start taking the drugs that slow the progression of MS. The drugs may not work for everyone, and they often have side effects. You and your doctor will decide together when you should start any of these drugs. There is no cure for MS. Treatment and self-care can help you maintain your quality of life. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help you manage some physical problems caused by MS. You can also help yourself at home by eating balanced meals, getting regular exercise and rest, and learning to use your energy wisely. Dealing with the physical and emotional demands of MS isn't easy. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to your doctor. You may be depressed, which can be treated. And finding a support group where you can talk to other people who have MS can be very helpful. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. Because a person's risk of MS is slightly higher in some families when a relative has MS, there may be a . For more information, see . Some research suggests that where you lived as a child and you have had could be triggers for MS later in life. But these links have not been proved. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) vary from person to person depending on which parts of the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system) are damaged. The and scarring caused by MS can affect any part of the central nervous system. Myelin is the insulating coating around a nerve. Symptoms may come and go or become more or less severe from day to day or, in rare cases, from hour to hour. Symptoms may become worse with increased body temperature or after a viral infection. , such as weakness, leg dragging, stiffness, a tendency to drop things, a feeling of heaviness, clumsiness, or a lack of coordination (). , such as blurred, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. Optic neuritis—sudden loss of vision that is often painful—is a fairly common first symptom. It occurs in up to 25 out of 100 people who have MS. , such as tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, a band of tightness around the trunk or legs, or electrical sensations moving down the back and legs. As MS progresses, symptoms may become more severe and may include: Worse muscle problems, and stiff, mechanical movements () or uncontrollable shaking (). These problems may make walking difficult. A wheelchair may be needed some or all of the time. Bladder symptoms, such as an inability to hold urine () or to completely empty the bladder, or a loss of bladder sensation. (impotence) and . . These are common in people who have had MS for some time. Feeling very tired (fatigue). This can be worse if symptoms such as pain, spasticity, bladder problems, anxiety, or depression make it hard to sleep. In general, multiple sclerosis follows one of four courses: , where symptoms may fade and then recur at random for many years. The disease doesn't advance during the remissions. Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course. In 8 to 9 out of 10 people with this course of MS, the relapsing-remitting phase lasts about 20 years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course. Later on, it becomes steadily progressive. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where steady deterioration of nerve function begins when symptoms first appear. Symptoms appear and disappear, but nerve damage continues. Few people have this course of MS. MS is different for every person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. The duration of the disease varies. Most people who get MS live with it for decades. MS usually progresses with a series of that occur over many years (relapsing-remitting MS). In many people the first MS attack involves just a single symptom. It may be weeks, months, or years before you have a relapse. As time goes by, symptoms may linger after each relapse so you lose the ability to fully recover from the relapse. New symptoms often develop as the disease damages other areas of the . Events that can mean you may have a more severe type of MS include: Frequent relapses during the first few years of the disease. Early, lasting motor problems that affect movement. Many lesions that show up on an early in the disease. Some people have a few mild attacks from which they recover entirely. This is called benign MS. Although rare, a small number of people die within several years of the onset of MS. This is called malignant or fulminant MS. Because MS may affect your ability to move and walk, it can place limits on your daily living, particularly as you age. If you or someone in your family has MS, talk to your doctor about . Knowing what to expect will help you plan for the future. Reduced ability to move and walk. This makes it necessary to use a wheelchair some or all of the time. Your risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) increases with: Geographic location, or where you lived during childhood (up to age 15). People who spend the first 15 years of their lives in colder climates that are farther away from the equator tend to be more likely to get MS than people who lived closer to the equator during those years. Family history of MS. About 15 out of 100 people who have MS have a relative with MS, most often a brother or sister. Certain genetic characteristics associated with the . These appear more frequently in people who have MS. This may mean that there are one or more that may increase the chance of getting MS. Race. People of Western European ancestry are more likely to get MS. Being female. MS is about 3 times as common in women as in men. Some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are similar to those of many other illnesses. See your doctor if over a period of time you have more than one symptom, such as: Blurry, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain, loss of vision, or double vision. A feeling of heaviness or weakness, involuntary leg dragging, stiffness, walking problems, and clumsiness. Tingling or a pins-and-needles sensation; numbness; tightness in a band around the trunk, arms, or legs; or electric shock sensations moving down the back, arms, or legs. Inability to hold urine or to completely empty the bladder. Problems with memory, attention span, finding the right words for what you mean, and daily problem-solving. If you have been diagnosed with MS, see your doctor if: You begin having a symptom that you have not had before or you notice a significant change in symptoms that are already present. Milder MS-type symptoms can be caused by many other conditions or may occur now and then in healthy people. For example, lots of people have minor numbness in their fingers or a mild dizzy spell once in a while. Stiffness and muscle weakness can result from being more active than usual. A wait-and-see approach () is appropriate for these types of everyday aches and pains, so long as they do not continue. If your symptoms occur more often or don't go away, talk to your doctor. Talk to your doctor about what to expect from the disease and from treatment. MS is an unpredictable disease, but you probably can get some idea of what is ""normal"" and what symptoms or problems are reasons for concern. Some people who have MS want active, regular support from their doctors. Others want to manage their condition on their own as much as possible. Wherever you are in this range, find out which signs or symptoms mean that you need to see your doctor. And seek help when you need it. Health professionals who may be involved in evaluating symptoms of MS and treating the condition include: or . Consult your doctor when symptoms first start. He or she will refer you to a neurologist if needed. If you have MS, your family doctor or internist can treat your general health problems even if you see a neurologist for MS treatment. . A neurologist can decide whether your symptoms are caused by MS. He or she can also help you decide what may be the best treatment for your condition. Many university medical centers and large hospitals have MS clinics or centers staffed by neurologists and other health professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating MS. They may be able to provide the most thorough evaluation. If you have been diagnosed with MS, at some point you may need to seek the help of: A , to assist with exercise to maintain body strength and flexibility and deal with movement problems. An , to identify ways of accomplishing daily activities if MS has caused any physical limitations. A , to improve speech, chewing, and breathing if MS has affected the muscles of the face and throat. A , to help with managing pain, maintaining strength, and adapting to physical disability. A or , to evaluate and treat , or other mood disorders, and problems with memory and concentration if these develop. A , to help with any significant chronic pain that MS may cause. A pain specialist, often as part of a pain clinic, can help find ways of reducing pain when possible and dealing with pain that doesn't go away. A , to do surgery for severe or . Diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) isn't always easy and in some cases may take time. Your medical history and can identify possible nervous system problems and are often enough to strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS. Tests may help confirm or rule out the diagnosis when your history and exam do not provide clear evidence of the disease. MRI and neurological exam may help doctors predict which people will develop MS after a first attack of symptoms. of the brain and spinal cord. This test is done to . (sometimes called a spinal tap). This test may be done to evaluate . Most people with MS have abnormal results on this test. . This test can often reveal abnormalities in the and in the that other tests may not detect. MS is diagnosed when it is clear from neurological tests and a neurological exam that lesions (damaged areas) are present in more than one area of the (usually the brain, spinal cord, or the nerves to the eyes). Tests will also clearly show that damage has occurred at more than one point in time. Some people have had only one episode of a neurological symptom such as optic neuritis, but MRI tests suggest they may have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. Urinary tract tests may be needed to help diagnose a problem with bladder control in a person who has MS. may be needed to identify thinking or emotional problems, which may be present without the person being aware of them. Typically, these tests are in a question-and-answer format. A blood test for JC virus antibodies may be done. This test can help you and your doctor understand your risk for getting a rare but serious brain infection called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Treatment can make living with multiple sclerosis (MS) easier. Your type of treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and whether your disease is active or in remission. You may get medicines, physical therapy, and other treatment at home. Medicines are used to treat relapses, control the course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs), or treat symptoms. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and who have active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicines. This group also recommends treatment with medicine after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS. If you decide not to try medicines at this time, meet with your doctor regularly to check whether the disease is progressing. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You and your doctor will set up a schedule of periodic appointments to monitor and treat your symptoms and follow the progress of your MS. Monitoring your condition helps your doctor find out if you may need to try a different treatment. , occupational therapy, and nonmedical treatment done at home may also help you manage symptoms and adjust to living and working situations. To learn more, see . In rare cases, MS is life-threatening. If your condition gets considerably worse, you may want to make a living will, which allows your wishes to be carried out if you are not able to make decisions for yourself. For more information, see the topic . In general, there is no way to prevent multiple sclerosis (MS) or its attacks. For people with , , and , treatment with medicine may reduce the frequency of relapses and delay disability. If you have multiple sclerosis (MS), it is important to find ways of coping with the practical and emotional demands of the disease. These are different for everyone, so home treatment varies from person to person. Home treatment may involve making it easier to get around your home, dealing with , handling specific symptoms, and getting support from your family and friends. to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don't use throw rugs. And try adjusting your daily schedule so that your routine is less stressful or tiring. , either on your own or with the help of a physical therapist. . At some time, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home somewhat cool, and avoid hot swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. Change how and what you eat if you are having problems swallowing. Thicker drinks make swallowing easier. Try milk shakes or juices in gelatin form. Avoid foods such as crackers or cakes that crumble easily. These can cause choking. Soft foods need less chewing. Use a blender to prepare food for easiest chewing. Eat frequent, small meals to avoid fatigue from eating heavy meals. Ask your doctor about and occupational therapy to help you manage at work and home. Make all efforts to preserve your health. Proper diet, rest, wise use of energy, and practical and emotional support from your family, friends, and doctor can all be very helpful. For more advice about coping with MS at home, contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. Medicines for multiple sclerosis (MS) may be used: During a , to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to alter the natural course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs). These medicines can shorten a sudden relapse and help you feel better sooner. They have been shown to affect the long-term course of the disease or to prevent disability. Strong evidence suggests that MS is caused by the causing and attacking nerve cells and myelin, which is the protective coating surrounding the nerve fibers. Medicines that change the way the immune system works can reduce the number and severity of attacks that damage the nerves and myelin. For people who have , disease-modifying therapy can reduce the number and severity of relapses. It may also delay disability in some people. Some of these medicines may also delay disease progression and reduce relapses in some people who have or . The most commonly used disease-modifying therapies are: Interferon beta (such as Betaseron), for clinically isolated syndrome (first MS attack), relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive MS. Glatiramer (Copaxone), for clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. Other disease-modifying medicines may also be used for MS. Your doctor will prescribe a medicine depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms, and how your body responds. They include: Some people have only one episode of a neurological symptom such as . Yet or other tests suggest that these people have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have had a clinically isolated syndrome. These medicines, when taken early or even before you have been diagnosed with MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend your time without disease. Treating specific symptoms can be effective, even if it doesn't stop the progression of the disease. Symptoms that can often be controlled or relieved with medicine include: Medicines can also help with sexual problems, emotional problems, and walking problems. Sildenafil (Viagra) can help with sexual problems in both men and women. Clomipramine may also be given to improve . Dextromethorphan and quinidine (Nuedexta) is a medicine that can be used for uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing at strange or inappropriate times. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medicine that can be used to help with walking problems. Medicine may be used only some of the time or regularly, depending on how severe or constant a certain symptom is. Changes in diet, schedule, exercise, and other habits can also help manage some of these symptoms. See . Cannabinoids are substances found in marijuana. Similar drugs can be created in a lab. Some forms of natural and man-made cannabinoids may help with symptoms such as pain and spasticity. They are not available in all areas. Talk to your doctor if you are considering cannabinoids. A variety of other medicines and biological chemicals have been tried or are being studied as therapy for MS. None of them have been clearly proved as beneficial, and none have been approved for treatment of MS. Several medicines are being tested in clinical trials. People with MS who have not responded to standard therapy sometimes choose to take part in these trials. To learn more about clinical trials, talk to your doctor or contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Despite the recommendation, some people find it hard to decide whether to begin disease-modifying therapy, especially when their symptoms have been fairly mild. Some may not want to bear the risks and side effects of medicine when they are not sure they need it. Some may want to see whether their disease gets worse before they start therapy. A small percentage of people diagnosed with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and may never develop any disability, but the disease is unpredictable. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The need and desire for medicine vary. If your symptoms are mild, you may choose to manage them without any medicine. If you have specific symptoms that are causing problems, certain medicines may help you keep them under control. Or you may want to use medicine only during a relapse. The possible side effects of using steroids or other medicines to treat symptoms or control a relapse. Some people have only minor side effects. But others may have side effects that concern them more than their MS symptoms. The costs of treating symptoms and controlling relapses. In some cases, using medicine to control symptoms and relapses may reduce the need for hospital stays. Other personal issues that you face at work or at home. Also keep in mind that it can be hard to tell if medicine is helping. Multiple sclerosis is a disease with spontaneous remissions. This means that your condition can improve on its own, without any treatment. Just because your symptoms improve after treatment doesn't mean that a treatment is working. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have severe (shakiness) affecting movement may be helped by surgery. People with severe (muscle stiffness) may be helped by insertion of a spinal pump to deliver medicines when oral medicines fail. for tremor. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. Severe and disabling tremor that occurs with the slightest movement of the limbs may be helped by an implanted device that stimulates an area of the brain. A does the surgery to implant the device. Implantation of a drug catheter or pump, for spasticity. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. People who have severe pain or spasticity may benefit from having a catheter or pump placed in the lower spinal area to deliver a constant flow of medicine, such as baclofen. The unpredictability and variety of symptoms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) make it a disease that people have tried to treat in many different ways. Many have been proposed as treatments for MS. None of these treatments have been shown to modify the course of the disease. Some of those most commonly used are: Diets and vitamin, mineral, herbal, or dietary supplements. (often used by ). Although clinical research has not shown all of these complementary therapies to be effective, a person with MS may benefit from safe nontraditional therapies along with conventional medical treatment. Some complementary therapies may help relieve stress, depression, fatigue, and muscle tension. And some may improve your overall well-being and quality of life. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying any of these complementary therapies or to MS treatment. Clinical research also has been unable to show that treatments such as ""liberation"" angioplasty for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), bee venom therapy, Prokarin (a caffeine and histamine combination), removal of mercury fillings (dental amalgams), and have any benefits for people who have MS. Some of these therapies may be harmful as well as expensive and are not recommended by most experts. Experimental treatments for MS involve reducing the activity of the . This may be done with medicines and biological chemicals or through methods such as total lymphoid irradiation, in which the entire lymph node system is exposed to radiation. While these methods have been used with success in the treatment of certain other medical conditions, they have failed to produce significant benefits when tested in controlled clinical trials. They remain experimental treatments for MS. , which uses immature cells from the bone marrow, has been studied. Early results suggest that stem cell transplant may delay disability, especially in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Stem cell transplant may be an option for people who have very aggressive or malignant forms of MS. It remains unproved and isn't recommended for treating relapsing-remitting MS. There is no cure for MS. So far, the only treatments proved to affect the course of the disease are approved disease-modifying therapies. Other types of treatment should replace these medicines if you are a candidate for treatment with them. Some people who have MS report that complementary therapies have worked for them. This may be in part because of the . Some complementary therapies don't treat the disease itself, but they may affect a person's sense of well-being and help the person feel better and healthier. If you are thinking about trying a complementary treatment, get the facts first. Discuss these questions with your doctor: Talk with your doctor about the safety and potential side effects of the treatment. This is especially important if you are on drug therapy for MS. Some complementary treatments in combination with drug therapy can be quite dangerous. A treatment that could be harmful to you and may or may not improve your symptoms isn't worth the risk. Because MS symptoms can come and go, you may find it hard to judge whether a particular treatment is really working. Keep in mind that if you get better after using a certain treatment, the treatment isn't always the reason for the improvement. MS may often improve on its own (spontaneous remission). An expensive, unproven treatment that may or may not help you may not be worth its cost. Beware of therapy providers or products that require a large financial investment at the beginning of a series of treatments. Even if they aren't effective in treating MS, some complementary practices (such as acupuncture, massage, or yoga) may be safe. And they may lead to healthy habits that improve your overall well-being. These might be worth trying. With a hard-to-treat disease like MS, it can be tempting to jump at the promise of an effective treatment. Be cautious about trying unproven treatments.

236f6eac-21f1-495f-8f39-0c13917003b8,"/ Scientists find clue to multiple sclerosis treatment: Know how this condition affects your health Scientists find clue to multiple sclerosis treatment: Know how this condition affects your health According to researchers of a new study, a new therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis may be developed soon. Read on to know how this condition can affect your health. By: | Edited by: | MS is usually caused by a degeneration of the myelin sheath, which forms a protective cover around the nerves of the central nervous system. © Shutterstock Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. In this autoimmune disease, activated immune cells invade the central nervous system and cause inflammation, and tissue damage. It is believed that genes and environmental factors play a role in triggering this condition. Some say that it could be due to a virus. But experts are divided about the exact cause. Also Read - Low fitness levels can up your risk of developing psoriasis An affected person may either suffer from a relapsing-remitting or progressive form of this disease. Symptoms are usually extreme fatigue, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, constipation, pain, cognitive changes, co-ordination problems, altered sensation and numbness. There are also muscular and visual changes. As yet, there is no cure for this disorder and doctors rely on symptomatic treatments. Physiotherapy and medication that suppress the immune system can help deal with symptoms and slow disease progression.

According to researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine, stimulating these protective cells may lead to new therapies for diseases in which the immune system attacks the body’s own tissues, such as multiple sclerosis and celiac disease. Also Read - Rheumatoid arthritis ups your risk of diabetes by 23 per cent: Know other health risks In the study, published in researchers injected mice with peptides recognised by CD8 T cells. These cells are known to kill in the body. They saw that it reduced disease severity and killed disease-causing immune cells. This was due to a rise in CD8 T cells. They are confident that if they could mobilise those cells to function more effectively in patients with autoimmunity, then they will soon have a novel treatment for diseases like multiple sclerosis. MS is usually caused by a degeneration of the myelin sheath, which forms a protective cover around the nerves of the central nervous system. Because of this, it becomes difficult for the brain to communicate to the rest of the body. This disorder can have long-term effects on your body. It can also cause other related health issues. Let us take a look at how it affects your overall health. If you have this disorder, your immune system will attack the myelin sheath, composed of cells that offer a protective cover to the nervous system including the spinal cord and brain. This exposes the nerves and the brain experiences difficulty in communicating to with the rest of the body. This can cause symptoms like dizziness, vertigo, memory issues, personality changes and confusion. You may also . Tremors, seizures and cognitive problems, that are seen in dementia, are also common. Vision problems are often the first sign of this disorder for many people. You may experience double vision, blurred vision, poor contrast and pain in the eyes. Usually such problems are temporary and may be due to nerve inflammation or fatigue of eye muscles. But some people may suffer permanent vision problems. But most cases are mild and can be treated with steroids and other short-term treatments. Incidentally, some people may also suffer from . But again, these are temporary conditions and go away on their own. Multiple sclerosis may lead to cardiovascular disorders mainly due to nervous system dysfunction, physical invalidity, increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammatory status. It can cause abnormalities in blood pressure response, heart rate, heart rhythm, left ventricular systolic function and may even cause pulmonary oedema or cardiomyopathy. It can sometimes lead to sudden death. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. The body’s immune system attacks healthy nerve tissue, and this causes nerve damage in the entire body. This weakens the immune system, and this can lead to pneumonia, nutrient deficiencies and inflammatory conditions. All this can also induce MS flare-ups. It is a vicious cycle. Incontinence or loss of bladder control is a common problem for people with this condition. You may experience a frequent urge to urinate, a tendency to dribble urine involuntarily and an inability to completely empty the bladder. You need to consult your doctor because this can cause and sometimes, kidney problems. You may experience difficulty in walking due to nerve damage. Muscle cramps, spasms, weakness, tremor and stiffness are some common symptoms of this disorder. As the diseases progresses, this weakness may lead to the need for a wheelchair. Multiple sclerosis can cause sexual dysfunction problems in patients. People with MS usually suffer from fatigue, heat intolerance, spasms and spasticity, pain or changes in sensation, bladder and bowel changes and problems with attention and concentration. All this can have an adverse effect on sexuality and sexual response. This condition doe not affect fertility. But if you are planning a pregnancy, consult a doctor before going ahead.

Selma Blair Opens Up About 'Memory Problems' Caused By Multiple Sclerosis ""I might forget what I am looking up in the middle of it."" Selma Blair shared that she's suffering from ""memory problems"" due to multiple sclerosis in a new Instagram post. Memory problems are a key symptom in those with MS and are often the first sign of the disease. Selma shared earlier this week that she's also losing her eyelashes due to MS. Earlier this week, Selma Blair revealed on Instagram that her due to multiple sclerosis. Now, Selma's opening up about another : memory loss. In a new Instagram post Thursday, Selma shared a throwback photo of herself that was apparently part of a book. ""This was from a book to raise money? Awareness? For brain cancer,"" she wrote, clearly trying to remember something she couldn't exactly put her finger on. ""I have my own memory problems,"" she continued. ""I might forget what I am looking up in the middle of it. Or I would give you more info on this book. So. I keep typing."" Selma also revealed that she doesn't remember thinking she looked good back then. ""My face looks so good,"" she wrote. ""I don't think I ever thought so."" (Cue the shocked look on my face.) This isn't the first time Selma's mentioned her memory issues related to MS. In her very first Instagram post about her , Selma gave a rundown of her symptoms: ""I am disabled,"" she wrote. ""I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken gps. But we are doing it. And I laugh and I don’t know exactly what I will do precisely but I will do my best."" Yep. Cognitive changes are a key symptom in people with MS, per the (NMSS)—more than half of all those diagnosed with MS will develop problems with cognition (a.k.a., high-level brain functions that include the ability to learn, remember, focus, and understand, among other things). According to the NMSS, cognitive changes are often the first symptom of MS, and are often only weakly related to other MS symptoms. That means, per the NMSS, that one person may have no physical limitations with MS but experiences significant cognitive impairment, while others who have extreme physical disabilities can be unaffected cognitively. Why Selma Blair Thought Her MS Was A Pinched Nerve Those with MS can experience cognitive issues if their disease is on the more progressive side and if they're in an exacerbation—both issues that Selma has said she has dealt with. While it's unclear how much medical treatment for MS can aid memory and cognitive issues, cognitive rehabilitation, like learning or memory exercises, can help slow the disease's cognitive progression. In some cases when a certain cognitive function is completely gone, MS patients can use tricks (like making to-do lists or eliminate distractions) that can help when certain cognitive functions are lacking. It seems as though Selma might be working on cognitive rehabilitation by looking back at these old photos; here's to hoping it can help her deal with her cognitive changes.

a85fb18a-b1f5-4f30-9b77-871ed3bde440,"— Sexual and cognitive dysfunction intertwined in multiple sclerosis by DALLAS -- Cognitive dysfunction was an independent risk factor for sexual dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS), according to results of a presented here. Sexual dysfunction was 1.5 times more common in MS patients with perceived cognitive impairment, reported Jing Wu, a graduate student at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, and George Jelinek, MD, of the University of Melbourne in Australia, and co-authors at the 2019 Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis () forum. Prior studies have shown that people with MS often experience sexual dysfunction, at rates of 40% to 80%. Sexual problems exact a toll on patients' well-being: a survey of 6,183 patients in the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry found that sexual dysfunction had a on the mental health aspects of health-related quality of life in MS patients than severity of physical disability. Last year, a study at Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio showed that 64.2% of patients reported sexual dysfunction; those patients also showed significantly scores. Depressive and anxiety symptoms also have been associated with in MS. Despite the prevalence of both sexual and cognitive dysfunction in MS patients, there has been little research about the relationship between the two until now, said Wu. ""There's evidence that disability and fatigue are significantly associated with sexual dysfunction in MS,"" Wu told . While other studies have shown cognitive impairment is correlated with sexual dysfunction, its relationship with incident sexual dysfunction had not been assessed, she added. In this analysis, researchers looked at participants with diagnosed MS in the (Health Outcomes and Lifestyle in a Sample of People with Multiple Sclerosis) international online study. In total, 1,959 participants provided cognitive and sexual function data at baseline, and 1,127 did so at 2.5-year follow-up. The researchers assessed disability with the Patient-Determined MS Severity Score () and depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire-212 (). At each review, participants completed the , which included assessments of cognitive function and sexual function. Perceived cognitive impairment was defined as MSQOL-54 cognitive function subscore ≤66.7%, and perceived sexual dysfunction was defined as MSQOL-54 sexual function subscore ≤66.7%. At baseline, the prevalence of perceived cognitive impairment was 45.6% and the prevalence of perceived sexual dysfunction was 45.5%. Of participants who reported no sexual dysfunction at baseline, 23.4% went on to develop sexual dysfunction during the 2.5 year follow-up period. Incident sexual dysfunction was significantly higher among people with cognitive impairment (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.13-2.06), and among those who became cognitively impaired during follow-up. The relationship was still significant after adjusting for age, sex, P-MSSS, PHQ-2, marital status, physical activity, and the number of comorbidities. There was no difference in the cognitive impairment-sexual dysfunction association by sex, but non-partnered patients with cognitive impairment had a 2-fold greater risk of sexual dysfunction. ""Our results indicate that cognitive dysfunction is a risk factor for sexual dysfunction in people with MS,"" Wu said. ""This is another way MS may adversely affect patients' quality of life. It's important for clinicians to be aware of this and focus not only on the treatment of multiple sclerosis, but on the whole person."" This study had several limitations, including the fact that all data were self-reported.

Fortunately, the prognosis is good for recovery from many vision problems associated with MS. A 2004 study published in reported optic-spinal MS occurs in 17 percent of compared with 8 percent of Caucasians. A common visual symptom of MS is optic neuritis — inflammation of the optic (vision) nerve.    Optic neuritis usually occurs in one eye and may cause aching pain with eye movement, blurred vision, dim vision, or loss of color vision. For example, the color red may appear washed out or gray.  Vision may be lost completely in the affected eye. A blurred or dim spot (scotoma) may occur in the center of the visual field, with peripheral vision unaffected. Optic neuritis usually occurs in one eye only.  It is possible that after experiencing optic neuritis in one eye, you may experience it in the other eye at some time in the future – although this does not always occur. Optic neuritis, with a loss of vision can be a frightening symptom, but in most cases, vision returns. Residual symptoms are possible, and you may notice a dimming or blurring of vision if you are very fatigues or overheated. Rest and cooling generally help vision return. High doses of glucocorticoids, such as intravenous methylprednisolone or prednisone pills are often used to help accelerate recovery from optic neuritis. Nystagmus is involuntary and uncontrolled movement of the eyes that can impair your vision. Movement is usually rapid and can be up and down, side to side or rotating. Nystagmus may occur when looking straight ahead or may occur when the eyes are moved. Sometimes nystagmus is called “dancing eyes”.  It may make you feel like the world is moving and you may notice that you can hold your head at an angle to reduce the symptoms.  Nystagmus may come and go or may be persistent. Treatment for nystagmus is limited and may include off-label use of medications such as .  In MS, diplopia, or double vision, occurs when the nerves that control your eye movement are inflamed or damaged. The nerves control muscles that allow eye movement. Normally, the muscles work in a coordinated way, but when diplopia occurs, muscles on one side may be weak from nerve damage and the eye movements are no longer coordinated. This may produce two side by side images or one image on top of another.  Diplopia may be temporary or persistent and may resolve without treatment.  When diplopia is a new symptom, it may be part of a relapse of MS and a brief course of corticosteroids may be helpful. Patching one eye can also be useful for driving or other short tasks.  Special eyeglass lenses known as prism lens may be helpful for persistent diplopia.

The symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) from person to person. Relapses can last for weeks, months, or longer, as do the triggers for flare-ups. For people who have MS and their loved ones, none of this is comforting. Fortunately, comfort can come in the pages of the many well-written books that focus on what it’s like to live with the condition. According to the , some 2.3 million people are living with MS around the world. So, despite how a diagnosis can feel, you’re not alone. You can learn more than the medical aspects of the disease reading these books. You can learn the human aspects, too. From personal stories to physician guidance, there’s a wealth of information here. Titled “The Inside Guide to MS”in previous editions, this book speaks to the person behind the MS diagnosis. Written by life coach Andrea Wildenthal Hanson, it’s an inspirational volume that covers everything from emotional health to diet and exercise. You’ll appreciate this positive, step-by-step guide to living. MS doesn’t show up at a time that’s “good for you.” On the contrary, it often bumbles in at the most inopportune points in life. For author Marlo Donato Parmelee it came just a few months into her international career move. She left New York for London to pursue a music career — only to begin losing her eyesight to MS within a month. Here, she chronicles her journey through those early months and provides comfort for others facing the same diagnosis. Journalist Suzanne Robins explores life with the disease and the symptoms the outside world doesn’t always see. Specifically, she writes about the depression, fatigue, and cognitive problems that can come with MS, aspects of the condition that are largely invisible to — and sometimes even dismissed by — others. No More Secs!: Living, Laughing & Loving Despite Multiple Sclerosis Writer Ann Pietrangelo was diagnosed with MS at age 44. Her perspective of the disease and the symptoms that come with it is relatable, straightforward, and even humorous at times. Anyone faced with a new chronic illness who may need to relearn how your mind and body work will enjoy this book. “If Bridget Jones had MS, this would be her diary.” That’s how the MS Society described this book. The story that Barbara Stensland delivers is her own. In 2011, one year before she was officially diagnosed with MS, Stensland woke up unable to speak. In 2012, she received her diagnosis and began blogging about it. This book is a collection that started on her blog, where she discusses how MS intersects with her life as a working mother. Overcome the BS of MS: A 3-Step Plan for Women Living with Multiple Sclerosis Written specifically for women, “Overcome the BS of MS” delivers an actionable plan for dealing with this disease. Writer Lisa Cohen has MS too, so she knows all of the challenges that go along with it — from the emotional and psychological to the obvious physical changes. She wants women to manage MS, not the other way around. Stop Carrying the Weight of Your MS: The Art of Losing Weight, Healing Your Body and Soothing Your Multiple Sclerosis For people with MS, losing weight can lessen symptoms and slow the disease’s progress. Author Andrea Wildenthal Hanson walks MS survivors through a healthy approach to weight loss with MS. She casts aside the guilt and drastic measures usually employed to get folks with a chronic disease to lose weight. She instead encourages small, long-lasting lifestyle changes that will inspire and encourage. If dating is hard, then dating with MS can seem near impossible when you’re first diagnosed. For author Cory Martin, an MS diagnosis at age 28 immediately made her wonder, “Who will marry me now?” In “Love Sick” she chronicles her life with MS at a time when all she wanted was to be on the scene, dating, and hopefully meeting Mr. Right. It’s filled with heartwarming, humorous, and heartbreaking anecdotes. This book on the ins and outs of MS is an excellent read for friends and family members of a person living with the condition. Author Vanita Oelschlager and illustrator Joe Rossi help get you up to speed on the basics of the disease with easy-to-understand explanations. There are also discussions of the symptoms and disease progression and even how you can help your loved one in the long term. Chef Interrupted: Discovering Life’s Second Course in Ireland with Multiple Sclerosis Trevis Gleason didn’t only lose his health to MS. He lost his marriage and his career. A former chef, he used this as a new starting point and embarked on a journey to Ireland. In “Chef Interrupted,” Gleason tells the story of his new life and colorfully illustrates his new friends, surroundings, and the food he encounters along the way. Not only does he encounter the physical difficulties associated with MS, but Gleason learns a lot about himself, people, and life in general. Finding Harmony: The Remarkable Dog That Helped a Family Through the Darkest of Times Harmony is a service dog, but she does more than put away groceries and pass items to her owner. She’s responsible for helping lift author Sally Hyder out of a dark depression. Hyder faced her MS diagnosis at age 28. Discouraged but not defeated, she went on to have three children and a full life until she struggled with her daughter’s autism diagnosis that plunged her into depression. It was then that she met Harmony, who helped her turn a corner. This heartwarming tale takes readers from Hyder’s diagnosis to her ascent to the top of a mountain. Can I Tell You About Multiple Sclerosis? A Guide for Friends, Family and Professionals If you’re looking for an easy-to-understand explainer on MS, author Angela Amos has developed a great tool to help. “Can I Tell You About Multiple Sclerosis?” is simply written and illustrated to help folks understand the disease and how it affects people living with it. Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis Some folks realize something is wrong when they become easily and unexplainably confused. For attorney Jeffrey Gingold, these cognitive symptoms ultimately led to his MS diagnosis. He discusses his own journey, including the therapies and approaches that have worked for him, in hopes others experiencing the cognitive difficulties of MS can find some relief.

ccceb3f7-5a57-4e67-973a-89269a1f9651,"In very simple terms, cognition is the process of certain mental functions. These functions include identifying knowledge, processing and understanding, learning and planning, problem-solving, concentration, and memory. In MS this process can become difficult. This is known as cognitive dysfunction, or cognitive challenges and often referred to as ‘cog-fog’. Around 50 per cent of people diagnosed with MS will experience cognitive dysfunction to some degree (1). We asked the MS community to describe how cognition affects them, they said... Can be embarrassing, but luckily when I’m with friends and family they help and I can laugh about it I’m slow to think and speak to express my thoughts and feelings I cannot think quickly. If I were a computer, I feel like it’s my RAM that is slow  It takes longer to apply myself to dealing with life’s issues I get easily distracted, lose my train of thought, brain fog, memory holes Forgetting the start of a book by the time I’ve reached the end Signs can initially be so subtle that they are not even really noticeable. They are easily attributable to feeling tired, or perhaps getting older. It can also have much more impact as the condition progresses and can interfere with work, personal life, how a person feels about themselves, or other situations that require more complex thinking. Social situations can become difficult which can cause an increase in anxiety as a result. ‘I think most of my difficulty with cognition is due to fatigue so later in the day it is worse. I have to plan carefully and tackle complicated tasks when I am not fatigued. If I am struggling I will leave a task until I feel more able to tackle it’ Jeffrey Gingold, author of ‘Facing the cognitive challenges of multiple sclerosis’ states in his book how in some cases, cognitive issues have the potential to be just as disabling as the physical difficulties of MS (2). As cognitive dysfunction is an invisible symptom it can often be overlooked, hard to recognise and understand by family, friends, co-workers and even health professionals. The difficulties people can face can be misunderstood. Equally, cognitive dysfunction can be a difficult symptom to talk about and it can be hard to admit you are having problems. ‘Cognitive dysfunction profoundly affects one’s sense of self. You feel as though your brain is failing you (which, with MS, it is!) and when you can’t rely on your own mind, where do you go?’ Healthcare professionals need to have a flexible approach and be creative when providing new information to a person with MS-related cognitive difficulties. It is important for anyone, whether they are a health professional or a personal assistant working directly with people with MS, to understand the cognitive challenges that many people face. MS is an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system attacks its own nerve cells. This means that it can affect any part of the brain therefore any cognitive function can be affected. Along with lesions, MS can cause brain atrophy (loss of brain cells) and shrinkage in certain areas (1). In MS, the protective coating that surrounds the brain and spinal cord cells – myelin - becomes damaged, causing messages to not be transmitted through the nerves effectively. The parts of the brain that control cognitive ability can be exposed and that’s when problems can start to appear. People with lesions in the cerebrum and the cerebellum parts of the brain will more often have problems with cognitive function compared to those who have lesions in the cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord (3). The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, contributing to nearly 80 per cent of the total weight of the brain. The cerebellum makes up the remaining part. Symptoms can vary from person to person and the level can fluctuate greatly. Symptoms can come and go and be dependent on other factors such as heat intolerance, fatigue, infections, emotional stress, relapses and medication. Whereas for others, cognitive difficulties can be very persistent and debilitating. Difficulty learning and remembering new things – memory can be less reliable, issues with short-term memory (long-term is often unaffected) Processing lots of information at once or multitasking can be tricky and slow Having poor concentration and being easily distracted (for example difficulty holding a conversation if there is background noise such as from a television) Inability to get the right words out – the word may be on the ‘tip of the tongue’ but you just cannot think of it Planning and problem solving can be more challenging. Often you know what you want to do but cannot figure out how to do it Slowed information processing – it can take much longer to process what you are reading, hearing and experiencing through senses. This can lead to getting lost as you are less able to process spatial information Less able to comprehend social cues in conversation or meetings A number of these symptoms are not just specific to MS. They can be caused by other conditions such as depression and anxiety. Even some medications can interfere with cognition. Therefore, it can be difficult to assess and diagnose that cognitive issues are definitely MS related (4). When cognitive issues are undiagnosed and unrecognised it can be an emotional and distressing experience. It can also have an impact on relationships and employment, and a person can lose their sense of self and feel vulnerable. In some cases a person may compare their cognitive issues to that of a form of dementia, although the use of this term in MS isn’t necessarily supported in a health care setting (5). It is important to talk through these thoughts and fears with a health professional, counsellor, MS-UK Helpline or a friend. It may be that coping strategies can be created together and in turn, this will help reduce further stresses and anxiety.  There is no one test that can diagnose cognitive dysfunction, or even necessarily confirm it. However, there is ongoing research into finding better tools to acknowledge and assess the symptom and therefore allowing for better management (6). The NICE guidelines state that cognition should be discussed fully by MS clinic staff and referrals should be considered to both an occupational therapist (OT) and a neuropsychologist to fully assess and manage the symptom (7). A full assessment is required to determine the level of cognitive problems that a person is experiencing. However, there are tools that other health professionals (such as MS nurses) can use too, as access to neuropsychology in some areas can be quite limited. An assessment will likely include a number of different tasks that will test your ability to remember, concentrate and do things that would ordinarily be easy.  The assessment will take into consideration whether a person is having a relapse, may be experiencing depression or high levels of stress, as all will have an impact on cognitive ability. After the assessment the health professional and patient will work together to set individual goals and find ways in which to make improvements where needed. This might include things like creating new strategies and techniques, referring on for cognitive rehabilitation, counselling, finding alternative approaches to perform tasks, and so on. There are various ways in which a person can manage their cognitive difficulties but sometimes guidance is needed by a professional. Unfortunately, there are no prescribable drugs that can help with MS-related cognition although some disease-modifying therapies (DMT) have shown some improvements in clinical trials. However, a DMT wouldn’t be prescribed solely for cognition, they all have eligibility criteria that need to be met. GPs or MS nurses can refer you to a neuropsychologist but if there isn’t one in your area then an occupational therapist (OT) can help too. An OT can work with a person to help design some strategies to help manage specific issues. ‘The neuropsychologist was very helpful in giving me strategies to get through and not panic, and to be open about how it affects me so people understand, most importantly not to be ashamed of it’ An OT may suggest certain pieces of equipment and aids or even some apps to use on your mobile phone or tablet. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy can be offered by an OT or psychologist either individually or in a group setting. This type of therapy works by learning new cognitive strategies aimed at compensating for cognitive problems. It can have a positive impact on memory and problem solving and also help to improve attention and a person’s mood (8). MBCT is mindfulness training combined with elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. Studies have shown that mindfulness-based interventions can have a positive effect on cognitive function. More studies are required to evidence this further (8). Professor Dawn Langdon, neuropsychologist, says there are a number of things people with MS can do to help protect their cognition. Positive lifestyle choices, some of which may be hard to action but are important to consider include Other factors that may or may not be available to you are to take disease-modifying medication and to also be prescribed optimum treatment for all other diseases, especially cardiovascular and diabetes. Professor Langdon also says that regular challenging mental activities can help to maintain clear and fast thinking (5). ‘Having time to take in information and to respond to questions is very important’ Moderate and severe depression can have a significant impact on cognitive function and is a symptom experienced by up to 50 per cent of people diagnosed with MS (9). Depression can slow down a person’s thinking. The decline of cognitive function is interlinked with both depression and fatigue. Depression can increase fatigue, which can lead to cognitive decline. Fatigue is associated with increasing levels of depression, which can also lead to a decline in cognition. Each symptom impacts negatively on the others. It is important that depression is recognised and treated to prevent any potential impact on a person’s cognitive ability. Accessing counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, and taking anti-depressant medication can all help. Speaking to a GP and/or MS nurse about any low mood can open up the conversation in finding the best form of treatment. Treating just one of those symptoms has a significant improvement on the others (9). A 2016 study looking at brain training versus ordinary computer games showed that both improved overall cognitive function. Training consisted of one hour a day, five days a week for 12 weeks (10). The brain training group used a cognitive remediation training program where patients were instructed to play a series of games and tasks, compared to a placebo program of ordinary computer games. The brain training group showed nearly three times the improvement than the computer games group. Both groups were able to take part from their own homes rather than attend a clinic, which was beneficial to all. Cognitive remediation therapy is a form of rehabilitation offering exercises that aim to improve attention, memory, language and/or executive functions. It can also teach specific strategies to help find the best ways of working with cognitive impairments. StayingSmart is a website designed by the MS Trust for people affected by MS who want to know more about how MS can affect thinking. The main aims of the resource is to support learning about cognition in MS, to help build confidence in managing cognition and to encourage the sharing of knowledge about, and experiences of cognition. It looks at everyday problems and provides guides, videos and tips and tricks, full of a variety of ways to manage cognition. They also include videos from people sharing their own personal experiences. ‘I have learnt to manage my issues through planning, recording, scheduling, giving myself time and finding a job more suited to my ability’ StayingSmart has some useful suggestions when dealing with memory issues, they include (11) Paper diaries and electronic organisers are unobtrusive and very useful For important appointments and dates (such as hospital appointments or birthdays), a reminder in advance can be helpful. For example, a reminder to book leave from work or transport a week before an appointment. A reminder to buy a card or present a week before a birthday Writing small prompts or cues on sticky notes, for example just writing ‘dry cleaning’ will probably be enough to remind you to stop to pick up the cleaning Check in with family members and friends to see if they have noticed any problems with your memory. It helps to be open and honest as they will then feel more able to be honest with you too ‘I avoid meetings at work. I tend to catch up and email thoughts and ideas later as I find thinking on the spot too hard, especially when lots of ideas and comments are being thrown around’ There are other daily reminders that can really improve quality of life and are simple to implement. These include Dosette boxes are such a simple piece of equipment that help people to remember to take medication at the right time of the day. Sometimes they can even be arranged via the pharmacy to come prefilled with prescribed medications too Use a family calendar or organiser to track everyone’s activities each day of the week. This can really help to alleviate confusion and keep on top of where everyone is Assign a specific place for storing important frequently used things such as car keys, encouraging family members to make sure they put things back where they belong Plan your most challenging cognitive tasks for your best time of day. If you experience fatigue around 3pm each day, make sure you have completed more taxing tasks in the morning Smart phones are great tools for alarms and reminders, and using the notes app to keep track of to-do lists is helpful. They are also good for brain training if you use certain game apps such as sudoku ‘My iPad is my ‘bible’. It goes with me everywhere, so that I can diarise events or make lists as necessary’ In Jeffrey Gingold’s book ‘Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis’ he talks about tips for living (2). Maintaining clear thinking spaces in your life means saying ‘no’ to some requests which can often be difficult If a situation appears confusing, don’t be afraid to ask for clarification, reminders and direction When faced with a moment of ‘befuddlement’, don’t force it. Give yourself permission to pause and breathe calmly, relax and patiently gather your thinking focus. Allow yourself the time and mental space to ride out your temporary lapses in thinking Limit visual distractions and live an uncluttered life. Clear floors and tabletops; organise shelves and drawers Keep lists for daily responsibilities and activities. Also, keep a long term and a short term list for projects ‘I need to try and schedule “concentration” times to earlier in the day, when less tired’ Find ways to relax and soothe your mind to prevent or ease stress Remember to have fun and make it part of your daily routine Be patient with yourself by taking breaks and extra time to complete projects if necessary ‘I was advised to start writing things in a notebook. I like to do crosswords to challenge my vocabulary skills’ These are all important points to remember to begin to take control and manage your own cognitive function. Keeping your brain active with hobbies you enjoy such as reading, crafts, painting to name a few can really help to keep your brain healthy. Crosswords and jigsaw puzzles are a great tool to exercise your brain. It is important that these activities stretch your mind somewhat though. Reading is great, talking about the subject with others is better, writing about it is best. According to MS Brain Health, it is important to stop smoking when affected by cognitive issues. Cigarette smoking in people with MS is associated with decreased brain volume as well as higher relapse rates, increased disability progression, more cognitive problems and reduced survival compared with not smoking (12). In a recent study presented at ECTRIMS 2019, it was found that smokers have reduced Processing Speed Test (PST) scores (which are used to assess cognitive functioning), compared to non-smokers. They also have more brain atrophy (13). The study looked at ex-smokers as well as current smokers. It was found that ex-smokers had significantly greater brain atrophy than those who had never smoked. This was an effect that was much greater in current smokers. The doctor behind the study said how important it is for clinicians to discuss smoking management at every appointment and provide patients with the data to encourage them to stop smoking to reduce the risks and the negative impact on disease progression. If cognitive issues are becoming a problem in terms of managing your finances there are a few things you can do to help plan for the future. Third Party Access is when a trusted person is given access to your accounts to help you sort out your day-to-day banking. They can make sure your bills are paid on time by arranging direct debits for example; access to mobile or online banking can be helpful so you can go through it together. Another option would be for a standing order to be set up where a fixed amount is paid regularly to your third party so they can withdraw money and pay bills for you whilst keeping a record of what they spend on your behalf. Third Party Access can be set up at your bank and can be cancelled at any time. In some cases where cognitive issues have a significant impact on quality of life and can be a very disabling symptom, things can become more difficult. Life can become confusing, overwhelming and very isolating. In this instance, it may be a good idea to have a LPA. A LPA is a legal document that allows you to appoint one or more people, (or ‘attorneys’) to have the authority to help you make decisions or to make decisions on your behalf. The person/people appointed do not have to have any legal experience. They can be a family member, friend or people you trust who will always consider your preferences and to help you make your own decisions as much as you can. They should always make decisions in your best interests.  If there are high levels of cognitive issues meaning you cannot make your own decisions easily, you may be seen to ‘lack mental capacity’. Health professionals and social workers would be able to assess whether or not an individual lacks mental capacity. Therefore an LPA will be important in having control over what happens to you and your future. You can choose to just have one LPA, or both. You can arrange LPAs via a solicitor or for people living in England, Wales and Scotland the forms are available online from the Office of Public Guardian. For people living in Northern Ireland you can contact the Office for Care and Protection. Forms can be completed online and there is a fee to register each LPA made.

7207aea3-d653-444d-aae4-f89c8848638e,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) causes different symptoms in different people at different times. No two people living with MS experience it the same way, and the type and severity of symptoms will also be affected by whether people are tired, hot, fighting infection or just feeling ‘under the weather’. Here you can find information about some of the more common symptoms. Most people will only experience a small number of these. The combination, severity and frequency will be different for everyone.  Outside influences can exacerbate symptoms – hot weather may make fatigue worse and an infection can cause a temporary worsening of existing symptoms, or give rise to a symptom previously not experienced. New symptoms may not always be down to your MS. It is important to remember that not every ache and pain is connected to MS and, if a new symptom persists, you should seek medical advice. In multiple sclerosis, the protective covering of the central nervous system – myelin – is attacked and damaged, causing interruption to the usual flow of impulses along nerve fibres. Because this damage occurs at various sites, the symptoms each person experiences can vary enormously. These areas of damaged myelin are referred to as ‘lesions’ or ‘plaques’. Symptoms can come and go; some are much more responsive to treatment and others can be more difficult to manage. Sometimes damage is temporary and the body is able to make a partial repair but at other times the damage is more severe and becomes permanent. Most symptoms can be treated. In some people with MS, problems with balance can cause unsteadiness, clumsiness, and affect limb movement and posture. Areas of the brain involved in balance and movement can be affected by the inflammation associated with MS. Messages from the brain to the body can be disrupted, resulting in a loss of coordination. Muscle spasms, fatigue, tremor, numbness and neuropathic pain in the legs can also cause balance problems, as walking becomes more tentative. See the relevant sections below for more information on these. Once these are managed any balance issue may be eased. For some people, problems with balance are short-term, for others they may last longer. There are no specific medications for balance. However, it is important to make sure that any balance issues are not being caused by something else. For example, relating to another symptom or an inner ear infection. If muscle weakness is affecting you, your MS nurse can refer you to a neuro-physiotherapist who can develop an exercise programme to assist you in addressing this. Bladder problems are one of the most common symptoms in MS. In fact, problems with the bladder are common, whether a person has MS, or not. There is no need to feel embarrassed, and talking to your GP and MS nurse, is the first step to addressing this symptom. Urgency – the need to ‘go’ with little or no warning Frequency – having to ‘go’ more than eight times per day or hesitancy Retention – you can empty the bladder, but have a feeling of incompletion Many people with MS will experience bowel problems to some degree – constipation and difficulties emptying the bowel are the most common. The other problem area is incontinence and lack of control over the bowel opening. Again, a referral to a continence advisor will help to find ways in which to deal with problems in all these areas. Many people experience a combination of these symptoms. There are medications and treatments available to help with bladder issues (2). Your GP and MS nurse can also refer you to a continence advisor (3) to help you find ways to deal with bladder problems. Almost half of people with MS will have cognitive problems (4). These will range from fairly mild on a day-to-day basis to an increased worsening during a relapse. Initially, people may not realise that their cognitive problems are associated with their MS. The most common problems affect memory, information processing, problem solving, word-finding and concentration.  There are a number of things you can do to manage these such as Avoiding jobs which need concentration when fatigued or stressed Speak to your MS nurse about whether you would benefit from such a referral.  Symptoms can become more pronounced if you are tired, upset or anxious and sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between cognition, depression and fatigue. It is important you talk to your GP and MS nurse about what you are experiencing. The National Institute of Care Excellence (NICE) stated in their guidelines for the management of MS (5), that people with persistent memory or cognitive problems are considered for referral to both an occupational therapist and neuropsychologist to assess and manage these symptoms. Fatigue is more than tiredness, it is a feeling of complete exhaustion and a common symptom of MS. It is an invisible symptom that is difficult to describe and whilst not obvious to other people, it can be quite difficult to manage. There are a number of ways in which people learn to live with their fatigue and find ways to manage it effectively. ‘Energy is a limited resource. Manage your use of it carefully. One big effort in a day is enough – two is too many and three is setting yourself up to fail.’ There are a number of ways in which people manage their fatigue (5). Initially, other things should be considered to make sure fatigue isn’t being caused by anxiety, depression, anaemia, thyroid disease, or even difficulties with sleeping. Sometimes a drug called amantadine may help ease symptoms of fatigue. Other things that may help are gentle exercise like yoga, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness. All of which are suggested in the NICE guidelines section on easing the symptoms of MS (5). Some MS therapy centres offer fatigue management courses. It is worth asking your GP or MS nurse if this is something offered within your hospital trust. ‘Being well rested can make a huge difference to overall wellness – listen to your body!’ Foot drop is a symptom experienced by some people with MS and is caused by a weakness in the ankle that causes the foot to drag along the ground or hang down when walking. People who experience foot drop are more vulnerable to tripping and falling. Strengthening exercises as recommended by a physiotherapist The use of an ankle splint to hold the foot in a rigid position. A referral to an orthotist would be required Using functional electrical stimulation (FES). FES uses small electrodes either stuck to the surface of the skin or implanted under the skin, to deliver small electrical impulses to activate the muscles and support the foot’s movement into a more natural position for walking (6). The FES device is activated by a pressure sensor worn in the shoe. A physiotherapist referral would be required Some people with MS experience a temporary worsening of symptoms in heat (7) – for example during warm weather, or while taking a bath. You might feel fatigued, or experience an increase in pain, or feel your cognitive symptoms are worse. A change in body temperature can also give rise to Uhthoff’s Sign – causing blurred vision. See the ‘Sensory’ section for more details. Although uncomfortable, such symptoms are temporary and will resolve when the body is cooled down. If you are sensitive to heat, there are a number of strategies to help keep cool in hot weather including taking regular cold drinks, wrapping a damp towel around your neck, and putting ice in a tray of water in front of a fan to create an air-conditioning effect. Loss of mobility is defined as any limitation of movement caused by different factors, such as lack of motor coordination, muscle weakness, spasticity (muscular rigidity and spasms), balance problems and fatigue, all of which are associated with MS. Mobility difficulties can cause general problems with day to day living and make tasks such as getting in and out of a car and going up and down stairs difficult and frustrating. ‘Take the advice from the experts, I was too stubborn to use my sticks so I had loads of falls.’ Depending on what may be attributing to the mobility issue, there may be various treatments available, from spasticity medications and fatigue management, to seeing a physiotherapist and learning about exercises and stretches that may help. Fampridine was licensed to help improve walking speed, but is not recommended in the 2014 NICE guidelines for the treatment of MS (5) as it was found to not be a cost effective treatment. It can be paid for privately with a private prescription that needs to be obtained from a neurologist. Pain is often described as a stabbing, burning, tingling or pins and needles feeling. It’s subjective and no two people will experience it in the same way. There are two main types of pain that can occur – neuropathic and musculoskeletal. If the cause of the pain is found to be neuropathic, medication may be prescribed. If it’s musculoskeletal you may be referred to a physiotherapist. Pain can be challenging to manage, but there are many medications, therapies and management strategies. ‘Mindfulness helps maintain equanimity in the face of fluctuating symptoms and the uncertainties of MS.’ The impairment of sensory perception includes the loss of feeling in limbs and other areas. The sensations can include tingling, a crawling feeling over the skin, numbness or tightness, and sometimes pain. The medical term for these uncomfortable abnormal sensations is dysesthesia or paresthesia. These feelings are classed as neuropathic pain symptoms. Another sensory symptom is the feeling of an ‘electrical rush’ radiating from the neck and down the spine, when the head is flexed towards the chest. This is known as Lhermitte’s Sign and was named after the French neurologist who first described it in 1924. Lhermitte’s Sign is thought to be a signal that the nerves are inflamed and flexing the head causes this transient feeling. Lhermitte’s Sign is associated with MS, sometimes even before diagnosis, but is not sufficient in itself to confirm a diagnosis of MS as it is associated with other conditions. It is important to talk to your GP if you are experiencing this sensory symptom to rule out any other causes, such as injury to the neck. Another sensory symptom associated with heat fatigue is Uhthoff’s Phenomenon or Uhthoff’s Sign. This is a temporary worsening of symptoms – often visual disturbances, but sometimes motor or sensory symptoms - caused by a rise in body temperature, for example while exercising or taking a hot bath. The visual symptoms may present as double vision, a blurring of vision, and loss of colour vision or a ‘greying-out’ of vision. The symptom takes its name from Wilhelm Uhthoff, a German ophthalmologist, who first described this symptom in 1890.  Uhthoff’s Sign can be worrying, but if it happens stop exercising or move away from the heat source, and cool the body down with a cold drink or fan. Once you are at normal body temperature, Uhthoff’s sign will slowly abate. Banding is a sensory symptom where it feels as if there is a tight elastic band around the ribs, or one side of the torso. Sometimes it is called the ‘MS hug’, although it can also affect feet and hands, as if you are wearing gloves or socks. If you experience tightness across the chest, contact your GP. Banding associated with MS can be treated with pain medication and, although uncomfortable, most people find it will pass without needing treatment. Some people find that wearing tight clothing, such as a sports vest or elasticated gloves or socks, actually helps alleviate the discomfort. Be careful to ensure you are not restricting your blood circulation. Speech and swallowing disorders can arise as a symptom of MS for some people. Speech disorders include dysarthria – slurring of speech due to weakness or lack of coordination in the muscles used in speech and dysphagia – swallowing difficulties. Difficulties with speech can develop at any stage. However, they are more common in the later stages of the condition. Studies have found that around a third of people with MS experience swallowing difficulties to some degree (8). This can be caused by damage affecting the coordination of the various muscles involved in swallowing. The result can be difficulty chewing or episodes of coughing or choking when eating and drinking. If swallowing problems are more advanced and eating is putting you at risk, nutrition can be provided through a procedure called percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). A PEG is a feeding method whereby a small tube is inserted directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall. This helps to ensure sufficient nutritional intake and reduces the risk of aspiration, where food can get into the lungs, causing chest infections. If you are experiencing these symptoms, contact your MS nurse who can refer you to a speech and language therapist. Spasticity is a symptom where the signals from the brain are interrupted and the muscle remains in its shortened, contracted state. This causes the affected muscle to feel stiff or tight and to be resistant to movement. The degree of spasticity will vary from person to person and can greatly impact on many activities. Nevertheless, spasticity can be successfully managed. Sometimes spasticity is triggered by infections or bladder and bowel problems. Left untreated, spasticity can lead to complications such as frozen or immobilised joints and pressure sores. There are many ways in which spasticity can be alleviated (5). Drug treatment may be offered by your medical team. The most commonly prescribed are baclofen, dantrolene and tizanidine. They all help to relax the muscles. In some cases people may find the drugs are not effective, or cause unwanted side effects. The NICE Guidelines (5) suggest being referred to a specialist spasticity service for further treatment. This could include seeing a physiotherapist and/or occupational therapist for specific exercises and stretches which may help. In some cases where the drug treatments may not be effective, Botox may be considered. Botox is injected directly into the affected muscle to help reduce the tightness caused by spasticity. Sativex is a cannabis based spray that may help reduce spasticity. It is not generally available on the NHS. For more detailed information, see our Choices booklet, . Spasms are different to spasticity in that, although they involve similar muscle contractions they can come on very suddenly, and relax just as suddenly. Most spasms occur in the legs and arms, and less commonly the throat. Spasms can be painful and lead to interrupted sleep. The same drug treatments for spasticity are offered to help reduce spasm. An MS nurse with a holistic perspective has written about other suggested ways in which spasms can be managed. They are exercise, magnesium (either by tablet/spray/powder, or by rubbing directly into the skin), CBD oil and TENS machine (9). Many people with MS use other complementary therapies to help manage spasm too. A combination approach to treating spasms is often a more preferred option. ‘Do regular exercise (even when you don’t feel like it) it can be really helpful for many symptoms like stiffness and fatigue.’ Many people with MS may experience tremor in some way. There are different types of tremor; for some it may be very mild and only noticeable by the individual. For others it may be difficult to manage and incredibly disabling. Intention tremor is the most commonly experienced type. This is involuntary and a movement that is uncontrolled. Intention tremor in the upper limbs often worsens when reaching for an object. This can be exacerbated by stress and also fatigue. For mild tremor, adjustments in posture such as holding an arm closer to your body when moving a cup to your mouth, can help with the stability of the movement. Your MS nurse or GP can refer you to an occupational therapist who can offer practical advice in managing tremor – perhaps suggesting aids or appliances which can help, such as cups with easy-grip handles. A physiotherapist can also set up an exercise programme to increase strength in muscles which are weaker and may be contributing to the tremor’s severity. There are some drug therapies but these often only provide minor benefit. Sometimes the beta blocker, propranolol can have some effect, whilst in other cases, Botox has been shown to reduce head tremors. There are several problems that can affect the vision of people with MS. The most common symptom is optic neuritis – inflammation of the optic nerve, which is also one of the more common first symptoms that can lead to a diagnosis of MS. Optic neuritis is sometimes treated with steroids to help reduce the inflammation. Diplopia (double vision) – Often an early symptom of MS but can also occur as part of a relapse of MS where steroids may help Nystagmus – rhythmical oscillations of the eye ball which sometimes goes unnoticed by the person, but is obvious to others. A difficult symptom to treat but occasionally the drugs gabapentin and memantine may be offered Sometimes a temporary onset, or worsening of symptoms is actually a relapse. It can often be difficult to determine if you are having a relapse. It is important to let your GP and MS nurse know if you think you are experiencing a change in symptoms so they can determine if it is a clinical relapse and therefore if treatment is required. According to the NICE guidelines (5) a relapse can be diagnosed by a GP or neurologist if, ‘The person with MS has developed new symptoms or has a worsening of existing symptoms, and these symptoms have lasted for more than 24 hours in the absence of infection or any other cause after a stable period of a least one month.’ From multiple sclerosis symptoms, treatments and more to living life with MS, our Choices booklets cover a wide range of topics.

e8dbd2a7-97d3-4019-895c-68d0e335f5dc,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS can affect many aspects of daily family life, particularly if a person has symptoms such as fatigue, eyesight problems and cognitive changes. Couples may find that they have to review their roles within the household and this can be difficult. For example, a family with two incomes may have to learn to cope on one, or one of the partners may have to take on extra responsibilities for running the home or caring for children. It is estimated that as many as half of people with MS experience mild cognitive problems. Because cognitive difficulties in MS are “invisible” symptoms, family members may misinterpret behaviours or reactions on the part of the person with MS. Difficulties with memory, problem solving and concentration may be interpreted as the family member not caring or not listening, being uninterested or unwilling to cooperate. Correct information can be the key to helping families understand and cope with cognitive problems. Fatigue is another misunderstood invisible symptom of MS. Often a family member with MS appears to lack motivation when, in fact, the person is experiencing MS fatigue, a type of tiredness or exhaustion that is a symptom of the disease. When the family has a clear understanding of fatigue and its impact on the person’s ability to function, they may be more keen to help with household tasks, reconsider family activities that may be strenuous for the member with MS, and, in general, re-organise the house and habits of the family in away that helps the person with MS conserve energy. It is important for the family to understand the importance of energy conservation strategies that can help the person with MS have more energy to spend with the family. Each member of a family has his or her own coping style. On finding out that a family member has MS, some people look for as much information about the disease as they can find and perhaps prefer to talk to others about their experience with MS. Others may deal with news of the diagnosis by keeping busy with other activities in order to avoid thinking about MS. Each person brings into the “MS experience” his or her own way of coping. Different coping styles within the same family can be complementary or contradictory. Contradictory coping styles may lead to conflict within the family. Family members should be encouraged to cope with MS in their own individual styles, while respecting the coping styles of other members. However, communication is key, and if a family traditionally has dealt with problems by ignoring them, assigning blame or using some other, ineffective coping style, the family’s way of confronting MS will be the same, at least without the help of a family counsellor or psychologist. MS can add stress to a relationship. The unpredictability and progressive nature of the disease, the changes and sacrifices that might be required and the impact of some symptoms are all obstacles that make it difficult for both the person with MS and their partner to cope. It may be useful for a couple to seek help from a counsellor. MS affects every member of the family. Learning about the disease and its possible effect on the family can help people face challenges as they arise. Families that are informed about the different available can choose those that best suit their needs and lifestyle.

2df61b98-ca95-42d3-9d42-570d79d3868d,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS can affect many aspects of daily family life, particularly if a person has symptoms such as fatigue, eyesight problems and cognitive changes. Couples may find that they have to review their roles within the household and this can be difficult. For example, a family with two incomes may have to learn to cope on one, or one of the partners may have to take on extra responsibilities for running the home or caring for children. It is estimated that as many as half of people with MS experience mild cognitive problems. Because cognitive difficulties in MS are “invisible” symptoms, family members may misinterpret behaviours or reactions on the part of the person with MS. Difficulties with memory, problem solving and concentration may be interpreted as the family member not caring or not listening, being uninterested or unwilling to cooperate. Correct information can be the key to helping families understand and cope with cognitive problems. Fatigue is another misunderstood invisible symptom of MS. Often a family member with MS appears to lack motivation when, in fact, the person is experiencing MS fatigue, a type of tiredness or exhaustion that is a symptom of the disease. When the family has a clear understanding of fatigue and its impact on the person’s ability to function, they may be more keen to help with household tasks, reconsider family activities that may be strenuous for the member with MS, and, in general, re-organise the house and habits of the family in away that helps the person with MS conserve energy. It is important for the family to understand the importance of energy conservation strategies that can help the person with MS have more energy to spend with the family. Each member of a family has his or her own coping style. On finding out that a family member has MS, some people look for as much information about the disease as they can find and perhaps prefer to talk to others about their experience with MS. Others may deal with news of the diagnosis by keeping busy with other activities in order to avoid thinking about MS. Each person brings into the “MS experience” his or her own way of coping. Different coping styles within the same family can be complementary or contradictory. Contradictory coping styles may lead to conflict within the family. Family members should be encouraged to cope with MS in their own individual styles, while respecting the coping styles of other members. However, communication is key, and if a family traditionally has dealt with problems by ignoring them, assigning blame or using some other, ineffective coping style, the family’s way of confronting MS will be the same, at least without the help of a family counsellor or psychologist. MS can add stress to a relationship. The unpredictability and progressive nature of the disease, the changes and sacrifices that might be required and the impact of some symptoms are all obstacles that make it difficult for both the person with MS and their partner to cope. It may be useful for a couple to seek help from a counsellor. MS affects every member of the family. Learning about the disease and its possible effect on the family can help people face challenges as they arise.

I was diagnosed with MS in 1998, when I was 26. My first symptom was loss of dexterity in my hands. I could not write, brush my teeth or use cutlery. I had to defer my university exams. I also lost control of my bladder. It took a while to get an MS diagnosis, but I finally saw a neurologist and had an MRI and steroid treatment, which made my hands and bladder better. My initial reaction to being diagnosed with MS was shock and denial, but slowly I have come to accept it. Recent relapses have affected my bladder and the strength in my legs, and now I cannot walk properly. I also have to think carefully before I do something and make sure I do it slowly and carefully. Many people with MS here have vision problems. There should be more visual aids and larger print fonts available to help with this. There is also a shortage of accessible facilities so we need to raise awareness of MS among the public. My advice to other people with MS is to try to be positive.

dd12064f-0023-4671-951d-6ba43cf7735f,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing, can occur in people with MS. While more frequent in advanced disease, it can occur at any time. Both chewing and swallowing require a number of muscles in the mouth and throat to work in a coordinated way. In MS, the nerves that control these muscles can become damaged causing weakness and incoordination that can provoke swallowing problems. In addition, numbness of the mouth and throat can occur that can make chewing and swallowing difficult. MS may affect swallowing in a number of ways by causing difficulty managing solids or liquids, frequent throat clearing during eating or drinking, a feeling that food is stuck in the throat, or coughing or a choking sensation when eating or drinking. Sometimes medications prescribed for other symptoms or conditions can cause dryness of the mouth which can make swallowing – particularly dry or crumbly foods difficult. Swallowing problems are important to recognize early. When swallowing problems persist or worsen there is a risk of aspiration – which means food or fluids getting into the lungs – and this is a serious problem. Dysphagia is initially diagnosed by a careful history and neurologic examination of the tongue and swallowing muscles. A special imaging procedure called a modified barium swallow can be used to evaluate a person’s ability to chew and swallow solids and liquids. In this test, the person eats and drinks a small quantity of barium, which makes the structures of the mouth, throat, and esophagus visible on x-ray. The movement of these structures is recorded on videotape by a videofluoroscope as the person eats or drinks foods of varying consistencies — thin liquid, thick liquid and solid. The precise location and manner of a swallowing defect can then be identified, and treatment prescribed. A speech/language pathologist is the professional who diagnoses and treats dysphagia. Treatment typically consists of strategies for safer eating and swallowing, dietary changes, exercises or stimulation designed to improve swallowing.  Here are a few related topics that may interest you Clinical Bulletin - Swallowing Disorders and Their Management (.pdf) Clinical Bulletin - Swallowing Disorders and Their Management (.pdf) Our MS Navigators help identify solutions and provide access to the resources you are looking for.

553c405e-6e0f-4353-a68a-5bcf635893c4,"Cover Story: Cognitive Issues with Multiple Sclerosis: Research, Strategies and Support Cover Story: Cognitive Issues with Multiple Sclerosis: Research, Strategies and Support By Susan Wells Courtney Reviewed by Jack Burks, MD Cognitive changes with multiple sclerosis (MS) are fairly common. Most studies state that approximately 50 percent of individuals with MS may have some type of cognitive dysfunction, although some estimates are as high as 60 or even 70 percent. Individuals with MS who experience cognitive issues may have trouble with functions such as attention, information-processing speed, executive functions (decision making), episodic memory, and visuospatial abilities. These deficits can affect several activities of daily living, including employment, driving, social integration, and adherence to medication regimens. Concentration and attention shifting are other examples of cognition impairments observed with MS. The study of cognitive changes with MS is both extensive and varied, yet still in its early stages. A search of peer-reviewed articles reveals findings from hundreds of recent trials within the past few years, conducted in countries all over the world, and covering a wide range of objectives – from evaluating assessment tools and looking at cognition’s impact on quality of life, to identifying potential causes and determining the effectiveness of certain treatment strategies. Why is the study of cognition in MS so complex? This is because so many variables exist with this symptom and its manifestations. For example, cognitive changes can be a difficult area to measure and to compare with controls. Researchers are looking for the optimal tests to best evaluate the presence, type, and severity of cognitive deficits in different individuals with MS. The variety of tests used in these trials is impressive; for example, these may include questionnaires, dual-task evaluations, measures of eye movements, computerized tests of cognitive function, an array of physical, mental, and emotional scales, several types of neuroimaging, and more. Acclaimed author Jeffrey N. Gingold, writer of Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Second Edition (Demos Health, 2011) and Mental Sharpening Stones (Demos Health, 2008), has been able to put into words exactly what it feels like to experience a sudden lapse in cognition, where familiar surroundings are no longer familiar, and wellversed words cannot be found. In Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Second Edition, Mr. Gingold talks about his work as a successful lawyer who is suddenly faced with a host of cognitive challenges, some of which arise at the most inopportune of times. At right are excerpts from the Preface of this book, touching briefly on his experience with cognitive issues from MS. Another book written by Mr. Gingold, , also provides detailed descriptions of sudden lapses in cognition. It goes on to give valuable direction and tips for managing this symptom. Other books are available on the topic of cognition and MS, including Multiple Sclerosis: Understanding the Cognitive Challenges, which is an excellent resource written by Nicholas LaRocca, PhD and Rosalind Kalb, PhD (Demos Medical Publishing, 2006). All three of these books, as well as others, may be borrowed at no charge from MSAA’s Lending Library.

Would you be able and willing to explain it to your doctor? To your friends and family? Your spouse? When I was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1996, I envisioned being physically disabled, relegated to spending family time and a successful legal career in a permanently seated position. I never anticipated that MS would also include an invisible disability, a ‘mental wheelchair’ that would confound my recollection and distort my rational presence of mind, turning court appearances and the routine moments of life into mental quicksand.” “Without warning, many people with MS are suddenly faced with an inability to process routine thoughts. Their decision making may be stonewalled, befuddling simple conversations into a word-finding struggle. Others may lose their bearings in their own backyard or kitchen, or suddenly the face of a spouse or friend will appear unfamiliar. Then, the shroud over their memory recall lifts, defying explanation, and leaving no trace of the bait and switch. The individual’s cognitive functions have been compromised and often go undiagnosed, creating a deep chasm of unseen disability.” – Jeffrey N. Gingold, Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Second Edition Even with all of these tools, many questions still remain. For instance, when an individual with cognitive issues provides self-reported evaluations, are these answers valid? The findings from a study in France suggest that cognitive dysfunction did not compromise the reliability or validity of one’s responses on quality of life questionnaires, but these types of issues need to be considered when conducting studies on the effects of cognitive problems. Further complicating this issue is the fact that medications used for symptom management may also affect cognition as a side effect, and this too must be included in the equation. Neuroimaging is vital in determining what specific areas of the brain may be affected by MS to cause cognitive problems, as well as parts of the brain that may compensate for areas that are no longer conducting nerve impulses efficiently. Many forms of imaging technology are used for this purpose and can provide important data to researchers, enabling them to theorize the different areas of the brain that may impact cognition. Some of these types of tests are used to observe the activity in parts of the brain while a patient performs a task, and these data may be compared to someone without cognitive issues performing the same task. Additionally, the type or stage of MS can exhibit different types and degrees of cognitive changes. Researchers are studying both relapsing and progressive forms of MS, as well as individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and pediatric MS. Studies are also being conducted to determine if other symptoms may impact cognition, such as depression and other changes in mood, fatigue, poor sleep, and more. And perhaps the biggest variable in evaluating cognitive issues in MS is the day-to-day variations in symptoms as well as during times of exacerbations or pseudo-exacerbations. Demographics are another area of interest, and in this category, gender may even play a role. A Spanish study found that gender may have an impact on cognitive performance, and in this instance, found that males with MS exhibited poorer cognitive performance, largely in terms of verbal auditory memory. However, a study in Finland found that male patients with severe attentional deficits benefited more from neuropsychological intervention, as compared to females in the study. Much remains to be learned about this challenging symptom, and as illustrated in this example, a variety of outcomes may be derived from this research. As researchers delve further into the effects of cognitive issues in MS and look to find the causes, another important area of study is that which evaluates the effectiveness of potential treatments. Different forms of exercise as well as various types of cognitive training/ neuro–psychological rehabilitation are two areas of potential treatments that are being studied closely. Many trials are also underway to look at the effectiveness of the different approved and experimental disease-modifying therapies in delaying, improving, or preventing cognitive symptoms. Other treatments, such as fampridine, statins, and vitamin A, are now including changes in cognition among their study endpoints. The many variables mentioned above are just examples of the great complexity involved with learning about and treating cognitive dysfunction in MS. In the pages to follow, this article will provide excerpts from published studies from around the world, aimed at evaluating this challenging symptom and its potential causes, along with various treatment strategies. Readers may also learn about current studies and hear from two professionals who work closely with individuals experiencing cognitive issues from MS. Changes in the Brain That May Lead to Cognitive Problems What leads to cognitive problems in MS? Changes in the brain caused by damage to the myelin and axons (nerves in the brain) are the primary cause of cognitive dysfunction in MS. Research is ongoing to identify the exact locations of damage that cause cognition issues in individuals with MS. Additionally, damage to different locations of the brain affect different types of cognitive function, such as attention, information-processing speed, executive function, and memory, to name a few. The hope is that through such studies, treatments may eventually be designed to target these areas and minimize or prevent any effects that MS may have on cognition. The term “cognition” refers to a group of mental processes such as information processing, language, memory, visual perception/spatial skills, calculation skills, and executive functions (LaRocca, Sorenson and Fischer, 2000). These may be described as follows: Information-processing skills affect our ability to focus, maintain, and shift our attention from one thing to another without losing track of what we were doing, as well as managing incoming information quickly. Language refers to the ability to understand and use language appropriately in daily situations. Memory is a complex set of skills that involve learning, storage of information, and the ability to retrieve that information on demand. Visual perceptual/spatial skills allow us to do things such as recognize objects, draw, assemble things, and find our way around. Performing simple and complex math skills are involved in calculation abilities. Executive-functioning abilities enable us to get through our day by overseeing and coordinating tasks such as organization, planning, sequencing, problem solving, judgment, reasoning, monitoring our own behavior, etc. The most commonly affected cognitive processes in MS are speed-of-information processing, memory, and executive functions. Other domains of cognition can also be affected depending on where lesions are located. However, rarely are all domains of cognition impacted by MS. These are structures at the base of the brain composed of nerve cells; they are responsible for body movements and coordination. They also function as a relay center for sensory impulses to the cerebral cortex. Damage in this area may cause cognitive problems. A wasting or decrease in size of part of the brain because of disease, such as MS. Brain structure connecting the cerebrum pathways to the spinal cord, which leads to nerves in the arms and legs. It also controls vital functions, movement, sensation, and nerves supplying the head and neck. The cerebellum is at the base and the back of the brain. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance. This is the outer gray matter of the cerebrum, where many of the higher functions, such as volition, consciousness, conceptualization, motor activity, speech, and sensation, are carried out. This gray matter is mainly composed of nerve cells. This is the large, top portion of the brain that is divided into four lobes and is joined at the bottom by the corpus callosum. It controls and integrates motor, sensory, and higher mental functions, such as thought, reason, emotion, and memory. The four sections of lobes that make up the cerebrum are: The frontal lobes that are responsible for problem solving, judgment, and motor function. The parietal lobes that manage sensation, handwriting, and body position. The temporal lobes, including the hippocampus and limbic system, are involved with memory and hearing. The occipital lobes that contain the brain’s visual processing system. Part of the cerebrum, this is a plate of nerve fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, except for most of the temporal lobes. Areas of the nervous system composed mostly of myelinated nerve fibers (those having myelin sheaths) that conduct nerve impulses. Please note that portions of the information appearing in this article are described in “Cognition, Cognitive Dysfunction, and Cognitive Rehabilitation in Multiple Sclerosis,” written by Pepping M, et al, Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am 24 (2013) 663-672. Both acute inflammatory demyelination and axonal degeneration are thought to be the primary causes of MS-related disability. Although MS is often considered to be a disorder affecting only subcortical white matter, considerable evidence has shown that cortical demyelination can also occur, even at early stages of disease. Since both subcortical and cortical brain regions appear to be affected, this indicates that the nature of MS is diffuse (spread over a wide area), and may explain why a widespread set of cognitive issues are possible. What is notable about this data is the fact that MS damage leading to disability was at one time thought to be limited to white matter. The axons (nerves in the brain) found in white matter are insulated by myelin, which is the primary target of MS damage. However, when MS damage extends to the gray matter – consisting of dense nerve cells and myelin that is less apparent – additional disability, including cognition, can be affected. Gray matter damage is usually more widespread than the more well-defined white-matter lesions. This is why damage going beyond the white matter and extending into the gray matter is often referred to as “diffuse.” According to the authors of this article, despite the potential for diffuse brain involvement, MS lesions tend to locate in white matter, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. White-matter lesion load (or burden), the location of the lesions, and the amount of global or regional brain atrophy – which is the shrinking or reduction in brain volume – are of greatest interest in the study of cognitive dysfunction in MS. To follow are some examples of MS damage and the type of cognitive functions that they affect: Lesion load in areas near the cortex may cause problems with memory MS damage in the frontal lobe can affect executive function (which includes judgement and problem solving) Global and regional brain atrophy is particularly associated with cognitive dysfunction Additionally, in some studies, brain atrophy (reduction in tissue) was found to contribute more to cognitive impairment than the degree of lesion load. Other examples of damage that appear to affect cognitive function include: The width of the third ventricle, which was more highly associated with cognitive dysfunction than whole-brain (overall) atrophy A central role of the thalamus is to act as a relay station for the transmission of information between different areas of the brain; this could explain why atrophy in these areas has significant effects on key frontal-subcortical functions, which include thought and memory In some studies, cognitive impairment and atrophy of the thalamus were particularly linked to men – although the reason for this is not known To follow are a few brief findings from recent studies, which suggest that different areas of the brain may to play a role in cognitive symptoms with MS. As readers can see, researchers have differing opinions as to what areas or factors have the greatest impact on cognitive functioning. These reports are just a sampling of the many studies that have been published within the past few years. A study from Buffalo, New York states that there is a well-established correlation between and cognitive dysfunction in MS. The study’s findings also suggest that may play a role in MS cognitive decline. An international study reports that changes in the , are related to mobility and cognitive impairment. A study from Cleveland, Ohio indicates that in patients with MS, hippocampal volume (the is part of the temperal lobe in the cerebral cortex) was related to reduced memory and information-processing speed. These results highlight the role of the hippocampus in cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS and suggest that measures of hippocampal atrophy could be used to capture aspects of disease progression. A study in Switzerland indicates that can contribute to disability, including cognitive impairment in MS. Researchers in the United Kingdom linked , an excitatory neurotransmitter, with memory problems. Researchers in Canada report that they investigated the association between cognitive impairment and dysfunction in secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis. Other Factors that May Play a Role in Cognitive Problems in MS Other factors may be involved with the cognitive symptoms of MS. To follow is a listing of some of these factors that have been hypothesized or implicated in recent studies. From a study conducted in several countries, “While cognition can be affected during sensorimotor multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses, the relevance of isolated cognitive relapses (ICRs, i.e., those occurring in absence of new sensorimotor symptoms) remain poorly characterized. Here, we decided to explore the relationship between ICR, subjective evaluation of cognitive performance and long-term cognitive decline in a group of subjects with relapsing-remitting MS… Subjects who presented with an ICR [at six months into the study] presented with a significantly reduced cognitive performance at the follow-up evaluations compared with patients without ICR.” Researchers in Kansas City reported that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly use a variety of medications to slow disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and treat comorbid conditions. The use of multiple medications (polypharmacy) can be associated with additional fatigue and memory problems. The investigators recommend that patients and healthcare professionals weigh the risks and the benefits of using multiple medications at one time, given the potential for a possible increase in fatigue and cognitive issues. Investigators in Istanbul, Turkey explain, “According to the results of our study, heavy smokers had increased cognitive impairment when compared to nonsmokers. Extensive studies are necessary to further elucidate the relationship between smoking and cognitive impairment in MS patients.” Italian researchers suggest that the potential relationship with bacteria in the GI tracts and their potential influence on the immune system in neurological disease (such as MS), with an impact on pain and cognition. Mutual impact of gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) and central nervous system (CNS) functions has been recognized since the mid-twentieth century. They studied how the commensal gut microbiota influences systemic immune response in some neurological disorders, highlighting its impact on pain and cognition in multiple sclerosis. To follow are some recently reported study findings, helping to provide a broader understanding of the impact and variables in cognitive dysfunction as a symptom of MS, as well as help to identify the most useful methods of assessment. To follow are some recently reported study findings, helping to provide a broader understanding of the impact and variables in cognitive dysfunction as a symptom of MS, as well as help to identify the most useful methods of assessment. A German study explains, “Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and age-and gender-matched healthy individuals were tested with common neuropsychological tests and a , whereby a target stimulus has to be detected amongst distracting stimuli on a touch screen… [The researchers concluded that] visual search is a promising instrument for the assessment of cognitive functions and potentially cognitive changes in patients with multiple sclerosis thanks to its good discriminatory power and insusceptibility to practice effects.” Cognitive rehabilitation (discussed later) encourages people with cognitive issues to stay active and employ helpful strategies. These strategies include planning ahead and using written notes – both for memory prompts and for increased organization. In Kansas City, Missouri, researchers explain, “Eye movement difficulties in multiple sclerosis (MS) are common and may influence performance on cognitive tests… [Two] studies examined associations between a new measure of and visual/nonvisual cognitive tests. In both studies, slower eye movements were significantly associated with poorer performance on cognitive tests… Pending further research, the Speedy Eyes Test [SET], a brief, inexpensive, and nontechnical measure of speedy eye movement, may serve as a visual/oculomotor indicator of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.” The University of Illinois report that performing a cognitive task, while walking, results in a reduction of walking performance among persons with MS. Any loss in function that occurs because of doing two tasks at one time is referred to as dual-task cost, or DTC. Study investigators examined walking performance, cognitive processing speed, and symptoms of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain as correlates of DTC of walking in MS. There were significant and large declines in gait performance with the addition of a cognitive task for velocity, cadence, and step length. Walking performance might be a target of interventions for reducing the DTC of walking in MS. As noted earlier in this article, at least 50 percent of individuals with MS experience changes in cognition. This is often a challenging symptom that can impact one’s life in many ways. For instance, some individuals with cognitive issues may reduce or discontinue their participation in outside activities, they may become less socially active, and employment is often affected. At home, problems with cognition can also affect one’s ability to perform everyday activities, as routine duties may take longer to complete, things may be forgotten, and stress may arise over these changes. Other symptoms of MS, such as fatigue and depression, may have a negative impact on cognition as well. Treatment options and studies into potential new treatments are of constant interest and concern to the MS community. In this section, the possible benefits of exercise, medications, and cognitive rehabilitation are discussed. Common Questions and Answers Regarding Cognitive Issues In MS is one of MSAA’s Client Services Specialists. When asked about cognition as a symptom of MS, she talked about the experiences she has had with callers to MSAA’s Helpline. First, Mrs. Blair provided examples of client calls and inquiries that she often receives in regards to this symptom. Common questions include: Clients may report forgetfulness, not thinking as clearly or quickly as they once did, feelings of being overwhelmed, and not knowing if this is a symptom caused by their MS. Clients ask what they can do about these symptoms and who they can see for it. They want to know if this is something that will occur in the future. Next, Mrs. Blair provided the types of information that she and other Client Services Specialists provide in response to these inquiries, as follows: – thinking, memory, decision making, and judgment – especially in relation to where the disease is causing damage and inflammation in the brain. Other MS-symptom issues can also affect one’s cognition, and these might include fatigue, problems in sleep management, and depression. The side effects of medication can also have an impact on cognition. Other factors that affect cognition include anemia, infection, and thyroid problems. This does not necessarily mean that every individual with MS will experience this symptom, as everyone’s experience and symptom presentation with MS differs, but it is something that can occur as a challenge in the disease process. Evaluating and considering all factors that could be involved in the appearance and/or worsening of this symptom is important, as other health conditions can occur in conjunction with MS and may be a contributing factor to difficulties in thinking or processing information. Talking to one’s doctor can help to distinguish the cause of these changes. In regard to symptom management and evaluations for cognitive issues, the first step would be to work with his or her neurologist in discussing what these symptoms are, what’s been noticed, what types of changes have occurred, and any other concerns one may have. A neurologist may want to recommend baseline cognitive evaluations and testing, perhaps with the support of a neuropsychologist, who is a specialist focusing on mental processes, behavior, and thinking as they relate to the structure of the brain. This type of doctor can perform different types of testing in regards to one’s current rate of processing thoughts and tasks. This testing can include a series of different tests to evaluate language, memory, organization, and similar types of functions. After an evaluation, the specialist may then recommend and work with a client to create some type of cognitive rehabilitation treatment plan. This would include identifying problem areas and working on strategies for improvement in processing. Among other methods, this can include specific tasks and activities, games, exercise, and those types of things, all tailored to meet the client’s specific needs. Mrs. Blair also notes the possible impact that cognitive issues may have on daily life: Cognitive challenges can interfere with daily tasks, such as household duties and responsibilities. For instance, memory issues and forgetfulness can cause problems when trying to complete chores or errands, making and keeping appointments, staying organized, and performing other daily activities. Cognitive issues can impact one’s employment and job responsibilities, if memory and forgetfulness start to interfere with the completion of tasks. Decision making on the job can also be affected if one’s judgment and executive function are at all compromised. Management strategies may be developed to help someone who is having trouble at work as a result of cognitive problems caused by MS. Asking for accommodations in the workplace, if needed, can be very helpful. Another option is to take advantage of vocational rehabilitation services. These are specific counseling and employment-related services for those with disabilities – to identify areas of need and ways to manage and improve upon this issue. Making lists, using files, or employing other organizational methods that help to keep things in order, both at work and a home, can assist individuals in accomplishing tasks and minimizing the effects of forgetfulness and other cognitive issues. If appropriate and as needed, asking for help to delegate tasks to others can be very helpful as well. This includes having conversations with one’s healthcare team and his or her family or support network to discuss cognitive issues, ways they can be managed, recommendations for treatment, and obstacles that may be modified to accommodate for these changes. Cognitive difficulties can be a very sensitive and complicated issue to discuss with others, but it’s important for individuals with MS and their families to know that they are not alone and there are supports in place to help people cope with this symptom. With or without MS, the positive effects of exercise on cognition are frequently mentioned in the news. The following data provide interesting information on different types of exercise when studied in individuals with MS and their effects on cognitive function. Researchers from an Illinois study explain, “The current study compared the acute effects of moderate-intensity treadmill walking, moderate-intensity cycle ergometry, and guided yoga with those of quiet rest on executive control in 24 persons with relapsing-remitting MS without impaired cognitive processing speed… The present results support treadmill walking as the modality of exercise that might exert the largest beneficial effects on executive control in persons with relapsing-remitting MS without impaired cognitive processing speed. This represents an exciting starting point for delineating the appropriate exercise stimulus (i.e., modality and intensity) for inclusion in a subsequent longitudinal exercise training intervention for improving cognitive performance in this population.” Investigators from Seattle report, “The present study adopted a randomized controlled trial design and examined the effect of a physical activity behavioral intervention on cognitive and walking performance among persons with MS who have mild or moderate disability status… The current study supports physical activity as a promising tool for managing cognitive impairment and impaired walking performance in persons with MS, and suggests that physical activity might have specific effects on cognition and non-specific effects on walking performance in this population.” Research in Seattle has also set out “to determine whether there is an association between improvements in objective measures of physical fitness and performance on cognitive tests in people with multiple sclerosis (MS)… Participants in the physically improved group demonstrated improved performance on measures of executive functioning after 12 weeks of exercise. The results of this study lend support to the hypothesis that change in fitness is associated with improved executive functioning in people with MS.” Canadian researchers have found, “Exercise may have beneficial effects on both well-being and walking ability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise is shown to be neuroprotective in rodents and may also enhance cognitive function in humans. It may, therefore, be particularly useful for MS patients with pronounced neurodegeneration… “Patients with progressive MS and moderate disability were randomized to one of three exercise interventions (arm ergometry, rowing, bicycle ergometry) for 8-10 weeks or a waitlist control group… Significant improvements were seen in aerobic fitness. In addition, exercise improved walking ability, depressive symptoms, fatigue and several domains of cognitive function. This study indicated that aerobic training is feasible and could be beneficial for patients with progressive MS. Larger exercise studies are needed to confirm the effect on cognition.” As discussed in MSAA’s Winter/Spring 2013 issue of , one of the best ways to maintain cognition is to do your best to avoid new lesions by taking a disease-modifying therapy (if you have a relapsing form of MS). A number of studies with these drugs have shown some benefit on protecting cognition. Twelve disease-modifying therapies are now approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsing forms of MS. Please visit MSAA’s website at for specific information on these approved therapies. People with MS and MS clinicians have hoped that medications such as those that help people with Alzheimer’s disease might also benefit people with MS. Some of the Alzheimer’s disease medications work to block the enzyme that breaks down the nerve signal messenger acetylcholine. Although early reports suggested that the medication Aricept® (donepezil) might help cognition in MS, more thorough research has not proven this drug to be of benefit. Additional studies of the Alzheimer’s medications Exelon® (rivastigmine) and Namenda® (memantine HCl) also did not demonstrate a clear benefit. Some side effects may include stomach or bowel problems, mood changes, and urinary difficulty. Others had hoped that the herbal extract ginkgo biloba would be of benefit, however, preliminary studies have not demonstrated a benefit. Many other supplements are often promoted to help memory in the general population, but hard data is very limited even for people without MS. Be sure to discuss any drugs or supplements you may be taking with your healthcare team. Treating fatigue may reduce its effects, but does it help memory? This is a difficult area to study due to the difficulties in measuring and documenting cognitive changes, as well as the subjective nature of fatigue management. Small trials of amantadine (previously Symmetrel®) used for fatigue have not been convincing for cognitive improvement. The medication Provigil® (modafinil) and Nuvigil® (armodafinil) are commonly used “off label” for MS fatigue and have also been used by some with attention disorders. Ampyra® (dalfampridine), studied in the 4-aminopyridine form also did not demonstrate improvement. Management of fatigue by both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic means may be tried by some, and may include occupational therapy for energy-conservation techniques.” Several medications are currently being evaluated for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MS. Many of the approved DMTs have ongoing studies to determine their effectiveness in reducing cognitive challenges. Other medications and supplements are in study phases as well. To view current studies in this area of research and possibly look into participating in a clinical trial, readers may visit and search for “cognition and MS” for a full listing of related studies. This area of work is showing much potential for improvement in cognitive symptoms. Investigators and clinicians are able to address each type of dysfunction with various approaches to help people improve or compensate for any cognitive challenges they may experience. Cognition covers several different areas or patterns of function. In general, these categories include: attention, memory, acquisition and retrieval, information-processing speed, and executive function. The type and severity of cognitive dysfunction that an individual with MS experiences is largely dependent upon lesions occurring in certain regions of the brain, as well as areas of brain atrophy. Both the number of lesions (referred to as lesion load or burden) and atrophy (the shrinking of tissue or decrease in activity) are identified through neuroimaging techniques, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As mentioned earlier, a great deal of research continues to identify the specific areas of the brain that are affected by MS and lead to cognitive problems. Some studies have shown that brain atrophy, both regionally and globally, may contribute more to cognitive issues than the number of lesions. Noting that several areas of the brain may be affected, the effects of MS are thought to be widespread, and as a result, cognitive symptoms may be varied. For this reason, cognitive rehabilitation specialists must conduct an extensive evaluation of their patients prior to and throughout the time they are in cognitive therapy. This enables the specialists to design the most appropriate treatment plans for their clients, and to revise these plans as needed throughout the rehabilitation period. An assessment or evaluation of the individual seeking treatment will include many important details, such as which types of neurocognitive symptoms (such as memory-retrieval problems) and neurobehavioral symptoms (such as reduced awareness and problem-solving issues) he or she is experiencing. Additional details include test data, background information from the patient’s neurologist or other treating physician, and historical information providing details about the individual prior to diagnosis. The cognitive rehabilitation specialist will also note the patient’s reactivity to emotional concerns, as well as other symptoms that may have an impact on cognition (such as fatigue and pain). Identifying one’s abilities and preferences, along with learning about how he or she performs at school or at work, and in social situations, are also important while creating a customized treatment plan. Some of this information may be obtained through the family members and other individuals who are close with the patient. These people can also provide updates, letting the therapist know how the individual is doing in terms of applying the strategies and if any additional issues have been noted. Additional testing may be required to help with the treatment plan. An occupational therapist may assess an individual’s ability to perform activities of daily living. A speech-language pathologist may look for any deficits in areas of communication. Learning what the person with MS is able to do and what problems he or she may have is critical to the initial assessment. Many of the techniques used for cognitive rehabilitation and retraining in MS originated with those used to assist individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). While the two conditions differ in many ways and the severity of symptoms can vary greatly within either disorder, the same theories may be applied to the similar challenges of cognitive dysfunction. Whether the goals are to provide prompts that help with memory, to clear away distractions to increase attention, or to create more structure to improve executive function – or all three, along with many other strategies – these types of treatment plans are vital to improving one’s cognitive performance and ultimately increasing one’s quality of life. Senior Research Scientist, Center for Assistive Technology and Environmental Access at Georgia Tech Member, MSAA Healthcare Advisory Council What type of therapist(s) can assist with the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive issues with MS? “When an individual with MS is experiencing some type of cognitive dysfunction, he or she would most often contact a clinical psychologist, neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, and/or speech-language pathologist.” In general, how often might someone need to see a therapist, and does insurance usually pay for such appointments? “It really depends on the focus of treatment, but most often cognitive rehabilitation works best when people participate on a frequent basis. The challenge in providing services is that it mostly results in few options for insurance coverage. Most insurance companies do not cover cognitive rehab services for people who experience deficits as a result of a non-acute neurological condition, including chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (and others such as congestive heart failure, autism, cerebral palsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post chemotherapy). The research on the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for MS that is used for coverage determination with most of the insurance companies reflects that it is experimental or that it does not have enough evidence to demonstrate medical necessity.” Do you have any personal thoughts or guidance that you would want to give anyone with MS who may be experiencing cognitive issues? “I would recommend for the individual to have a discussion with his or her medical provider first to review the list of medications to determine the impacts these may have on cognitive function. The medical provider can also discuss other potential sources of cognitive issues, such as nutritional deficits, poor sleep habits or sleep disorders, stress, etc. Individuals should be sure to talk with their medical provider before trying any alternative supplement that promises improvement in memory or other cognitive function. People experiencing cognitive issues should still try to maintain social connections and outlets that keep them mentally active and challenge their memory, attention, language, and problem-solving abilities.” Although occasional forgetfulness, difficulties recalling specific names, or losing things is fairly common, real problems with memory and learning can become a huge hurdle in accomplishing tasks, succeeding at school or work, and even accomplishing activities of daily living. For some people with MS, the ability to sift through several ideas and identify the most important ones becomes significantly affected. These individuals may then be greatly challenged to recognize what needs to be remembered and then be able to store this information so it is easily retrievable when details need to be recalled. One of the best methods for improving memory is to take notes; the value of doing so can’t be overstated. Notes should be taken wherever and whenever information needs to be remembered – and this can include doctor appointments, school and work, at home, and while performing various activities such as shopping or attending meetings. The notes should be well-structured and kept in the same location, so they can always be immediately accessed. Developing a system is important to make note-taking a part of the routine, and prompts should be included for both taking and reviewing notes regularly. Using a Day Planner-type of booklet or smartphone is ideal for keeping things organized. Dividing the information into smaller sections and practicing by re-reading and/or reading aloud helps to better store the information and enable one to retrieve the information when needed. When information cannot be processed quickly, many functions such as social interactions and day-to-day activities are affected. Having a conversation can become labored and uncomfortable; trying to follow directions can at times be almost impossible; and having to think of more than one or two concepts at the same time can lead to frustration and confusion. Fortunately, people who experience reduced information-processing speed may take steps to help minimize the effects of this type of dysfunction. Consciously increasing one’s attention on the task, on the person speaking, or on whatever the event may be, while reducing any distractions, are good first steps (strategies for improving attention are noted in the next section). Another helpful tip is to take notes and ask questions – when appropriate – to assist with comprehension and understanding. Additionally, using different forms of communication to reinforce the same information can also assist with speedier comprehension and retrieval. This might include seeing things visually (through attending an event, as well as viewing videos, charts, outlines, etc.), hearing the information presented either in person or on a recording, and written information, which includes asking people to email main points as a follow-up to a lecture or reviewing notes from the event. Without the ability to focus and provide uninterrupted attention, one’s ability to listen, learn, and retain information is immediately compromised. Perhaps the most important strategy for improving attention is to reduce or eliminate any distractions. This may be accomplished by looking at the area where attention is needed and evaluating potential distractions. Whether they consist of sight or sound – necessary steps should be taken to reduce or eliminate these diversions. Examples include cleaning away extra clutter from a room, reducing the number of people present during a gathering, and/or turning off the TV and other electronic devices. Earplugs or headphones may also be used if needed to reduce noise or other competing distractions. Sometimes people have thoughts that interfere with attention to the matter at hand. With this type of distraction, a good plan is to write down any ideas that might be monopolizing one’s thoughts and try to set them aside to focus on at a later time. Attention may also be improved through identifying, organizing, and scheduling tasks and activities. This type of cognitive rehabilitation enables someone to perform daily functions efficiently and minimize how often he or she needs to shift attention to switch directions or return to repeat an action. Instruction on how to become better organized and step-by-step plans on how to start and complete projects are key strategies for improving one’s ability to employ good judgement and be able to solve problems efficiently. Structuring one’s schedule with reasonable timing to complete different projects can help to avoid becoming overwhelmed with everything that needs to be done. To reduce the pressure of working under a tight deadline, individuals may want to double or triple their estimate of time required, just to avoid any extra stress. This is partly due to the fact that people with MS sometimes feel that their sense of time is diminished, and duties might be more time-consuming due to fatigue and other factors. Scheduling time to work when interruptions are at a minimum is also important. Individuals with MS who experience problems with executive function need to be flexible with their schedule. While staying on track is worthwhile, people with MS need to be prepared for changes in symptoms that may disrupt their plans for the day, week, or potentially longer. Even when not experiencing any type of changes in symptoms, schedules should be regularly re-evaluated and revised as needed. Individuals should also be aware of their own physical limits as well as the fact that they may be more easily distracted now than prior to their diagnosis. Individuals with MS who are experiencing cognitive difficulties may benefit greatly by staying aware of their limitations and continually learning new ways to counter the effects of this challenging symptom. Through the knowledge that cognitive issues could be slowing them down, causing frustration and forgetfulness, as well as other implications, individuals may be empowered by regularly learning and employing new techniques. Doing so can lead to a better quality of life and even greater success with their endeavors. Furthermore, relationships may become more positive as plans are put into place to counter any problem areas. Other urgent responsibilities, such as taking one’s medications at the correct times and dosages, may be more closely followed through planning, organization, and the added attention the individual knows is necessary. When asked about cognitive problems experienced by people with MS, MSAA Chief Medical Officer Jack Burks, MD, reflects on the many challenges that some individuals with MS may face while coping with this often unexpected symptom. At the same time, he is pleased to explain that several proven strategies, as well as new and emerging therapies, are becoming available, all of which may provide the help needed to counter these types of symptoms. Dr. Burks explains, “Many people with MS tend to focus on their physical challenges and minimize or deny their cognitive issues, although they may realize some difficulties at work, at home, or with social interactions. Their adherence to MS medications may also suffer. “When finally evaluated by neuropsycho-logical testing, they are often surprised by the degree of difficulties they experience during the tests. They often believe that if they look and feel ‘pretty good,’ drive safely, get satisfactory job performance evaluations, and can handle their checkbook, they must not be cognitively impaired. Once the problem is identified, they are initially upset. However, after they learn how to deal with the issues, they are relieved by the ability to accomplish even more. “The bottom line is that cognitive problems may exist… but so do many opportunities and strategies that are available to help people perform their cognitive tasks. This article provided insights into the enormous research efforts related to MS cognition and ideas to improve one’s daily living skills. Additionally, we are learning that MS disease-modifying therapies may also help MS cognition, which is good news of course for individuals with relapsing forms of MS. However, some medi-cations are now being studied for cognition in individuals with progressive forms of MS, which is certainly good news for individuals with this type of MS as well.” Cognitive rehabilitation and retraining offers many valuable strategies for achieving goals and attaining optimum quality of life. With this in mind, anyone who believes that he or she may be experiencing changes in cognitive function is encouraged to consult his or her neurologist about the potential benefits that this type of therapy may provide.

93fe7411-0950-4fc1-85be-e99201561dce,"Patient Advocate Founds 'Fix MS Now' to Raise Awareness — Top Healthline contributor Sheryl Jacobson Skutelsky raises awareness of MS through social media, and even her dog gets in on the act. The journey from diagnosis to patient advocacy is a road less traveled. Not everyone can both accept their condition and use their voice in a positive way to educate those around them. Since her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2001, Healthline contributor has been heading down that path. Skutelsky writes informative blog posts about life with MS and has also appeared in a Healthline about the disease, sharing her positive attitude and tips on what has made accepting her illness easier. Although she was officially diagnosed in 2001, Skutelsky suspects that she’d had the disease for as long as 20 years prior. “I went from doctor to doctor ending up being told that I was suffering stress from a verbally abusive marriage,” she said. It was a massive headache that drove her to seek relief at the emergency room that ultimately led to a consultation with a neurologist and the MRI scan that confirmed MS. “Everything was starting to make sense to me after I was finally diagnosed and I actually found out it was MS,” said Skutelsky. “It was almost a relief to find out that all these strange [symptoms] made sense now.” Skutelsky hasn’t always been an advocate, however. She admits that her emotions were typical for someone who’s been diagnosed with a debilitating, incurable disease. But she says she wouldn’t change a thing, and has decided to learn all that she can from the experience. Symptoms of MS can range from numbness and tingling to loss of vision, loss of balance, emotional problems, and cognitive deficits—none of which are immediately apparent to the untrained eye. Read More: But You Look Great! Jack Osborne’s ‘Invisible’ MS » It’s this general lack of understanding about MS that drives Skutelsky’s advocacy efforts. “I was tired of people saying, ‘but, you look so good’ while questioning why I need a handicap parking spot or why I need to cancel a date,” she said. “I already had a New York vanity license plate that said FIX MS, so ‘Fix MS Now’ was born.” Five years ago, when she had to go on disability, Skutelsky decided to focus on advocacy. She had spent her career working as a graphic artist and still owns her own design company. “I needed a purpose to pull myself up out of depression, and it seemed logical to use my graphic design skills to raise MS awareness,” she said. She started the Facebook page in July 2012 and launched this past year. In that time, she’s built a social media following of thousands of people living with MS. And Skutelsky is equally passionate about her dogs. One of them, Peanut, has caught the advocacy bug and has his own Facebook page, . Read More About Sheryl’s Teeny Tiny Mighty MS Mascot » “I hope to reach as many new people around the world as possible,” Skutelsky said. “I’m very good at doing research, and I attempt to bring all the latest news I can find to the page as well as answering any questions presented to me that can help others find all the MS resources that are out there.” Skutelsky also appears on an internet radio program called “” where she discusses everything from symptoms of MS to her views on traditional medicine versus a more holistic approach. “I’ve found that almost everyone knows someone with MS,” she said on the radio show, “yet they themselves don’t know what MS is.” With the impassioned advocacy of Skutelsky—and her pooch—knowledge is spreading. By educating patients, as well as family members, friends, and caregivers, advocates like Skutelsky are bringing MS information to the masses. — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

It is unusual for MS to affect the autonomic nervous system, and therefore uncommon for breathing problems to occur in MS as a direct result of loss of autonomic control. If breathing problems occur suddenly, it is imperative to see a healthcare provider immediately or go to the emergency room since this may indicate infection or some other problem. In MS, the most common cause of respiratory problems is loss of muscle strength and endurance. Just as a person can experience muscle weakness in the arms or legs, weakness can occur in the ventilatory muscles of the chest and abdomen that are involved in breathing. And like weakness in the other parts of the body, weakness of the ventilatory muscles can begin to occur early in the disease course and gradually worsen over time. People with weakened ventilatory muscles have to work harder to inhale and exhale. This extra effort can be quite tiring, particularly for people who already experience a significant amount of MS fatigue. Respiratory problems can also interfere with the process of speech and voice production — making it much more difficult and tiring for people to carry on a conversation or speak loudly enough to be heard. The speech/language pathologist can recommend exercises and tools to enhance and communication. , such as tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and opioid analgesics, can depress breathing. The use of these medications should be carefully monitored in anyone with a history of respiratory distress or swallowing problems. Breathing problems can also occur as a result of , which results from the inability to clear secretions from the nose and throat, or from swallowing difficulties that result in inhalation of food particles into the lungs. Evaluation and treatment by a speech/language pathologist is essential for anyone who begins to experience swallowing difficulties and/or choking while eating or drinking. In addition to exercises and other forms of therapy to improve a person’s swallow, the therapist may also recommend dietary changes and postural changes while eating to minimize swallowing problems. Sometimes, a feeding tube is necessary to avoid continued risk of aspiration pneumonia. Evaluations of breathing problems are most often done by a healthcare provider with special training in this area. If your respiratory function becomes affected, a therapy program including breathing exercises may be recommended to strengthen ventilatory muscles and enhance respiration. Everyone living with MS can benefit from adding breathing exercises into their regular wellness routine. Once you have consulted with your healthcare provider on what exercise program might be best for you, consider viewing our video for guided breathing exercises. *Disclaimer: Consult a medical professional before starting a new exercise routine and follow personal safety precautions to reduce the risk of injuries.*  Caring for Loved Ones with Advanced MS: A Guide for Families Here are a few related topics that may interest you Caring for Loved Ones with Advanced MS - A Guide for Families (.pdf) Joint Conference on Primary-Progressive MS Focuses on Unmet Needs (.pdf) Our MS Navigators help identify solutions and provide access to the resources you are looking for.

7598740f-2e83-4777-a679-782260f1c9eb,"But You Look Great! Jack Osbourne's 'Invisible' MS — Many multiple sclerosis symptoms are felt but not seen in celebrities like Jack Osbourne and Ann Romney. People in good health often see disease only through the lens of celebrity. We know more about Parkinson’s disease thanks to Michael J. Fox. Breast cancer was dinner table conversation after Angelina Jolie shocked the world with her . And multiple sclerosis (MS) was back in the spotlight last year when Jack Osbourne, son of rocker Ozzy Osbourne and his wife Sharon, shared his diagnosis in a magazine . While many patients are diagnosed with progressive, debilitating forms of MS, others “look so good” you’d never suspect they were ill. “It’s like it’s not even there,” Jack’s sister Kelly Osbourne told magazine when she was asked about Jack’s illness earlier this week. In the early stages of the disease, MS symptoms may be subtle to the untrained eye. Many people with MS experience “invisible” symptoms, including vision problems, dizziness, weakness, pain, numbness, fatigue, memory issues, and bladder or sexual dysfunction. In Osbourne’s case, he realized he was having problems when he began losing vision in one eye. A classic symptom, optic neuritis is often the first one a patient suffers. And it may not be immediately apparent, even to friends and family. Describing these subtle symptoms to those around them presents its own unique challenges for MS patients.Rennie Rankin, a high school Spanish teach in Freehold, NJ who has been battling MS for 10 years, has had to cope with many invisible symptoms. “One of the symptoms that is most frustrating for me is heat-induced loss of vision. This necessitates air conditioning in my classroom, [which] is not the norm where I work” Rankin told Healthline. While her colleagues sometimes make comments about her “preferential treatment,” Rankin says, “I’d gladly trade the AC for good health.” Talking about these experiences in a relatable way can help others understand. For instance, describing fatigue as feeling “so tired” could earn a patient the label “lazy.” Instead, comparing it to the feeling of wearing a lead suit might make it easier to understand.When she was newly diagnosed, Rankin didn’t realize that saying she felt ‘pins and needles’ wasn’t enough. She learned to describe the sensation more accurately, “as if the pins and needles are sticking me from the inside out”.The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has people with MS share their with family, friends and caregivers. Having an honest and open dialog with doctors is key when living with a chronic condition like MS. Even though neurologists are trained to identify and measure many invisible symptoms, unless they are informed, they won’t be able to help manage them. For example, bowel and bladder problems are symptoms a neurologist can only ask about. Unless a patient is honest, he or she may suffer needlessly or develop more serious complications. Not being able to empty one’s bladder completely can increase the likelihood of infections, and chronic constipation can lead to nutrient absorption issues. Invisible MS symptoms can not only be painful for patients, they can also cause a frustrating sense of isolation.Celebrities like Jack Osbourne, Ann Romney, and Clay Walker might appear unaffected on the outside, but no one else can know their stories without walking many miles in their shoes.

0ccd4ec3-3885-4e56-bb3b-c04f4dc8fd4b,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Zuzanna is in her 20s and works as a neuropsychologist, an anthropologist of culture and a journalist. She lives in Warsaw. I was diagnosed with MS two years ago, but I think it started in high school. It was not until 2009 that there was a turning point. I was walking in the Tatra Mountains with my best friend, Monica, and amid the extraordinary landscape, at a height of 2,000 metres, I felt as if hundreds of small ants had passed over my body. I also realised that I could not control my gait. The strange feeling passed after a while. Once I was home, more symptoms appeared – a strange shiver along my spine that would come and go, and my neck itched terribly. But, most disturbing, was my problem with concentration, attention and memory. My friends and family used to say I had a memory like an elephant, so when I started to forget the simplest things I felt like I ceased to know who I was. My other main symptom is depression which, unfortunately, has not yet been treated with any success. Sometimes I am better, sometimes worse. This is the life that I have learned to live. Zuzanna My diagnosis came about after visiting my GP, who referred me to an orthopaedic specialist because of the feelings in my spine. The orthopaedic surgeon arranged an X-ray and I waited for the results. “The X-ray is clear”, said the orthopaedic surgeon, “there is no problem with your spine”. “What about the numbness?” I asked. I was worried and confused but did not want to be a hyperchondriac. The doctor asked my age and then handed me a referral for a neurological consultation. At my appointment with the neurologist, I was asked to close my eyes and to touch the tip of my nose with my right index finger, and then the left. I knew where my finger should go, but I touched my cheekbone instead of my nose. The neurologist then arranged for an MRI scan. I noticed words on the notes about MS and become very frightened. At the MRI the radiologist said, “Do not move. Once it starts it is quite loud, but you will get used to it. Good luck”. I was left alone in a deafening and unpleasant tube. After a while, I heard a series of repetitive high-frequency sounds which sounded like 1980’s electronic music; a mix of synthesizer and bass guitar. Being in a closed, claustrophobic space seemed to make the time pass even more slowly. I left the hospital feeling full of fear. Fortunately, I was not alone. My friend Irena was waiting for me. “Well, how was it?” she asked. I saw scientific curiosity in her eyes. “Sorry,” she said, “What did the doctor say? Do you have the result?” I replied “The result will be ready in an hour. I’m so hungry. Let’s go and eat”. An hour later, Irena stood beside me and we watched the pictures of my brain. “At least you can see that I have a brain” I said to her, stifling fear with black humour. We smiled at each other but then I felt tears well up in my eyes. “Now what?” I asked. For some, the diagnosis of MS is the end of the world. I would be lying if I said that I had no such thoughts. The fear that accompanied me in the first moments was enormous. I had just turned 25. Paradoxically however, MS started a new stage of my life. I started the battle for myself and so far I am winning. My perspective has been changed by knowing other people with MS, gathering information about treatments and taking part in an experimental drug trial. The therapy is working, making me feel positive and that life is not meaningless. Thanks to organisations such as the Polish National Multiple Sclerosis Society, people with MS have an opportunity to establish a personal bank account, and the right to collect funds for treatment and rehabilitation. Donations from friends, acquaintances and even strangers means that I have enough money for treatment for six months. It is not easy to open up and announce that you are sick. Most people do not know what MS is. However, I recommend that people with MS be completely open. “Coming out” helps you feel free from unnecessary tension and stress. Some of the people I told drifted away, but nature hates a vacuum, so in a short time, there were plenty of people who wanted to help and just be my friend. This is a sign of sincerity above all. It is also important to acknowledge and seek help for depression and cognitive problems caused by MS. I now use simple but effective strategies to focus attention on what is in the here-and-now. I remember words from a seminar: “Let us live beautifully, live actively, wisely, open ourselves to new experiences, gain new skills, try to act and if it fails to get established, then try something else. Do not perceive life as a to-do list”. Thanks to these words, I see life with a chronic disease as a challenge but it is not the focus of my life. I’m sick, but I choose if I give up or make friends in spite of the difficulties of MS. Good luck! RT @: @ research alumnus @ has published further work on therapeutic lag and MS!

18bf563e-fb96-4dfa-821b-c7287d22742f,"— — Some people with multiple sclerosis (MS) feel their symptoms worsen when they become overheated. When elevated body temperature impairs vision, it’s called Uhthoff’s phenomenon. Uhthoff’s occurs because of damage to the optic nerve. It interferes with the transmission of signals between the eyes and the brain. Symptoms include blurry or reduced vision, and it’s often one of the first symptoms of MS. Uhthoff’s phenomenon is sometimes called “Uhthoff’s syndrome” or “Uhthoff’s sign.” The condition was named for William Uhthoff, a German professor of ophthalmology who lived from 1853 to 1927. MS is a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks myelin, the protective covering surrounding nerve cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Inflammation damages the nerve cells and causes lesions and scar tissue to form. This damage impairs the ability of the CNS to send signals to the rest of the body. Symptoms of MS vary depending on the location of the lesions. Some symptoms include: A 2011 reported that between 60 and 80 percent of people with MS experience heat sensitivity. Demyelinated fibers in the CNS are hypersensitive to a rise in body temperature. This makes it more difficult for the body to receive internal signals. This can result in a worsening of MS-related symptoms and cause blurred vision. The good news is that heat sensitivity and the related worsening of MS symptoms are only temporary. This is called pseudo-exacerbation. It doesn’t mean new lesions, lasting neurological damage, or a rapid progression of MS. Uhthoff’s is only temporary, so there’s no need to panic if you develop symptoms. But if your vision is seriously impaired, ask someone to assist you. MS-related heat sensitivity doesn’t cause new symptoms, but it can aggravate existing symptoms. Besides vision problems, these can include: Treatment involves cooling your body temperature. If you’re outdoors on a hot or humid day, find a shady area to rest. If you can, stay indoors and take advantage of air conditioning or a fan. You could also take a cool bath or shower. And drink a cool beverage or use ice cubes to cool your body. Once you’ve cooled down, symptoms generally improve quickly. Fever can also cause Uhthoff’s. When you have a fever, the remedy is to treat the underlying cause. Medical intervention isn’t necessary for symptoms of Uhthoff’s. If you’ve experienced it before, you’ll know what to expect. But it’s easy to confuse heat-related symptoms with other medical emergencies. you’ve never experienced heat-related symptoms of MS before you’re uncertain that your symptoms are Uhthoff’s or MS-related your symptoms don’t improve after you’ve cooled down To avoid Uhthoff’s phenomenon, the key is to avoid overheating in the first place. Try to stay indoors and use an air conditioner or fan during times of extreme heat and humidity. This is especially helpful when exercising. Also avoid hot showers, baths, and saunas. Outdoors, try to stay in the shade and avoid intense exercise. Use cooling products such as cooling vests, neck wraps, and portable fans. Enjoy icy beverages, and avoid hot tubs and swimming pools heated above 85°F (29°C). In some cases, MS and Uhthoff’s don’t go together. If you’re not sensitive to the heat, there’s no need to avoid activities you enjoy. While heat and humidity can trigger a wide range of MS-related symptoms, so can cold weather. High humidity or cold temperatures can trigger involuntary muscle spasms or stiffness, called spasticity. If you have heat- or cold-related symptoms of MS, it’s best to avoid exposure to any extreme temperature. If you’re thinking of relocating for health reasons, it’s a good idea to spend some time in a different climate first to see if it makes a difference. Uhthoff’s phenomenon is easy to treat and doesn’t mean your MS symptoms are worsening. But if you’ve never experienced symptoms of Uhthoff’s or of MS, see your doctor. — — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

549d1be0-bb19-4ece-97c2-85e04f2b0654,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Rehabilitation is the part of managing of MS that focuses on function For many people with MS, pharmacological therapy alone is not able to address particular symptoms adequately or, in some cases, disease progression. Rehabilitation is a component of the comprehensive management of MS that focuses on function, and adds non-pharmacological strategies for the care of the person. Rehabilitation in MS aims to encourage autonomy and improve the quality of life through goal-oriented programmes that involve the person with MS in deciding on treatment priorities. For example, an individual may want help moving around, remembering things better, or feeling less fatigued. To ensure rehabilitation is most effective, it is important that all members of the team work together. The team should include the person with MS and their family, who work closely with experts from a number of specialised disciplines, including professionals knowledgeable in exercise, technical aids, speech and swallowing, vocational aspects and counselling. Working in collaboration, the rehabilitation team aims to create a plan that meets the needs of the person with MS, taking into account his or her priorities, lifestyle and desires. Some of the main disciplines are discussed below. More comprehensive information can be found in MS in focus – rehabilitation. This type of rehabilitation is mainly used following a relapse or when a person finds they can no longer do certain tasks. For example, if a person has increased weakness in their legs, physiotherapy can help improve strength and control through resistance exercises. Spasticity and muscle stiffness can be relieved by stretches and positioning techniques taught by a physiotherapist. Some people with MS may have problems with speech and swallowing, depending on where lesions occur in their central nervous system. A speech and swallowing therapist would undertake a thorough assessment of the lips, throat, tongue and larynx areas to identify the main issues. They then use strategies to help correct the problems, such as changing the head or body position, suggesting controls during swallowing or changing diet. The type of therapy focusses on skills that are important for continuing the daily occupations of life, for example, washing, dressing, cooking, walking, writing, going to work or taking part in social or leisure activities. The occupational therapist will assess each individual and then work with them to help restore function, suggest other ways of doing things, or give advice on an aid or adaption that may help, for example grab rails in the bathroom. This rehabilitation provides services, support and training to enable people with MS to obtain, maintain and advance in their job. For example, therapists can work with someone to identify and help implement workplace changes that will help them stay in their job, such as changes to their working day or memory aids. They can also advice on their legal rights. Counselling for people with MS is not just about listening and giving advice, it can also help with the uncertainties and unpredictability of MS. Counselling also gives people with MS a chance to discuss the personal problems related to the disease with someone neutral. These might include talking about family pressures brought about by MS and discussing strategies such as re-assigning household tasks. Getting a diagnosis of MS can be bewildering and a person may feel isolated and lonely; counselling can provide emotional support during this time.

They will work closely with you to determine the best course of care. An MS team typically includes the following health professionals. If you have any symptoms of MS, see your family doctor or primary care physician (PCP) first. After your doctor takes a physical exam and reviews your medical history, they may refer you to a neurologist. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in diseases of the nervous system. You’ll find neurologists in: A neurologist is involved in testing, diagnosis, treatment, and symptom management. Before your appointment with a neurologist, it’s a good idea to write down a few things. Your neurologist will ask many questions to help them make an accurate diagnosis. Having the answers ready will help with the process. Some questions you may be asked include: You should also consider writing down questions you’d like your doctor to answer for you. Some things you might want to ask include: A neuropsychologist will help you manage your mental function. MS can cause difficulties with memory, focus, information processing, and problem solving. A neuropsychologist might teach you exercises to help maintain and improve mental function. A clinical nurse specialist, nurse practitioner, or registered nurse might be involved in your care. These professionals have advanced training. They can help you in many areas, including: A social worker is trained to assist you in identifying and accessing: Social workers are also trained to provide counseling, emotional support, and crisis intervention. A psychologist can diagnose and treat issues related to mental health, such as , which is common in MS. Interventions can include specialized testing and ongoing counseling and support for you and your family. A physiatrist is a doctor who specializes in rehabilitation medicine. A physiatrist will design a treatment plan to help you function at the highest level possible. This may include exercise and assistive devices as well as medication. The goal is to give you the highest possible quality of life. Physical therapists (PTs) treat problems that involve balance, coordination, strength, and mobility. PTs assess for: proprioception, which is the perception of your location in space (is the toe up or down, for example) PTs help you find the balance between exercise and fatigue. They will: teach you the appropriate use of rehabilitation equipment and mobility devices measure for and apply braces and other orthotic supports An occupational therapist (OT) will help you stay productive, safe, and independent in your home and work environments. Treatment may involve modifications of your space, such as: They can also help you develop strategies to simplify jobs and conserve energy. A dietician or nutritionist will help you maintain a healthy diet. There’s no diet specific to MS, but eating a healthy diet will help you stay healthy. A dietician can teach you how to prepare healthy meals that can help with weight management and reduce fatigue and constipation. A dietician can also help with any swallowing problems that you might develop because of MS. A speech-language pathologist (SLP) can help if you have problems with: In the case of swallowing problems, an SLP works with a physical therapist and dietician to help you learn to eat safely. If you have speech difficulties, they can help with speech production and clarity so that you can continue to communicate effectively. A recreational therapist helps you find diverse activities appropriate to your level of function. This will help improve your quality of life. Activities such as swimming, yoga, tai chi, hippotherapy (horseback riding), meditation, and other fitness programs have been found to be helpful in managing MS. Reading, computer use, board games, and other mind-stimulating programs are also important for recreation with others and for relaxation on your own. — — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

961a3e1d-0504-466d-b82c-280e7d08e0a1,"— A recent study showed the older adults who eat leafy vegetables had slower rate of memory decline. Experts think this phenomenon could help with MS. A out of Rush University found that participants who ate at least one serving of leafy greens a day had a slower rate of decline in memory and thinking skills versus those who rarely or never ate these green vegetables. The study included 960 older adults, average age of 81, without dementia. They tracked their diets for an average of almost five years. Those who ate their greens experienced a mental advantage equivalent to 11 years in age over those who didn’t. The study found that participants who ate green leafy vegetables and foods rich in vitamin K1, vitamin E, lutein, nitrate, folic acid, and kaempferol had the best results with the cognitive tests. Vitamin K1 foods include green leafy vegetables, scallions, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, fermented dairy, and prunes. is a powerful group of antioxidants that help fight oxidative stress, known to exacerbate multiple sclerosis (MS). These foods include wheat germ oil, almonds, sunflower seeds, pine nuts, avocado, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow trout. Folic acid is found in leafy greens, spinach, asparagus, citrus fruits, beans, peas, lentils, breads, cereals, rice, and pasta. Nitrates include lettuce, beets, carrots, green beans, spinach, parsley, cabbage, radishes, celery, and collard greens. Kaempferol comes from capers, kale, dill weed, cress, broccoli, and turnip greens. While this study didn’t target those with MS, it hits on an important problem associated with this disease. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, cognitive changes occur in of all people with MS at a varied rate of intensity. Cognitive dysfunction can cause significant disabilities. “Cog fog,” as many with MS call it, can be devastating. One recently looked at cognitive impairment as defined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and found that about 41 percent of participants had some level of disability. Information processing speed was the No. 1 problem. Other issues included planning, executive function, memory, fatigue, depression, and basic attention. “Your gut could be the connection,” explained Nichole M. Bednar, MS RD, a senior dietitian, food service and Computrition specialist at UCLA Health. “Along with all of these green vegetables comes more roughage. And you’ll never going to go wrong with antioxidants,” Bednar told Healthline. Healthy microbes thrive in an alkaline environment that can be created with low-glycemic vegetables and fruit. Bednar further explained, “Bringing in roughage changes the microbiome into a healthier one. With the healthier gut comes less depression and less anxiety.” In addition, “a healthy microbiome will not have inflammatory reactions. And that .” Bednar, who works with a variety of patients, added that “with MS patients, the first thing is to figure out if the patient has an allergy connection. Even just a sensitivity can cause an inflammatory response in the gut. It can kill good bacteria.” Gut bacteria is a growing interest for those with MS. Researchers at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) recently looking specifically at the microbes of MS patients and found promising information. People with MS have different microbes than those in a healthy gut. And two microbes are showing up on a regular basis — and . These microbes trigger inflammation, while a species of bacteria found at lower than usual levels in MS patients — — triggers immune-regulatory responses. Bednar explained the benefits of switching diets for a week. “One week of a plant-based diet can make a significant change in the gut biome. It can give you a new GI track.” Recently, experts looked at experiments showing that dietary alterations can induce large, temporary microbial shifts . Other modifiable risk factors taken into consideration for the Rush study included smoking, drinking alcohol, fish consumption, and exercises that were carefully controlled in the study, explained Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and clinical director of the UCLA MS program. Geisser emphasized that the Rush study “doesn’t prove that eating these foods slows brain aging, but it shows an association between the two.” While careful in controlling modifiable risk factors, the samples were a little skewed, with participants mainly older and white. She found the study “interesting but needs more research.” Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

9ce0fbdf-85f2-4d33-9049-9cbef9f0f9e8,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Rehabilitation is the part of managing of MS that focuses on function For many people with MS, pharmacological therapy alone is not able to address particular symptoms adequately or, in some cases, disease progression. Rehabilitation is a component of the comprehensive management of MS that focuses on function, and adds non-pharmacological strategies for the care of the person. Rehabilitation in MS aims to encourage autonomy and improve the quality of life through goal-oriented programmes that involve the person with MS in deciding on treatment priorities. For example, an individual may want help moving around, remembering things better, or feeling less fatigued. To ensure rehabilitation is most effective, it is important that all members of the team work together. The team should include the person with MS and their family, who work closely with experts from a number of specialised disciplines, including professionals knowledgeable in exercise, technical aids, speech and swallowing, vocational aspects and counselling. Working in collaboration, the rehabilitation team aims to create a plan that meets the needs of the person with MS, taking into account his or her priorities, lifestyle and desires. Some of the main disciplines are discussed below. More can be found in This type of rehabilitation is mainly used following a relapse or when a person finds they can no longer do certain tasks. For example, if a person has increased weakness in their legs, physiotherapy can help improve strength and control through resistance exercises. Spasticity and muscle stiffness can be relieved by stretches and positioning techniques taught by a physiotherapist. Some people with MS may have problems with speech and swallowing, depending on where lesions occur in their central nervous system. A speech and swallowing therapist would undertake a thorough assessment of the lips, throat, tongue and larynx areas to identify the main issues. They then use strategies to help correct the problems, such as changing the head or body position, suggesting controls during swallowing or changing diet. The type of therapy focusses on skills that are important for continuing the daily occupations of life, for example, washing, dressing, cooking, walking, writing, going to work or taking part in social or leisure activities. The occupational therapist will assess each individual and then work with them to help restore function, suggest other ways of doing things, or give advice on an aid or adaption that may help, for example grab rails in the bathroom. This rehabilitation provides services, support and training to enable people with MS to obtain, maintain and advance in their job.

Rehabilitation is a component of the comprehensive management of MS that focuses on function, and adds non-pharmacological strategies for the care of the person. Rehabilitation in MS aims to encourage autonomy and improve the quality of life through goal-oriented programmes that involve the person with MS in deciding on treatment priorities. For example, an individual may want help moving around, remembering things better, or feeling less fatigued. To ensure rehabilitation is most effective, it is important that all members of the team work together. The team should include the person with MS and their family, who work closely with experts from a number of specialised disciplines, including professionals knowledgeable in exercise, technical aids, speech and swallowing, vocational aspects and counselling. Working in collaboration, the rehabilitation team aims to create a plan that meets the needs of the person with MS, taking into account his or her priorities, lifestyle and desires. Some of the main disciplines are discussed below. More can be found in This type of rehabilitation is mainly used following a relapse or when a person finds they can no longer do certain tasks. For example, if a person has increased weakness in their legs, physiotherapy can help improve strength and control through resistance exercises. Spasticity and muscle stiffness can be relieved by stretches and positioning techniques taught by a physiotherapist. Some people with MS may have problems with speech and swallowing, depending on where lesions occur in their central nervous system. A speech and swallowing therapist would undertake a thorough assessment of the lips, throat, tongue and larynx areas to identify the main issues. They then use strategies to help correct the problems, such as changing the head or body position, suggesting controls during swallowing or changing diet. The type of therapy focusses on skills that are important for continuing the daily occupations of life, for example, washing, dressing, cooking, walking, writing, going to work or taking part in social or leisure activities. The occupational therapist will assess each individual and then work with them to help restore function, suggest other ways of doing things, or give advice on an aid or adaption that may help, for example grab rails in the bathroom.

b7a3c3a2-3d5f-41f4-bc9f-51f16d738586,"How I Am Redefining What ‘Sick’ Looks Like for Black Women Living with Multiple Sclerosis — In everything I read after my MS diagnosis, Black women, especially millennial Black women, seemed to have been erased from the narrative. At the end of my freshman year of college, blurry vision in my left eye took me from the student health center to an eye doctor, then to an emergency room. Each provider who saw me that day was just as confused as the one before. The student health physician attributed my vision problems to needing prescription glasses. The eye doctor assumed I had “reparable nerve damage.” The ER physicians were so stumped that they decided to admit me for further tests by a neurologist. I ended up spending the next 3 days in the hospital, going through countless tests and receiving few answers. But, after MRIs revealed inflammation on my brain and spine, I heard the words “” for the first time. I had never heard of the disease, and the neurologist’s technical explanations and apathetic demeanor certainly didn’t help. I stared at him, dumbfounded, as he explained the disease’s symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, blurred vision, and the possibility of immobility. For someone who’s rarely at a loss for words, it was one of the few times in my life when I’ve been speechless. Recognizing how overwhelmed I was, my mom, who had caught the first available flight to be by my side, asked the very obvious question: “So, does she have multiple sclerosis or not?” The neurologist shrugged and responded, “ not.” He instead attributed my symptoms to the stress of attending an elite university, prescribed some steroids, and sent me on my way. It wasn’t until 3 years later when I finally received my diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease known to Black women. Since then, I’ve recognized my experiences with chronic illness to be tied to my Blackness. As a recent law school graduate, I spent 3 years studying the ways in which systemic racism can be veiled in complex legalese but have direct effects on Black and low-income communities’ access to high-quality healthcare. I’ve experienced firsthand how a medical provider’s , the of Black and brown participants from clinical trials, and the lack of health education materials influences the overall of communities of color. The lack of representation made me feel alone and ashamed In the months following my diagnosis, I obsessively researched everything that I could. I was moving to San Francisco to start my first job, and I had plans of applying to law school. I needed answers on how to thrive while fighting a disease that causes the body to literally attack itself. From diets to alternative treatments to exercise regimens, I read it all. But, even after I read everything I could, nothing spoke to me. Black women were, and still are, largely nonexistent in research and clinical trials. Their stories were rarely amplified in patient advocacy groups and educational literature, despite disease progression. In everything I read, Black women, especially millennial Black women, seemed to have been erased from the narrative. The lack of representation made me feel ashamed. Was I really the only 20-something Black woman living with this disease? Society already at every junction. What will they say if they know that I have a chronic illness? Without a community that I felt truly understood me, I decided to keep my diagnosis a secret. It wasn’t until a year into my diagnosis that I came across the hashtag , a campaign created by Victoria Reese to unite women of color living with MS. Reading the stories of Black women thriving despite their MS pushed me to the verge of tears. This was the community of women I had been yearning for, the community I needed to find power in my story. I found Victoria’s email address and immediately reached out to her. I knew the work was bigger than a hashtag, and I felt called to be a part of building something that would end the invisibility and racism that had kept me silent. Working to address the systemic racism in the U.S. healthcare system In early 2020, Victoria and I founded as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization to continue the #WeAreIllmatic campaign’s mission. We’ve continued to grow a network of more than 1,000 women, and we’re cultivating a space for those women to not only share their story with MS, but to also learn from others. When working with our industry partners, we require that they go beyond simply creating content that addresses the concerns of the community we serve, but that they recognize how their practices have disparately affected Black women. And that do the work to change them. In the months following We Are Ill’s founding, COVID-19 hit. The of the pandemic on the Black community brought to light the systemic racism and social inequities that have always underscored our healthcare system. The pandemic has only amplified the importance of this work, and thankfully, We Are Ill isn’t doing it alone: is leveraging technology to connect Black women with Black doctors who are committed to eradicating the racial health disparities that have led to of maternal mortality for Black women. collects health-related information from communities of color so that their medical history can be better represented in clinical trials to create more inclusive treatments. The “” and “” podcasts highlight the stories of those living beyond their chronic conditions. Since entering the advocacy space, I’m regularly asked what advice I have for Black women living with MS. And honestly, I have a lot: Find best practices to reduce stress, if you can. Believe your story has power, and invest in a supportive community. But I’ve started to realize that a lot of these pieces of advice are rooted in how to navigate a racist system. It’s not OK for Black women to be misdiagnosed or gaslit by medical professionals. It’s not OK that medical research participants are (less than of cancer clinical trials funded by the National Cancer Institute include enough minority participants to provide useful information, for example). It’s not OK to live with the of discrimination, a chronic illness, family, employment, and overall livelihood. It’s not OK to live without healthcare. It’s not OK to feel . I will always give support and advice to women fighting this disease, but it’s time that the players in public health come to the aid of Black women by challenging the medical community’s long history of inadequate care. We are already sowing the seeds for social change and empowering Black women to redefine what sick looks like. It’s time for them to join us.

670b51d8-75a7-4bf7-aa52-aaf118dc82c1,"Everything You Need to Know About Transitioning from RRMS to SPMS — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects your brain and the spinal cord. According to the National MS Society, about people over the age of 18 live with this condition in the United States. MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the CNS. This triggers inflammation and damages myelin, an insulating material that surrounds nerve fibers. The exact mechanism of how someone gets the disease is unknown. However, we do know that there is likely a combination of triggers including genetic and environmental factors. Damage to these fibers can trigger multiple neurological symptoms. This includes fatigue, numbness, weakness, cognitive problems, and issues with walking. The severity of your symptoms varies from person-to-person, and depends on the type of MS you have. Many people are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). But over time, symptoms can progress to another type of MS, known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Here’s what you need to know about both types of MS. RRMS refers to a type of MS in which you experience periods of new MS symptoms or relapses followed by periods of remission. Remission is when symptoms improve or disappear. During relapses, you may have new typical MS symptoms like numbness, tingling, and blurred vision. These symptoms can lasts for days, weeks, or months, and then slowly improve over weeks to months. Some people experience complete disappearance of their symptoms during remission. On the other hand, if your symptoms continue, they may not be as severe. About with MS receive an RRMS diagnosis at first. Many people experience progression of their symptoms after living with RRMS for some time. This means that the disease becomes more active, and periods of remission become less and less frequent. This stage of MS is known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or SPMS. This condition is best described as MS without relapses. MS affects everyone differently, and not everyone with RRMS will transition to SPMS. But SPMS only develops after an initial diagnosis of RRMS. You’ll have typical MS symptoms during the transition from RRMS to SPMS, but you may experience a slow worsening of symptoms. You may even develop new symptoms. Before, maybe you had numbness or mild weakness, and these didn’t interfere much with your daily life. Once you transition to SPMS, though, you may notice cognitive changes, such as difficulty finding words. You may also have increased difficulty with walking or more noticeable numbness and tingling. The cause of this transition is unknown, but it may have to do with the disappearance of nerve fibers as the result of progressive nerve damage. Or it may be connected to the progressive loss of grey matter, which can be more subtle. Some people transition soon after an MS diagnosis, whereas others live with RRMS for decades before transitioning to SPMS. Since MS symptoms are unpredictable, it can be difficult to distinguish an RRMS relapse from the onset of SPMS. Speak with your doctor if you feel that you’re experiencing new or worsening symptoms. Your doctor can use an imaging test like an MRI to examine inflammation in your brain. Based on the level of inflammation in your brain as well as your relapse history, your doctor can determine whether your symptoms are a new relapse or SPMS. Even though some people with RRMS eventually transition to SPMS, it’s possible to delay disease progression. Treating MS is key to improving your symptoms and quality of life, and ultimately, slowing down the disease. Your doctor can prescribe disease-modifying therapies to help decrease inflammation, which can also improve the severity and frequency of your attacks. These include injectable, oral, and infusion medications such as: These treatments and others can help with the relapsing forms of MS. Talk to your doctor to find out which one is best for you. You may also receive intravenous corticosteroids to reduce acute inflammation in your CNS. This helps speed up recovery from an MS relapse. MS is a progressive condition that can lead to disability. You may eventually require some type of rehabilitation to help with daily living. Programs vary based on your needs. If you’re having difficulty with speech or swallowing, you may receive assistance from a speech or language pathologist. Or you may need appointments with an occupational therapist if you’re having difficulty with personal care, housework, or employment. Lifestyle changes can help improve your symptoms, too. Regular exercise may reduce spasticity and joint stiffness. It can improve both your flexibility and your overall health. Plus, exercise increases the brain’s production of endorphins, which are hormones that help regulate your emotions and mood. To avoid injury, start slow with gentle activities like water aerobics or walking. It’s also important to stretch both before and after activity to reduce muscle spasms, which are common in MS. Learn how to pace yourself and set limits. Additionally, you’ll want to avoid foods that can increase inflammation. These include highly processed foods such as hamburgers and hot dogs and foods high in salt. Examples of foods that can reduce inflammation are whole foods such as green leafy vegetables, fish high in omega-3s, and fruits such as blackberries and raspberries. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about ways to quit. Some people feel better after confiding in a close friend or family member, or after joining a support group for MS. MS is a serious condition, but early treatment can help you achieve remission and slow the progression of the disease. Worsening of symptoms can also interfere with the quality of your life. Talk with your doctor if you develop any new symptoms or signs of advancing MS. — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

64cbd29b-3bd5-4ebc-b9fb-f5cedeeae4f0,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the . The CNS consists of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord. With MS, areas of the CNS become inflamed, damaging the protective covering (known as ““) that surrounds and insulates the nerves (known as ““). In addition to the myelin, over time, the axons and nerve cells (neurons) within the CNS may also become damaged. The damage to the protective covering and also to the nerves disrupts the smooth flow of nerve impulses. As a result, messages from the brain and spinal cord going to other parts of the body may be delayed and have trouble reaching their destination – causing the symptoms of MS. Shown above is an illustration of two nerve cells. The normal one on the left has a healthy nerve fiber, or axon, protected by myelin (insulation covering the nerve), and is able to transmit signals at a very fast speed – similar to electricity traveling along an electrical cord. The ms nerve cell on the right shows damage to the myelin, and as a result, signals do not travel well along the nerve. When the myelin becomes damaged (as shown in the top illustration), or the nerve itself becomes damaged, signals can no longer travel across the nerve fiber efficiently. As signals slow down or are lost, the body cannot respond appropriately – causing the symptoms of ms. Shown above is an illustration of a nerve cell. The nerve fiber, or axon, when protected by healthy myelin, is able to transmit signals at a very fast speed – similar to electricity traveling along an electrical cord. Areas of inflammation and damage are known as “.” The changes in size, number, and location of these lesions may determine the type and severity of symptoms. While individuals with relapsing forms of MS are believed to experience more inflammation than those with progressive forms of MS, lesions still occur for individuals with all forms of MS. However, the lesions in progressive forms of MS may be less active and expand more slowly. In addition to symptoms, disease activity may be evaluated from changes in the size or number of lesions. Frequently, MS may be “clinically silent,” showing no increase in symptoms, yet continuing to show signs of disease activity within the CNS. For individuals with relapsing forms of MS, early and continued treatment with a can often slow the “clinically silent” disease activity in the brain, reducing the size and number of active lesions. This is why most neurologists, as well as the American Academy of Neurology, recommend that individuals with relapsing forms of MS after the diagnosis is established. More recent FDA approvals have brought new DMTs that also treat active secondary-progressive MS and primary-progressive MS. Additionally, areas of thick scar tissue may eventually form along the areas of permanently damaged myelin. These areas of scar tissue are referred to as “.” The term “multiple sclerosis” originates from the discovery of these hardened plaques. Multiple refers to “many;” sclerosis refers to “scars.” Lesions and plaques are viewed on a scanner. This technology is used to help diagnose MS and evaluate its progress at various intervals.

07a37ca0-a845-40aa-b0c9-740dd93eb833,"Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue? — MS patients who suffer from fatigue may actually have a sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or insomnia. A new finds that more than 70 percent of people living with multiple sclerosis (MS) may also suffer from undiagnosed sleep disorders. Everything from sleep apnea to restless leg syndrome (RLS) might be contributing to fatigue — one of the most common symptoms reported by MS patients. Using a detailed 10-page survey, researchers at the University of California, Davis Medical Center in Sacramento polled more than 2,300 members of the Northern California Chapter of the National MS Society about their sleep habits. They discovered that the majority of respondents screened positive for at least one sleep disorder. MS patients may not suspect a bona fide sleep disorder as the cause of their daytime fatigue because fatigue has traditionally been considered one of the many symptoms of MS. Sleep apnea, RLS, daytime sleepiness, and insomnia were all sleep disturbances the researchers studied in order to find a link between a patient’s sleep health and the level of fatigue they experienced. More than half of those who took the survey said it took them more than half an hour to fall asleep, with more than 11 percent resorting to medications to help them sleep. More than one-third of patients screened positive for obstructive sleep apnea, while another third suffered from insomnia. Almost 37 percent of patients had RLS. However, most of them had never been diagnosed with a sleep disorder by a doctor. “Sleep apnea has a Th1 cytokine profile that is similar to MS. MS is an autoimmune disease, but sleep apnea is not, but the impact of sleep apnea does have an impact on your immune system,” explained Dr. Steven Brass, co-medical director of the UC Davis Sleep Medicine Laboratory and lead author of the study in an interview with Healthline. Cytokines are substances secreted by cells that have an effect on the immune system. Th1 plays a role in allowing T-cells to do nerve damage in MS. “What all the MS treatments do is they try to suppress the Th1 cytokines,” said Brass. Patients who have sleep apnea have a similar cytokine profile to MS patients, meaning that the same inflammation is present. The standard treatment for sleep apnea is a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine and face mask that is worn during sleep. “When you treat [sleep apnea] with CPAP the TH1 cytokines drop,” Brass said, “so the question is, in patients with MS and sleep apnea, whether that would have a beneficial effect on the whole disease course — we don’t know.” Brass points out that among patients who have sleep apnea but do not have MS, the most common word they use to describe their symptoms is “fatigue.” “So MS can cause fatigue,” Brass concedes, “but it may not be the only answer. It can be other things.” Is true MS-related fatigue caused by the loss of nerve conduction seen in MS? “A lot of people think that it is,” Brass said, “So you have to work twice as hard to do anything because of your demyelinated axons.” But it could also circle back to Th1 cytokines, he said. “When you inject these same Th1 cytokines into mice, it will cause sleepiness,” Brass said. According to the , about 80 percent of people with MS have fatigue. Still, the idea that MS patients might also suffer from sleep disorders is a relatively new angle for researchers to explore. In 2011, Dr. Joseph Berger of the University of Kentucky published that showed that some patients complain of fatigue as their major symptom long before MS is even suspected. Berger’s study suggests that fatigue should be considered a red flag that MS is a possible diagnosis. “I think that when MS patients present with fatigue, there needs to be an extensive evaluation of their sleep problem,” Brass said. He said that doctors often prescribe stimulants to people with MS who complain of fatigue rather than exploring the possible cause. “I think basics need to be done,” he said, “like taking a sleep history, screening for sleep apnea, talking about sleep hygiene … I think it needs to be looked at better by MS neurologists in general and by other healthcare providers taking care of MS patients.” For people living with MS, this study is good news — suffering from daytime fatigue doesn’t have to be a “given” simply because they have the disease. A doctor can refer a patient to a sleep specialist, who may recommend a sleep study to assess the patient’s quality of sleep. During the study, patients sleep in a room that is similar to a hotel room. As they sleep, their oxygenation, air flow, and eye movement are monitored. The doctor can review your sleep study results with you and suggest a treatment plan. — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Stretch It Out: Yoga Eases Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms in Pilot Study Could a Low-Grade Fever Be Making Your MS Fatigue Worse?

6ae643b6-4613-4bb3-a0ac-7eeb4636054e,"Medically reviewed by — Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects women as often as men. Since hormones play a big role in the disease, it’s not surprising that MS can affect menstrual periods — which are also hormone-driven. Some women notice a change in period symptoms once they’re diagnosed with MS. They may see an increase in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms like mood shifts, irritability, fatigue, pain, poor concentration, and a loss of interest in sex. This collection of symptoms typically appears a few days before your period and disappears a few days after you get it. Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between MS and PMS symptoms. After all, fatigue, mood shifts, and sexual problems are common with both conditions. Read on to learn more about how MS can cause changes in your menstrual cycle. If you feel like your periods changed after your MS diagnosis, you could be right. In comparing women with MS to those without it, researchers found that those with the condition experienced more irregular periods and symptoms of PMS. One reason for the change is that your body temperature rises slightly during your period. Even a tiny increase in temperature can make MS symptoms worse. Hormones are the other likely cause of the relationship between MS and your menstrual cycle. Sex hormones — estrogen and progesterone — both regulate your menstrual cycle and affect MS activity. Right before you get your period, levels of these hormones plummet, setting off symptoms. Hormones are also the reason why MS symptoms change during pregnancy. Rising estrogen and progesterone during those 9 months can reduce MS symptoms for some (until after they deliver). Some of the medications that manage MS can also affect the menstrual cycle. Beta interferon, a treatment for relapsing forms of the condition, can cause irregular bleeding. It can also make your periods come earlier or later than usual. The relationship between MS and your menstrual cycle goes both ways. Research finds you’re more likely to have a relapse of motor symptoms, vision problems, and trouble with coordination in the 3 days before your period. Doctors call these temporary bouts of symptoms pseudoexacerbations. Sometimes it’s hard to know whether symptoms like weakness, pain, and fatigue are from MS or your period because they can feel very similar. Your mental sharpness and motor skills can also experience changes right around the time your period is due. In a , people with MS did worse on tests of mental and physical performance just before their period. One way to prevent bothersome PMS symptoms is to take birth control pills or use other hormonal contraceptives. The hormones in these treatments will help regulate your menstrual cycle, and should make your periods lighter and easier overall. Medications that manage MS may also help with at least some aspects of difficult periods. Drugs that help to regulate the immune system can improve the mental fog some women experience right before their periods. You can also try a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). These over-the-counter pain relievers can ease PMS discomforts like cramps and sore breasts. Some women dread the days before their period starts because of PMS symptoms. MS can make periods more unpredictable and more uncomfortable. Periods can sometimes worsen MS symptoms too. If you’re experiencing very painful and unpleasant periods, see your OB-GYN and neurologist for guidance. The OB-GYN may be able to prescribe birth control pills or other hormonal contraceptives to lighten your symptoms, while your neurologist can prescribe medications that help with MS symptoms.

MS symptoms are variable and unpredictable. No two people have exactly the same symptoms, and each person’s symptoms can change or fluctuate over time. One person might experience only one or two of the possible symptoms while another person experiences many more. Explore the list below to find more information about the symptoms you or someone you care about may experience. Most of these symptoms can be managed very effectively with medication, rehabilitation and other management strategies. Effective symptom management by an interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals is one of the key components of . Occurs in about 80% of people, can significantly interfere with the ability to function at home and work, and may be the most prominent symptom in a person who otherwise has minimal activity limitations. Related to several factors including weakness, spasticity, loss of balance, sensory deficit and fatigue, and can be helped by physical therapy, assistive therapy and medications. Numbness of the face, body, or extremities (arms and legs) is often the first symptom experienced by those eventually diagnosed as having MS. Refers to feelings of stiffness and a wide range of involuntary muscle spasms; can occur in any limb, but it is much more common in the legs. Weakness in MS, which results from deconditioning of unused muscles or damage to nerves that stimulate muscles, can be managed with rehabilitation strategies and the use of mobility aids and other assistive devices. The first symptom of MS for many people. Onset of blurred vision, poor contrast or color vision, and pain on eye movement can be frightening — and should be evaluated promptly. People with MS may feel off balance or lightheaded, or — much less often — have the sensation that they or their surroundings are spinning (vertigo). Bladder dysfunction, which occurs in at least 80% of people with MS, can usually be managed quite successfully with medications, fluid management, and intermittent self-catheterization. Very common in the general population including people with MS. Sexual responses can be affected by damage in the central nervous system, as well by symptoms such as fatigue and spasticity, and by psychological factors. Constipation is a particular concern among people with MS, as is loss of control of the bowels. Bowel issues can typically be managed through diet, adequate fluid intake, physical activity and medication. Pain syndromes are common in MS. In one study, 55% of people with MS had ""clinically significant pain"" at some time, and almost half had chronic pain. Refers to a range of high-level brain functions affected in more than 50% of people with MS, including the ability to process incoming information, learn and remember new information, organize and problem-solve, focus attention and accurately perceive the environment. Can be a reaction to the stresses of living with MS as well as the result of neurologic and immune changes. Significant depression, mood swings, irritability, and episodes of uncontrollable laughing and crying pose significant challenges for people with MS and their families. Studies have suggested that clinical depression — the severest form of depression — is among the most common symptoms of MS. It is more common among people with MS than it is in the general population or in persons with many other chronic, disabling conditions. Speech problems, including slurring (dysarthria) and loss of volume (dysphonia) occur in approximately 25-40% of people with MS, particularly later in the disease course and during periods of extreme fatigue. Stuttering is occasionally reported as well. Swallowing problems — referred to as dysphagia — result from damage to the nerves controlling the many small muscles in the mouth and throat. Tremor, or uncontrollable shaking, can occur in various parts of the body because of damaged areas along the complex nerve pathways that are responsible for coordination of movements. Seizures — which are the result of abnormal electrical discharges in an injured or scarred area of the brain — have been estimated to occur in 2-5% people with MS, compared to the estimated 3% of the general population. Respiration problems occur in people whose chest muscles have been severely weakened by damage to the nerves that control those muscles. About 6% of people who have MS complain of impaired hearing. In very rare cases, hearing loss has been reported as the first symptom of the disease. While the primary symptoms described on this page (more and less common) are the direct result of damage to the myelin and nerve fibers in the central nervous system (CNS), the secondary symptoms are the complications that can arise as a result of these primary symptoms. For example: Bladder dysfunction can cause repeated urinary tract infections. Inactivity can cause loss of muscle tone, weakness (not related to demyelination), poor posture, decreased bone density (increased risk of fracture) and shallow, inefficient breathing. While secondary symptoms can be treated, the optimal goal is to avoid them by . Tertiary symptoms result from the impact of the disease on your life. These symptoms include social, vocational and psychological complications. For example, if you are no longer able to drive or walk, you may not be able to hold down your usual job. The stress and strain of dealing with MS often alters social networks and sometimes fractures relationships. Problems with bladder control, tremor or swallowing may cause people to withdraw from social interactions and become isolated. is very common in people with MS. Depression may be both a primary and a tertiary symptom as it can be caused by the disease process itself and/or triggered by the challenges discussed above. - excerpt from Private Disability Insurance Claims: A Guide for People with MS (.pdf) Momentum article - Momentum article Your Whole Health, Your Whole Team: Managing Your Complex MS Symptoms- webinar brought to you by the National MS Society and Can Do MS.  - article addresses emerging research on sleep in MS, how people with MS can assess their sleep, and emerging treatments for sleep disturbance in MS.

In a study exploring this problem, researchers at the University of North Carolina and collaborators found that balance problems that were not detected in people with MS while walking were evident using virtual reality-based testing. The team compared balance in 14 people with MS and 14 people without MS using normal walking, and then using the virtual reality headset-based method, which involves giving people the illusion of falling. The investigators are testing and developing this method further, in the hopes that it may ultimately be used to detect balance and address problems in people living with MS before falls occur.

d19e5c54-76e5-4712-ae7a-5ec151091d10,"Sexuality and intimacy have an important impact on the quality of life for nearly everyone, including those with a chronic disease such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, sexual dysfunction may be one of the less talked-about symptoms of the disease. It is important to recognize and understand this symptom in order to adequately address it. Intimacy may be defined as anything that makes one feel closer to another, particularly in a personal and private way. Intimacy plays an important role in the sexual lives of people with MS and their partners. Males and females may experience sexual dysfunction. Some studies suggest it affects between 40 and 80 percent of women, and 50 to 90 percent of men. Other studies suggest sexual dysfunction increases over time in people with xMS and may be associated with some of the other physical symptoms of the disease, including limited mobility, spasticity, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. People are at times reluctant to discuss sexual dysfunction with their MS care team as they may feel awkward discussing things that seem so personal. In order to address these problems, like others, it first must be recognized and discussed. The causes of sexual dysfunction may be divided into three categories: primary, secondary and tertiary. is the result of damage to the central nervous system caused by MS. Motor and sensory pathways may be disrupted by damage to the neurons. This can result in a slowing of the impulses sent from the brain to the body and back. Symptoms that result can manifest as decreased sexual sensation, decreased vaginal lubrication, or erectile dysfunction. can be the result of other symptoms of the disease. Limited mobility may result in the inability of the person with MS to maintain certain positions to engage in sexual activity. Fatigue is also a major contributor to sexual dysfunction. Often the demands of daily life combined with fatigue in MS result in a decreased libido and a decreased willingness to attempt to engage in physical sexual activity. Spasticity may limit the types and number of positions a person with MS can maintain during sexual activity. A sudden onset of painful spasms can certainly interrupt attempts at sexual activity. Bowel and bladder dysfunction are also known to contribute to sexual dysfunction. People with MS who have difficulty controlling their bowels or bladder often avoid intimate contact fearing an embarrassing accident. Depression has also been found to have a significant effect on sexuality. Many of the medications used by people with MS can also contribute to sexual dysfunction, including antispasticity and antidepressant drugs. results from primary and secondary causes and includes psychological disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and depression. People with MS often focus a significant amount of time and energy on the other physical symptoms of the disease. This may leave them simply too tired to consider sexual activity. They may also be embarrassed by the use of other devices such as urinary catheters or extremity splints. Some people with MS experience a loss of self-esteem or an altered body image. For example, a man who is no longer able to work and needs physical care from his partner may not imagine himself to be a sexual being and will thus avoid sexual contact. This may be true for care partners also. Providing intimate physical care for a person with MS such as catheterization and then engaging in sexual activity with that person may be overwhelming. Concerns about the possibility of pregnancy and having a child with MS can also impact sexual function. There may be other possible causes that have nothing to do with MS yet should be considered. These problems may be associated with a normal aging process. Vaginal dryness and decreased libido may be the result of menopause in women. Lack of erectile function in men may be associated with aging or vascular disease, or medications such as anti-hypertension drugs. Common symptoms of sexual dysfunction may include: The first step to managing sexual dysfunction is to recognize and discuss it with your partner and MS team or a sexual counselor. MS presents many physical challenges that can be recognized and managed, resulting in a more satisfying sexual life. Another important first step is to review medications. Many impact sexual performance. A discussion of these with your healthcare team may result in some changes that can improve sexual function. Doses may be changed or medications may be switched if necessary. Other simple measures can include avoiding beverages such as caffeinated drinks (coffee, tea, carbonated sodas) and spicy foods immediately prior to sexual intimacy, which can reduce the possibility of a bladder or bowel accident. Emptying the bladder and bowels immediately prior to a sexual encounter may also reduce the risk of elimination dysfunction during intimacy. Timing a sexual encounter is also important. Fatigue often worsens as the day progresses, so setting aside time early in the day may enhance the sexual experience. Pelvic floor exercises taught by a physiotherapist can serve to strengthen the muscles used in many sexual encounters. Hot or cold therapy, biofeedback, and electrical stimulation may also help with mobility limitations or spasticity. Timing sexual encounters at least 30 minutes after a dose of antispasticity medications is important. Personal lubricants may be useful for women with vaginal dryness. There are several medications available by prescription for erectile dysfunction. Men should discuss these and all medications with the MS team. It is important to remember that sexual function is more than just a physical action. In the next issue of , the topic of emotional and psychological symptom management, including sexuality, will be addressed. As noted at the beginning of this section, sexuality and intimacy have an important impact on the quality of life for nearly everyone, including those with a chronic disease such as MS. There are many ways to manage sexual dysfunction in MS. The first step is recognizing and discussing sexual function with your MS healthcare team. The following medications may be used to treat sexual dysfunction (as listed on MSAA’s website at under Symptoms). Please see MSAA’s website for more information about these drugs, such as prescribing information and side effects. Sexuality and intimacy have a significant impact on the quality of life for nearly everyone, including those with a chronic disease such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, sexual dysfunction may be one of the more invisible symptoms of the disease. It is important to recognize and understand the factors that contribute to sexual dysfunction in order to adequately address it. Both men and women may experience sexual dysfunction. Some studies suggest it affects between 40 to 80 percent of women and 50 to 90 percent of men. Other studies suggest that sexual dysfunction increases over time in people with MS and may be associated with some of the emotional and psychological problems that they may also experience. People are at times reluctant to discuss sexual dysfunction with their MS-care team, as they may feel awkward discussing things that seem so personal. In order to address these problems as one would address other symptoms, they first must be recognized and discussed. Cognitive impairment is common in MS, affecting as many as 50 percent of individuals with MS, and is not necessarily associated with advanced stages of disease. The onset of cognitive impairment in MS is usually not easy to pinpoint. Some people notice distinct changes in their mental functioning that can be attributed to the disease, while others are unaware of how their cognitive limitations may be affecting relationships. Some of the cognitive functions typically affected in people with MS include: information processing; perceiving; attending/responding to incoming information; information-processing speed; cognitive flexibility, such as attending to multiple stimuli at the same time (“multi-tasking”); problems with storage, manipulation, and retrieval of information; and executive function, which includes planning, working memory, attention, and problem-solving. Cognitive impairment may affect sexual function and relationships in many ways. Partners may become frustrated if the person with MS becomes easily distracted during intimacy. Distractions such as children in the home, music, and television may interrupt intimate moments if the person with MS is not able to filter out these distractions and remain focused on his or her partner. Planning for sexual activity may be complex and overwhelming to the person with MS, and he or she may choose to avoid it all together. Verbal fluency and word finding may also be a problem leading to a partner who feels he or she is not wanted or respected. Fatigue may worsen both cognitive function and the quality of sexual relations as well. Once cognitive impairment has been identified in a person with MS, what can be done to treat this condition? First, people with relapsing forms of MS should be encouraged to begin or remain on an effective disease-modifying therapy (DMT), if advised by his or her doctor. Based on these agents’ ability to inhibit inflammation and the accumulation of brain lesions, it is likely that they exert some degree of neuroprotection that may limit the progression of cognitive impairment. Evidence suggests that exercise training in people with MS has the potential to improve many aspects of cognitive performance. Exercise has been proposed to have positive effects in reducing inflammation and neurologic damage in people with MS. Counseling is vital to assist the couple dealing with cognitive challenges affecting sexual function. Patients can be referred to an occupational therapist to assist with adaptation of certain skills or to a psychosocial therapist for assistance with coping and stress reduction. Depression is another psychological disorder seen frequently in people with MS that often impacts sexual function. People with MS who are depressed may have a decreased libido, difficulty with certain sexual positions, and fear of developing relationships. Men may also experience erectile dysfunction. The best treatment for depression is usually psychotherapy along with medication and exercise. Seeking strength in spiritual beliefs can also help. Depression can also affect care partners and may increase as disability increases. Care partners need to recognize and treat depression to effectively participate in intimate relations. Anxiety can affect sexual function as well, and care partners are also at risk. When anxiety impacts sexual function, both of these symptoms can worsen. Intimacy may be defined as anything that makes one feel closer to another, particularly in a personal and private way. People with MS who are experiencing emotional or psychological difficulties may find intimacy particularly challenging. Depression, anxiety, and cognitive dysfunction are all likely to interfere with attempts at intimacy. Recognizing and treating the underlying cause is the best way to enhance intimacy. Emotional and psychological impairment affects quality of life, which includes intimate and sexual relationships. Recognizing these impairments in people with MS and their care partners is the first step to a healthy sexual relationship. Quality of life can be impacted and treatment for many of the underlying emotional and psychological causes of sexual dysfunction should be investigated. With early recognition and treatment, a healthy and satisfying sexual relationship is certainly possible. Krawchuk LR Rediscovering Intimacy. Fall 2004 Orton SM, Herrera BM, Yee IM, et al.

c457ef20-aba0-4c9c-bf46-99f9ed37e813,"A Guide to Disability Benefits and Multiple Sclerosis — by Jennifer Chesak Because is a chronic condition that can be unpredictable with symptoms that can flare up suddenly, the disease may be problematic when it comes to work. Symptoms like impaired vision, fatigue, pain, balance problems, and muscle control difficulty could require extended periods away from a job, or hinder your ability to look for employment. Fortunately, disability insurance can replace some of your income. According to the , approximately 40 percent of all people with MS in the United States rely on some form of disability insurance, either through private insurance or through the Social Security Administration (SSA). is a federal disability insurance benefit for those who have worked and paid into social security. Keep in mind that SSDI is different from supplemental security income (SSI). That program is for low-income people who didn’t pay enough into social security during their working years to qualify for SSDI. So, if that describes you, consider looking into SSI as a starting point. In either case, benefits are limited to those who are unable to “perform substantial gainful activity,” according to Liz Supinski, director of data science at the Society for Human Resource Management. There are limits on how much a person can earn and still collect, she says, and it’s about $1,200 for most people, or around $2,000 per month for those who are blind. “That means most people who are able to qualify for disability benefits are not working for others,” says Supinski. “Self-employment is common among both disabled workers and those with disabilities severe enough to qualify for benefits.” Another consideration is that even though you might have private disability insurance, which is usually obtained as part of workplace benefits, that doesn’t mean you can’t apply for SSDI, Supinski says. Private insurance is typically a short-term benefit and usually offers smaller amounts to replace income, she notes. Most people use that type of insurance as they’re applying for SSDI and waiting for their claims to be approved. The common symptoms of MS that can interfere with your ability to work is covered under three distinct sections of the SSA’s medical criteria: includes issues related to muscle control, mobility, balance, and coordination includes vision and speaking issues, which are common in MS includes the type of mood and cognitive issues that can occur with MS, such as difficulty with depression, memory, attention, problem-solving, and information processing To make sure the process is streamlined, it’s helpful to compile your medical paperwork, including date of original diagnosis, descriptions of impairments, work history, and treatments related to your MS, says Sophie Summers, a human resources manager at software firm RapidAPI. “Having your information in one place will help you prepare your application, and can also highlight what type of info you still need to get from your healthcare provider,” she says. Also, let your doctors, colleagues, and family know you’ll be going through the application process, Summers adds. The SSA gathers input from healthcare providers as well as the applicant, and sometimes asks for additional information from family members and co-workers to determine if you qualify as disabled based on SSA criteria. Claiming disability benefits can be a complex and lengthy process, but taking the time to understand the criteria used by the SSA can help you get closer to getting a claim approved. Consider reaching out to representatives at your local SSA field office, since they can help you apply for SSDI and SSI benefits. Make an appointment by calling 800-772-1213, or you can also at the SSA website.

Sexual arousal begins in the central nervous system, as the brain sends messages to the sexual organs along nerves running through the spinal cord. If MS damages these nerve pathways, sexual response — including arousal and orgasm — can be directly affected. Sexual problems also stem from MS symptoms such as fatigue or spasticity, as well as from psychological factors relating to self-esteem and mood changes. In a study of people with MS, 63 percent reported that their sexual activity had declined since their diagnosis. Other surveys of persons with MS suggest that as many as 91 percent of men and 72 percent of women may be affected by sexual problems. Ignoring these problems can lead to major losses in quality of life. Yet both individuals and healthcare professionals are often slow to bring up the subject. The relating to changes in sexual function are quite complex. They may involve loss of self-esteem, depression, anxiety, anger and/or the stress of living with a chronic illness. Counseling — for you and your partner — by a mental health professional or trained sexual therapist can address both physiologic and psychological issues. Both men and women with MS may experience difficulty achieving orgasm or loss of libido. You and your partner can benefit from instruction in alternative means of sexual stimulation to overcome slow arousal and impaired sensation. Abnormal sensations and spasms can often be controlled through use of medication. Techniques such as intermittent catheterization or medication can control urinary leakage during intercourse. may additionally have difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection (by far the most common problem), reduced sensation in the penis and difficulty achieving ejaculation. Erectile dysfunction may be addressed through: Small suppositories that are inserted into the penis may experience reduced sensation in the vaginal/clitoral area, painfully heightened sensation and vaginal dryness. Management strategies could include: Use of a vibrator to increase stimulation and arousal Use of liquid or jellied, water-soluble personal lubricants for vaginal dryness. (Hint: you cannot use too much of these products; specialists advise using them generously.) Petroleum jelly (Vaseline®) should not be used because it is not water-soluble and may cause infection. MS does not affect the basic fertility of either men or women, although sexual problems may interfere with the ability of a man with MS to father a baby. ""Dry orgasms"" that impair fertility, have been reported by men with MS in several studies. These problems have been successfully treated with medication or through techniques to harvest sperm for insemination. Men who are concerned about fertility issues should consult a urologist experienced in this area. Women and men with MS are also advised that they must make the same decisions and take the same precautions regarding birth control and sexually transmitted diseases as anyone else.

b5002937-d621-44d4-b19d-97cc5389970e,"MS-UK Counsellor Kerry Trevethick offers her advice With COVID-19 continuing to spread, the Government has started to implement social distancing. This means increasing our distance from others including avoiding social places such as pubs, theatres and gatherings, avoiding unnecessary travelling and working from home where possible. For people living with (MS) and some groups of people, the advice is that they should self-isolate and stay at home for up to 12 weeks. Whilst these measures are supposed to protect the most vulnerable in our society and slow down the spread of the virus, they can have a detrimental impact on our mental and emotional wellbeing. Below are some tips that may help you manage your mental health during this difficult time. Try to spend some time in nature. The advice is, you are currently able to go for a walk if you keep a safe distance from other people. If you are unable to do this then try to get outside – spending time in the garden or on a balcony can be helpful. If this isn’t possible try sitting by an open window and watching the birds and trees. Mindful activities such as colouring in, guided meditation and puzzles, for example, can help you manage anxiety. There are several apps that can help with this such as subscription apps like Calm and Headspace along with some free apps such as Elefriends and What’s Up? All can be found on the app store on your phone or tablet device. Limit the amount of time you are reading or watching the news. You may also need to limit your use of social media, as there are lots of negative stories at the moment which may make you feel more anxious. Keep to a routine. It may be tempting to sit in your pyjamas all day if you are not going out, but a routine can be important for our mental health. This includes regular meal times, setting up a structure for working and getting up and going to bed at healthy times to ensure you are getting enough sleep, along with finding some time for leisure. It is important that you also do enough in the day to stimulate yourself rather than using the time to lie in bed or sleep. It may be tempting to spend more time in front of a screen, be that the computer, TV, phone or tablet. Make sure you are doing other things such as reading, listening to podcasts, arts and crafts, baking, or doing your favourite hobby. Keep connected. Just because you are self-isolating, this doesn’t mean that you have to cut yourself off from everybody. Keep connected with your friends and family via phone, email, video call or social media. Talk about your feelings, anxieties, worries or concerns with friends or family members. If this isn’t possible then try using a helpline such as the Samaritans on 116 123. If you have any worries about how this may impact your MS then call the MS-UK Helpline free on 0800 783 0518 or think about accessing the . Lots of people in communities are offering help at the moment, be that going to the shop for you, or for a friendly phone call – if you need the support, please use it, you are not a burden. Try to maintain a healthy diet and keep as physically active as possible. Remember that these measures are just temporary, they will pass, and it is important to look after yourself both physically and emotionally at this time. Guest blog: 5 steps to kick-start mindfulness for your MS Wellness coach and Director of Work.Live.Thrive Zoe Flint, discusses what you can do to boost relaxation which can help boost your immune and central nervous systems The first thing to do is to prioritise relaxation as an essential part of your health. My experience of delivering mindfulness courses for MS-UK, has shown me that very few clients typically think of themselves first. The vast majority are far more concerned about their family and friends than their own wellbeing. Whilst this is a lovely quality, “you can’t pour from an empty cup”, as they say. In order to be there for friends and family, we must prioritise our own wellbeing. There are many practices you can try, and below are my top recommendations for beginning to develop your relaxation practice. Give each a try and see which you enjoy most, set yourself some time daily to practice (like learning a musical instrument, learning a relaxation practice takes motivation, determination and regular practice, enabling your brain to physically rewire itself and prime your mind and body to be able to habitually slip into states of relaxation). Probably the most important and effective way to induce the relaxation response, setting time aside to breathe slowly, deeply, and extending the out breath has remarkable effects at reducing stress, anxiety and panic - Breathe in slowly, filling the lungs completely to a count of 5. Breathe out, slowly and completely, to a count of 7. Repeat until you feel a noticeable sense of relaxation. Struggling? Download ‘Breath2Relax’ at the App store.  Mindfulness is a brain training meditation practice that originated in Buddhism 2,000 years ago. There is a wealth of research into its effectiveness at reducing stress and anxiety, increasing focus, reducing pain, boosting the immune system, reducing fatigue and increasing a sense of acceptance. There are also studies specific to MS that show a decrease in symptoms.  - Sit comfortably, in an upright position. The aim is to be relaxed but alert. Start by taking a few slow, deep breaths, letting go of any thoughts of worry, lamenting or busyness. Spend a few moments focusing on the sensations of breathing. Feel the air as it enters your nose; the temperature, the quality. Focus on its journey down into the lungs. The movement of the body and rib cage as you inhale and exhale.  Notice the change in temperature of the breathe as you exhale. Struggling?  Download the Apps ‘Calm’ or ‘Insight Timer’.  In addition to producing a feeling of calmness and relaxation, this technique helps you to notice areas of the body where tension is held and can ease headaches, muscle stiffness and bring a fresh supply of blood to important muscles. - Start with your feet and work up towards your head.  Scrunch up your toes, hold, and release.  Flex your feet, hold, point your toes, hold, and relax.  Squeeze your calf muscles, release.  Squeeze your thighs, relax.  Attempt to pull your tummy button towards your back.  Hold, and release.  Squeeze your shoulders up to your ears, hold.  Let go.  Make fists with your hands, tense them tightly, hold, release.  Clench your jaw, hold and relax. Sit for a few moments, absorbing the benefits of the practice. Struggling? Search ‘Progressive Muscle Relaxation’ on YouTube. Where’s the place you find the most relaxing? A beach, a walled garden, a meadow, a lagoon? Wherever it is, you can go there in your mind.  Imagine the most relaxing place you can, using all your senses – what would you smell, hear, see and feel? Warm sun on your face, birdsong, cool, soothing water or soft grass under your feet? Let your imagination go wild and spend some time each day in your relaxing place.  Struggling?  Search YouTube for ‘guided relaxations’. So good for our immune systems and wellbeing in general, fun and laughter are often little prioritised in our busy lives. What makes you laugh? Can you make a list of films, podcasts, friends, activities and books that make you laugh out loud?  Laughter released pain relieving endorphins and helps us bond with others.  Use your list to do something daily that you find fun and induces laughter.  Struggling? Try a laughter yoga class! MS-UK Counsellor Rachel Murray reflects on the uncertainty of living with multiple sclerosis We travel through life with varying degrees of and awareness of uncertainty. We like it when we feel certain - it feels safe - and we don’t like the anxiety and fear that uncertainty can bring – for many of us it feels scary and unsafe. A diagnosis of (MS) and living with MS increases the uncertainty experience! Symptoms can be unpredictable and may or may not be connected to MS. Never knowing when a relapse may come along can be daunting, uncertainty about treatment options and their uncertain long and short term effects, uncertainty about MS in workplaces, MS in family life, and MS in the future.  All of these are thought about through the lens of uncertainty and may frighten and worry us. Living with uncertainty as a constant companion can be exhausting and frightening but what if the lens is changed so that uncertainty is viewed as an adventure, as a path we did not expect to be on but as we are… then let’s see what’s around the next corner and make the most of the journey anyway. What if uncertainty becomes openness with curiosity and a willingness to see what unfolds. What if we start to welcome and embrace uncertainty because it opens up a different experience and viewpoint?  What if you meet the challenge of processing and experiencing the journey with MS by choosing the lens of adventure and curiosity over the lens of uncertainty? You may find yourself being surprised along the way. “Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what’s going to happen next. Delicious ambiguity.” — Gilda Radner To find out more about MS-UK Counselling or sign up, visit .

One found that exercise can not only help you manage it in the present, but it can also act as a buffer to protect you from future effects, too. Personal trainer Dom Thorpe specialises in exercise for people with MS and offers an ‘MS Warrior’ programme online. Visit Pile your plate high with prebiotics, because there is evidence that these feed the good bacteria in your gut, and improve the physiological impact of stress. Prebiotics are fibres found in foods such as chicory, Jerusalem artichokes, raw garlic, leeks and onions. When this fibre is digested by beneficial gut bacteria, the microbes release byproducts which researchers think influence brain function. Prebiotics were also found to increase the amount of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep that happens. REM sleep is believed to be critical for promoting recovery from stress, with research showing that those who get more REM sleep after a traumatic event are less likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder. Finally, when you’re in need of a snack, you could do a lot worse than to reach for a handful of walnuts. A found these tasty nuts and their oil may help prepare the body to deal with stress. Other studies have shown omega 3 fatty acids, such as the ones found in walnuts, can reduce bad cholesterol and inflammation markers in the body.

Today is World Mental Health Day and our MS-UK Counselling team are looking at common mental health myths head on… Myths and beliefs about mental health issues can be instilled in us from an early age. These myths and beliefs are not designed to harm – they are passed to us in good faith mainly from parental figures, care givers and the environment in which we develop. These myths are designed to protect us from emotional issues rather than support us. The result is that we learn how to suppress our emotions rather than express them. Here are some common myths we often come across as counsellors with MS-UK… Mental health problems are widespread. According to around one in four people will experience a mental health problem each year and they can affect people from every walk of life. Myth 2 - I can’t do anything to support someone with a mental health problem Ask how somebody is doing. It’s highly unlikely that you will make things worse. In fact, it may be that your relative, friend or colleague needs to talk to somebody and you ask them how they are doing helps them to open up about how they are feeling People want to feel heard. You offering a listening ear can often help more than you realise. Try not to judge what the person is saying, even though what you are hearing may be shocking. They are being brave talking to you Sometimes the person may feel worried or feel embarrassed about what they may have shared with you and wonder how you are going to act around them going forward. Try and treat them in the same way as you did before they opened up to you It is OK to ask if somebody wants to talk more than once. It may be that the first time you asked them they didn’t feel able or ready to talk but they feel able to talk now Myth 3 - People experiencing mental health problems aren’t able to work People living with mental health problems can hold down a successful job. If one in four people experience a mental health problem each year these statistics suggest that in fact we probably all work with someone who is experiencing a mental health problem. Myth 4 - People with mental health problems can’t recover People can and do recover from mental health conditions and recovery means being able to live, work, learn and participate in the community. There is lots of different support and help available to help people recover. Mental health problems may not go away forever but lots of people with mental health problems still work, have families and friends, engage in hobbies and interests and lead full lives. Myth 5 - People living with mental health conditions are usually violent and unpredictable Most people living with mental health conditions are not violent. In fact, somebody with mental illness is actually more likely to be a victim of violence than to inflict it. According to , the movement working to end mental health discrimination, the majority of violent crimes are committed by people who do not have mental health problems. It also states people with mental health problems pose more of a danger to themselves than to others, with 90% of people dying through suicide having experienced mental distress. Myth 6 - Young people just go through ups and down as part of puberty – it doesn’t mean anything One in eight young people experience a mental health problem, according to the NHS’s Mental Health of Children and Young People 2017 report. This statistic is widely thought to just be the tip of the iceberg. You may find it helpful to look at the charity, Young Minds. Visit . Myth 7 - People with mental health problems are lazy and should try harder to snap out of it This is not true. There are many reasons why someone may have a mental health problem and being lazy or weak is not one of them. People cannot just snap out of a mental health problem and many people may need help to get better. This help may include counselling, medication, self help and support from friends and family. Depressive disorders occur at high rates among patients with MS and this can have a major, negative impact on quality of life for people living with multiple sclerosis, according to a . However, counselling can be helpful in finding ways to talk about thoughts and feelings associated with MS. It is World Mental Health Day and in this guest blog, Julie tells us why she took years to come to terms with her diagnosis of MS and how MS-UK Counselling has helped her… ‘To this day I struggle to think about the day I was given the news of my . Unfortunately, it was dealt with dreadfully. I was on my own and not prepared at all. The consultant showed me my MRI scan and quite bluntly said the only thing she could think was that it was MS. I could barely breathe but knew I had to try to listen so as not to miss any information. She asked me what I was doing later that afternoon and I replied that I was due to go on holiday with my husband and daughter. She said: ‘Have a good time and try not to think about it too much.’ I couldn't believe what I was hearing, the sheer insensitivity. It took me years to accept my diagnosis and to learn to accept it.’ ‘I first noticed something was wrong around 2009 whilst on a charity walk. After around 40 minutes my right foot felt wobbly and slapped the ground. I didn't take much notice and for the next few years, nothing changed much until one day when I was meeting a friend in town. I parked a way out and by the time I got to the centre my right leg really ached and I couldn't control my foot. I made an appointment with my GP who couldn't find anything much but referred me for physiotherapy. Physio had no effect and when I described the of weakness, a tickling sensation and pins and needles I was referred for an MRI of my spine. This came back as normal but the consultant decided I should have further imaging of my head and neck and it was this scan that showed the lesions.’ ‘One day, my MS nurse pointed out that every year I bring up the bad experience I had when I was diagnosed, and maybe I should consider some .  ‘I had no reservations about accepting help and found it a relief to talk to my counsellor. My first session was comforting and I felt listened to and cared for. I felt I mattered.  ‘The service has helped immensely. I have discovered I am actually stronger than I thought and have learned coping mechanisms for the times that are tricky.  ‘I would say to anybody struggling emotionally not to wait as I did and to seek help. It is available, and any good GP will help, or you can self-refer. The good thing about the MS-UK Counselling service is that the people have knowledge of the disease which makes a huge difference.  ‘I have also found exercise and meditation hugely beneficial in helping with anxiety.’ MS-UK Counselling is confidential and open to anyone living with multiple sclerosis.

Guest blog: ‘Someone who is independent, who doesn’t know me but just wants to support and help …’ As part of our series of blogs today for World Mental Health day, Adam tells us about his first counselling session with MS-UK and how he felt supported to open up to someone who was completely removed from his experiences of living with multiple sclerosis… ‘I was first diagnosed with (MS) in March 2018 after one episode of symptoms. After I was told the news I was initially in a state of shock and just remember my wife bursting onto tears. I didn’t want to see or speak to anybody and I just couldn’t believe what was happening. ‘I have four children and all I could think of was them. I had a million questions in my head. How would I look after them? Would they end up looking after me? ‘The biggest feelings were ones of guilt and helplessness. I felt like the diagnosis meant my life was pretty much over and I would be a burden to those I am closest to. The feelings of helplessness were due to the lack of information and the unpredictability of the disease. Everything is a ‘maybe’ as each person is different so it’s a difficult diagnosis to understand and explain to others. ‘I found the and the MS Trust a great way of not only explaining the condition to friends and family but also for me to understand the condition and that the things I was feeling were normal. ‘I saw a tweet from MS-UK which mentioned the service and I thought to myself that it couldn’t hurt to try. The idea of counselling did have an appeal. ‘I feel lucky as I have a great support network but it’s hard sometimes when you do want to talk about MS but don’t want the guilt of burdening someone close to you. I did have reservations, mainly because it was a new experience and that unnatural feeling that comes from sharing things with a stranger. Fear of being judged came into it as well, although I quickly realised this was not something to worry about. ‘The first session left me feeling so positive. It was just so nice to have someone really listening. Someone who is independent, who doesn’t know me but just wants to support and help. ‘When we went through the initial checklist of things I may be struggling with, I did have a realisation that some of them were affecting me more than I thought. You do wonder how talking through things will actually help and this is perhaps the biggest reservation, but after just one session I absolutely understood how I could benefit from the service. ‘Counselling has helped me really think about my needs and gave me the opportunity to be reflective in my thoughts about how I interact with people, what I enjoy doing and how to feel positive about the future. ‘This service also helped me feel empowered to talk through some of the anxieties I was feeling living with MS. It really did feel like a journey and I do think about decisions and choices in a different and more positive manner. ‘I have definitely got better at recognising the things I’m proud of now, no matter how small. Using the MS-UK counselling service has made me realise that sometimes the simplest achievements can be proud moments to celebrate.’ MS-UK Counselling is confidential and open to anyone living with multiple sclerosis.

In this guest blog, David lets us know why he and his partner Anne-Marie are taking on the challenge of the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 this weekend, and the incredible journey they have been on to get to this point... I made a promise to my dad twenty years ago that one day I would do a charity event and raise money for (MS). My dad is 83 and had relapsing-remitting MS for 40 years and I have seen first-hand how this disease not only affects the person but also the family.  So, after twenty years of procrastinating, my partner Anne-Marie and I decided to finally hold true to my word. I was already in the RideLondon-100 so we looked at MS charities for Anne-Marie. Thankfully we spoke to Jenny at MS-UK who was enthusiastic and welcoming and that sealed our decision. I know a lot of people use places as a way of getting into an event they wanted to do anyway but if there was one bit of advice I could ever give someone, it would be to pick a charity that means something to you. For all those rainy days you don’t feel like training, for all the times your bum hurts (even with a litre of chamois cream slapped over it), for all those times you are halfway up a steep hill wondering why you aren’t slouched on the couch chowing down on popcorn, knowing why you are putting yourself through this makes such a difference to your resolve and dedication. Training went well until one sunny May afternoon, I had a collision with a car whilst out cycling. The end result was a road closure, ambulance, two police cars, a suspected broken leg, injured back and hand, stitches in the chin and my bike was written off. Subsequent x-rays and MRIs to my hand and leg miraculously showed nothing broken. By sheer chance, the angle of my knee prevented a far more serious long term knee injury occurring so I feel incredibly lucky. Nevertheless, I was told I would be on crutches for up to 10 weeks and that all cycle events would be out until September.  This was devasting for both myself and Anne-Marie. To put this into perspective, Anne-Marie is not a confident cyclist. She has never ridden on her own so the thought of her cycling 100 miles solo scared her to death.  She continued to train on an indoor bike in the gym but only for an hour at a time which wouldn’t be enough to get her in shape for a 100 mile ride outside. She also suffered far more than me after my accident. My damage was physical but Anne-Marie’s was mental. From a lack of sleep due to nightmares leaving her exhausted, from having to be my carer for five weeks leaving little time for the bike, to seeing her partner in almost constant pain, her confidence plummeted. But this is where choosing a charity that means something to you is so important. Despite all her fears, she knew she wouldn’t pull out. It was too important a promise to go back on. After a few weeks of mental turmoil, she made a last-minute decision to try the Tour of Cambridge on her own. A massive feat for her and one I am so proud of her for. In the meantime, I had been rehabbing for up to two hours a day. I developed a huge admiration for people like my dad who, because of their MS, have to ‘rehab’ every day just to keep mobile and functioning.  I remember the first day I managed to do a full revolution of a pedal stroke in the gym. It took me 10 minutes to get my leg over the top of the pedal stroke and it felt amazing. Within a week I managed five minutes on an indoor bike. A week later I double that time to 10 minutes and a week later I tried 20 minutes. Each time I felt exhausted and despite the Physio telling me there was no way I would get to the start line of the RideLondon, the prospect of being there with all the other MS-UK riders really made me want to give it a shot. Despite everyone telling me not to overdo it, I cautiously overdid it and increased my longest ride from 20 miles to 25 to 35 to 53 to 70 miles on subsequent sessions with Anne-Marie always by my side. At the end of each ride, I felt exhausted and would fall asleep in a sweaty mess. So here we are today. My max longest ride will have been 70 miles. I don’t feel ready for the event, my hand still hurts but I’ll give it a jolly good bash. I can honestly say if it wasn’t for the importance of the charity, I wouldn’t have tried anyway near as hard on the rehab. Anne-Marie would have certainly dropped out of the event too but she feels a connection to the charity through me and my family.  Seeing the effort families put in to helping their loved ones, seeing the effort those suffering from MS put into daily life means that you can’t help but feel motivated and inspired to put that little bit more into your own daily life. For those who are reading this who are doing the event, I look forward to seeing you on the start line. I also look forward to seeing you (hopefully) at the finish line. It’s all for a great cause and the journey has been unexpectedly up and down but also an amazing growing experience for both of us. In the final part of our self-esteem trilogy, MS-UK Counsellor Louise Willis offers some more empowering tips for good mental health... Mindfulness is a bit of a buzzword and that is for good reason. With practice, mindfulness can change the way our brains work and instill a sense of calm. Far from its roots in traditional Buddhist practice, mindfulness of today is about taking your focus out from the past which we can’t change and the future which is yet to happen and putting it firmly in the present. This can be done in a number of ways from focusing on the body to the external senses. Holding on to grudges and past hurts has been likened to ‘putting your hand into a fire but expecting it to burn the other person’. It might feel like the right thing to do, but what does it really accomplish? Forgiveness is surprisingly seldom about the other person but about the feelings and beliefs that we carry with us from the precipitating event. Forgiveness is a private decision and it is not necessary to tell the other person that we have forgiven them. Of course, forgiveness of the self is just as important, as feelings of shame can be overwhelming, we are human after all and everyone makes mistakes. It’s easy to fall into a rut of negative talk, but by changing the wording it can have a transformative effect on how we feel about ourselves. Remember that coach from school or any other supportive and encouraging role model you have had the joy of spending time with? Be your own cheerleader – ‘you can do it, you are worthy and you are loveable’. By setting ourselves small achievable goals throughout the week we can begin to see that we can do the things we set our minds to. Whether it is finishing that book, learning to crochet, phoning an old friend or putting time aside for self-care, it shows ourselves and others that we care for and value ourselves. Log three things you are grateful for every other day, they don’t have to be big things. A smile from the lady in the newsagents, a bird on the windowsill or simply an hour of your favourite TV show. By feeling and acknowledging the small moments in our life that we often take for granted, we can start to build a more accurate model of what our life is really like rather than focusing on the negative parts. Last week, MS-UK Counsellor Louise Willis looked at what self-esteem is, this week she will look at how we can help to build a healthy level of self-esteem We have all done this, whether it’s how we speak to ourselves when we make a mistake or our general internal narrative. When we talk to ourselves in a negative way we have no filter to say ‘hey, that is not true’ or even to question it as we may to a friend if they were to say it. Would you expect someone who is being spoken to negatively to have high self-esteem? You are a valid and unique person like everyone else. Treat yourself with the respect you need and others will too. Spending time doing your favourite hobby, getting a massage, reading a good book, enjoying time outside or a long relaxing bath are all ways to show ourselves that we care. Being assertive is not about taking control or being aggressive or forceful, but about kindly and calmly stating your needs or wants with respect to both yourself and others. Assertive communication uses ‘I’ statements as a way of owning thoughts and feelings and always calmly listening to and acknowledging the other person. Practicing saying ‘No’, planning conversations in advance and offering alternatives is also helpful in assertive communication. Having stable and reliable boundaries affords us and others the security to know where we stand in relationships. For those with low self-esteem, boundaries can often be weak and the more we allow others to cross them, the more out of control we can feel. Developing boundaries is not only healthy for us but is essential for healthy relationships. We can often adopt negative ‘core’ beliefs about ourselves. These can rear their ugly heads in times of hardship and illness. When challenged, these beliefs are rarely true but because they have been there since early life, we often don’t even realise we have them. When we view our life through the lens of a negative belief, we will see mostly negative outcomes. Happily, these beliefs can be challenged and changed for new, more helpful ones which in turn will begin to build self-esteem.

It affects quality of life and correlates with worsened disease outcome. Out approach is to try to systematically identify and treat this problem early and effectively. Q: How common are cognitive disorders present in MS? The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MS is estimated to be between 40 and 65 percent (Bobholz and Rao, 2003; Benedict, Zivadinov, 2011). The cognitive abilities most often affected include episodic memory (recall of previously studied information, like a shopping list or story), working memory (temporary on-line maintenance and manipulation of information), divided attention (multi-tasking ability), and speed processing. Language, executive, and visuospatial functions are relatively spared. However, there is considerable variation in the neuropsychological presentation of MS patients. For example, one study identified six distinct cognitive profiles among patients with relapsing MS entering a trial of interferon-β1a (Fischer, 1999). The largest subgroup, which included 34% of the sample, was cognitively intact. Only 2% showed global cognitive impairment across multiple cognitive domains. The remainder showed circumscribed deficits in two to three cognitive domains. At the Mellen Center, we specifically inquire about the presence of cognitive symptoms at each visit. This is done both in our previsit screening questionnaire and as part of our review of symptoms for each visit. If this is an issue for the patient or their families, we inquire more deeply into this issue. Q: What other factors need to be considered when a patient states they have cognitive problems? (Differential diagnosis) Early in the process of cognitive evaluation for MS patients, other facts should be considered. Standard assessment of laboratory parameters used for general cognitive disorders should be undertaken (For example, thyroid indices and vitamin B12 level). The patient should have an assessment for depression to ensure that the problem is not primarily related to an emotional disorder (see below). Questions about sleep disturbance should be asked as sleep disorders are common in MS and may affect cognitive abilities. The medication the patient is taking should be evaluated for negative impact on cognition. Q: Do physical disability, disease course, and disease duration correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Level of physical disability, as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), has at best a modest correlation with severity of cognition in MS. This is not surprising since the EDSS is heavily influenced by non-cognitive signs and symptoms, such as ambulation. Several studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction is greater in secondary progressive than in relapsing-remitting MS (Gaudino, Chiaravalloti et al.,2001). Cross-sectioning studies have found only a modest relationship between duration of the disease and the extent of cognitive impairment. As noted above, this is likely due to the inter-patient variability in the presentation of cognitive disorders. It is important to note that cognitive changes can occur early in the course of the disease (Deloire, Salort et al.,2005) and, in some patients, may never occur. Longitudinal neuropsychological studies of MS patients studied over an extended period of time suggest that approximately 5-10 percent of patients experience a discernible worsening of cognitive functioning over the course of a year (Amato et al., 2001). Unlike patients with progressive dementias, MS patients with cognitive impairment can be stable for years. In addition, recent cases reports have noted cognitive impairment as a sole manifestation of relapse of MS, with cognitive declines correlating with new lesion formation on MRI imaging. For the above reasons we also do not assume that patients with physical disabilities are cognitively impaired, now do we assume that those without physical impairment are cognitively intact. Q: Do abnormalities detected on brain MRI scans correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Compared to demographic and disease variables, neuroimaging indices correlate relatively well with cognition in MS. Several studies have demonstrated an inverse relation between cognitive performance and the number of volume of lesions on conventional MRI, including T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging (Rovaris and Filippi, 200). Regionally specific relations between lesion volume and cognition have been reported. For example, one study showed specific relations between frontal lobe involvement and executive functions, like conceptual reasoning (Arnett, Rao et al., 1994). Some studies have suggested that brain atrophy is a better predictor of cognitive impairment in MS than lesion volume (Bermel, Bakshi et al., 2002; Benedict, Weinstock-Guttman et al., 2004). Longitudinal studies have shown a relation between progressive brain atrophy and cognitive changes patterns in MS (Hohol, Buttman et al., 1997). There are occasional patients with subacute cognitive changes that correlate with the presence of new lesions, so that a new complaint of cognitive dysfunction may prompt further imaging to assess for disease activity (Pardini, 204). Recent studies indicate that cortical lesions are not only present in early clinical MS, but may be as common as white matter lesions (Lucchinetti 2011). Such lesions and associated tract degeneration may underly some component of the cognitive dysfunction in MS. Note that in addition there are patients with prominent cognitive symptoms with limited lesion burden or atrophy on brain imaging. In such patients, we would assess carefully for other factors such as medication, sleep disturbance, and depression masquerading as cognitive deficits (See below). Q: Do cognitive disorders correlate with other factors related to MS (for example, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders)? Emotional problems, sleep disorders, and fatigue are significantly more common in individuals with MS than in the general population. Although the relationship among these symptoms may be complex, depression has been reported to affect cognitive test performance in the areas of rapid information processing, working memory, and executive function in MS patients (Arnett, Higginson et al., 2001). Although subjective reports of fatigue do not necessarily correlate with observable deficits in cognitive function, decrements in cognitive performance occur during sustained mental effort and after completion of cognitively challenging tasks in MS patients (Krupp and Elkins, 2000; Schwid, Tyler et al., 2003). It is reasonable to assume that patients' performance may be compromised if they are significantly depressed, fatigued, or sleep deprived during cognitive testing. There are many medicines used in MS care that may have a negative impact on cognition. We assess these medicines in our patients with cognitive deficits and consider whether they can be changed to alternative medicines or whether they can be weaned off. Medicines that have such an impact include steroids (particularly IV high dose solumedrol), anticholinergics such as oxybutynin, tricyclic antidepressants, sedatives, beta blockers, muscle relaxants, etc. In addition, the chronic use of marijuana and related substances can have a negative effect on cognition. Sleep disorders may be seen with MS and may affect daytime cognitive performance. We do inquire about sleep at the Mellen Center and consider expert evaluation depending on symptoms presented (for example, snoring, restless leg, periodic leg movements, repeated awakenings, etc). There are documented events where subacute cognitive impairment is the only clinical manifestation of a relapse documented by a decline in neuropsychological function and imaging findings of new lesion formation. A subacute decline in cognition should prompt both a search for factors such as infection, new medications, or emerging illness, or imaging to assess for new lesion activity. Q: How can cognitive disorders be detected in the clinical setting? A: We note that patient self-report of cognitive deficits in unreliable. Patients with MS who are depressed will report cognitive impairment, while patients with cognitive deficits may under report their deficits. An informant (family member, close friend) is critical to assist in giving history to document cognitive impairment. One method for identifying cognitive dysfunction is to administer rating questionnaires to patients and their family members. One such scale is the MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ), a 15-item self-informant-report inventory (Benedict, Cox et al., 2004). Results suggest that informant ratings of cognitive problems are more likely to correlate with objective neuropsychological tests than patient self-reports. Unfortunately, informant ratings are not always available in the clinical setting. An alternative approach is to use a brief cognitive screening examination. One commonly used test, the Mini-Mental State Examination, has been found to be insensitive to the cognitive impairments in MS. Performing extensive cognitive testing can be too time consuming for centers with limited staff, yet performing an annual cognitive screen may be necessary as part of ongoing MS care. Langdon and others (2012) extensively reviewed the literature on neuropsychological measures in MS. They determined that the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), with the possible addition of the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised learning trials, is a reasonable screen. Their expert panel judged these studies to be preferred over others when rated on psychometric qualities (reliability, validity, and sensitivity), an international application, ease administration, feasibility in the specified context, and acceptability to patients. The SDMT consists of single digits paired with abstract symbols. The patient must say the number corresponding with each symbol. The test can be administered and scored within 5 minutes. It is a sensitive test of information processing speed that is preferentially affected in MS patients. It is well validated against multiple MRI measures and has minimal practice effect. One problem with the standard SDMT is that there are not multiple versions, so as a repeated measures test this would be subject to a training effect. The California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition comprises a 16 item word list, with four items belonging to each of 4 categories. This is read aloud 5 times in the same order to the patient at a rate slightly slower than 1 per second. This test can be completed in 5-10 minutes including instructions, testing, and responses. This test has also been validated with brain MRI measures. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised Learning T1-3 requires the patient to inspect a 2x3 stimulus array of abstract geometric figures. There are three learning trials of 10 seconds, then the stimulus is removed and the patient is required to draw the array from memory. This study also correlates with a variety of MRI measures. Other measures which could be used include the PASAT, MOCA test, and others. At the Mellen Center we screen both with items on a self-reported quality of life scale as well as in our review of symptoms. We have not systematically used screening tools in out entire population though this would be a reasonable approach as well. Q: What is the role of neuropsychology in ascertaining and monitoring cognition? The brief cognitive screening batteries described above could be administered by a non-neuropsychologist to determine if an MS patient is experiencing some form of cognitive dysfunction. Such a result is of limited importance, however, if not tied into specific clinical management. For this to happen, it is common to refer MS patients for a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment performed by a board certified clinical neuropsychologist. Such as assessment typically entails three to four hours of testing and includes a clinical interview. Comprehensive assessments can provide detailed baseline and follow-up data as well as information that pertains to complex matters such as differential diagnosis (e.g. MS dementia versus Alzheimer's disease in an elderly patient), guidance for rehabilitation or therapies, or determination of disability status. Neuropsychology testing can be particularly helpful if work or school related performance has been questioned, potentially leading to recommendation for accommodations (for example, breaks between tasks, more time for examinations, quieter workspace, part time work, etc.) Referral to a clinical neuropsychologist, board-certified by the American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, is recommended. Q: What non-medication interventions exist for cognitive dysfunction? Non pharmacologic treatment for cognitive impairment in MS, variously described as cognitive retraining, cognitive remediation, or cognitive rehabilitation among other labels, includes three main approaches: (1) restorative therapies that aim to improve specific abilities, (2) compensatory approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of cognitive strategies, and (3) adaptive approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of external aids and modifications (Amato and Zipoli, 2003). Recent studies have begun to assess interventions specifically designed to improve targeted aspects of learning and memory in MS (Chiaravalloti, DeLuca et al., 2005). A recent Cochrane Review found low level evidence for the benefit of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS patients (Rosti-Otajarvi 2004). Variations in study design and conduct precluded a strong recommendation for such rehabilitative strategies. In addition to the direct treatment of cognition, it is useful to detect and treat comorbidities such as depression and fatigue that can influence cognition and quality of life (Amato and Zipoli, 2003; Bagert, Camplair et al., 2002; Bakshi, 2003). Cognitive-behavioral counseling based in neuropsychological principles has been shown to improve insight and social skills, leading to a reduction in disinhibition and social aggressiveness in cognitively impaired MS patients (Benedict, Shaprio et al., 2001) In addition, a single study indicated reduced brain atrophy in patients actively exercising, which might have an impact on cognition (Lovera, 2010). Compensatory strategies may be helpful. These include a simplified schedule of activities, reminder lists or other strategies, reducing clutter in the household, among others. Where available, vocational rehabilitation may be useful to counsel the patient on alternatives or adaptions which might assist them in the workplace. In general populations, various preventive strategies to spare cognition have been supported by epidemiological or clinical trials data. These may be worth discussing with patients concerned about preventing cognitive decline: Treating hypertension, diabetes, and other vascular risk factors Data on brain training is limited at the present time. Q: What medication approaches are there for cognitive dysfunction? Treatment of cognitive problems in MS has received relatively little clinical or empirical attention in the past. However, recent years have seen the emergence of studies of pharmacologic interventions that have undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny in well-designed clinical trials (Doraiswamy and Rao, 2004). Prevention of cognitive impairment in MS is an important target of therapy. Some disease-modifying medications have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognition (e.g., Fischer, Priore et al. 2000). Pharmacologic strategies used to treat cognitive impairment in other disorders may have a beneficial effect on MS. A randomized, placebo-controlled study demonstrated a modest but statistically significant benefit of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil on memory test performance in MS (Krupp, Christodoulou et al., 2004). However, a larger multicenter study of donepezil did not confirm this finding (Krupp et al 2011). It may also be helpful to minimize, when possible, the use of medications with potential adverse cognitive consequences, such as bladder-control medications with anticholinergic effects (Tsao and Heilman, 2005). A randomized multicenter study of memantine 10mg bid in MS patients with cognitive symptoms shows more fatigue and neurological adverse events than patients on placebo and no positive effect on cognition. Higher doses of memantine may have more cognitive side effects in this population as well. Other medications considered for use in this population have not been tested in a randomized trial way. These include activating antidepressants, stimulants, and modafinil. There is limited data to support the use of these medications in this situation. Q: What do families need to think of when there are cognitive disorders? Independent of the severity of physical disability, cognitive dysfunction can have a major impact on employment and activities of daily living in MS (Rao, Leo et al., 1991). Severity of cognitive impairment, as measured by neuropsychological testing, is predictive of ability to drive (Schultheis, Garay et al., 2002), employment status (Benedict, 2005; Rao, Leo et al., 1991), success in rehabilitation (Langdon and Thompson, 1999), and social skills (Knight, Devereux et al., 1997). It is critical that patients and family members receive accurate information and psychosocial counseling to assist them in coping with these sometimes intractable consequences of MS. There are specific recommendations available on the assessment and management of cognitive impairment in MS which may be useful to families and patients with such impairment (Benedict Zacharia, et al., 2006). Specific considerations to discuss with families include safety (to avoid falls, wandering, injury); financial oversight; and driving safety. Bobholz, JA and Rao, SM (2003).

b798f00f-ab82-425d-bced-df86bc66cfec,"Can Radiology Be Used to Diagnose Multiple Sclerosis? Medically reviewed by — — is a chronic disease of your central nervous system (CNS). It’s thought to be the result of an immune system attack. MS causes demyelination, or the damage of myelin. This is the protective layer that surrounds your nerve fibers. As scar tissue (lesions) forms, it interferes with nerve signals within the CNS. People with relapsing-remitting MS experience periods of increased disease activity followed by remissions. Progressive forms of MS cause symptoms that steadily worsen. There are many symptoms associated with MS, depending on the location of the lesions. Severity of symptoms varies significantly from person to person. Some common symptoms include: balance and coordination problems or unsteady gait Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made it easier to diagnose MS and monitor disease progression. An MRI can provide different information, depending on how it’s done. Types of MRI and radiology tests that may be used for MS include: Using contrast dye to detect active inflammation, this scan highlights new lesions or lesions that are growing. It can also show dark areas that indicate possible permanent damage. This scan detects all old and new lesions and helps gauge total disease progression. As a more sensitive scan, this test can help identify brain lesions. This test can detect lesions within your spinal cord. This scan, involving radiation, can also detect areas of demyelination, but with less detail than MRI. There’s not much preparation for an MRI, but there are some important considerations. Due to the strong magnetic field, some conditions may make it unsafe or require special preparation. Let your doctor and MRI technician know if you: have an implanted medical device, such as a , drug infusion device, cochlear implant, or aneurysm clips If you’re claustrophobic or anxious about the procedure, tell your doctor in advance. A mild prescription sedative may help. For an MRI of your spine, wear clothing that’s easy to change. Even if you’re only having images taken of your brain, you’ll still need to choose clothes with no metal, such as zippers or snaps. You may be required to wear a hospital gown. You’ll be asked to remove jewelry and other metal objects. You may need to leave your valuables in another room. Most hospitals provide a locker for safekeeping. Your doctor or facility should provide you with instructions before the day of your scheduled test. Preparation for a CT scan is similar to that of an MRI. If your test will be done with contrast dye, you may be asked not to eat solid foods for a few hours before the test. Your MRI may be performed with or without contrast. Contrast dye is given to you through an IV in your arm. You’ll lie on a table that slides into the tube-shaped MRI machine. Earphones help you communicate with the technician, who will monitor from another room. MRI is noisy. You’ll hear loud banging sounds. Some facilities offer music via the earphones to help drown out the noise. You’ll also have a call button in case you feel claustrophobic or anxious. You must remain perfectly still during scanning. Any movement could ruin the scans. The procedure is painless and you won’t feel anything. Length of the procedure depends on how many scans are being done and if they’re done both with and without contrast. It generally takes at least one hour but could take much longer. Like MRI, the CT scanner doesn’t touch you and you won’t feel anything. You’ll be required to remain still. The scanner makes some noise as it moves and captures images. You’ll be able to dress and go home as soon as scanning is complete. If you were given an IV it will be removed. If you took a sedative, you’ll need someone to drive you home. MS was a lot more difficult to diagnose before MRI was available. The detailed images are an excellent way to detect MS lesions, which appear as white spots in the brain or spinal column. However, other things can cause white spots, so they don’t necessarily mean you have MS. A single lesion accompanied by symptoms of MS is usually diagnosed as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS can sometimes develop into MS. Multiple lesions may indicate MS. The diagnosis usually requires at least two lesions within your CNS that occurred at separate points in time. A radiologist will study the MRI or CT scans and prepare a report for your doctor to share with you. There’s no single test for MS. To make a proper diagnosis, your doctor will consider your clinical evaluation, symptom history, and other test results. Other diagnostic tests may include: This will check for antibodies sometimes found in people with MS and can also help rule out similar conditions. These study how well electrical signals in your CNS work. No blood test can diagnose MS, but they can help rule out quite a few other conditions with similar symptoms. There are a variety of medications used in the treatment of MS: are designed to slow progression and lower the relapse rate. Most are self-injectable, but a few are given intravenously. Some newer drugs are available in pill form. are generally used to reduce inflammation during relapses. Individual symptoms can also be treated. Options may include: medication to treat fatigue, muscle spasms, or other symptoms Your individual outlook depends on the type and severity of the disease, as well other health factors. While there’s no cure for MS, there are a variety of treatments and ways of managing your MS. is close to normal, averaging about seven years less than the general population. This is mainly due to complications or other health problems. It’s rare, but MS can be fatal. Good lifestyle habits not only help you feel better, but they help prevent additional health problems. That’s why you should strive for a well-balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. If you use a disease-modifying drug, it must be taken exactly as directed. Follow up with your doctor regularly. Most people with MS continue to lead active, fulfilling lives. Having some symptoms isn’t enough to conclude you have MS. These symptoms can be caused by a variety of conditions. That’s why it’s important to investigate the cause. Start with your family physician. If necessary, you’ll be referred to a neurologist. Symptoms of MS can come and go, so diagnosis can take time. Radiology tests can be a key in your diagnosis and maintenance. It’s also a good idea to keep a symptom diary. Keep track of your symptoms, when they started, and when they stopped. That information will help your doctor decide on the next steps.

0b24641a-4832-4a4c-9459-a254ff50dbce,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Conference Convened to Find Solutions for Vision Problems Experienced By People with MS Conference Convened to Find Solutions for Vision Problems Experienced By People with MS Vision problems are among the most common MS symptoms, and often serve as the first symptom of the disease. Vision problems can affect a person’s ability to work and perform other activities of daily living. To review what’s currently known, to explore the role of vision as an outcome in clinical trials for new therapies for MS, and to identify areas for future research, a meeting was convened by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis (sponsored by the National MS Society and the European Committee on Treatment and Research in MS). More than 60 world-renowned experts in the fields of MS, neuroophthalmology, and clinical trial design met in Dublin Ireland in November 2013  and now publish their conclusions and recommendations in an open-access article (, ). The article, by Drs. Laura J. Balcer (New York University), David H. Miller (University College London), Stephen C. Reingold (Scientific and Clinical Review Associates, LLC), and Jeffrey A. Cohen (Cleveland Clinic), provides an extensive review of published research related to vision and MS, and summarizes the meeting’s focus on optimal ways to evaluate visual signs and symptoms in people with MS and their impact on quality of life, developing consensus on how to design clinical trials that incorporate vision-related outcomes, and identifying priorities for future vision research. A test called “low-contrast letter acuity” (LCLA) has emerged as a leading candidate to measure visual impairment in MS. This test involves measuring a person’s ability to distinguish grey letters against a white background, whereas standard vision tests use black letters against a white background. LCLA has been shown to correlate with how vision affects quality of life in people with MS. Another relatively new tool for evaluating vision and its impact on MS is optical coherence tomography. OCT is a non-invasive and painless imaging tool for viewing nerve structures at the back of the eye. It provides a potential window not only to see damage to important structures that support proper vision, but also to give a window into how MS may be impacting the central nervous system more generally. Studies using OCT support the idea that impairments observed on LCLA reflect nerve fiber and cell loss in people with MS. OCT also is being used to determine damage to nerve cells known as ganglion cells. This damage has been correlated with MS tissue damage in the cortex (outer layer of the brain) on MRI scans. The authors discussed the use of visual outcomes in clinical trials, including trials of experimental strategies for protecting or repairing the nervous system. Some studies, including two recent trials involving stem cells, enrolled people with MS who had a history of visual problems to determine if treatment results in repair to that damage. Assessing visual outcomes in acute optic neuritis – inflammation of the optic nerve that often presents as the first MS symptom – shows promise as a model for screening neuroprotective and repair strategies. The optic nerve is one of the few locations in the central nervous system that can be assessed directly and noninvasively. Another test discussed was “visual evoked potentials,” which may complement OCT outcomes. “VEPs” measure electrical activity in the brain in response to sensory – in this case visual – input. Participants sit in front of a screen on which an alternating checkerboard pattern is displayed. The readout indicates blocks in nerve impulse conduction, and can provide more information on damage to myelin or nerve fibers. The authors summarized future needs for vision research in MS, including: • studies addressing how measuring visual impairment correlates over time with or predicts more general measures of neurologic disability; • further exploration of blood markers that have been shown to be elevated in people with optic neuritis and other vision problems; • further studies to evaluate vision and visual outcomes in children with MS, to assess similarities and differences compared to adults; • studies that correlate objective visual outcomes with patient-reported outcomes so that the latter would be accepted by regulatory agencies for drug development and approval; • the development of practical methods to assess abnormal eye movements – which are common in MS – in clinical trials. The authors comment that the field of vision research now benefits from a well-organized network of investigators, and that their findings will be important to the development of new MS therapies aiming to restore function. “The capacity for measures of visual function, quality of life, visual pathway structure, and electrophysiology to show not only deterioration but also improvement will be critical in the emerging era of agents that repair and protect the nervous system,” they write.

98d2e8a2-fe82-40b2-9841-cc6d74f51ebe,"Scientists Trying to Reduce Liver Damage Caused by MS Drugs — Researchers say they may be able to identify people with multiple sclerosis who are more likely to develop liver diseases after taking interferon-based medications. Serious liver damage is a risk for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are treating their illness with medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But has found a way to identify people who could experience increased liver enzyme activity if taking an interferon beta. In the 1990s, there were three disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for people with MS called the ABC shots: two interferon betas, Avonex and Betaseron, and one glatiramer acetate, Copaxone. Today, there are 17 DMTs approved by the FDA to treat MS. Five of them are interferon-based drugs delivered via injections. The other options are delivered orally or intravenously (IV). They all come with side effects. DMTs are designed to slow down progression, reduce the number of relapses, lessen the intensity of relapses, and limit brain lesions. They also may prevent a second clinical attack after an initial episode. DMTs vary in strength and results. The stronger the medicine, the worse the side effects and risks. Biotechnology company Biogen voluntarily took MS drug Zinbryta off the market after were raised about liver damage. People taking are monitored for heart disease. Lemtrada, taken through an IV, can produce . It’s usually only prescribed after two other interventions were tried but didn’t work. The clinical trials for Tysabri found patients could progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often fatal viral infection of the brain. can cause swelling behind the eyes, liver problems and PML, but it recently became the first disease-modifying treatment approved by the FDA for pediatric MS. Aubagio, an oral treatment, has that include hair thinning, headaches, and the potential for severe liver injury. Advances are making these treatments safer for people with MS. Experts can measure a biomarker for the presence of JC virus antibodies to prevent PML. In addition, researchers have found a genetic variant, close to a gene called interferon regulatory factor 6 () that may help predict liver injury in people using interferon-beta therapies. Interferons are a commonly prescribed DMTs for people with MS. They have shown a success rate of up to in preventing and shortening relapses as well as reducing new brain lesions. They have also been shown to slow disease progression and cognitive loss. However, they don’t slow the advance of disabilities. Current FDA-approved interferon betas include Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, Extavia, and most recently, , a peginterferon. These drugs are designed to encourage the body’s natural response of activating interferons (proteins) to fight viral infection and inflammation. Interferons are used to treat cancer, viral infection, and MS. “It is known that interferon betas can increase liver enzyme activity,” said Kathy Costello, a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center and the associate vice president of healthcare access for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “This is not terribly uncommon. What is uncommon are severe effects. “This new research suggests that there are people with genomic characteristics that would make them more likely to have the liver enzymes when given interferons,” explained Costello. “A patient could be inclined toward liver damage if taking an interferon but not a different type of DMT, even if the alternative may be known to cause an increase in liver enzyme activity. “This is an important study,” Costello told Healthline. “I’m not aware of others that have corroborated these important results. It is useful information.” People with MS have options when it comes to DMTs if they show a tendency toward liver damage while taking interferons. There are other DMTs that may not cause such problems. Some treatments may result in an increase in liver enzyme activity but not cause liver damage or disease. “This is important for the doctor/patient strategy. Knowing this could inform shared decision-making about risk and fuel the conversation around other options for DMTs,” said Costello. “It may be able to prevent drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in at-risk patients. Maybe they’re monitored more closely.” Healthline caught up with Dr. Jaime Imitola, the director of the Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Multidisciplinary Clinic and Translational Research Program at the Wexner Medical Center at The Ohio State University. He noted the Nature Genetics Journal, which published this study, represents high-quality research. “It is clear that not every patient will respond in the same way [to interferons]” said Imitola. “Some patients will have the propensity to have better outcomes than others. “The effectiveness of these DMTs lie in the drug’s ability to create a response to the interferons,” he explained. Researchers are looking at ways to help protect people with MS from interferon-related liver enzyme activity. One recently looked at the consumption of fish and olive oils and their effect on liver enzyme activity. Experts found that liver enzyme activity changed after six months of consuming fish oil and nine months of consuming olive oil. Those who consumed the oils showed a decrease in mitochondrial ATPase activity and an increase in membrane fluidity, countering the effects of the interferons. The results showed a noticeable difference in participants who consuming the oil compared to the control group. One , recently published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine, presented findings that Chinese herbal medicine may help counter the effects of interferon-based liver damage. The report stated that interferons negatively affect a person’s qi, throwing off a person’s yin-yang balance. In Chinese medicine, this condition is called kidney yin deficiency. Typically, symptoms of this type of qi deficiency include fatigue, dizziness, poor appetite, distended abdomen after meals, diarrhea, and muscle weakness. These symptoms also can be found in people taking interferons. The patient in this case study saw results after two weeks and experienced a 50 percent improvement in their health. The research suggests that Chinese medicine doesn’t cure MS but may offer a possible complementary treatment to Western medicine. “Interferons have been used longer than any other DMTs and are still considered safe,” concluded Imitola, “but some people will have susceptibility because of this gene.” Imitola suggests patients be regularly evaluated, especially those on interferons who are at risk.

Everyone with MS retains the capacity to give and receive love and pleasure, although creative problem-solving is sometimes necessary for some people in order to find avenues for intimate expression. Understanding how MS symptoms might affect intimacy and sexuality represents a crucial step towards overcoming obstacles effectively. Whether one is newly diagnosed, physically disabled, young, mature, single or in a long-term relationship, MS does not diminish the universal human need to give and receive love and intimate pleasure. The sexual partnership can be challenged by changes within a relationship, such as one person becoming the other’s caregiver. Similarly, changes in employment status or role performance within the household are often associated with emotional adjustments that can temporarily interfere with sexual expression. The strain of coping with MS may challenge a couple’s efforts to communicate openly about their respective experiences and their changing needs for sexual expression and fulfilment. Watch the ‘Sex life and MS’ animation which looks at a few of the challenges that some people with MS may experience. This animation was originally created by the Italian MS Society. We worked with some of our member organisations in Australia, Denmark, Italy, India, Lebanon, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom to adapt and translate the animation so it can be shared globally. Sexual changes in MS: frequency and characteristics Studies have been completed on the prevalence of sexual and relationship problems in MS in a number of countries. Although normal sexual function changes throughout the lifespan, MS can affect an individual’s sexual experience in a variety of ways. Studies on the prevalence of sexual problems in MS indicate that 40-80 per cent of women and 50-90 per cent of men have sexual complaints or concerns. The most frequently reported changes in men are a diminished capacity to attain or maintain an erection, and difficulty having an orgasm. The most frequent changes that women report are a partial or total loss of libido (sexual desire), vaginal dryness/irritation, diminished orgasm, and uncomfortable sensory changes in the genitals. Sexual changes in MS can best be characterised as primary, secondary or tertiary. Primary sexual dysfunction stems from changes to the nervous system that directly impair the sexual response and/or sexual feelings. Primary disturbances can include partial or total loss of libido, unpleasant or decreased sensations in the genitals, decreased vaginal lubrication or erectile capacity, and decreased frequency and/or intensity of orgasm. Secondary sexual dysfunction refers to MS-related physical changes that indirectly affect the sexual response. Bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, fatigue, spasticity, muscle weakness, problems with attention and concentration, hand tremors, and non-genital changes in sensation are among the most common MS symptoms that can cause secondary sexual dysfunction. Tertiary sexual dysfunction results from psychosocial and cultural issues that can interfere with sexual feelings and sexual response. Depression, performance anxiety, changes in family roles, lowered self-esteem, body image concerns, loss of confidence, and internalised beliefs and expectations about what defines a “sexual man” or a “sexual woman” in the context of having a disability, can all be expressions of, or contribute to, tertiary sexual dysfunction. Sexual response is mediated by the central nervous system – the brain and spinal cord. There is no single sexual centre in the central nervous system. Many different areas of the brain are involved in various aspects of sexual functioning, including sex drive, perception of sexual stimuli and pleasure, movement, sensation, cognition and attention. Sexual messages are communicated between various sections of the brain, thoracic (upper), lumbar (middle) and sacral (lower) spinal cord and genitals throughout the sexual response cycle. Since MS can result in randomly distributed lesions along many of these myelinated pathways, it is not surprising that changes in sexual function are often reported. The good news is that there are likely to be neurologic pathways that mediate aspects of sexual feelings and response that are widely distributed and therefore unaffected by MS lesions.

MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Reviewed By: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In MS, the immune system attacks and damages or destroys myelin, a substance that surrounds and insulates the nerves. The myelin destruction causes a distortion or interruption in nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain. This can result in a wide variety of symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is estimated to affect 2.8 million people worldwide. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, though it can also occur in young children and the elderly. Multiple sclerosis is three times more common in women than in men. In addition, nearly all women afflicted with MS get the condition before menopause. This could mean that hormones play an important role in the disease’s development. Usually, MS in men is more severe than it is in women. They typically get MS in their 30s and 40s, just as their testosterone levels begin to decline. Although MS is more common in women than men overall, one form of the disease contradicts this pattern. People with primary progressive (PP) MS are about as likely to be male as female. (The four main types of MS are described later). People who smoke are more likely to develop MS, and to develop it more severely and with a faster progression. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other ethnicities. MS is believed to have a genetic component as people with a first-degree relative with the disease have a higher incidence than the general population. We don't know exactly what causes multiple sclerosis, but it is believed to be some combination of immunologic, environmental, infectious, and/or genetic factors. Some theories have been proposed, though there is not enough evidence to establish any one cause. Theories as to what causes MS include: Exposure to chemical solvents such as amines, esters, ethers, and ketones Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly perceives its own myelin (the protective sheath around the nerves) as an intruder and attacks it, as it would a virus or other foreign infectious agent. To understand how this harms the body, it helps to understand how nerves work. A nerve can be seen by the naked eye, but it is made up of hundreds or even thousands of microscopic nerve fibers wrapped by connective tissue. Nerves conduct messages to and from the brain by way of electrical impulses. Often the nerve fibers that make up a nerve are all individually wrapped in myelin, a protective sheath that causes electric impulses to conduct down the nerve much faster than fibers that lack myelin. (The same principle is used to improve electric wires by covering them with a plastic outer layer.) In multiple sclerosis, the immune system's T cells attack the myelin sheath. By attacking myelin, the immune system in a person with MS causes inflammation and degeneration of the myelin that can lead to demyelination, or stripping of the myelin covering of the nerves. It can also cause scarring (the ""sclerosis"" in the name “multiple sclerosis”). This causes electrical impulses to travel more slowly along the nerves resulting in deterioration of function in body processes such as vision, speech, walking, writing, and memory. While multiple sclerosis is not hereditary, genetics are believed to play a role. In the U.S., the chances of developing MS are one in 750. Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling) increases the risk to up to 5%. An identical twin of someone with MS has a 25% chance of being diagnosed with the disorder. It is thought there is an outside trigger, as genetics only makes certain people susceptible to getting MS, which is why the disease is not considered hereditary. Genes may make a person more likely to develop the disease, but it is believed that there still is an additional outside trigger that makes it happen. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis that have been identified and each type can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and a patient's response to treatment. The four types of MS are discussed on the next four slides. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS, RRMS or RMS) is the most common type of MS, affecting about 85% of MS sufferers. RR-MS is defined by inflammatory attacks on the myelin and nerve fibers causing a worsening of neurologic function. Symptoms vary from patient to patient, and symptoms can flare up (called relapses or exacerbations) unexpectedly, and then disappear (remission). Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS, PPMS) is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any relapses or remissions. There may be occasional plateaus, but overall, the progression of the disability is continuous. This form of MS occurs equally in men and women, and the age of onset is about 10 years later than in relapsing-remitting MS. Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS, SPMS) is a form of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS. Most people diagnosed with RR-MS will eventually transition to having SP-MS. After a period of relapses (also called attacks, or exacerbations) and remissions the disease will start to progress steadily. People with SP-MS may or may not experience remissions. Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PR-MS, PRMS) is the least common form of MS, occurring in about 5% of MS patients. People with PR-MS experience steady disease progression and worsening neurological function as seen in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS), along with occasional relapses like people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS). Symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be single or multiple. They may range from mild to severe in intensity. They may also be long-term or short-term in duration. Multiple sclerosis is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms are so varied and can resemble other diseases. It is often diagnosed by a process of exclusion – that is, by ruling out other neurological diseases – so the diagnosis of MS may take months to years. A physician will do a complete history and neurological exam, along with tests to evaluate mental, emotional and language functions, strength, coordination, balance, reflexes, gait, and vision. Tests to Help Confirm a Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Cerebrospinal fluid exam (spinal tap, lumbar puncture) One of the main ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. Characteristic areas of demyelination will show up as lesions on an MRI scan. On the left is a brain MRI scan of a 35-year-old man with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that reveals multiple lesions with high T2 signal intensity and one large white matter lesion. The right image shows the cervical spinal cord of a 27-year-old woman representing a multiple sclerosis demyelination and plaque (see arrow). There are several aspects to treating multiple sclerosis. Modifying the disease – there are several drugs that can reduce the severity and frequency of relapses Treating exacerbations (or attacks) with high dose corticosteroids Rehabilitation both for fitness and to manage energy levels Treatment for multiple sclerosis may include drugs to manage attacks, symptoms, or both. Many medications carry the risk of some side effects, so patients need to manage their treatment with their doctors. Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation in the body and affect the function of the immune system. They are often used to manage MS attacks, but can have numerous side effects. There are several medications approved for disease modification, including the following: Many medications are used to treat and manage symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol): Solu-Medrol is given intravenously during the acute attack, sometimes followed up with an oral corticosteroid. Continued from the last slide, here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. : Anti-convulsants like carbamazepine (Tegretol) or gabapentin (Neurontin) are used for face or limb pain. : Anti-depressants or electrical stimulation are used for pricking pain, intense tingling, and burning. : Antibiotics are used to manage infections : Vitamin C and cranberry juice are used to prevent infections : Used for bladder dysfunction This is usually treated by increasing fluids and fiber to the diet. Often resistant to treatment. Sometimes drugs or surgery are used if tremors are severe. There has been a lot of progress over the years in managing multiple sclerosis, and research is ongoing into new therapies. There are several new avenues of current research. Scientists hope to find further associations between lifestyle and illness progression. They want to learn ways to repair and reverse the damage MS causes. And they hope to learn the ultimate cause of this disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that progressively damages the nerves of the brain and spinal cord. Any sensory or motor (muscular) function in the body may be affected by the nerves damaged from MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, immunological, infectious, and/or environmental factors. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis and symptoms range from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and, to some degree, the patient's response to treatment. What Is Multiple Sclerosis?

In MS, the myelin sheath, a fatty tissue that surrounds and protects nerve fibers, is damaged. Inflammation also occurs which further destroys the sheath and eventually the nerves that it encompasses. This leads to areas of multiple scarring or sclerosis which can slow down or even block nerve signaling that is responsible for muscle coordination, strength, sensory information, and visual responses. Multiple sclerosis is chronic, however not contagious, and depending upon the severity of damage which occurs, can be debilitating. Most researchers of MS believe that it is an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly identifies its own tissues as foreign. This results in a response by the immune system to send antibodies and white blood cells to target the myelin sheath. It is still unclear as to why this action takes place, but it may be caused by a combination of genetic predisposition and exposure to a virus or bacterium. The virus entering the body may carry with it a protein that mimics the proteins of myelin, therefore causing an inappropriate reaction. This may be triggered by such situations as a viral infection of a cold ,flu, or even changes within the body following pregnancy. More than 300,000 people in the United States and over 1 million people worldwide are diagnosed with MS. The disease generally strikes women twice as often as men, between the ages of 20 to 40. The signs and symptoms of MS can vary widely depending on the individual and the specific nerves that may be affected.

The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012).

It causes damage the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells (Marieb, 2012). This damage slows down the process in which the brain relays messages to the rest of the body, leading to a variety of symptoms. Some of the most common include pain and numbness; fatigue; walking, balance, and coordination problems; bladder and bowel dysfunction; vision problems; cognitive dysfunction; emotional changes and depression (National Society, n.d.). Though the exact cause of MS is unknown, it’s widely thought to be an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases arise from an overactive immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body (Marieb, 2012). In other words, the body actually attacks its own cells. The immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks it. The disease affects women more than men, often beginning sometime between the ages of 20 to 40. Recently, a study found that the incidence of MS appears to be higher in African American women than in caucasians, contradicting previous findings (Langer-Gould, Brara, Beaber, & Zhang, 2013).

You can develop MS at any age, but most people receive diagnoses between the . There are relapsing, remitting, and progressive types of MS, but the course is rarely predictable. Researchers still don’t fully understand the cause of MS or why the rate of progression is so difficult to determine. The good news is that many people living with MS don’t develop severe disabilities. Most have a normal or near-normal lifespan. There’s no national or global registry for new MS cases. Known figures are only estimates. Recent findings from a National MS Society study estimate nearly in the United States are living with MS. This is more than double the last reported number, and the first national research on MS prevalence since 1975. The society also estimates that 2.3 million people live with MS globally. About are diagnosed each week in the United States, says the MS Discovery Forum. Rates of MS are higher . It’s estimated that in (below the 37th parallel), the rate of MS is between 57 and 78 cases per 100,000 people. The rate is twice as high in northern states (above the 37th parallel), at about 110 to 140 cases per 100,000. The incidence of MS is also higher in colder climates. People of Northern European descent have the highest risk of developing MS, no matter where they live. Meanwhile, the lowest risk appears to be among Native Americans, Africans, and Asians. A 2013 study found only of all diagnosed MS cases are in children. Far more women have MS. In fact, the National MS Society estimates MS is more common in women than men. MS is , but researchers believe there may be a genetic predisposition to developing the disease. About of people with MS have one or more family members or relatives who also have MS, notes the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. In the case of identical twins, there’s a 1 in 3 chance for each sibling to have the disease. Researchers and neurologists still can’t say with certainty what causes MS. The ultimate cause of MS is damage to myelin, nerve fibers, and neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Together these make up the central nervous system. Researchers speculate that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is at play, but it’s not fully understood how. The relationship of the immune system and the brain, however, could be considered a culprit. Researchers suggest the immune system could mistake normal brain cells for foreign ones. One thing the MS community knows for certain is that the disease is . CISis considered to be of MS, but it may or may not progress to MS.To get a diagnosis of MS: A person has to experience a neurologic episode (typically lasting 24 hours or more) that resulted in damage to the central nervous system. People who are at high risk of developing MS are found to have MRI-detected brain lesions. There’s a chance of receiving an MS diagnosis within a few years, estimates the National MS Society. Meanwhile, people at low riskdon’t have MRI-detected brain lesions. They have a 20 percent chance of receiving an MS diagnosis in the same amount of time. RRMS is characterized by clearly defined relapses of increased disease activity and worsening symptoms. These are followed by remissions when the disease doesn’t progress. Symptoms may improve or disappear during remission. Approximately of people receive a diagnosis of RRMS at first, says the National MS Society. SPMS follows an initial RRMS diagnosis. It sees disability gradually increase as the disease progresses, with or without evidence of relapse or changes in an MRI scan. Occasional relapses may occur, as will periods of stability. Untreated, about of people with RRMS transition to SPMS within a decade of the initial diagnosis, estimates a 2017 study. About 90 percent of people transition within 25 years. PPMS is diagnosed in about of people with MS, estimates the National MS Society. People with PPMS experience a steady progression of the disease with no clear relapses or remissions. The rate of PPMS is equally divided between men and women. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 35 and 39. A high percentage of MS cases don’t progress. These may fit into a subgroup with a “very stable benign” form of the disease, per a presented in 2017. Researchers say it’s possible for people to remain in the RRMS phase for 30 years. At the other end of the spectrum, a 2015 study found about of people with MS develop a more aggressive course of the disease. It’s known as highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (HARRMS). Symptoms vary a great deal from one person to another. No two people have the same combination of symptoms. This, of course, complicates identification and diagnosis. In a , one-fifth of European women surveyed received misdiagnoses before eventually receiving an MS diagnosis. The average woman was found to go through about five visits with a healthcare provider over the course of six months before reaching a diagnosis. According to the , symptoms can impact the mind, body, and senses in a number of ways. These include: There’s no single “MS test.” To receive a diagnosis, your doctor needs to collect your medical history and perform a neurological examination and a series of other tests. Tests may include: Since the exact cause of MS is still unknown, there’s no known prevention. There’s also no cure for MS yet, but treatments can manage symptoms. MS medications are designed to lessen the frequency of relapses and slow the progression of the disease. There several approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat MS. They include: These medications aren’t approved for use during pregnancy. It’s also unclear if MS medications are excreted through breast milk. Talk to your doctor about your MS medications if you’re considering becoming pregnant. People with MS can safely carry a baby to term. Pregnancy doesn’t generally affect MS in the long term. MS has been found to affect decisions about pregnancy, though. In a , 36 percent of women participants decided not to have children at all or postponed the timing of getting pregnant due to their MS. While people with MS often experience during pregnancy, about have a relapse within six months of giving birth. MS is an expensive disease to treat. A found the total lifetime costs per person with MS to be $4.1 million. The average yearly healthcare costs range from $30,000 to $100,000 based on the mildness or severity of the disease.

77314a19-dc77-4bf7-b9c7-5cc6306a7733,"New Drug Shows Promise in Treating Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — Half of all people with MS are ultimately diagnosed with secondary progressive MS. This new treatment is the first to slow progression of the disease. Is a breakthrough treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) finally on the horizon? It’s still too early to answer that question, but in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a new Novartis drug called siponimod (BAF132) was able to delay progression of the disease in people with SPMS, many of whom had already reached a stage of advanced disability. The study, funded by Novartis, included 1,651 participants from 31 countries. The results were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal . After three months of use, siponimod was able to slow down the disease’s effects by 21 percent and reduced the risk of six-month disease progression by 26 percent. Participants who took a daily oral dose of siponimod also lost less brain volume, had fewer brain lesions, and reduced their number of annual relapses by 55 percent. However, siponimod didn’t improve how well the participants could walk. The results of this study show that siponimod “can delay disability progression in typical established SPMS patients, where other approaches tested so far have been unsuccessful,” Dr. Ludwig Kappos, a professor at University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland and the principal study investigator, said in a . “These data are all the more impressive when considering that the majority of patients already had advanced disability when starting treatment.” Other experts are more cautiously optimistic, pointing out that siponimod was tested against a placebo and for a relatively short amount of time. “There’s an indication that siponimod could be useful in SPMS, but we need more studies,” said Dr. Jaime Imitola, director of the Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Multidisciplinary Clinic and Translational Research Program at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. SPMS is an advanced form of MS, an autoimmune disease that disrupts the normal flow of information in the brain as well as between the brain and body. Symptoms vary from person to person, but numbness and tingling, trouble walking, extreme fatigue, dizziness, pain, depression, and even paralysis. The estimates that more than 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. At least two to three times more women than men are affected. The majority of people with MS initially receive a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). They experience occasional periods of time in which their symptoms improve or may even go away for a while. But within a decade of initial diagnosis, of people with RRMS progress to SPMS. With this form of MS, symptoms no longer wax or wane, but stick around — and get steadily worse. While researchers are always looking for new treatments for SPMS, so far other potential drugs haven’t produced . Of the 15 medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of RRMS, for SPMS. Siponimod is what’s known as a “disease-modifying therapy.” This is a type of drug that works to keep a disease from getting worse. By binding to lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and blocking them from entering the central nervous system, siponimod is able to reduce the inflammation that’s responsible for so many SPMS symptoms. “The challenge is going to be how to determine who is going to respond to this medicine and who will not,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “It looks like the younger and closer to the conversion to SPMS you are might be factors that contribute to a response to therapy. But until [siponimod] is used more broadly, it will be hard to know for sure.” Bebo expects the risks and side effects of siponimod to be similar to the immunosuppressive drug fingolimod (Gilenya), which has a similar mechanism of action. These include a slightly higher risk for infection, slowed heart rate, macular edema, and liver damage. Novartis plans to file for approval of siponimod for SPMS with the FDA this year, which means it could be available in late 2019 or early 2020. In the meantime, Imitola stresses that it’s important for patients with MS to get a prompt diagnosis and start treatment with a MS specialist as soon as possible. “Why wait until a patient is declared to have SPMS, around 10–15 years after relapses, to reduce progression?” Imitola asked. “If you stop the disease in its tracks early on with potent medications, then a patient may never get to SPMS. That is the goal. It’s clear that the next generation of MS medications are changing the natural history of the disease. We need more medications that tackle the neurodegeneration in MS.” — Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

09c2f627-fbe5-4a0c-933c-2455de9343f6,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Effectiveness of memory rehabilitation in people with MS Effectiveness of memory rehabilitation in people with MS Review shows previous measures of memory rehabilitation were not reflective of daily life People with MS often struggle with memory problems, which can lead to difficulties in everyday life. Memory rehabilitation is offered to help enhance the ability to perform everyday activities and to increase independence by reducing forgetting. This can involve the use of specific techniques and strategies to change the way a person tries to remember, store, or retrieve memories. However, it is unclear whether memory rehabilitation is effective in reducing forgetting or improving performance of activities in daily life, and there are few good-quality studies that have investigated the effectiveness of memory rehabilitation in people with MS. Researchers from Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham, UK, reviewed 15 studies with 989 participants involving various types of memory retraining techniques, some using computer programs or memory aids such as diaries or calendars. The review showed some evidence to support the use of memory rehabilitation in people with MS. However, the measures used in the studies were abstract and did not reflect people’s daily life, and the groups who did and did not receive memory rehabilitation did not differ in terms of their subjective reports of memory problems or mood. There are still relatively few large, good-quality studies to base these findings on, so more are needed.

3a21d874-d621-4ca9-814b-ae4e12ca68dd,"— — is a progressive neurological disease that can affect the . Every time you take a step, blink, or move your arm, your CNS is at work. Millions of nerve cells in the send signals throughout the body to control these processes and functions: Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals via nerve fibers. A layer called the myelin sheath covers and protects these fibers. That protection ensures that each nerve cell properly reaches its intended target. In people with MS, immune cells mistakenly attack and damage the myelin sheath. This damage results in the disruption of nerve signals. Damaged nerve signals can cause debilitating , including: MS affects everyone differently. The severity of the disease and the types of symptoms vary from person to person. There are , and the cause, symptoms, progression of disability may vary. The exact cause of MS is unknown. However, scientists believe that four factors may play a role in the development of the disease. MS is considered an immune-mediated disease: The immune system malfunctions and attacks the CNS. Researchers know that the myelin sheath is directly affected, but they don’t know what triggers the immune system to . Research into which immune cells are responsible for the attack is ongoing. Scientists are seeking to uncover what causes these cells to attack. They’re also searching for methods to control or stop the progression of the disease. Several genes are believed to play a role in MS. Your chance of developing MS is slightly higher if , such as a parent or sibling, has the disease. According to the , if one parent or sibling has MS, the chances of getting the disease are estimated to be around 2.5 to 5 percent in the United States. The chances for an average person are approximately 0.1 percent. Scientists believe that people with MS are born with a genetic susceptibility to react to certain unknown environmental agents. An is triggered when they encounter these agents. Epidemiologists have seen an increased pattern of MS cases in countries located farthest from the equator. This correlation causes some to believe that may play a role. Vitamin D benefits immune system function. People who live near the equator are exposed to more . As a result, their bodies produce more vitamin D. The longer your skin is exposed to sunlight, the more your body naturally produces the vitamin. Since MS is considered an immune-mediated disease, vitamin D and sunlight exposure may be linked to it. Researchers are considering the possibility that may cause MS. Viruses are known to cause inflammation and a breakdown of myelin. Therefore, it’s possible that a virus could trigger MS. It’s also possible that the bacteria or virus that have similar components to brain cells trigger the immune system to mistakenly identify normal brain cells as foreign and destroy them. Several bacteria and viruses are being investigated to determine if they contribute to the development of MS. These include: human herpes virus-6, which leads to conditions such as Other risk factors may also increase your chances of developing MS. These include: Women are more likely to develop relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) than men. In the primary-progressive (PPMS) form, numbers of men and women are approximately equal. RRMS usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50. PPMS usually occurs approximately 10 years later than other forms. People of northern European descent are at highest risk of developing MS. There are several triggers that people with MS should avoid. Stress can trigger and worsen MS symptoms. Practices that help you reduce and cope with stress can be beneficial. Add to your day, such as or . can add to the progression of MS. If you smoke, look into . Avoid being around . Not everyone sees a difference in symptoms due to , but avoid direct sun or hot tubs if you find you react to them. There are several ways that medication can worsen symptoms. If you’re taking many drugs and they poorly, talk to your doctor. They can decide which drugs are vital and which ones you may be able to stop taking. Some people stop taking their because they have too many side effects or they believe they aren’t effective. However, these medicines are critical to help prevent relapses and new lesions, so it’s important to stay on them. Fatigue is a common symptom of MS. If you’re not getting enough sleep, this can decrease your energy even more. From to the or , infections can cause your symptoms to worsen. In fact, infections cause approximately one-third of all , according to the . Although there’s no cure for MS, there are to help manage MS symptoms. The most common treatment category is , such as oral (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) and methylprednisolone. These drugs reduce nerve inflammation.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system. It affects more than 25,000 people in Australia and is 3 times more common in women than in men. MS means there is damage to the protective sheath (known as myelin) that surrounds the nerve fibres in . This damage causes scars, or lesions, in the nervous system, meaning that the nerves can’t send signals round the body properly. A person's risk of developing MS is increased if they have a close relative with the condition. The cause of MS is not known, but theories include that it is an ; that it is caused by genetic or environmental factors (it is more common the further away from the equator you live); and that it is caused by a virus. There is currently no known cure for MS although there are treatment options. MS affects different people in different ways, and treatment often involves managing symptoms. What are the different types of multiple sclerosis? — This is the most common form of MS and about 3 in every 4 people with MS begin with a relapsing-remitting stage. With RRMS, new symptoms appear or existing symptoms worsen over a period of days, weeks or even months, followed by a partial or complete recovery, which is then followed by another relapse. For some people, these relapses get worse and the disability stays. Their health gradually declines. This is known as secondary progressive MS (see below). — 1 or 2 people in every 10 with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. These people usually find that their symptoms become gradually worse, with no separate attacks. — Most people with RRMS will eventually experience SPMS. In this form, disability generally worsens slowly, independent of any relapses. MS usually starts with mild symptoms that may or may not get worse over time. Symptoms depend on which part of the central nervous system is affected and how much damage has occurred. problems with controlling the body — like muscle spasms, weakness, loss of coordination and balance tiredness and sensitivity to heat (a hot day or a hot bath, or even a hot cup of tea, can make symptoms worse) other nervous symptom problems — including vertigo, pins and needles, dizziness, neuralgia and problems with eyesight continence problems — including bladder incontinence and constipation changes in memory, in concentration, in reasoning, in emotions, or in mood (such as depression) The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person. They can also come and go in any one person. MS is unpredictable. A range of tests can be used to diagnose MS, including to detect lesions in the central nervous system, a physical examination to check reflexes and responses, blood tests, and other types of tests to measure nerve activity. Sometimes it can take years to reach a diagnosis because there is no single test for MS. A person will be diagnosed with MS if there is evidence of lesions in different parts of the central nervous system, at different times, with no other explanation than MS. Medicines can delay the progression of MS and reduce the risk of relapses. These are called ‘disease modifying therapies’. Other medicines are used to control symptoms. The best medicine for you depends on the type of MS you have. Talk to your doctor or other health professionals who care for you about the right combination of treatments for your particular situation. Disease modifying therapies work by targeting the immune system. They slow the frequency and severity of attacks so the myelin sheaths are damaged less. These medicines are also called immunotherapies. However, these treatments do not reverse current symptoms and there can be significant side effects. These medicines are usually used for people with relapsing-remitting MS. Steroids can reduce the severity of an MS attack by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Medicines to suppress the immune system (called immune suppressants) are sometimes used, especially for people with progressive MS. There are medicines available that can ease muscle spasms, pain, continence problems, tiredness, depression and other symptoms. Regular exercise, physiotherapy and occupational therapy can also help reduce symptoms and help you be as active as possible. A well-balanced diet low in fat and high in fibre can help. Regular exercise can strengthen muscles, improve heart health and improve mood. A lot of research, including stem cell research, is focused on prevention, treatment and a cure for MS. There is also help and support available for people with MS, and their carers.

Medicines can delay the progression of MS and reduce the risk of relapses. These are called ‘disease modifying therapies’. Other medicines are used to control symptoms. The best medicine for you depends on the type of MS you have. Talk to your doctor or other health professionals who care for you about the right combination of treatments for your particular situation. Disease modifying therapies work by targeting the immune system. They slow the frequency and severity of attacks so the myelin sheaths are damaged less. These medicines are also called immunotherapies. However, these treatments do not reverse current symptoms and there can be significant side effects. These medicines are usually used for people with relapsing-remitting MS. Steroids can reduce the severity of an MS attack by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Medicines to suppress the immune system (called immune suppressants) are sometimes used, especially for people with progressive MS. There are medicines available that can ease muscle spasms, pain, continence problems, tiredness, depression and other symptoms. Regular exercise, physiotherapy and occupational therapy can also help reduce symptoms and help you be as active as possible. A well-balanced diet low in fat and high in fibre can help. Regular exercise can strengthen muscles, improve heart health and improve mood. A lot of research, including stem cell research, is focused on prevention, treatment and a cure for MS. There is also help and support available for people with MS, and their carers.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and debilitating disease that affects the central nervous system. Multiple Sclerosis Description Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common acquired chronic neurological disease affecting young adults Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic (long-term) disease that affects the central nervous system. In MS, the protective sheath (known as myelin) that surrounds the nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord becomes damaged. ... What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is not contagious, but it is progressive and unpredictable. Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the brain and spinal cord thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction. It is characterised by loss of the myelin sheath covering nerves of the central nervous system.

Treating Urinary Tract Infections Without Antibiotics? Nearly one in two women and one in twenty men will suffer a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime (Kidney Health Australia 2016). Frequent use of antibiotics to (treat a UTI) has led to an increase in antibiotic-resistant organisms and bacteria, which are now gaining the upper hand. The gut microbiome is increasingly appreciated for the role it plays in health and disease, so much so that it has been referred to as the ‘Forgotten Organ’. Stress and Urge Urinary Incontinence in Women - Australasian Menopause Society Normal bladder function is represented by:a frequency 4-6 per day (0-1 at night);1-2 cups of urine (250-500mls) are passed;voiding can be deferred until convenient;urine is passed in a steady continuous stream until bladder is emptyno leakage between visits to the toilet.There are two main types of urinary incontinence: stress and urge incontinence.

c4ff0e18-0412-43fb-8aa2-8ea9fadd0220,"Transverse Myelitis: What It Is and How It's Connected to MS — — Transverse myelitis is a condition in which a section of the spinal cord becomes inflamed. This can cause damage to the myelin, the covering for nerve cell fibers. As a result, communication between nerve cells in the spinal cord and the rest of the body can be interrupted. Symptoms range from back pain to more serious problems, such as paralysis or loss of bowel control. Transverse myelitis is often a onetime illness. But for some people, transverse myelitis is an early symptom of another serious disease of the nervous system. One such disease is . MS is a chronic disease with no cure. It occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the central nervous system. MS can affect various parts of your body, including: The severity of symptoms varies from person to person. Transverse myelitis means both sides of a cross-section of the spinal cord are inflamed. Partial myelitis, which affects only one side of the cross-section, is more commonly a symptom of MS. But the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke recommends that anyone with transverse myelitis or partial myelitis get checked for MS. MS and transverse myelitis share some common symptoms, such as a tingling sensation in the arms and legs. There are also some significant differences between MS and transverse myelitis: People with transverse myelitis often experience back pain as their first symptom. Extreme sensitivity to touch is also present in about 80 percent of people with transverse myelitis, according to the . The causes of transverse myelitis aren’t completely understood. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke suggests that the disease may be caused by an infection. The reports that MS also may be caused by an immune system response. Transverse myelitis can occur in men and women of all ages and races. Like MS, it affects more women than men. In addition, transverse myelitis tends to appear in younger people. Those between the ages of 10 and 19 and between 30 and 39 face the highest risks of transverse myelitis, according to the . MS usually develops in people between the ages of 20 and 40. A doctor usually orders magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose transverse myelitis. An MRI of your spinal cord will show inflammation. It will help your doctor determine whether your pain is from a slipped disc or another condition like MS. For a proper diagnosis, the doctor must get your medical and family history. A neurological exam is also required to diagnose transverse myelitis and MS. Treatment for transverse myelitis often begins with drugs to decrease inflammation. Since moving your limbs is important to help keep them healthy, you will also likely receive physical therapy to help repair nerve damage. Waiting to get treatment is dangerous. The sooner you are treated after symptoms appear, the better your chance of recovery. — — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

e8f3f7ef-9015-4de1-8d62-98bee1059bb9,"— — is a condition affecting almost 1 million people over the age of 18 in the United States. It causes: MS occurs when the body’s immune system attacks support structures in the brain, causing them to become damaged and inflamed. Ann Romney, wife of U.S. Senator Mitt Romney, received a diagnosis of in 1998. This type of MS comes and goes unpredictably. To reduce her symptoms, she combined traditional medicine with alternative therapies. It was a crisp autumn day in 1998 when Romney felt her legs go weak and her hands became unexplainably shaky. Thinking back, she realized that she’d been tripping and stumbling more and more often. Always the athletic type, playing tennis, skiing, and jogging regularly, Romney grew scared at the weakness in her limbs. She called her brother Jim, a doctor, who told her to see a neurologist as soon as she could. At Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, an MRI of her brain revealed the telltale lesions characteristic of MS. The numbness spread to her chest. “I felt I was being eaten away,” , courtesy of CBS News. The primary treatment for MS attacks is a high dose of steroids injected into the bloodstream over the course of three to five days. Steroids suppress the immune system and calm its attacks on the brain. They reduce inflammation as well. Although some people with MS require other medications to manage their symptoms, for Romney, steroids were enough to reduce the attacks. However, the side effects from the steroids and other medications became too much to bear. To recover strength and mobility, she had her own plan. The steroids helped with the attack, but they didn’t help the fatigue. “The unrelenting, extreme fatigue was suddenly my new reality,” . Then, Romney remembered her love of horses. At first, she could only ride for a few minutes a day. But with determination, she soon regained her ability to ride, and with it, her ability to move and walk freely. “The rhythm of a horse’s gait closely assimilates a human’s and moves the rider’s body in a fashion that enhances muscle strength, balance, and flexibility,” . “The connection both physical and emotional among horse and human is powerful beyond explanation.” A found that equine therapy, also called hippotherapy, can improve balance, fatigue, and overall quality of life in people with MS. As her coordination returned, Romney’s leg remained numb and weak. She sought out the services of Fritz Blietschau, an Air Force mechanic turned reflexology practitioner near Salt Lake City. is a complementary therapy that involves massaging the hands and feet to cause changes in pain or other benefits elsewhere in the body. A examined reflexology and relaxation for fatigue in women with MS. Researchers found that reflexology was more effective than relaxation in reducing fatigue. Romney also sought out as a treatment. Acupuncture works by inserting slim needles into specific points on the skin. An estimated of people with MS try acupuncture for relief of their symptoms. Although may have found it helps some patients, most specialists don’t think it offers any benefits. “I don’t think anyone can prepare for a diagnosis such as this, but I was very fortunate to have the love and support of my husband, my family, and my friends,” . Although she had her family by her side every step of the way, Romney felt that her personal attitude of self-reliance helped carry her through her ordeal. “Even though I had the loving support of my family, I knew this was my battle,” . “I was not interested in going to group meetings or getting any help. After all, I was strong and independent.” But Romney can’t do it all alone. “As time has passed and I’ve come to terms with living with multiple sclerosis, I’ve realized how wrong I was and how much strength you can gain through others,” . She recommends that people living with multiple sclerosis, particularly the newly diagnosed, reach out and connect with others on the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s online community. Today, Romney deals with her MS without any medication, preferring alternative therapies to keep her sound, although sometimes this results in occasional flare-ups. “This treatment program has worked for me, and I am very fortunate to be in remission. But the same treatment may not work for others. And everyone should follow the recommendations of his/her personal physician,” . — — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

AUBAGIO (teriflunomide) is a prescription medicine used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Have severe liver problems. AUBAGIO may cause serious liver problems, which can be life-threatening. Your risk may be higher if you take other medicines that affect your liver. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your liver within 6 months before you start AUBAGIO and monthly for 6 months after starting AUBAGIO. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of these symptoms of liver problems: nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, tiredness, yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes, or dark urine. You should have a pregnancy test before starting AUBAGIO. After stopping AUBAGIO, continue to use effective birth control until you have made sure your blood levels of AUBAGIO are lowered. If you become pregnant while taking AUBAGIO or within 2 years after stopping, tell your healthcare provider right away and enroll in the AUBAGIO Pregnancy Registry at 1-800-745-4447, option 2. Are of childbearing potential and not using effective birth control. It is not known if AUBAGIO passes into breast milk. Your healthcare provider can help you decide if you should take AUBAGIO or breastfeed — you should not do both at the same time. If you are a man whose partner plans to become pregnant, you should stop taking AUBAGIO and talk with your healthcare provider about reducing the levels of AUBAGIO in your blood. If your partner does not plan to become pregnant, use effective birth control while taking AUBAGIO. Have had an allergic reaction to AUBAGIO or a medicine called leflunomide Take a medicine called leflunomide for rheumatoid arthritis. AUBAGIO may stay in your blood for up to 2 years after you stop taking it. Your healthcare provider can prescribe a medicine that can remove AUBAGIO from your blood quickly. Before taking AUBAGIO, talk with your healthcare provider if you have: liver or kidney problems; a fever or infection, or if you are unable to fight infections; numbness or tingling in your hands or feet that is different from your MS symptoms; diabetes; serious skin problems when taking other medicines; breathing problems; or high blood pressure. Your healthcare provider will check your blood cell count and TB test before you start AUBAGIO. Talk with your healthcare provider if you take or are planning to take other medicines (especially medicines for treating cancer or controlling your immune system), vitamins or herbal supplements. AUBAGIO may cause serious side effects, including: reduced white blood cell count — this may cause you to have more infections; numbness or tingling in your hands or feet that is different from your MS symptoms; allergic reactions, including serious skin problems; breathing problems (new or worsening); and high blood pressure. Patients with low white blood cell count should not receive certain vaccinations during AUBAGIO treatment and 6 months after.

54bc2388-6398-4280-8f85-9c5f116964c8,"— Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common neurological disorders. It affects around 400,000 U.S. adults and over 2.1 million people worldwide, and it’s two to three times more common among women than men (, ). This article explains how diet may affect MS and provides a guide for dietary changes that may help manage its symptoms. (MS) is an autoimmune disorder that gradually destroys the protective coverings that wrap around your nerve fibers. These coverings are called myelin sheaths. Over time, this disease can permanently damage your nerves, affecting communication between the brain and body (). MS is highly complex, and the way the disease progresses varies from person to person. Scientists are still not certain what causes MS and how to cure it (). Although diet cannot cure MS, some research suggests that making dietary changes may help people with MS better manage their symptoms. This, in turn, may improve their quality of life (, ). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition that gradually destroys the protective coverings, which are called myelin sheaths, that wrap around your nerve fibers. Scientists do not fully understand the disease, and there is no cure. Currently, there are no official dietary guidelines for people with MS. No two people with MS experience it the same way (). However, scientists believe a combination of genetic and environmental factors may cause the disease, as well as that nutrition can have an influence. The fact that MS is more prevalent in Western countries than in developing nations is one clue that diet may play a key role (). That is why dietary guidelines and recommendations for people with MS should aim to help manage symptoms to improve overall quality of life. Diet may help with MS in several ways, including by preventing or controlling its progression, helping manage its symptoms, and reducing flare-ups. Ideally, an MS-friendly diet should be high in to fight inflammation, high in fiber to aid bowel movements, adequate in calcium and vitamin D to fight osteoporosis, and pack plenty of vitamins and minerals to fight fatigue and promote wellness. It should also limit foods that have been and other poor health outcomes, or those that simply make day-to-day activities more difficult for someone with MS. Some evidence suggests that other dietary patterns, including ketogenic diets, may help improve symptoms in people with MS. However, this research is ongoing, and scientists need to further investigate the role of diet in MS. A study in 60 people with MS found that fast-mimicking diets and had potential to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Still, the researchers suggested that more high quality studies on the effects of fast-mimicking diets in humans were needed (). Another study that gave people with MS a ketogenic diet found they showed improved symptoms, including reduced fatigue, inflammation, and depression (). A separate study found certain nutrients may benefit people with mild to moderate MS, potentially leading to better general functioning, as well as an improved quality of life and ability to move around (). The nutrients associated with these positive changes included increased fat, cholesterol, folate, iron, and magnesium intakes. On the other hand, decreased carb intake appeared to be beneficial (). Clinical trials investigating the effects of ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting on MS are currently underway (). Current evidence suggests that a modified and taking supplements may help improve perceived fatigue in MS patients (). There’s also evidence that people with MS are more likely to be deficient in some nutrients, including vitamins A, B12, and D3 (). Preliminary evidence suggests that taking certain vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, antioxidants, plant compounds, and melatonin may help improve some symptoms (). Scientists need to do more research before making official recommendations about many of the dietary patterns discussed above. However, preliminary research is promising. There are no official dietary guidelines for MS. However, research suggests that making certain dietary changes may help slow disease progression and help manage MS symptoms to improve quality of life. An MS-friendly diet should help people with MS manage their symptoms. In particular, it should help control disease progression and aim to minimize the effects that common MS symptoms have on overall quality of life. Here is a list of foods to include on an MS-friendly diet: all fresh fruits and vegetables all grains, such as oats, rice, and quinoa all fish, especially fresh fish and fatty oily fish, such as salmon and mackerel, as they’re high in and vitamin D eggs and all fresh meats, such as beef, chicken, lamb, and more such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter healthy fats, such as olive, flaxseed, coconut, and avocado oils such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi In short, the guidelines for an MS-friendly diet are similar to an overall healthy, . However, it emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods and grains. That is because plant-based foods and grains are higher in , vitamins, minerals, and fluid, which can help with MS symptoms, such as constipation, fatigue, and bladder dysfunction. They’re also higher in plant-based compounds that function as antioxidants, which are molecules that help defend your cells against free radical damage and inflammation. These compounds may help fight inflammation and potentially slow MS progression (, ). Fish, particularly fatty fish, such as salmon and mackerel, appear to be beneficial for MS, possibly because they’re high in anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. They’re also high in vitamin D, which can help keep your bones strong when combined with calcium (, , ). Current research on the effects of red meat and saturated fat intakes on MS symptoms shows mixed results. However, eating red meat in moderation, while focusing on more fruits, vegetables, and grains, is likely beneficial for people with MS (, ). Dairy products also show mixed results. However, they’re a good source of calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, and potassium, so you can include them in moderation on an MS-friendly diet (, ). In addition, some research shows that people with MS may have a higher risk of , an autoimmune condition that causes damage to the small intestine in the presence of gluten (). Gluten is a group of proteins in wheat, barley, and rye. If you have MS and experience extreme discomfort when eating gluten-based products, such as bread, pasta, crackers, and baked goods, it’s important to notify your healthcare provider to see whether you have celiac disease. People with MS who do not have celiac disease may still benefit from healthy grains in their diet. Eating plenty of fruit, vegetables, grains, and fish may help with managing MS symptoms. A person with MS may eat red meat and dairy in moderation, as current research on their effects is mixed. While an MS-friendly diet allows plenty of healthy, delicious options, there are still some food groups you should limit to help manage MS symptoms. Most of these foods are linked to chronic inflammation. They include , refined carbs, trans fats, and sugar-sweetened beverages, just to name a few (, , ). such as sausages, bacon, canned meats, and meats that are salted, smoked, or cured such as white bread, pasta, biscuits, and flour tortillas such as french fries, fried chicken, mozzarella sticks, and doughnuts such as fast food, potato chips, and convenience and frozen meals such as margarine, shortening, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils such as energy and sports drinks, , and sweet tea limit consumption of all alcoholic beverages when possible As this article mentions above, some people with MS may have celiac disease. If you have celiac disease, aim to avoid all gluten-based foods, such as foods containing wheat, barley, and rye. An MS-friendly diet is similar to an overall healthy diet. It restricts unhealthy foods, such as processed meats, refined carbs, junk foods, and trans fats. These foods do not help manage MS symptoms and may worsen inflammation. In addition to the diet guidelines above, people with MS may want to consider the following food tips to help manage their symptoms. Eating too few calories can cause fatigue. If you have time, batch-making meals can help you save energy later. If you’re often fatigued, this can be especially helpful. Place food, utensils, and other equipment in areas that are close by and easy for you to clean up. This will help you save energy. Buying precut fruits and veggies can help you shave minutes off cooking time and make cooking simpler. If you have difficulty swallowing, preparing thicker beverages like a healthy may be easier to manage. If chewing too much is making you fatigued, try choosing softer foods like baked fish, bananas, avocado, and cooked veggies. If you have difficulty swallowing or find yourself choking on food often, consider limiting foods that crumble, such as toast and crackers. Even if you don’t like asking for help, having other members of the household help with small tasks, like preparing meals, cleaning, or simply setting the table, can help ease your fatigue. Although exercise can make a person with MS feel fatigued, it’s especially important for helping manage your weight and staying healthy. It’s also important for preventing , which is more common among people with MS. If you have other MS-related concerns not addressed above, it’s important to notify your healthcare provider. They can offer personalized tips to help you manage your symptoms better. The tips listed above can help improve your quality of life with MS by helping you maintain a healthy weight and manage symptoms like fatigue and swallowing issues. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune condition that affects the nervous system. There are no official dietary guidelines for MS. However, making certain dietary changes may help relieve common MS symptoms, such as and fatigue, as well as improve overall quality of life. Dietary changes that may help include eating more plant-based foods, grains, and fish. In addition, avoiding unhealthy foods may help with managing MS symptoms and potentially slow disease progression. People with MS should avoid certain foods, including processed meats, refined carbs, junk foods, , and sugar-sweetened beverages. Other tips to manage MS symptoms include making meals in bulk, using “ready-to-use” grocery items, rearranging your kitchen for convenience, choosing foods with appropriate textures, and reaching out for help to manage daily activities. As with any new diet, it’s important to notify your healthcare provider before making major changes to your diet to manage MS. — Lhermitte’s Sign (and MS): What It Is and How to Treat It 8 Things Your MS Doctor Wants You to Ask About Switching Medications MS ‘Zingers’: What They Are and How to Cope with Them MS can be unpredictable, so it’s understandable to have questions about the disease.

604e8e00-9f74-4b51-9ecb-3c342510f9ca,"Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS): Symptoms and Diagnosis Medically reviewed by — — (MS) is the most common disease of the . It’s caused by an immune response that destroys the myelin sheath, or coating on nerves. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is one of the four types of MS. The three other types of MS are: PPMS is one of the least common types, affecting about of all people diagnosed with MS. Most people affected by MS have acute attacks with symptoms, called relapses, and periods of months or years with little to no symptoms, called remissions. PPMS is different. The disease progresses once symptoms start to appear, hence the name primary progressive. There may be periods of active progression and then periods of inactive progression of symptoms and disability. One difference between PPMS and the relapsing forms is that while active progression may stop temporarily, the symptoms don’t resolve. In relapsing forms, the symptoms may actually improve or return near where they were before the most recent relapse. Another difference is that there isn’t as much inflammation in PPMS compared to relapsing forms. Because of this, many of the drugs that work for relapsing forms don’t work for PPMS or SPMS. The progression of symptoms can worsen over a few months or several years. PPMS is often diagnosed in people in their . RRMS, on the other hand, usually presents in people in their 20s and 30s. PPMS also affects both sexes equally, while RRMS affects two to three times as many women as men. PPMS is caused by slow nerve damage that stops nerves from sending signals to each other. All four types of MS involve damage to the protective coating (myelin) of the central nervous system, called demyelination, as well as damage to the nerve. PPMS symptoms are similar to SPMS symptoms. Of course, what one person experiences will be different from another. A continuous contraction of certain muscles may cause stiffness and tightness, which may affect movement. This can make it more difficult to walk, use the stairs, and influence your overall activity level. About of those with PPMS experience . This can significantly affect daily life and make it difficult to work and complete regular activities. Those diagnosed with PPMS may find themselves very tired from simple activities. For example, the task of cooking dinner could wear them out and require them to take a nap. Another early symptom of PPMS is or tingling in various body parts, such as your face, hands, and feet. This can be confined to one area of your body, or travel to other parts. This can include , , inability to identify colors and contrasts, and pain when moving your eyes. While PPMS typically affects mobility, some individuals may experience a cognitive decline. This can significantly impair remembering and processing information, solving problems, focusing, and learning anything new. Those with PPMS may have episodes of and lightheadedness. Others may experience vertigo, a sensation that they’re spinning and losing their balance. Bladder and bowel problems can range from , to the constant need to go, to . This can lead to sexual problems, such as , , and less sensation in the genitals. About will face at least one depressive episode. Although it’s common to be upset or angry about the increasing disability, these mood changes typically go away with time. , on the other hand, doesn’t subside and requires treatment. PPMS has similar symptoms to other types of MS, as well as other nervous system disorders. As a result, it may take up to longer to get a confirmed PPMS diagnosis than a RRMS diagnosis. have a year of progressively worsening neurologic function meet two of the following criteria: Your doctor will likely conduct a medical history exam and ask you about any previous neurologic events. They may ask for family members to be present, as they can contribute their experiences with past symptoms. Your doctor will then likely do a thorough physical exam, specifically checking your nerves and muscles. Your doctor will order an MRI scan to check for lesions in the brain and spinal cord. They may also order an to check for electrical activity in the brain. Finally, your doctor will perform a to look for signs of MS in the spinal fluid. There’s no cure for PPMS. One medication, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), is approved for PPMS as well as relapsing forms of MS. are commonly used in relapsing forms, however, because they decrease inflammation. PPMS doesn’t have a lot of inflammation, so immunosuppressants may not be recommended as useful. Research on effective treatments is ongoing. While there’s no cure for PPMS, those diagnosed with PPMS shouldn’t give up hope. With the help of doctors, physical therapy professionals, speech pathologists, and specialists in mental health, there are ways to manage the disease. These can include medications that help relieve symptoms, such as for muscle spasms, as well as a healthy diet, exercise, and a proper sleep routine.

Primary sexual dysfunction is a direct result of neurologic changes that affect the sexual response. In both men and women, this can include a decrease or loss of sex drive, decreased or unpleasant genital sensations, and diminished capacity for orgasm. Men may experience difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection and a decrease in or loss of ejaculatory force or frequency. Women may experience decreased vaginal lubrication, loss of vaginal muscle tone and/or diminished clitoral engorgement. Secondary sexual dysfunction stems from symptoms that do not directly involve nervous pathways to the genital system, such as bladder and bowel problems, fatigue, spasticity, muscle weakness, body or hand tremors, impairments in attention and concentration, and non-genital sensory changes. Tertiary sexual dysfunction is the result of disability-related psychosocial and cultural issues that can interfere with one’s sexual feelings and experiences. For example, some people find it difficult to reconcile the idea of being disabled with being fully sexually expressive. Changes in self-esteem include people’s feeling about their bodies, demoralisation, depression and mood swings. These can all interfere with intimacy and sexuality. Sexual response is mediated by the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Many different areas of the brain are involved in aspects of sexual functioning, including sex drive, perception of sexual stimuli and pleasure, movement, sensation, cognition, and attention. Sexual messages are communicated between various sections of the brain, spinal cord and genitals throughout the sexual response cycle. Since MS lesions may appear on many of these myelinated pathways, it is not surprising that changes in sexual function are reported frequently by people with MS. There are treatment and management options available for both men and women who experience sexual dysfunction.

1d47ed1f-f497-451d-af75-7b90f7a1b9f9,"Medication and Treatment for Primary Progressive MS — — is one of the four types of multiple sclerosis (MS). According to the , about 15 percent of people with MS receive a diagnosis of PPMS. Unlike other types of MS, PPMS progresses from the start without acute relapses or remissions. Although the disease usually progresses slowly and may take years to diagnose, it typically leads to problems with walking. There’s no known cause of MS. However, many treatments can help prevent the progression of . Most existing MS drugs are designed to control inflammation and reduce the number of relapses. However, PPMS causes significantly less inflammation than relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the most common type of MS. In addition, although there might be occasional small degrees of improvement, PPMS doesn’t have remissions. Because it’s impossible to predict the course of PPMS progression in any individual who has it, it’s difficult for researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug on the course of the disease. However, as of 2017, one PPMS drug has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is FDA-approved to treat both PPMS and RRMS. It’s a monoclonal antibody that destroys certain B cells of the immune system. Research suggests that B cells are partially responsible for damage to the brain and spinal cord tissues of people with MS. This damage is enabled by the immune system itself. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion. The first two infusions are administered 2 weeks apart. Later infusions are administered every 6 months. The goal of using stem cells to treat PPMS is to promote the immune system to repair damage and reduce inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). For a process known as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), stem cells are collected from a person’s own tissues, like bone marrow or blood, and then reintroduced after their immune system has been suppressed. This is done in a hospital setting and is currently FDA approved. However, HSCT is a major procedure with serious side effects. More research and outcomes from clinical trials are needed before this becomes a widely used treatment for PPMS. Several clinical trials are currently underway in people with PPMS. Clinical trials go through several phases before they receive FDA approval. Phase I focuses on how safe the drug is and involves a small group of participants. During phase II, researchers aim to determine how effective the drug is for certain conditions like MS. Phase III typically includes a larger group of participants. Researchers also look at other populations, dosages, and drug combinations to find out more about how safe and effective the drug is. A two-year is currently evaluating the oral antioxidant lipoic acid. Researchers are studying whether it can preserve mobility and protect the brain more than an inactive placebo in progressive forms of MS. This study builds on an that looked at 51 people with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Researchers found that lipoic acid was able to reduce the rate of brain tissue loss compared to placebo. Biotin is a component of the vitamin B complex and is involved in cell growth and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. An is recruiting people with PPMS who are taking a high dose of biotin (300 milligrams) daily. Researchers want to see if it’s effective and safe in slowing the progression of disability in people with PPMS. In observational studies, researchers monitor participants without intervening in the process. Another is evaluating a high-dose biotin formulation known as MD1003 to see if it’s more effective than a placebo. Researchers want to know if it can slow the disability of people with progressive MS, especially those with gait impairment. A small open-label looked at the effects of high-dose biotin in people with either PPMS or SPMS. Doses ranged from 100 to 300 milligrams per day for 2 to 36 months. Participants in this trial showed improvement in visual impairment related to optic nerve injury and other MS symptoms, such as motor function and fatigue. However, another found that high-dose biotin nearly tripled the relapse rate in participants with PPMS. The has also warned that high doses of biotin may lead to inaccurate lab results for people with certain conditions, including MS. Masitinib is an oral immunomodulatory drug that has been developed as a possible treatment for PPMS. The treatment has already shown promise in a . It’s currently under investigation in a in people with PPMS or relapse-free SPMS. Ibudilast inhibits an enzyme called phosphodiesterase. Used as an asthma medication mainly in Asia, it has also been shown to promote myelin repair and help protect nerve cells from damage. Ibudilast was awarded fast track designation by the FDA. This could speed its future development as a possible treatment for progressive MS. Results of a phase II trial in 255 patients with progressive MS were published in . In the study, ibudilast was associated with slower progression of brain atrophy than a placebo. However, it also led to higher rates of digestive system side effects, headache, and depression. Many other treatments, aside from medications, can help optimize functioning and quality of life despite the effects of the disease. Occupational therapy teaches people the practical skills they need to take care of themselves both at home and . Occupational therapists show people how to preserve their energy, since PPMS typically causes extreme fatigue. They also help people adjust their daily activities and chores. Therapists may suggest ways to improve or renovate homes and workplaces to make them more accessible to people with disabilities. They may also assist in treating memory and problems. Physical therapists work to create specific exercise routines to help people increase their range of motion, preserve their mobility, and reduce spasticity and tremors. Physical therapists can recommend equipment to help people with PPMS get around better, such as: Some people with PPMS have problems with their language, speech, or swallowing. Pathologists can teach people how to: They may also recommend useful telephone aids and speech amplifiers to make communicating easier. can help you reduce spasticity and maintain a range of motion. You can try yoga, swimming, stretching, and other acceptable forms of exercise. Of course, it’s always a good idea to discuss any new exercise routine with your . CAM therapies are considered nonconventional treatments. Many people incorporate some type of CAM therapy as part of their MS management. There is very limited research evaluating the safety and effectiveness of CAM in MS. But such therapies are intended to help prevent the disease from damaging your nervous system and maintain your health so your body won’t feel so much of the effects of the disease. According to one , the most promising CAM therapies for MS include: Talk to your doctor before adding CAM to your treatment plan, and make sure you continue to adhere to your prescribed treatments. A big part of your overall treatment plan will be to manage your symptoms. You may need a variety of medications, lifestyle changes, and complementary treatments to do this. Depending on your symptoms, a doctor may prescribe: medications to reduce fatigue, such as modafinil (Provigil) medications to help treat erectile dysfunction (ED) These lifestyle changes could make your symptoms more manageable: Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Perform strength-building exercises to build up muscles and boost energy. Try gentle exercise and stretching programs like tai chi and yoga to help with balance, flexibility, and coordination. Manage stress with massage, meditation, or acupuncture. The goal of rehabilitation is to improve and maintain function and reduce fatigue. This may include: Ask your doctor for a referral to specialists in these areas. PPMS isn’t a common type of MS, but multiple researchers are still exploring ways to treat the condition. The 2017 approval of ocrelizumab marked a big step forward because it is approved for PPMS indication. Other emerging treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and biotin, have garnered mixed results in PPMS so far. Ibudilast has also been studied for its effects on PPMS and SPMS. Recent results from a phase II trial show that it causes some side effects, including depression. However, it was also associated with a lower rate of brain atrophy. Speak with your doctor if you want the most up-to-date information on the best ways to manage your PPMS. — — Doctor Discussion Guide: What to Ask About Primary Progressive MS Everything You Need to Know About PPMS and the Workplace People Like Me: Living with Primary Progressive MS 15 Ways to Live Your Best Life with Multiple Sclerosis A multiple sclerosis diagnosis can turn your world upside down, but it doesn't need to prevent you from doing what you love.

51fcecbd-d232-4861-9956-e7a5975770a1,"Investigational Agent Slows Brain Shrinkage in Progressive MS Recognizing the Frequency – and Addressing the Impact – of Swallowing Problems in MS How Impact on Quality of Life Differs by Type of MS More Sun Early in Life May Mean Lower MS Risk Later in Life Research into the causes, diagnosis, impact, and management of multiple sclerosis (MS) continues to move forward on a broad front and at a rapid pace. While many advances are announced at medical meetings, such as the annual gatherings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), American Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), and European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), other findings are reported in medical journals throughout the year. Below, we highlight several noteworthy studies published in recent months. Investigational Agent Slows Brain Shrinkage in Progressive MS People with progressive MS who took the investigational agent ibudilast for 96 weeks had roughly one-half the amount of brain atrophy (the shrinking or reduction in brain volume) than the amount experienced by their counterparts who were given a placebo. These results are according to a study published in August in . [Fox 2018] The study enrolled 255 individuals with progressive MS. A total of 129 study participants received an oral dose of up to 100 mg of ibudilast daily. The other 126 participants received placebo. A slight majority of individuals in both groups had primary-progressive MS (PPMS), while the remainder had secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). The main adverse events seen in the ibudilast group were gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and depression. These occurred more often in people receiving the drug than in those receiving placebo. This Phase II trial was conducted at 28 sites, and was sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, among others. Ibudilast is an oral anti-inflammatory and potentially neuroprotective agent being developed by MediciNova. The company is also exploring the potential role of ibudilast in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – also known as ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease – and other conditions. With limited treatment options for progressive forms of MS, this Phase II study is extremely interesting and promising. Hopefully it sets the stage for a Phase III trial examining the impact of ibudilast on MS symptoms and outcomes. Gilenya (fingolimod) reduced the annualized relapse rate in children and adolescents with MS relative to these individuals’ earlier relapse rates. This reduced relapse rate is also relative to other pediatric patients treated with interferon beta-1a (Avonex). [Chitnis 2018] This reduction in the annualized relapse rate was the main finding from the PARADIGMS study, the first global, completed, controlled, randomized study specifically designed for children aged 10 to 17 years with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. While the study was published in in August 2018, results from the trial prompted the FDA to approve Gilenya in May 2018 as the first MS treatment for pediatric patients. Gilenya was approved for use in adults with relapsing MS in 2010. A total of 215 children and adolescents participated in the PARADIGMS trial, with 107 randomized to receive Gilenya and 108 to receive interferon beta-1a. Participants in the Gilenya group received 0.5 mg of the oral agent per day (or 0.25 mg per day for those weighing 40 kg – roughly 88 pounds – or less). Participants in the comparison group received an intramuscular injection of 30 ug of interferon beta-1a per week. Both treatments were given for up to two years. The mean average age of the participants was 15.3 years, and these individuals had experienced a mean average of 2.4 relapses in the preceding two years – or more than one relapse per year. The adjusted annualized relapse rate in the Gilenya group was 0.12 versus a 0.67 rate in the interferon beta-1a group. This absolute difference of 0.55 relapses was statistically significant. Compared to their peers receiving interferon beta-1a, children and adolescents receiving Gilenya also had roughly one-half as many new or newly enlarged central nervous system (CNS) lesions identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 89 percent of participants receiving Gilenya and 95 percent of those receiving interferon beta-1a experienced adverse events, with 16.8 percent of those taking Gilenya and 6.5 percent of those taking interferon beta-1a having serious adverse events. In the Gilenya group, serious events included convulsions in six participants, infection in four, and a reduction in white blood cell count in two. In the interferon beta-1a group, two individuals had infection and one experienced an abnormal heart rate. The availability of a treatment shown to reduce relapses in children and adolescents represents a major milestone in pediatric MS. As the PARADIGMS study’s lead author Tanuja Chitnis, MD, and her colleagues noted, the reduction in relapses, lessened accumulation of new or enlarging CNS lesions, and higher rate of serious adverse events seen with Gilenya (relative to interferon beta-1a), underscore the need for longer studies to determine the durability and safety of Gilenya in pediatric patients. Meanwhile, however, clinicians and their young patients finally have an FDA-approved treatment option. A study was designed to determine the effectiveness of group, cognitive rehabilitation (CR) therapy in women with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). The study found that these women performed better on memory assessments than their counterparts who did not participate in such sessions. [Mani 2018] Researchers assigned 17 women with RRMS and evidence of impaired cognitive function to participate in eight, two-hour sessions of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) over a four-week period. Those CR sessions focused on memory, attention, and executive function. A second control group of 17 women with RRMS and cognitive impairment attended a separate set of group sessions that did not involve cognitive rehabilitation. All participants underwent assessment of cognitive function before the start of the group sessions and three months after the sessions ended. At the three-month follow-up, the CR group had significantly greater improvement from baseline in visual and verbal memory than the control group. The CR group also outperformed the control group in an overall assessment of memory function. Further, women in the CR group did better on a card-sorting exercise that tests memory than did those in the control group. Attention was the only domain in which no significant difference was found between the groups. Cognitive impairment eventually affects up to two-thirds of people with MS. While this study had a small number of subjects and did not include men, it may have identified a valuable strategy for helping preserve or enhance memory function in people with RRMS.   Recognizing the Frequency – and Addressing the Impact – of Swallowing Problems in MS More than one-third of people receiving care at an Australian MS clinic reported swallowing problems when specifically asked about the issue on a questionnaire. [Alali 2018] Difficulty swallowing – known as dysphagia in medical terminology – was reported by 38 percent of the 103 adults with MS participating in this study. The nature and severity of the problems ranged from coughing and throat clearing, to choking on food and liquid. Patients also reported a reduced desire to eat, longer time required to eat, and mealtime anxiety. Researchers conducting the study noted that, if left untreated, swallowing problems eventually can lead to complications including malnutrition, dehydration, and pneumonia. They recommended that people with MS who have dysphagia see a speech pathologist as early as possible for evaluation and management to improve swallowing function. This study highlights the importance of promptly recognizing and addressing a common symptom of MS rather than minimizing its impact or deferring care. How Impact on Quality of Life Differs by Type of MS The symptoms that most affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with progressive MS differ significantly from those affecting people with relapsing forms of the condition. [Barin 2018] This difference between symptoms was the main finding from a study of 855 people participating in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry. Researchers used two scales with ranges from 0 to 100 to measure the impact of various symptoms in 611 people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 244 people with progressive MS (PMS). They found that in individuals with RRMS, gait and balance problems were the symptoms that had the most impact. By contrast, people with progressive MS cited spasticity and paralysis as the issues that most detracted from their health-related quality of life. Fatigue, depression, dizziness, and spasticity also were frequently cited issues for people with RRMS, while the PMS group identified pain as another symptom adversely affecting their quality of life. While the findings are not surprising, given the different courses of relapsing-remitting and progressive MS, they reinforce the importance of understanding how several factors – including MS type – contribute to the disease burden that patients experience. They also underscore the need for people to talk with their clinicians, not only about the presence of various symptoms, but also about the extent to which each symptom is affecting their quality of life.  More Sun Early in Life May Mean Lower MS Risk Later in Life Growing up in a sunny area reduces the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), according to a recent study by investigators in the United States and Canada. [Tremlett 2018] The researchers matched 151 people with MS with 235 similarly aged healthy controls from the Nurses’ Health Study. The investigators classified each person as having low, medium, or high exposure to ambient ultraviolet (UV-B) light at ages 5 to15 years, 16 to 20 years, and every 10 years thereafter. The classification was based on factors including the latitude, altitude, and cloud cover where a person lived. Researchers also documented hours per week of sun exposure in summer and winter. A total of 98 percent of the study subjects were Caucasian, and the mean average age of MS onset in the 151 people with MS was 39.5 years. The study found that people living in a high UV-B area before the mean average age of MS onset had a 45-percent lower risk of developing MS than people living in a low UV-B area. Additional analysis showed that having medium or high exposure at ages 5 to 15 cut the risk of MS by more than one-half, relative to people living in low-exposure areas. This study extends a line of inquiry into the association between Vitamin D levels and MS risk. Sunlight is a major source of Vitamin D, and research has shown that many people with MS have relatively low levels of the vitamin. Additionally, epidemiological research has shown MS to be more prevalent in northern countries, where individuals receive less year-round sun exposure than in lower latitudes. Given the very real dangers of sun-related skin cancer, this research is not a reason to engage in tanning for potential preventive purposes, but it does add to the knowledge base about risk factors for MS.

87eb685c-6a2c-4269-8dc3-dcfdb5c61680,"What’s the Connection Between MS and Optic Neuritis? Medically reviewed by — — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that attacks the nerves in your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. It’s considered an autoimmune disease. It causes inflammation and the loss of a protective covering on nerves, known as myelin. This means the electrical impulses, which your body relies on, don’t travel through the nerve properly. The connection between MS and optic neuritis is the inflammation and loss of the myelin covering of your optic nerve and retina. Your optic nerve is responsible for transmitting images from your eyes to your brain. Inflammation of this nerve results in optic neuritis. This can cause you to experience vision loss and other troubling symptoms. Optic neuritis is the first sign of MS in about of people who have MS. The lifetime risk of developing MS after an episode of optic neuritis is about according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms of optic neuritis usually occur in one eye and might include: pain on eye movement or a dull ache behind your eye flashing lights or flickering lights with eye movement The exact cause of optic neuritis isn’t known. Along with MS, there are other things that have been linked to the development of optic neuritis including: neuromyelitis optica, an autoimmune disorder that can affect your optic nerve bacterial infections, including , , and and , both of which cause inflammation certain medications like quinine and some antibiotics As mentioned, optic neuritis often occurs in connection with MS. Other factors that increase your risk of optic neuritis include: Some people have genetic mutations that increase their chance of optic neuritis. Women are much more likely to develop optic neuritis than men. Those between 20 to 40 years old have increased risk of developing optic neuritis. Optic neuritis affects Caucasians more often than other ethnicities. Your doctor will likely refer you to an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist if they suspect you have optic neuritis. Common tests used to diagnose the condition include: , which examines your optic disk for swelling pupillary light reaction test, which tests how your pupils respond to light MRI scan, which allows for better viewing of your optic nerve visual response test, which detects optic nerve damage Optic neuritis usually improves on its own, and certain medications may help speed your sight recovery if it doesn’t. Steroids are commonly used to treat optic neuritis, and they help reduce optic nerve inflammation. Steroids may be given intravenously or in pill form. Your doctor may recommend plasma exchange therapy if you experience severe vision loss. If your optic neuritis is believed to be linked to MS, other treatments are available that help slow the progression of MS such as . Monitoring vision for changes associated with optic neuritis is important. Doing so may present a window of time for your healthcare provider to try to prevent or delay MS progression. Your ophthalmologist and neurologist will work together to monitor changes that may affect treatment decisions. You may experience a flare-up or relapse of optic neuritis if you have MS. This is also known as an exacerbation, which means your symptoms may noticeably worsen or you may experience new symptoms. Relapse may occur if your optic nerves become inflamed and affect your vision. You may notice only one symptom, or you may have multiple symptoms. For instance, you could experience fatigue or balance problems alongside optic neuritis. This can occur if you have inflammation in different parts of your central nervous system. See your healthcare provider right away if you have eye pain, experience loss of vision, or see flashing lights. Fast action can help prevent permanent vision loss or other serious health problems. Be sure to get medical attention if you notice new symptoms, such as a change in how well you can see. It’s also important to be aware of worsening symptoms if you already have optic neuritis, especially if your symptoms aren’t responding to treatment. Optic neuritis symptoms generally improve in 80 percent of patients over a few weeks according to the . It’s possible to experience only minor visual loss or a full resolution of symptoms. You may have vision problems in the future if you have optic neuritis but don’t have MS or another underlying condition. Your prognosis for improved long-term vision is better than if you do have MS, however. Having both optic neuritis and MS may make you more likely to experience recurring symptoms of optic neuritis.

1720eefe-971c-4cae-ad82-e42dd6ebcd75,"Antidepressant Shows Potential as Treatment for Progressive MS — Research that used a systematic screening of generic drugs showed clomipramine as a promising therapy for progressive multiple sclerosis. While people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) are getting assistance from successful studies and new treatments, those with progressive MS may feel they’re less likely to find help. But a new out of Canada has made two major discoveries to help end this pattern. The first is a clinical way to measure currently approved oral generic drugs that benefit people with MS in a timely manner. The second is to further study the benefits of the antidepressant clomipramine as a potential therapy for progressive MS. According to the study, in order to successfully treat progressive MS, the treatment should simultaneously target three MS disease drivers. These drivers include iron-mediated neurotoxicity, lymphocyte activity, and oxidative stress. The study looked at generic, orally available medicines that target the three drivers of progressive MS. A successful drug must be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and have a positive effect on all three disease drivers. Out of the initial 1,040 drugs tested, 249 were able to cross this barrier. Of these, 35 prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity in culture. This list was further narrowed down based on how the drugs managed the remaining two disease drivers. Among the semifinalists were several antipsychotics and antidepressants. One antidepressant that stood out was clomipramine. It also showed the ability to inhibit lymphocyte activity. In addition, clomipramine is a well-tolerated antidepressant. Discovered in 1964, clomipramine has been used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and chronic pain. It’s on the World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines, considered to be the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Common side effects include constipation, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sleepiness, sexual dysfunction, trouble urinating, and weight gain. It also runs a risk of affecting the liver. This could interfere with some MS disease-modifying therapies. In some cases, the risk of suicide increases, around 25 years of age. The drug may also not be safe during pregnancy. Clomipramine works by reducing inflammation and microglial activation. The human body manages inflammation by activated microglia. These are the immune cells of the central nervous system. The microglia respond to neuronal damage and remove the damaged cells by phagocytosis — a fancy word for a Pac-Man sort of behavior where one cell engulfs another. The study also looked at clomipramine in mice, specifically those with autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which is considered a model for MS. In mice, clomipramine significantly improved the clinical signs of acute and chronic phases of MS. “This is an interesting approach of ‘repurposing’ old drugs for new uses,” explained Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and clinical director of the UCLA MS program. “The animal results are very intriguing,” Giesser told Healthline, “and if they are shown to translate into efficacy in human trials, [that] would represent significant advances in treating progressive MS.” Mark Allegretta, PhD, associate vice president of commercial research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, did issue a caution. “This is early laboratory research, so there is no immediate consequence yet for people living with MS,” Allegretta told Healthline. But, he added, “this kind of systematic approach to screen based on multiple readouts relevant to progressive MS may lead to a compound with greater efficacy.” “It is always good for people living with MS to communicate with their clinical care professionals,” he advised. “However, clomipramine has not been tested in people with MS, and much more testing is needed to determine if it is safe and efficacious.” Editor’s Note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS. Her award-winning blog is — The Blood Test That Could Improve Your MS Prognosis Healthy Diet Can Reduce Disabilities Involving Multiple Sclerosis Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS The Blood Test That Could Improve Your MS Prognosis By showing potential to help predict the progression of MS, a blood test is aiming to reduce the number of MRIs for people with the chronic condition.

2a3f72b7-e391-412b-b439-58440a3640d1,"A sudden or severe exacerbation (also known as a relapse, attack, flare-up, or episode), in which existing symptoms worsen, or new symptoms develop. To be considered a true relapse, symptoms must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, and not be associated with other factors that might mimic an acute attack, such as a urinary tract infection, anxiety, depression, hot weather, and extreme exercise. Relapses occur with relapsing-remitting, progressive-relapsing, and sometimes secondary-progressive forms of MS. Written instructions that provide specific directions to doctors and family regarding a person’s end-of-life choices in advance, should this person become unable to make these decisions on his or her own when needed. Typically include appointing a healthcare representative or proxy as well as creating a “living will.” A brace that holds and angles the foot and ankle in the best position for maximum comfort and mobility. This device can also relieve stress on the knee. A protein produced by the body’s immune system when it detects foreign substances, called antigens. Examples of antigens include microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses) and chemicals. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly targets healthy tissue, which happens with an autoimmune disorder. Each type of antibody is unique and defends the body against one specific type of antigen. A foreign molecule or substance that stimulates the immune system to activate a series of events to eliminate the antigen. In MS, the immune system misdirects the reactivity to antigens to damage the CNS, which is referred to as autoimmunity. Tools, products, or types of equipment that help someone perform tasks and activities. They may help individuals to move around, see, communicate, eat, or get dressed. Some are high-tech tools, such as computers (which can be adapted to meet various disabilities such as reduced vision or dexterity/mobility problems). Others are much simpler, like a “reacher” – a tool that helps someone to grasp an object that is difficult to reach. Any service or tool that can help a person with a disability perform activities that might otherwise be difficult or not be possible. Inability to coordinate walking movements. The decrease in the volume of brain or muscle tissue often associated with MS. When the body’s own immune system attacks its own tissue, it is known as an autoimmune disease. MS is believed to be an autoimmune disease. The ANS helps control blood flow to and from the extremities; it also controls: heart rate; blood pressure; bowel, bladder, and sexual activity; and other automatic bodily functions. The wire-like nerve fibers that conduct signals between neurons (nerves of the brain and spinal cord). Axons have a protective myelin covering and are found in the white matter of the brain. Damaged nerves that are unable to efficiently conduct impulse flow. Immune-system cells that produce antibodies to fight against “foreign invaders” (such as bacteria or viruses) within the body and help to regulate other immune cells. These cells have been shown to be an element of the autoimmune destruction seen in MS. The Babinski reflex occurs after the sole of the foot has been firmly stroked. The big toe then moves upward or toward the top surface of the foot. The other toes fan out. This reflex is normal in children up to 2-years old. It disappears as the child gets older. When the Babinski reflex is present in a child older than 2 years or in an adult, it is often a sign of a brain or nervous-system disorder. Multiple sclerosis is among the disorders that could be indicated by this reflex in people older than 2 years. Bell’s palsy is the most common cause of facial paralysis. It usually affects just one side of the face. Symptoms appear suddenly and are at their worst about 48 hours after they start. They can range from mild to severe and include twitching, weakness, paralysis, drooping eyelid or corner of mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, excessive tearing in the eye, and impaired ability to taste. Scientists think that a viral infection makes the facial nerve swell or become inflamed. Individuals are most likely to get Bell’s palsy if pregnant, diabetic, or sick with a cold or flu. It can also occur with multiple sclerosis. Three out of four patients improve without treatment. With or without treatment, most people begin to get better within two weeks and recover completely within three to six months. A protective barrier that lines the blood vessels, this layer of cells is designed to prevent damaging cells and other substances in the blood (including those that could cause disease) from entering the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord of the CNS. Consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord and functions to send and receive nerve impulses throughout the body. The liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Prior to a diagnosis of MS, CIS is a single attack (or the appearance of one or more symptoms characteristic of MS), with a very high risk of developing MS, when no other diseases or causes for symptoms are apparent. A group of mental processes that include functions such as memory, decision making, and concentration, which is the ability to focus on specific tasks and planning. Some of the cognitive functions typically affected in people with MS include: information processing; perceiving; attending/responding to incoming information; information-processing speed; cognitive flexibility, such as attending to multiple stimuli at the same time (“multi-tasking”); problems with storage, manipulation, and retrieval of information; and executive function, which includes planning, working memory, attention, and problem-solving. A type of steroid that works by reducing inflammation in the CNS. A steroid first used to treat MS relapses in 1951. Small proteins that may stimulate or inhibit the function of other cells. They connect to specific receptors found on the surface of cells and send messages from one cell to another. They can stimulate or inhibit the inflammation process. Damage to the protective (insulating) covering of the nerves (myelin) of the CNS, causing interruptions in the flow of nerve impulses in the CNS. This can ultimately affect a wide range of function. Double vision resulting from lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. Neither the participants nor the medical staff administering or evaluating the new treatment are told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo or other drug being compared to the test drug. Speech that is slurred or poorly articulated; it can involve a loss of volume control, unnatural emphasis on words or sentences, and a slower rate of speaking. Type of pain that is experienced as a burning, aching, or “pins and needles” type of sensation under the skin. For some, this can be painful; for others, it is more bothersome. Disorder causing changes in the quality of speech, such as a breathless quality to the voice, or speech that sounds harsh. An electrical test used to evaluate nerve and muscle problems. Evoked potentials measure the speed of the brain’s response to visual, auditory (sound), or sensory (feeling) stimuli to the central nervous system, using electrodes (taped to the patient’s head) and a computer. This system measures the time for an impulse to travel from the eye, ear, arm, or leg to the brain. This 10-point scale (from 1 to 10 with half points) measures degrees of disability, largely in terms of mobility. Points 1 to 3 on the scale are primarily used to measure function; points 4 to 9 measure mobility. Half points are used for higher clarity. An MS-like disease in animals, induced through the injection of myelin plus adjuvant (a substance that enhances the body’s response), to enable investigators to see how experimental treatments affect this MS-like disorder (often in mice). A type of dye given via injection prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It serves to enhance areas of active inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. A procedure to help bring urinary symptoms under control by inserting a catheter (a specially designed thin tube) into the urinary opening to drain urine from the bladder, for people who cannot empty their bladder normally (see neurogenic bladder). An electric shock-like sensation down the spine and legs when the neck is flexed forward; approximately 40 percent of individuals with MS experience this type of pain, although it usually does not require any treatment. It is often an indication of myelin damage in the spinal-cord area. Also known as a spinal tap, LP is a procedure where a very thin needle is inserted at the lower back and a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected to look for induced changes or other problems. A type of white blood cell that plays a strong role in the body’s immune system, which works to defend the body against foreign bodies and disease. In MS, the lymphocytes may be misdirected to cause damage to the central nervous system. Some lymphocytes help to control the MS damage (T-regulatory cells). Type of white blood cell that works to ingest and destroy foreign substances. Scan of the brain and/or spine. The MRI uses a computer, radiofrequency stimulator, and a large electromagnet to provide a picture of the brain. Monoclonal antibodies are produced to defend the body and are derived from cells that are identical (cloned from a single cell and then replicated). They are produced from animal tissue, most commonly laboratory mice. Humanized monoclonal antibodies are antibodies from non-human species whose protein sequences have been modified to increase their similarity to antibodies produced naturally in humans. Monoclonal antibodies are an important type of medication, as they can be specifically targeted to perform a particular action, which is desirable when trying to impact a complex structure like the immune system. The name of all monoclonal antibodies ends with “mab.” These antibodies attack and destroy specific inflammatory lymphocytes that may be damaging the CNS in MS. A scale that measures lower-limb function (walking), upper-limb function (arm movements), and cognition. Myelin is a fatty protein that serves as a protective covering and insulation to the nerves (called axons) that work like wires to carry messages to and from the CNS. Bladder problems resulting from demyelination in the nervous system pathways that control the muscles of the bladder and the sphincters of the urinary tract. The three categories of bladder problems are usually referred to as “failure to store” (small, spastic bladder), “failure to empty” (large, flaccid bladder), and “dyssynergia,” which is a disconnect between the muscles of the bladder wall and the urinary sphincter. Involuntary movements of the eyes that result from lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. It typically is an uncontrolled side-to-side (horizontal) or up-and-down (vertical) movements of the eye. It can be asymptomatic (causing no visual problems) or severe enough to disturb vision. Objects may appear to jump or move unpredictably as the two eyes no longer coordinate well with each other. Nystagmus can be more of a nuisance than a major problem and is usually temporary. It may sometimes distort vision. Abnormal immune proteins called immunoglobulins. These are present in the CSF of roughly 90 percent of individuals with MS, however, they can occur with several other neurological disorders. Since the introduction of the MRI, CSF analysis is used less often, but it can be helpful in supporting an MS diagnosis if the MRI results are normal or inconclusive. Cells that produce and maintain myelin. Over time, oligodendrocytes may be damaged or lost and fail to repair the damaged myelin. A condition that causes decreased or blurred vision. This is an inflammation of the optic nerve, which – unlike the nerves that innervate most of the body that are part of the peripheral nervous system – is actually part of the central nervous system and is myelinated in the same way as axons in the brain and spinal cord. Tingling, burning, or numbing sensation. Sudden recurrence of a symptom, spasm, or seizure. Area around the cerebro-spinal fluid in the brain. Areas of inflammation and damage in the brain or spinal cord in MS. This form of MS presents a gradual but steady accumulation of neurological problems from the onset, without the presence of relapses and remissions. A progressive course of MS from the onset with acute relapses occurring later in the disease course. Characterized by uncontrolled, inappropriate, and/or exaggerated episodes of crying, laughing, or other emotional display. PBA occurs involuntarily with little or no stimulation to invoke such a response. A temporary worsening of symptoms without actual myelin inflammation or damage, brought on by other influences. These can include other illnesses or infection, over-exercise, a warm environment, depression, exhaustion, and stress. When symptoms flare, checking for a fever is important, since even a minor infection and slight increase in temperature can cause symptoms to appear. A temporary worsening or recurrence of existing symptoms and/or the appearance of new symptoms (also called an “acute attack;” definition shown above), caused by inflammation occurring along the nerves and the myelin. This can range from a few days in duration to a few months, followed by a complete or partial recovery (remission). Acute physical symptoms and neurological signs must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, without any signs of infection or fever, before the treating physician may consider this type of flare-up to be a true relapse. Treatments may improve recovery time. A course of MS that includes temporary symptom flare-ups (also referred to as relapses, attacks, exacerbations, or bouts), which typically last for one to three months. These are followed by a complete or partial recovery. Reduction and stability in severity of one’s MS, or the disappearance of symptoms. The restoration or repair of myelin (protective covering to the nerves). Characterized by long pauses between syllables and words with loss of melody in speech production; it is a type of dysarthria. Blind spot in the center of the visual field. This phase of MS follows relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and is reached when the patient experiences a progressive worsening of symptoms. SPMS may occur with or without superimposed relapses. Disease-modifying therapies for MS help to delay the conversion from RRMS to SPMS. A tightness or stiffness of the muscles – occurring typically in the legs (calf or thigh), groin, buttocks, arms, or hands. Immune-system cells that have the ability to increase an immune response within the body, causing inflammation and damage in MS. A spontaneous, sharp or shooting facial pain, often brought on by a light touch or movement. The sensation of “spinning or rotation,” which may occur as the result of lesions in the brainstem areas that coordinate balance.

These changes can affect the way people feel about themselves and alter their cognitive functions. For many, the emotional and cognitive effects of the disease represent its greatest challenges. There are a number of emotional responses that appear to be common as people learn to deal with having MS. Uncertainty, stress and anxiety are the most common, not just during diagnosis, but throughout the course of the disease. A person with MS may grieve for their life before MS and their self-image may take a while to adjust to having MS. Other emotional changes that may occur in MS include clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and mood swings. All of these are more common among people with MS than in the general population. Depression and bipolar disorder require professional attention and the use of effective treatments. Emotional lability appears to be more common, and possibly more severe, in people with MS. This may include frequent mood changes, for example from happy to sad to angry. It is believed that the causes are the extra stress brought on by MS as well as neurological changes. Uncontrollable laughing and crying is a disorder affecting a small proportion of people with MS, and is thought to be caused by MS-related changes in the brain. Having MS can affect self-esteem. There may be times when it’s difficult to do everything a person is used to doing, or they may have to do things differently. Focusing too much on the negative aspects can feel overwhelming. This one minute infographic gives some confidence boosters and tips for managing low self-esteem and MS. Thanks to the UK MS Society for providing the text for this infographic. MS organisations around the world have into a range of languages. If you’re interested in translating it into an additional language, contact . Cognition refers to the “higher” brain functions such as memory and reasoning. About half of all people with MS will not experience any cognitive changes, but for others, the most commonly affected aspects of cognition are: Because MS can affect any part of the brain, almost any cognitive function can be impaired, and symptoms can range from having a mild impact on only one or two aspects through to more pervasive changes, which affect a person’s daily life. Cognitive changes can have a significant impact on a person’s ability to work and fulfil family responsibilities. Family members may not realise that MS can cause cognitive problems and this misunderstanding can result in anger and confusion. MS is a complex disease with many psychological aspects. Adjusting successfully to MS requires understanding and addressing these changes along with the physical ones. There are many available for education, evaluation and treatment. By using these resources to the fullest, a person with MS and their family can continue to live their day to day life. Minsk, Belarus, 10/2011.

Your doctor finds out how you’re doing by asking questions and possibly ordering an MRI. “I ask a patient if they’ve had any new symptoms in the past year, if any symptoms have worsened, or is there anything they could do a year ago that they can’t do now,” says , director and chief research scientist at Tisch MS Research Center in New York City. “If the doctor sees no change in your mental status or muscle strength, he may also order an MRI, which will tell him whether there are new lesions on the brain or spinal cord, or evidence of disease progression. If there’s nothing new in your symptoms, examination, or MRI, then the treatment is working.” If you’re obviously not doing well, of course, alternative treatment options need to be explored. “But even patients who are doing well might need more aggressive treatment,” says of Holy Name Medical Center. “If the MRI is active, the patient should be treated more aggressively, no matter how they feel,” she says. “Just like cancer, which is treated aggressively to prevent it from spreading, MS can be a very bad disease and aggressive treatment prevents further deterioration. Often patients are told they have a mild form of the disease and they can watch and wait; but the earlier MS is treated, the better patients do.” If my MS medication isn’t relieving my symptoms, what will? Your doctor needs to treat each symptom individually. Corticosteroids are used to shorten attacks. Muscle spasticity or stiffness can be managed with stretching exercises and medications like tizanidine. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) can help walking speed, as it enhances conductions of nerve signals. Fatigue may improve with aerobic exercise and medication such as modafinil (Provigil), which increases wakefulness and may also improve the fatigue associated with MS. Modafinil is prescribed off-label, meaning it is not approved specifically to relieve fatigue in MS and some insurance companies will not pay for it. Bowel problems are not uncommon and can be managed with diet and fluid changes, suppositories, or medications. Burning or painful sensations may respond to a variety of medications including (Elavil) and gabapentin (Neurontin). Cognitive and speech problems often respond to rehabilitation. Aubagio (teriflunomide) can help treat active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) that is neither highly active nor rapidly evolving severe RRMS. Yes, if you are suffering any reductions in function as a result of your MS. Physical therapy won’t change the course of your MS, but it may improve other factors such as fitness, mobility, and memory, and make you more independent. It can help strengthen any muscles weakened by lack of use and improve balance as well. Occupational therapy improves independence in daily living. If you’re having problems with eating, dressing, or grooming, occupational therapists can help with coordination and strength, and recommend equipment for your home or workplace to help with daily life. Speech therapy will help those who have problems speaking or swallowing. There is even cognitive rehabilitation to improve memory, attention, and problem solving, which may be affected by the loss of myelin in the brain. Yes. More research is showing the benefits of exercise and other rehabilitation strategies in improving quality of life, safety, and independence in MS patients. Exercise contributes to well being and helps with sleep, appetite, and bowel and bladder function. “Exercise has a lot of benefits for MS, especially for management of fatigue,” says , director of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Multiple Sclerosis Center of Excellence. “Patients think that working out will make them more tired, but the opposite is actually true. In addition, when patients have issues with muscle tone, spasticity, and ambulation, exercise will keep muscles limber and preserve strength.” Are there lifestyle or dietary changes that might help? Sometimes, moving to a cooler climate can help. Some patients are sensitive to heat. Lots of diets have been put forth for MS, but none have proven effective or necessary. The only vitamin that has been proven to help is vitamin D. Studies on other vitamins, such as vitamin E, show promise. Your doctor should be able to give you a good indication of your prognosis. There are different types of MS, some of which are more progressive than others. Even if you have primary progressive MS, there is a lot your doctor can do to minimize it. Don’t be afraid to research what the latest treatments are so you can ask your doctor about them. Are there alternative or complementary therapies that might help? None have been scientifically proven to help. The danger of using them is that patients might stop using prescribed treatments, which can certainly cause their MS to get worse. However, some people find that alternative therapies such as acupuncture, hypnosis, massage, and meditation help reduce stress, manage symptoms, and make them feel better.

People with RRMS tend to have more brain lesions with more inflammatory cells.Those with PPMS tend to have more spinal cord lesions and fewer inflammatory cells. RRMS affects women two to three times more often than men. People with RRMS will likely have mobility issues, but these issues are more gradual.People with PPMS often experience more mobility issues and have more trouble walking. In general, PPMS tends to affect the body’s ability to function more than RRMS does. For example, those with PPMS may also find it more difficult to continue working because of their mobility issues and declining neurologic function.

b3669cc3-1cd3-4c89-acd4-b019b4150ef7,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is often diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s. The disease typically follows a pattern, moving through different variations or types over the years. This is because as you get older, your MS symptoms are likely to change. MS damages myelin, the protective coating around nerves. This damage interrupts the flow of nerve impulses from the brain to the body. The greater the damage that’s done to the myelin, the more severe your symptoms will become. Everyone with MS is different. How quickly your disease progresses and the symptoms you experience won’t necessarily be the same as someone else’s with the condition. Your doctor can’t predict exactly how your disease will change over time. But advances in MS research are offering better treatments to slow the disease’s progression and improve the outlook for people living with MS. MS often starts with a single attack. Suddenly your vision becomes blurry, or your legs feel numb or weak. When these symptoms last for at least 24 hours and this is the first attack, they’re called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS typically starts between ages 20 and 40. It’s caused by inflammation or damage to myelin in your central nervous system. CIS can be a warning of MS to come, but that isn’t always the case. Between of people with CNS will develop MS. If an MRI shows signs of brain lesions, MS is much more likely to develop. Up to of people with MS are first diagnosed with RRMS. It typically starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, although it can begin earlier or later in life. In RRMS, attacks on myelin produce periods of symptom flare-ups called relapses. During a relapse, symptoms may include: Each relapse can last from a few days to a few months. The exact symptoms and their severity can be different for each person. After a relapse, you’ll enter a symptom-free period called remission. Each remission lasts for several months or years. The disease doesn’t progress during remission. Some people stay in RRMS for many decades. Others progress to the secondary-progressive form within a few years. It’s impossible to predict how each person’s disease will act, but new treatments are helping to slow the progression of MS overall. About of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form. PPMS usually appears during the mid to late 30s. In PPMS, nervous system damage and symptoms steadily get worse over time. There are no real remission periods. The disease continues to progress, and it can eventually lead to problems walking and performing other daily activities. SPMS is the stage that follows RRMS. In this type of MS, myelin damage gets worse over time. You won’t have the long remissions that you had with RRMS. Increasing nervous system damage will lead to more severe symptoms. In the past, about with RRMS moved into the SPMS stage within 10 years, and transitioned to SPMS within 25 years. With new MS drugs, fewer people are progressing to SPMS, and the transition is happening much more slowly. Experts don’t yet know how long these treatments can delay the progression to SPMS. MS is a disease that starts early in life but progresses over time. Most people start with the relapsing-remitting form, alternating periods of symptoms called relapses with symptom-free periods called remissions. Without treatment, the disease continues to the secondary-progressive form. Yet new and more effective treatments are slowing MS progression, sometimes for decades. — — Advancing MS: Coping with Depression, Stress, and Anger Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Depression and MS: Ways to Care for Your Mental Health If you have MS, you're at an increased risk of developing depression.

Here’s What You Need to Know — Many people complain about winter, but it can be a particularly challenging time for those who live with chronic conditions. Chris Anderson is no stranger to bad winters. He lives in Minnesota — a state that gets, on average, of snow every year, depending on where you live. In the winter, the average temperature can get as low as 18 to 8°F (-7 to -13°C). And as someone living with , this cold, frigid weather affects him more than most. “The colder it gets, the shakier my legs get,” he says. “It makes it very difficult for me to move around in the colder months.” After losing about 85 percent of his eyesight due to , inflammation of the optic nerve, Anderson was first diagnosed with MS in September 2004. At the time, he was working as a middle school social studies’ teacher. While his eyesight did more or less recover, he soon developed other including , balance issues, and extreme . The extreme winter weather in his state exacerbates many of these symptoms. “Last winter was especially bad because of the ice,” Anderson says. “I normally use ice cleats on my shoes along with a walking stick with a metal tip on the end to help prevent falls, [but] last year, I slipped on the icy pavement and suffered a .” — whether from the weather, exercise, or a hot shower — has been linked to and a temporary worsening of symptoms in people with MS. While heat sensitivity is more commonly reported, around of people with MS experience worsening symptoms due to cold temperatures. A drop in temperature can cause temporary issues with cognition, mobility, vision, and balance and may lead to numb, burning, or tingling sensations and tremors in the body’s extremities. It’s believed that this happens because the cold affects the speed of messages traveling along nerves that are already damaged by the disease. But it’s also been suggested that in MS could occur due to an in the part of the brain that affects body temperature. If you have MS and are affected by the cold weather, it’s important to prepare. Anderson recommends finding someone to help with snow removal and investing in a remote starter for your car (and making sure it’s working at the start of winter). “Since the cold weather greatly affects my MS, I need to have a warm car to walk into to prevent the leg shakiness from flaring up,” he says. Other folks with MS focus on ensuring they can wear layers of clothes to help them regulate their body temperature. Thermal socks and underwear are great for that, as are . Betsy Mahowald, who also lives in Minnesota, says that every winter she stocks up on winter clothes, like boots, hats, mittens, sweaters, and anything with a hood. In case of bad weather, she makes sure her home is stocked so she can avoid going outside in the worst weather. “I make sure I have a decent supply of food in the pantry and freezer, such as meats or frozen soups, Kleenex, toilet paper, and basic cold and flu medications,” she says. It’s also important to move around — even if indoors — because keeps your body warm and helps minimize muscle stiffness. Keeping your home warm, as best as possible, can also be helpful. Just be sure not to make the temperature hot because heat may also exacerbate MS symptoms. Mahowald says she also tries to schedule her annual neurologist visit in the fall, before the bad weather starts. Just one less trip she has to make outside in the cold. The best way to help a loved one with MS through the winter is simply by being there for them. “There are a lot of things I need to do to prepare for winter,” says Anderson. “Admittedly, I cannot do all of them alone because of my MS.” That’s why, he says, he’s grateful to the neighbors who help with snow removal or check in with him before or after a large storm. Many people complain about winter, but it can be a particularly challenging time for those who live with chronic conditions or pain. That’s why, if you can, simply offering to be a good ally or support system can go a long way in making things a little easier. Simone M.

3dd0ca5a-ad06-422e-b966-09d061aa57ab,"Why Nearly 1 in 5 People Thought to Have MS Have Been Misdiagnosed The misdiagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is a problem with significant consequences for patients as well as the healthcare system. There are in the United States living with the disease. And now say nearly 20 percent of them are misdiagnosed. Most of them had another condition but had been treated for MS for years. “The diagnosis of MS is tricky. Both the symptoms and MRI testing results can look like other conditions, such as stroke, migraines, and vitamin B-12 deficiency,” , a specialist in neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and a co-lead investigator of the study, said in a statement to Healthline. “You have to rule out any other diagnoses, and it’s not a perfect science.” The study looked at 241 patients across three campuses and will be published in the May issue of the peer-reviewed journal Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders. Kaisey, along with co-lead investigator , interim chair of neurology and director of the Cedars-Sinai Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology Center, and researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Vermont, analyzed patients who had been diagnosed by other physicians and then referred to the Cedars-Sinai or UCLA multiple sclerosis clinics over the course of a year. Investigators wanted to see how many patients were misdiagnosed with MS and identify common characteristics among those who had been misdiagnosed. The research found that almost 1 in 5 patients who came to the medical centers with a previous diagnosis of MS didn’t fulfill the criteria for that diagnosis. On average, researchers said, these people spent four years getting treatment for MS before receiving a correct diagnosis. “When we see a patient like that, even though they come to us with an established diagnosis, we just start from the beginning,” Sicotte said. The most common correct diagnosis was migraine (16 percent), followed by radiologically isolated syndrome, in which patients don’t experience symptoms of MS even though their MRI results may look like the disease. Among those misdiagnosed, 72 percent had been prescribed MS treatments. Forty-eight percent of these patients received therapies that carry a known risk of developing , a serious disease in the white matter of the brain. “I’ve seen patients suffering side effects from the medication they were taking for a disease they didn’t have,” Kaisey said. “Meanwhile, they weren’t getting treatment for what they did have. The cost to the patient is huge — medically, psychologically, financially.” Researchers estimated that the unnecessary treatments identified in this study alone cost almost $10 million. The researchers said they hope the results of this study will help improve diagnostic procedures and prevent future MS misdiagnoses. “The first step, which is what we’ve done here, is to identify the problem, so now we’re working on potential solutions,” Kaisey said. “This news is alarming and concerning,” , executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), told Healthline. “The study was done before the most recent update to the was published in December 2017.” “We’ve made great strides over the last few decades, especially with the MRI, but this study shows we need more help with diagnosis with MS,” he said. “We are looking forward to learning if this rate is reduced in the long run as a result of the criteria diagnostic.” Because the diagnosis of MS and new treatment algorithms are complicated, it’s often helpful to have a consultation with an MS specialist to review diagnosis and treatment. For example, migraine, the most common correct diagnosis, may present an imaging signal on an MRI that could prompt the confusion. The NMSS to rule out during the diagnosis process. In 2016 researchers , including direct and indirect costs, ranged from $8,528 to $54,244 per patient per year. Data sources ranged from 1999 to 2008 and don’t include some of the newer, more costly therapies. MS therapies have significantly increased in cost. by the Food and Drug Administration in March were priced at $88,500 and $99,500. Healthline spoke with , a patient advocate, writer, and patient co-investigator for . “There is a danger in pushing for an MS diagnosis when there isn’t clear and convincing evidence, as they found through this study,” she said. “People really must be seen by a neurologist who specializes in MS and not just general neurology and have a thorough neurological exam. “When you are diagnosed with MS it changes so many things in our lives, and to undo that mark on the medical record is complex, if not impossible. Even if you have to travel great distances to have a diagnosis confirmed at an MS center, it can be worth the time and effort,” Kolaczkowski said. There are approximately 70 MS clinics in the United States. These clinics, as well as a list of neurologists who specialize in MS, can be located at the . The NMSS provides a on its website to help find an MS specialist. The offers a variety of MS-specific campuses in Arizona, Florida, and Minnesota. “But not everyone has access to an MS specialist. The society is aware of the issues of access to quality MS care and is making significant investments in this area,” Bebo noted. “It is a complicated problem which needs to be addressed,” he said. “It emphasizes the importance of doctors using the new diagnosis criteria.” Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

0e3ca8cc-3c03-4800-81ca-52eebcdf34a9,"— I was diagnosed with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in 2005, at the age of 28. Since then, I have experienced what it’s like to be paralyzed from the waist down and blind in my right eye and to have cognitive loss not unlike early onset Alzheimer’s. I have also had a cervical fusion and, most recently, a relapse where I was paralyzed on the entire right side of my body. My MS relapses have all had different short- and long-term effects on my life. I have been fortunate to experience remission after each relapse, however, there are lingering permanent side effects that I live with every day. My most recent relapse left me with recurrent numbness and tingling on my right side, along with some cognitive issues. This is what the average day looks like for me when I’m experiencing an MS relapse. I’m lying in bed, restless and caught between wakefulness and dreams. I haven’t slept all night for more than 20 or 30 minutes at a time. My neck is stiff and sore. They say MS doesn’t have pain. Tell that to my inflamed spinal lesion, pressing against the titanium plate in my neck. Every time I think the MS flare ups are behind me, boom, there they are again. This one is really starting to take hold. I have to pee. I’ve had to for a while. If only AAA could send a tow truck to pull me out of bed, then maybe I could take care of that. The sound of the alarm startles my sleeping wife. I am on my back because that is the only place I can find momentary comfort. My skin is unbearably itchy. I know it is the nerve endings misfiring, but I can’t stop scratching. I still have to pee, but haven’t been able to get up yet. My wife gets up, comes over to my side of the bed, and lifts my numb, heavy right leg off of the bed and onto the floor. I can’t move or feel my right arm, so I have to look at her as she tries to pull me up to a sitting position, from where I can swing my normally functioning left side around. It’s a hardship to lose that sensation of touch. I wonder if I will ever know that feeling again? My wife pulls the remainder of me up to my feet from the sitting position. From here, I can move, but I have drop-foot on the right. That means I can walk, but it looks like a zombie limp. I don’t trust myself to pee standing up, so I sit down. I’m also a little numb in the plumbing department, so I wait to hear the dribbles splashing the toilet water. I finish, flush, and leverage the bathroom vanity counter on my left to pull myself up from the toilet. The trick to managing an MS relapse is maximizing the time you spend in each space. I know that when I leave the bathroom, it will be a long time before I will make it back again. I start the water in the shower, thinking maybe a steamy shower will make the pain in my neck feel a little better. I also decide to brush my teeth while the water warms up. The problem is that I can’t fully close my mouth on the right side, so I have to lean over the sink as the toothpaste drools out of my mouth at a frenetic pace. I finish brushing and use my left hand to try to scoop water into my permanently ajar mouth to rinse. I call for my wife to help me once again with the next phase of my morning routine. She comes to the bathroom and helps me out of my T-shirt and into the shower. She bought me a loofah on a stick and some body wash, but I still need her assistance to get fully clean. After the shower, she helps get me dried, dressed, and out to the living room recliner in just enough time to say goodbye to the kids before they leave for school. I have been in this recliner since the morning. I work from home, but I am extremely limited in terms of what work tasks I can handle right now. I can’t use my right hand to type at all. I try to type with one hand, but my left hand seems to have forgotten what to do without the right hand accompaniment. It is insanely frustrating. That isn’t my only work problem. My boss keeps calling to tell me that I’m letting things fall through the cracks. I try to protect myself, but he is right. My short-term memory is failing me. Memory problems are the worst. People can see my physical limitations right now, but not the brain fog that is taking a toll on me cognitively. I’m hungry, but I also have no motivation to eat or drink. I can’t even remember if I had breakfast today or not. My kids arrive home from school. I’m still in the living room, in my chair, right where I was when they left this morning. They are concerned about me, but — at the tender ages of 6 and 8 years old — they don’t know what to say. A few months ago, I was coaching their soccer teams. Now, I’m stuck in a semi-vegetative state for most of the day. My 6 year old cuddles up and sits on my lap. He usually has a lot to say. Not today, however. We just quietly watch cartoons together. The home health nurse arrives at the house. Home health is really my only option for getting treatment because I am in no condition to leave the house right now. Earlier, they tried to reschedule me for tomorrow, but I told them that it was critical that I start my treatment as soon as possible. My only priority is to do whatever I can to put this MS relapse back in its cage. There is no way I am going to wait another day. This is going to be a five-day infusion. The nurse will set it up tonight, but my wife will have to switch the IV bags for the next four days. This means that I will have to sleep with an IV needle stuck deep in my vein. I watch the needle go into my right forearm. I see blood start to pool, but I can’t feel anything at all. It makes me sad inside that my arm is deadweight, but I try to feign a smile. The nurse talks to my wife and answers some last-minute questions before she says goodbye and leaves the house. A metallic taste takes over my mouth as the medicine starts to race through my veins. The IV continues to drip as I recline my chair and close my eyes. Tomorrow will be a repeat of today, and I need to harness all the strength I can muster to fight this MS relapse again tomorrow.

Approximately 250,000 to 350,000 people have been diagnosed with M.S. in the United States (Schoenstadt, 2006). Every week, 200 new people are diagnosed with M.S. in our country (National MS Society, n.d.). M.S. can affect each person differently. Damage to the myelin in the Central Nervous System and nerve fibers disturb the signals sent between the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body causing the primary symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (National MS Society, n.d.)Symptoms can come and go without any warning. An idea on how to help people suffering from M.S. is to have a dietitian either come to an M.S. housing building or support group, and introduce a healthy, nutritious diet that will help decrease the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. There are many diets out there that can help reduce symptoms and weight. Using a dietitian to introduce a healthy diet to those with M.S. can be very beneficial because it can decrease their pain and exacerbations, and improve the quality of their lives. There are four different types of M.S. that people can have. They are relapsing- remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS) and progressive-relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS) (National MS Society, n.d.). RRMS is when patients have relapses followed by periods of recovery (Mayo Clinic, 2012). SPMS occurs when there are relapses and partial recoveries, but the disability progressively gets worse until a steady progression of disability replaces cycles of exacerbations (Mayo Clinic, 2012). PPMS is when the disease progresses slowly and steadily from start with no periods of remissions (Mayo Clinic, 2012). Finally, PRMS is a rare type of M.S. where people experience both steadily worsening symptoms and attacks during times of remission (Mayo Clinic, 2012). To people who have Multiple Sclerosis, being diagnosed with any one of these types can be depressing. People with Multiple Sclerosis often suffer with extreme pain. My Mom has been living with M.S. for over 15 years now and she struggles with severe back pain every day. She is currently seeing a pain management doctor to help relieve some of her pain. M.S. patients can have pain in two different areas, which are neuropathic and musculoskeletal. Neuropathic pain is caused by the disruption in how the nerves carry messages within the brain and spinal cord (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Musculoskeletal pain is from damage to muscles, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Even with the use of pain medication, the pain associated with M.S. can be very hard to deal with. There are certain foods that can reduce inflammation and pain in people who have M.S. Anything that can lessen or stop the use of pain medication would be valuable to patients. Multiple Sclerosis affects a person’s brain and spinal cord causing a variety of troubling symptoms. The most common symptoms of M.S. are pain, fatigue, numbness, poor motor skills and vision problems. There are also many other symptoms that can trouble those who suffer from M.S. Other common symptoms are trouble walking, bladder, bowel dysfunction, dizziness, depression, and spasticity. Through diet and exercise, people with M.S. can improve some of those problems and lead a healthier, more productive life. A dietitian can help them focus on the foods and exercises that will eliminate or reduce the symptoms that bother them the most. M.S. patients struggle their whole lives dealing with exacerbations. They never know when one will come and how long it will last for. During an exacerbation, a lot of different problems can occur. An exacerbation is a relapse or flare up of Multiple Sclerosis symptoms. It can bring on new symptoms or... References: Gandy, J. Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics. (Feb 2007). 20 (1), 1.

This disease starts as an auto-immune disease in which CD4 T cells cross the blood brain barrier and attack myelin sheaths of olygodendrocytes resulting in demyelination (Gandhi et al., 2010; Lund et al., 2013). Initially this is a transient process and re-myelination occurs, so initial stage of the disease is characterized by neurological dysfunctions that eventually recover. However this re-myelination is not permanent (Compston and Coles, 2008; Wakerley et al., 2012). The continuous immune attacks cause serious pathological changes of myelin sheaths hence disease progression and development of serious disabilities . (Makris et al., 2013; Wakerley et al., 2012; Hafler, 2004; Nylander and Hafler, 2012; Eshaghi et al., 2013). Peak age of the initial diagnosis of MS is 30 and the disease progress overtime causing a in decline in health and even mortality (Makris et al., 2013). Though it is subjective the average decrease in life expectancy of a patient with MS is 5 to 10 years after the disease is being diagnosed (Keegan and Noseworthy, 2002). Disabilities caused by the disease vary between patients and depend on the abnormalities of the neuronal track that is affected (Leray et al., 2010). Some disabilities include numbness, muscle...

MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States alone. The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012). Definition of Disorder is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well. This disorder affects movements, sensation, and bodily functions (National Society [NMSS], 2012). There are several types of MS, these include: mixed (general), spinal, and cerebellar. General MS affects both the CNS and PNS, while spinal and cerebellar affect the CNS.

Of that 400,000 the ratio is roughly one woman to every seven men. is a disease where the individual’s immune system attacks the central nervous system. The immune system attacks and damages the myelin sheath which is a coating that is around the nerve fibers which eventually attacks and kills those nerve fibers as well.

MS is a selective progressive inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. In the brain and the spinal cord, we have grey and white matter. The outside of the brain is covered with grey matter with white matter running down as fascicles. The grey matters are cell bodies of neurons that have dendrites running down a bunch of axons. The axons are electric conducting pathways that send messages through the central nervous system.

It is known as an autoimmune disease, Where the body’s immune system turns against the body and destroys the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. This damage to the nerve cells causes many problems for the patient including weakness, muscle stiffness, poor coordination and balance, tingling, numbness, tremors, blurred vision, slurred speech, and memory and concentration problems (Bren) There are three different versions of (“What is MS?”). The least severe being relapsing-remitting; this occurs when a person has an attack and then there are no further symptoms until there is a relapse or another flare up of the disease (Bren). The next kind is called primary progressive; this is where the disease and the symptoms just worsen with time, each attack building on the previous (Bren). The final type is secondary progressive and this is a combination of relapsing-remitting first which eventually will become progressive (Bren).

3d9d2276-72e3-460a-a3d4-c368d980ebb3,"Spanish version of modified Story Memory Technique effective for Mexicans with MS A team of researchers reported preliminary findings for efficacy of the Spanish version of the modified Story Memory Technique, a cognitive intervention developed at Kessler Foundation (KF-mSMT™). Their study, conducted in Mexicans with multiple sclerosis, is an important step toward addressing the void in evidence-based rehabilitative interventions for treating the cognitive effects of multiple sclerosis across diverse cultural populations. The article, ""Efficacy of the Spanish modified Story Memory Technique in Mexicans with multiple sclerosis: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"" (doi: 10.3233/NRE-192808) was epublished on November 28, 2019 by NeuroRehabilitation. The authors are Denise Krch, PhD, Anthony Lequerica, PhD, and Nancy Chiaravalloti, PhD, of Kessler Foundation, Adriana Aguayo Arelis, MSc, and Brenda V. Rabago Barajas, MS, of Universidad Enrique D´ıaz de Leon and the Mexican MS Foundation, Guadalajara, Mexico, and Juan Carlos Arango-Lasprilla, MD, of Cruces University Hospital, Bizkaia, Spain, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain, and University of the Basque Country, Leoia, Spain. Link to article: DOI: https://content.iospress.com/articles/neurorehabilitation/nre192808 While problems with learning and memory occur across populations with multiple sclerosis around the world, the availability of evidence-based cognitive interventions in different languages is limited. The lack of interventions in Spanish presents a barrier to the rehabilitation of many individuals in the Hispanic community who have cognitive deficits caused by multiple sclerosis. An international team of researchers has adapted the English language KF-mSMT into Spanish, for use in the cognitive rehabilitation of Mexicans with multiple sclerosis.     In this pilot study, 20 participants with multiple sclerosis, relapsing-remitting type, were randomized to either treatment (n = 10) or placebo control (n = 10) groups. The treatment group received the Spanish adaptation of the KF-mSMT, a 10-session intervention that teaches imagery and context to facilitate learning. The control group participated in 10 sessions based on similar content and presentation. All participants underwent baseline and follow-up neuropsychological assessments. Individuals in the treatment group showed significant improvements in learning and life satisfaction relative to the control group, suggesting that that this adaptation of the KF-mSMT may be an effective rehabilitative tool in Spanish-speaking populations with MS, according to Dr. Krch, senior research scientist in the Center for Traumatic Brain Injury Research. This is an example of how cultural adaptation can be an effective way to extend evidence-based interventions to non-English speaking populations. The positive outcomes seen in this pilot study of urban-based Mexicans have important implications. While further testing is needed, we anticipate that this adaptation of the modified Story Memory Technique will be applicable to the diverse Spanish-speaking population in the U.S., in addition to those with Mexican heritage.” Dr. Denise Krch, senior research scientist in the Center for Traumatic Brain Injury Research Kessler Foundation researchers have documented this tool in the U.S. for English-speaking populations with traumatic brain injury as well as multiple sclerosis. “Based on our prior research,” noted Dr. Krch, “the modified Story Memory Technique may also prove useful in the rehabilitation of Spanish-speakers with cognitive deficits caused by traumatic brain injury.”   The KF-mSMT is available from Kessler Foundation in English and Spanish for use by rehabilitation professionals.

8b822636-37ef-4d99-a02f-a004ee4835bd,"MS Patients Must Take Charge of Their Care to Avoid Medical Mishaps — Keeping all of your doctors on the same page is important for people with chronic conditions like MS. Lack of communication could lead to drug interactions, over-medication, and other serious side effects. As many as 400,000 people die each year in U.S. hospitals due to errors, making medical errors the third-leading cause of death in the United States, . People living with a chronic condition such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are especially vulnerable to medical mishaps, since MS is a complex disease that requires ongoing care involving multiple experts. “Many MS patients require the care of specialists in addition to their MS neurologist,” Samantha Schech, LSW, client services specialist for the (MSAA), told Healthline. “For example, a urologist specialist may be involved if the patient experiences challenges with the bladder that are determined to be beyond the MS neurologist’s scope of care.” The use of complementary and alternative therapies in the form of over-the-counter supplements, fresh herbs, or essential oils also has the potential to complicate care. Patients may not realize that a plant or vitamin can interact with prescription medications, so they don’t mention using supplements to their doctor. Patients expect their medical team to keep track of follow-up appointments and medication changes, but sometimes things slip through the cracks. “It is very important for patients to try and have an active role in their medical care plan,” Schech said, “or have a point person in place that can manage it for them, like a spouse or caregiver.” Knowing the “big picture” is key for doctors to avoid making inadvertent mistakes. Prescribing a drug that interacts with another medication or supplement they are unaware their patient is taking can have tragic consequences. With proper communication, these errors can be avoided. Diagnosed with MS in 2008, Laura Failla from East Windsor, New Jersey, also suffers from a seizure disorder and has developed chronic biliary pain that has yet to be explained. She sees multiple doctors because each one is treating a different condition. No stranger to the healthcare field, Failla once worked in a physician’s office and she’s savvy about the need to know one’s health history and make sure doctors are informed. “When it comes to my health,” Failla told Healthline, “I am very particular and make sure each doctor knows exactly what is going on with the others. I ask for copies of lab work and MRIs just in case someone else wants to see it.” But even the best informed patient can be caught unawares. “My seizures were difficult to control, and after yet another medication switch, I thought they were, finally,” said Failla, “[The seizures] slowly reappeared, though, and I was crushed.” One afternoon, Failla came home from the beach to an urgent voicemail message from her doctor. “The story, as he told it, was that he had gotten a panicked phone call from my mail-order pharmacy where I receive my MS medication. The medication that the [gastrointestinal] doctor had prescribed for the biliary pain about six weeks earlier had the potential to not only cause the seizure medication to stop working, but also to affect a very particular portion of my heartbeat, which could have been a serious problem when combined with my MS medication.” Related News: ‘Leaky Gut Syndrome’ Implicated in MS » When the problem was discovered, Failla stopped taking the gastrointestinal drug and eventually her seizure medication started to work again. Because the interaction between the medications had happened gradually, Failla said, “I did not put it together that it was caused by the biliary medication.” Whether you are taking multiple medications, dealing with many different doctors or pharmacies, or even exploring alternative therapies, staying on top of your records, treatments, and doctors is important for someone with MS. “Nobody knows a person with MS like that person themselves,” said Dr. Daniel Kantor, immediate past president of the Florida Society of Neurology and founder of the Medical Partnership 4 MS. “In today’s complex managed care environment, it is even more important to make sure that you are getting the care that you deserve.” To help you manage a complex healthcare team, Schech says, “it may be helpful to keep a medical binder that can be brought to the appointments and updated with the doctor. The patient can keep track of the dates of visits, changes to medications or treatment plans, and update each doctor at the time of the appointment.” Kantor adds, “When you go from one specialist to another, you should make a request to have your records forwarded.” The MSAA also has a smartphone app to help patients manage their medical care. allows you to input and store medical records as well as contact information for the healthcare team. As for Failla, she has learned from her experience that even the most savvy patients can sometimes miss important clues. “I reiterate the meds I am on to each doctor at each appointment,” she stresses. “Saying, ‘Can we make sure your records are up to date?’ makes me uncomfortable and the nurses cranky, but it’s a necessity. I also ask the pharmacist about any interactions and closely read the information sheet [that comes with the medication].” She is determined to never let a mistake like this happen again.

17090eb6-0a1e-43ea-a24f-79ff80916a15,"— — While there’s no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS), there are many treatments available. These treatments mainly focus on slowing down the progression of the disease and managing symptoms. Different people can have different types of MS. And disease progression and symptoms range greatly from person to person. For both reasons, each person’s treatment plan will be different. Read on to learn about the types of MS treatments available. Disease-modifying medications can reduce the frequency and severity of MS episodes, or relapses. They also can control the growth of lesions (damage to nerve fibers) and reduce symptoms. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has currently approved several drugs for modifying MS. They come as: glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, generic versions such as Glatopa) In 2018, the manufacturers of the injection daclizumab (Zinbryta) withdrew it from the market due to safety concerns. These four therapies must be given by infusion at a licensed clinic: Stem cells have shown some promise in treating the neural damage caused MS causes. According to one , mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has shown to help repair the central nervous system (CNS), which becomes damaged with MS. The process by which stem cells work to do this is not fully understood, but studies are ongoing to determine more about the curative abilities of stem cell therapy. While there isn’t any research supporting one specific diet for MS, eating a generally healthy, balanced diet is recommended. Constant movement and activity are critical to fighting MS. Exercise helps: A good way to start your MS exercise routine is to try basic stretches while you’re sitting or in bed. When you feel comfortable with those exercises, add more demanding exercises such as: As you get stronger and more comfortable exercising, you can modify and build on your exercise program. Keep in mind that anything you can do with others, especially exercise you enjoy, can help. People with MS often experience fatigue. And when you’re tired, you may not feel like exercising. But the less exercise you get, the more tired you’ll feel. That’s another reason why exercise, including physical therapy (PT), is so important. However, it needs to be carefully tailored to people with MS. Things such as keeping session times short and increasing exercise over time are important factors. Someone with MS should consider PT during a relapse that has produced a change in functions such as: The goal of PT during relapse is to return to a prior level of function, if possible. A professional PT program will help improve your strength and physical function. Ending a relapse as quickly as possible benefits both the body and the mind. That’s where relapse treatments come in. Inflammation is a key feature of MS relapses. It can lead to many other symptoms of MS, such as: Corticosteroids are often used to ease inflammation and reduce the severity of MS attacks. Corticosteroids used to treat MS include methylprednisolone (intravenous) and prednisone (oral). If corticosteroids don’t provide relief for relapses, or if intravenous treatments can’t be used, there are other treatments. These may include: ACTH is an injection into your muscle or under your skin. It works by prompting the adrenal cortex gland to secrete the hormones cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone. These hormones reduce the level of inflammation in your body. This process involves removing whole blood from your body and filtering it to remove antibodies that may be attacking your nervous system. The “cleansed” blood is then given back to you through a transfusion. This treatment is an injection that helps to boost your immune system. However, evidence of its benefits for MS relapses has been inconsistent in . While the drugs listed above help treat MS, a range of medications are available to treat the different physical symptoms that MS can cause. Muscle relaxants are often prescribed for people with MS. That’s because relaxing muscles helps with common MS symptoms such as: Relieving those symptoms can also help with depression, which can occur with MS. Drugs used to treat fatigue include modafinil (). They also include amantadine hydrochloride (Gocovri), which is used off-label for this purpose. Off-label use is when a drug that’s approved for one purpose is used for another. Fluoxetine (Prozac) is also often prescribed since it helps combat both fatigue and depression. There are more than a dozen prescription medications for bladder problems, such as incontinence, related to MS. Talk to your doctor about which drugs might be best for you. The most effective medications for constipation and bowel symptoms associated with MS seem to be over-the-counter stool softeners. If you have questions about these products, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Though MS treatments can be helpful in managing the condition, they can also cause side effects. In general, most MS drugs can cause common side effects such as: Coping with MS isn’t easy, but treatment can make a big difference in how you feel, both physically and emotionally. Work with your doctor to develop a treatment plan that addresses your medical issues and can help improve your physical symptoms and emotional outlook. — — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

337be25d-abb0-44a7-9acd-6d3c9510466b,"Why People with MS Appear to Have a Greater Risk for Cancer Researchers say the high rate of smoking among people with multiple sclerosis could be one reason for the elevated risk. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) may have a greater risk for developing cancer than people in the general population, according to new research. These findings were presented last week at the fifth European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress in Oslo, Norway. “This study is the first to compare cancer risk in MS with non-affected siblings of MS patients. The risk assessment between these two groups is extremely interesting because they share the same genetics and environmental conditions,” , postdoctoral researcher at the Western Norway Regional Health Authority and lead researcher, said in a press release. The research was based on data from various Norwegian MS and cancer registries. Included were 6,883 people with MS who were born between 1930 and 1979, as well as 8,918 siblings and 37,919 people without MS. The overall cancer risk for people with MS was 14 percent higher than for people without MS, according to the study’s researchers. They also reported the risk was especially high for certain cancers. The increase in risk was 66 percent for respiratory cancers, 52 percent for central nervous system cancers, and 51 percent for urinary cancers. When compared with their siblings, however, people with MS didn’t have an overall higher risk for cancer. That’s because siblings of people with MS were found to have a higher risk for hematological cancers than people with MS and people in the general population. Study authors acknowledge the increased cancer risk for people with MS may be due to excessive smoking and surveillance bias. This was an observational study. Grytten cautioned that conclusions about causality can’t be made. is a medical oncologist and medical director of MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in California. Jacoub told Healthline it’s important to keep in mind that the study took place in another country. That means demographic and environmental differences exist. “When making population-based studies and comparing to another place, there are inherent variables impossible to control for. Nonetheless, they had a good number of patients, and the increased rates of cancer were unusually high,” he said. According to the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, smoking is common among people with MS. Surveys indicate that 45 to 52 percent of people with MS are current or past smokers. Smokers develop more autoimmune conditions and higher levels of co-morbidities. One of the most common co-morbidities for people with MS is chronic lung disease. The study spanned 65 years, during which time smoking rates generally declined. The puts the smoking rate at 35 percent in 1990 versus 17 percent in 2013. In the United States, cigarette smoking rates among adults fell from 43 percent in 1965 to 14 percent in 2017, according to the . Jacoub explains that in MS, as well as other immune system disorders, the immune system shifts efforts from targeting infection and other invaders to targeting the body itself. “The immune system, along with other factors, is usually able to control cancer cells and not allow them to form a tumor and create disease. If you have immune dysfunction, the ability to do that is not very effective,” Jacoub said. is a neuro-oncologist and chair of the department of translational neurosciences and neurotherapeutics at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California. Kesari told Healthline the study highlights the role of inflammation in a variety of diseases, from autoimmune disorders such as MS to cancer. “The paper suggests a genetic component to MS and abnormal immune system function in siblings, who may have that as well, even though they don’t have MS. Immune system dysfunction is predisposing to cancer, mainly hematological cancers,” Kesari said. “The main thing is the connection between immune health and various disorders. Cancer, heart disease, brain function: We’re finding out the immune system is involved in dementia and other disorders of aging,” he added. “MS patients, because they’re trying to control an overactive immune system, are on drugs that suppress the immune system, which increases the risk of developing cancer as well,” Kesari said. Kesari notes people with MS tend to have more monitoring in general. Abnormalities that may turn out to be cancer are more likely to be found early. That’s the surveillance bias the study authors mentioned. There’s little difference in how people with MS are treated for cancer compared to people without MS. “Typically, we don’t manage it differently as far as chemotherapy. For people with MS, sometimes chemo will even put MS in remission and control the disease for a long time,” Jacoub said. “But there should be some hesitation and discussion when it comes to treating people with cancer and MS with immunotherapies due to the potential for ,” he continued. The study suggests that siblings of people with MS have an increased risk for developing blood cancers. According to Jacoub, this speaks to the immune system issue. “There are with autoimmune illness. This study is not enough to say siblings should seek extra screening. But doctors should be aware of the potential risk of some cancers if someone in the family has an autoimmune disease,” Jacoub said. The cautions that these finding should be considered preliminary. The paper hasn’t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Other large-population studies are needed to fully understand what it means for people with MS and their families. “These studies offer hypotheses. They generate leads into more research and better understanding. Clear observation provides a powerful message,” Jacoub said. “If accurate and this can be reproduced, guidelines may be changed so that patients who are asymptomatic are screened to try to catch cancer earlier,” he said.

Unlike MS, they can include: Most of the time, an episode of ADEM is a single occurrence. Recovery usually begins within days, and the majority of people make a full recovery within six months. MS lasts a lifetime. In relapsing-remitting forms of MS, come and go but may lead to accumulation of disability. People with experience steady deterioration and permanent disability. You can develop either condition at any age. However, ADEM is more likely to affect children, while MS is more likely to affect young adults. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, over of childhood ADEM cases occur in children younger than 10 years old. Most other cases occur in people between 10 and 20 years old. ADEM is rarely diagnosed in adults. Experts believe ADEM affects in the United States annually. It’s more common in boys than girls, affecting boys of the time. It’s seen in all ethnic groups across the world. It’s more likely to appear in the winter and springtime than in the summer and fall. ADEM often develops within months of an infection. In of cases, it may be triggered by an immunization. However, doctors aren’t always able to identify the triggering event. MS is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50. Most people receive a diagnosis while in their 20s or 30s. MS affects women more than men. The most common type of MS, RRMS, affects women at a rate that is than it is for men.

It is the severity of symptoms and possible resulting disability that will dictate the extent to which work or education will be influenced. The possibility of some degree of disability in the long-term should not outweigh the fact that people with MS can have many productive years. People who have a less active form of the disease or whose symptoms are minimal and not visible will probably be able to continue with their usual employment and educational activities. If fatigue is a problem, they may have to plan for regular rest periods during the day. People who have relapsing-remitting MS or who develop some level of disability will need to realistically evaluate their situation in many areas (e.g. physically, socially, cognitively) to decide on long-term as well as short-term strategies for work and education. People with MS should work with their employer and/or educational institutions to ensure their needs can be met. Small changes such as having somewhere to have a rest, or flexible work hours, can make a big difference to being able to stay on at work, as found in our survey on employment and MS. The decision to share information about your MS is a matter of personal judgement. If you do not have visible symptoms there may be no reason to disclose a diagnosis of MS. On the other hand, many employers will offer support to allow someone to continue working if they understand their needs. And many educational institutions will make adjustments for people with MS, such as to their timetable, examinations or entry requirements, while maintaining a level of confidentiality.

It is the severity of symptoms and possible resulting disability that will dictate the extent to which work or education will be influenced. The possibility of some degree of disability in the long-term should not outweigh the fact that people with MS can have many productive years. People who have a less active form of the disease or whose symptoms are minimal and not visible will probably be able to continue with their usual employment and educational activities. If fatigue is a problem, they may have to plan for regular rest periods during the day. People who have relapsing-remitting MS or who develop some level of disability will need to realistically evaluate their situation in many areas (e.g. physically, socially, cognitively) to decide on long-term as well as short-term strategies for work and education. People with MS should work with their employer and/or educational institutions to ensure their needs can be met. Small changes such as having somewhere to have a rest, or flexible work hours, can make a big difference to being able to stay on at work, as found in our survey on employment and MS. The decision to share information about your MS is a matter of personal judgement. If you do not have visible symptoms there may be no reason to disclose a diagnosis of MS. On the other hand, many employers will offer support to allow someone to continue working if they understand their needs. And many educational institutions will make adjustments for people with MS, such as to their timetable, examinations or entry requirements, while maintaining a level of confidentiality. The legal requirements to accommodate people who have disabilities vary from country to country. Your national MS society may be able to advise you of the situation in your country. Find your nearest MS organisation. Download the employment issue of magazine (you will need r to view these files): Because MS might bring about some physical and cognitive disability over time, it makes sense to evaluate your current job in the light of these possible changes. If your job is very physically demanding, you might want to consider alternative jobs or retraining to reduce the physical nature of your occupation. In a more sedentary job, your physical limitations may not impact so greatly and you might be able to work for many more years.

44fc723b-a8e0-4604-8c2d-c4cbf195e585,"Is My Child’s MS Flare an Emergency? When to Go to the Hospital — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition that can change over time. When new symptoms develop or known symptoms get worse, it’s known as a flare, attack, relapse, or exacerbation. If your child lives with MS, they may experience mild flares that go away on their own or more severe flares that require treatment. In most cases, flares are mild. In rare cases, your child may need to visit the emergency department or urgent care center. Keep reading to learn more about severe flares and when you should consider taking your child to the hospital for treatment. Most MS flares don’t require a trip to the emergency department to treat. But sometimes MS-related symptoms do require immediate treatment. There may also be cases when your child’s flare is triggered by a serious infection that requires immediate attention. If your child has MS, they might be experiencing a medical emergency if they develop: intense pain that prevents them from functioning well changes in their symptoms that are accompanied by a fever or other signs of infection If your child experiences any of these symptoms or other signs of a severe flare, contact their neurologist or other members of their MS health team. They can help you determine whether your child should visit the emergency department, an urgent care center, or the neurologist’s office for treatment. If your child is having trouble breathing or shows signs of reduced consciousness, call 911 immediately. To treat severe flares of MS, doctors often prescribe a short course of corticosteroids. In some cases, they may also prescribe other treatments. If you don’t already have a primary care provider, you can browse doctors in your area through the . If your child experiences a severe MS flare, corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and speed up the recovery process. Their doctor may prescribe treatment with an oral steroid, such as oral methylprednisolone. Or they may prescribe treatment with an intravenous corticosteroid, such as IV methylprednisolone. Short-term corticosteroid use can cause side effects, such as: Long-term corticosteroid use can cause more serious side effects and should be avoided. If your child’s symptoms don’t respond to treatment with corticosteroids, their doctor may recommend plasma exchange. This procedure is also known as plasmapheresis. To perform plasma exchange, a healthcare professional will remove some of your child’s blood from their body. A machine will separate your child’s blood cells from the liquid portion of their blood, known as plasma. Your child’s blood cells will then be transfused back into their body, along with donor plasma or a plasma substitute. Potential side effects of this procedure include infection and blood clotting problems. Always let your child’s neurologist and other members of their health team know if your child has been admitted to a hospital for MS-related symptoms. Their health team may recommend follow-up care, including rehabilitation therapy, medications, or other treatments. If a severe flare has negatively affected your child’s physical or cognitive abilities, their health team may recommend rehabilitation therapy to help your child recover or adapt. occupational therapy, if your child is finding it hard to complete routine tasks at school or home physical therapy, if your child is having trouble moving or getting around speech-language therapy, if your child is experiencing difficulties with speech or swallowing cognitive remediation, if your child is coping with thinking or memory problems Your child might need to take time off school or make other adjustments to their daily routine while recovering from a severe flare. If your child develops new symptoms during a flare, their health team may prescribe medications to help manage those symptoms. For example, they may prescribe medications to help treat: To help prevent future flares, your child’s doctor might also prescribe a disease-modifying therapy (DMT). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn’t approved any DMTs for children under 10 years old. However, neurologists sometimes prescribe DMTs to younger children. This is known as “off-label” use. Most MS flares can be treated outside of a hospital. In some cases, your child might need to visit an emergency department or urgent care center. If you suspect that your child is experiencing a severe flare, contact their neurologist or other members of their MS health team. They can help you learn where to get the treatment your child needs. If your child is having difficulty breathing or losing consciousness, call 911 right away. — What to Expect When Your Child Starts Treatment for MS The Caregiver’s Guide to Multiple Sclerosis in Children Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis: What You Need to Know Multiple sclerosis (MS) can affect children, though it's less common than in adults.

An aspiring student, he has had to drop out of high school, and the cost of his treatment is an ongoing worry for his family. The online community has provided support, but Hao struggles to find a way to cope with MS. “I was a very good student but because the high school was unable to make modifications to accommodate me – to address my mobility problems – I had to drop out. Because of a relapse, I had to go on a course of interferon, and this is when I gave up my education. I enrolled in an inferior technical college.

8479e3fa-cfc8-4f42-84a0-617f2ea42a3e,"— — Almost everyone who has also has fatigue. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), of those diagnosed with the condition will experience fatigue at some point during the course of the disease. However, the exact cause of MS-related fatigue remains unknown. Read on for nine tips that can help you increase your energy and reduce your fatigue. Before learning how to beat fatigue, it’s useful to understand the types of fatigue you may face when you have MS. Researchers have started to identify specifically associated with MS. They define it as quite different from garden-variety tiredness: It can occur in the morning, despite having slept the night before. It commonly worsens throughout the day. Heat and humidity may aggravate it. It tends to be more severe than other types of fatigue. It’s more likely than regular fatigue to disrupt your ability to perform everyday tasks. According to the , regular physical activity can help fight fatigue related to MS. Sticking with a consistent exercise program can help with endurance, balance, weight loss, and general well-being — all important for people with MS. However, there’s one caveat: While exercise helps some people with MS, there are others who won’t experience the same benefit. If in doubt, talk to your doctor before starting any kind of . Also remember that the goal of exercise is to give you more energy, not make you feel more tired. Energy conservation isn’t just important for the environment. It’s also a key principle for those with MS. What’s your best time of day to get things done (i.e., the time when you feel the most energetic)? If you notice that you feel less fatigue in the morning, take advantage of your extra energy to complete tasks such as shopping and cleaning. You can then conserve your energy later when you feel more fatigued, knowing you’ve already accomplished key tasks for the day. People with MS may be especially sensitive to heat. As a result, they may experience more fatigue when they become overheated or are in a warmer environment. Try these techniques to cool down: Use air conditioning as needed, especially in the summer months. If lifestyle changes don’t give you the energy boost you need, you may want to try or therapy. With occupational therapy, a trained specialist helps you simplify activities in your work or home environments. This may involve using adaptive equipment or changing your environment to help increase your physical and mental energy. With physical therapy, a trained professional helps you perform daily physical tasks more effectively. For instance, you may use techniques or devices that can help you conserve energy while walking. are often behind the fatigue that people with MS experience. Whether you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting the amount and type of sleep you need to awaken feeling refreshed, the result is the same: You feel tired. To help prevent these problems, it’s important to regulate your sleep. This might involve identifying and treating other MS symptoms that cause sleep problems — for example, . If all else fails, you can talk with your doctor about using sleep medications for a short period of time. Certain behaviors may seem to help with fatigue, but in the end, they may cause more problems than they solve. Drinking a hot beverage may sound like a good way to wind down if you’re having trouble sleeping, but coffee and tea typically contain caffeine. Be sure to check whether your drink contains caffeine. It can prevent you from falling asleep, leading to fatigue the next day. Similarly, while alcohol may help you feel sleepy after you first drink it, it can make it harder to get a restful night’s sleep later. Consider behaviors that may be contributing to poor sleep habits and fatigue and try to take steps to adjust them. can make anyone feel tired or fatigued, and the same may be even more true for people with MS. show that your diet can affect your symptoms and how you feel. It may even affect the progression of your disease. Good nutrition advice for most people includes eating lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. This advice holds true for people with MS too. Some tips, such as making sure you consume enough healthy fats and vitamin D, may be especially important if you have MS. If you have questions about what you should be eating, talk to your doctor. They can help advise you. They can also refer you to a nutritionist who can help create a personalized healthy eating plan. Just like a poor diet may affect a person with MS more than someone without it, stress could have a bigger effect on you than on your friend without MS. Anyone with stress can experience insomnia, which can lead to fatigue. However, if you have MS, stress can actually worsen your condition. Stress does not cause new brain lesions, but stress could cause worsening of MS symptoms including fatigue. Advanced disease can increase your symptoms, including fatigue.

In terms of medication to help ease fatigue, your doctor can help you decide what’s right for you.

They’re still being studied as a treatment for MS fatigue, which means your insurance may not cover them for this purpose. For more information about these drugs, talk to your doctor. Off-label drug use means a drug that’s FDA approved for one purpose is used for a different purpose that it hasn’t yet been approved to treat. However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs, but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So, your doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care. Fatigue from MS can wreak havoc on your life for many reasons, both at work and at home. It may severely limit the types of activities you can do and may even result in you having to leave your job. It’s worth it to learn how to manage MS-related fatigue.

I had just got married when my first symptom occurred. We had gone out for a walk one afternoon, and got a bit lost. After about an hour I started to drag my left foot, and then by the time we got back to where we were staying, I was dragging both feet. After a sit down and a rest, everything was ok again. This symptom kept occurring for the next eight years, and is still occurring today. It was seven years after this episode started that the second symptom occurred. This one was far more complex. Following a discussion with my wife, who said that I was acting very depressed, I went to my GP who, in turn, referred me to a psychiatrist. It was this psychiatrist who felt there was something more to my predicament than just depression. It was after this that I began to realise just how the depression was affecting my work. I subsequently got referred again, this time onto a neurologist, who started what turned out to be four years’ worth of investigations into my health problems! It was following my first MRI that my neurologist gave me three possible illnesses that he would be looking into: Sarcoidosis, SLE or multiple sclerosis. That afternoon I trawled through the internet, finding out about the three options that I had been given. After reading about the symptoms I was 90 per cent sure that I had MS. Everything seemed to fit – it was like it had been written about me. In the following months more referrals were made. Firstly onto a clinical neuro psychologist at the Wolfsen Neuro Re-Habilitation Centre, where my cognition was proved to be amiss, and then a second neuro psychologist at St George’s. A urologist at Roehampton had a say as well. It took a long time to get a final diagnosis as to whether it was relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS), but finally it was confirmed as PPMS. After reading about PPMS I realised that my symptoms fitted like a glove, and with hindsight, that I don’t remit or relapse. Getting the diagnosis left me feeling quite relieved. The doctor confirmed to me that I had PPMS, albeit a very rare form of PPMS: relapsing progressive MS. He said I was one of 10 per cent of people with PPMS to have this type. Over the past six years, my life has changed BIG time. Firstly, I lost my health. My marriage broke down and I’m now divorced (that’s another big story). I lost my job because my employer did not understand MS (again, is another big story), and I also lost my brother to a brain tumour (yet again, that’s another big story). I have always been very positive about my MS. In fact I love my MS; after all I have to live with it for the rest of my life. Yes, it’s a pain in the backside (not literally) but I have to make the best of everything. I want to help other people with any form of MS and I want to keep myself busy whilst accepting my limits. I do not work anymore – I was a carpenter for all my working life. My balance and stability are shot, and now walking is becoming harder every week, but I manage. The fatigue gets to me every day and my short term memory has been blown to pieces, but thankfully my long term memory is fine. I have recently seen an MS counsellor, who helped me answer questions that I did not realise even needed asking. She told me that my ‘emotional gate’ was closed, so it did not allow me to take or show any emotion. It has taken a few years to get my emotions back to how they used to be. But I do not think life will ever be the same. I have also seen a physiotherapist and participated in a fatigue management course and a relaxation course. These have helped me no end, and I would recommend them to other people with MS. I would also say to other people with MS, be as positive as you can about your MS and try and keep yourself as busy as you can. I find that it does help to take your mind off the numerous problems associated with the MS. It is now with hindsight, and quite a lot of research, that I realise my MS has probably been with me since I was about 20, with nothing definite showing until I was about 38. I am now 46 and live with relapsing progressive MS (I have yet to get a true, actual meaning of this type of MS). I also live with Nystagmus, as brought on by my MS. I would love to get more information on this type of MS – I have found out that it is quite rare, with only 5 per cent of the 10 per cent who live with primary progressive MS living with this type. It equates to there being 500 people in the UK living with relapsing progressive MS, so I am one of the 500. It makes me feel quite special now. It is now summer 2014 and my condition has progressed, only very slowly though. I am now 48 and not much has changed with my MS, although my walking seems to be a bit more tricky now, and the neuralgic pain that I get, mainly in my left leg, has increased. This is now being treated, quite successfully, with the medication 2x60mg’s of Duloxetine, that my consultant has put me on. The other medications that have also put me on are 2700IU of Vitamin D3 and, most recently, in a month’s time I will be on 60mg of Simvastatin, only on 40mg at present, which is a Statin, and said to be beneficial to those who live with a progressive MS. I just wish that I could get to see my consultant at least twice a year now, but I understand why it is only once yearly, with their work load, and my very slow progression of my MS. All of my emotions are now back to where they were, and sometimes increased to what they were, which I think is brilliant. I got re-married last year, with a very small but quite lovely ceremony at a Masonic lodge, a stone’s throw from Twickenham Rugby Stadium. We only went on honeymoon this year, but that was to the Dominican Republic, which was so nice. The Nystagmus, which I live with also, is more prominent in my day to day life. This may be because I have been told that the Nystagmus is vertical as well as horizontal, with the later being the worst. I now intend to live my life to the fullest, whilst taking my disability into account. This is what everyone who is, or may be, in the same club as me, should also strive for. It gives a good reason for living, even if it is only with a rare form of multiple sclerosis. أحدث البحوث والتطورات العلمية في مجال مرض التصلب العصبي المتعدد بالنقر على ""إرسال"" انا أعطي موافقة للأتحاد الدولي للتصلب العصبي المتعدد MSIF بأن يرسل لي نشرة MS Research News Please read our and Multiple Sclerosis International Federation 3rd Floor Skyline House 200 Union Street London SE1 0LX Keep in touch with our work on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.

It is now with hindsight, and quite a lot of research, that I realise my MS has probably been with me since I was about 20, with nothing definite showing until I was about 38. I am now 46 and live with relapsing progressive MS (I have yet to get a true, actual meaning of this type of MS). I also live with Nystagmus, as brought on by my MS. I would love to get more information on this type of MS – I have found out that it is quite rare, with only 5 per cent of the 10 per cent who live with primary progressive MS living with this type. It equates to there being 500 people in the UK living with relapsing progressive MS, so I am one of the 500. It makes me feel quite special now. It is now summer 2014 and my condition has progressed, only very slowly though.

This is now being treated, quite successfully, with the medication 2x60mg’s of Duloxetine, that my consultant has put me on. The other medications that have also put me on are 2700IU of Vitamin D3 and, most recently, in a month’s time I will be on 60mg of Simvastatin, only on 40mg at present, which is a Statin, and said to be beneficial to those who live with a progressive MS. I just wish that I could get to see my consultant at least twice a year now, but I understand why it is only once yearly, with their work load, and my very slow progression of my MS.

This may be because I have been told that the Nystagmus is vertical as well as horizontal, with the later being the worst. I now intend to live my life to the fullest, whilst taking my disability into account. This is what everyone who is, or may be, in the same club as me, should also strive for.

a3e0b030-6ae2-45dd-a29c-c72b05171977,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Sean Hegarty from the UK is in his mid-forties and lives with relapsing progressive MS My story actually starts some 15 years ago now, when I was about 30. I had just got married when my first symptom occurred. We had gone out for a walk one afternoon, and got a bit lost. After about an hour I started to drag my left foot, and then by the time we got back to where we were staying, I was dragging both feet. After a sit down and a rest, everything was ok again. This symptom kept occurring for the next eight years, and is still occurring today. It was seven years after this episode started that the second symptom occurred. This one was far more complex. Following a discussion with my wife, who said that I was acting very depressed, I went to my GP who, in turn, referred me to a psychiatrist. It was this psychiatrist who felt there was something more to my predicament than just depression. It was after this that I began to realise just how the depression was affecting my work. I subsequently got referred again, this time onto a neurologist, who started what turned out to be four years’ worth of investigations into my health problems! It was following my first MRI that my neurologist gave me three possible illnesses that he would be looking into: Sarcoidosis, SLE or multiple sclerosis. That afternoon I trawled through the internet, finding out about the three options that I had been given. After reading about the symptoms I was 90 per cent sure that I had MS. Everything seemed to fit – it was like it had been written about me. In the following months more referrals were made. Firstly onto a clinical neuro psychologist at the Wolfsen Neuro Re-Habilitation Centre, where my cognition was proved to be amiss, and then a second neuro psychologist at St George’s. A urologist at Roehampton had a say as well. It took a long time to get a final diagnosis as to whether it was relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS), but finally it was confirmed as PPMS. After reading about PPMS I realised that my symptoms fitted like a glove, and with hindsight, that I don’t remit or relapse. Getting the diagnosis left me feeling quite relieved. The doctor confirmed to me that I had PPMS, albeit a very rare form of PPMS: relapsing progressive MS. He said I was one of 10 per cent of people with PPMS to have this type. Over the past six years, my life has changed BIG time. Firstly, I lost my health. My marriage broke down and I’m now divorced (that’s another big story). I lost my job because my employer did not understand MS (again, is another big story), and I also lost my brother to a brain tumour (yet again, that’s another big story). I have always been very positive about my MS. In fact I love my MS; after all I have to live with it for the rest of my life. Yes, it’s a pain in the backside (not literally) but I have to make the best of everything. I want to help other people with any form of MS and I want to keep myself busy whilst accepting my limits. I do not work anymore – I was a carpenter for all my working life. My balance and stability are shot, and now walking is becoming harder every week, but I manage. The fatigue gets to me every day and my short term memory has been blown to pieces, but thankfully my long term memory is fine. I have recently seen an MS counsellor, who helped me answer questions that I did not realise even needed asking. She told me that my ‘emotional gate’ was closed, so it did not allow me to take or show any emotion. It has taken a few years to get my emotions back to how they used to be. But I do not think life will ever be the same. I have also seen a physiotherapist and participated in a fatigue management course and a relaxation course. These have helped me no end, and I would recommend them to other people with MS. I would also say to other people with MS, be as positive as you can about your MS and try and keep yourself as busy as you can.

It can affect the optic nerve, spinal cord, and brain. The include numbness, , , and other problems. Severity varies greatly from person to person. While there’s currently no cure, and can help manage some symptoms. MS doesn’t usually affect . Because NMO is so similar to MS, scientists previously believed it might be a . However, scientific consensus now distinguishes NMO from MS and groups it with related syndromes under the unifying term “neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).” The reports that NMO attacks do more harm than MS does to certain parts of the body. The clinic also points out that NMO doesn’t respond to some of the drugs that help relieve MS symptoms. MS and neuromyelitis differ in the impact that episodes have on the body. Symptoms of are less severe than NMO attacks, especially in the early stages of the disease. The cumulative effects of these attacks can become very serious. However, they may also have a limited impact on a person’s ability to function. NMO attacks, on the other hand, can be severe and lead to health problems that can’t be reversed. Early and aggressive treatment is important in reducing the harm caused by NMO. The course of both diseases can be quite similar. Some people with MS experience , ones in which symptoms come and go. The more common form of NMO also occurs in attacks that return on a regular basis. of MS don’t have periods in which symptoms go into remission.

c39a85fe-87c8-4a08-9d32-4f21ced76df3,"Earworms and MS: What Musical Hallucinations Can Teach Researchers — What one woman’s unrelenting musical hallucinations are teaching researchers about the effects MS can have on neural pathways. We’ve all had an “earworm” at one time or another—a tune that gets stuck in your head and plays on an endless loop. Earworms typically fade away after a few minutes if we think about or listen to something else. But for one 54-year old woman with multiple sclerosis (MS), auditory hallucinations have plagued her non-stop for years, shedding new light on the involvement of neural pathways in MS. In a case study published in the journal , researchers at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) shared the bizarre story of her unrelenting internal soundtrack. In 2010, after a long history of relapsing MS, the patient began taking the disease-modifying therapy (DMT) Tysabri. A year later, the auditory symptoms began. She hears words like “jabberwocky” several times a day, and verses of familiar country songs—complete with instrumentation—play non-stop in her head. The problem is so persistent that she has to turn on other music in order to fall asleep at night. Read More: 12 Things You Should Never Say to Someone with a Chronic Health Condition » Some medical conditions can produce auditory hallucinations that are treatable. “We tried her on antidepressants and antiepileptic medications, but they had no effect,” Dr. Farhat Husain, lead study author who now works at Integris Neurology in Oklahoma City, told Healthline, Since earworms like this are very rare in MS, no one thought it might be a symptom of MS. “She came to me from another neurologist,” said Husain, “and by that time she had one set of MRIs but doctors were not getting anywhere. They even took her off Tysabri for a time, but it made no difference.” Husain and her team determined that the woman didn’t suffer from any mental or emotional problems, and that she had normal hearing. So they turned their attention to her past MRI films to look for patterns of disease activity that might explain her odd hallucinations. The films revealed that since 2010 she had developed a new lesion deep within the white matter of her brain that was still present but no longer enhancing or active. “We found the inflammation had damaged an area of the brain called the auditory association cortex, which has pathways related not just to hearing, but also memory,” Husain said in an interview with . “This created musical hallucinations. She didn’t just think about the music or the word, she thought she was hearing them.” According to researchers at , the association cortex regions are the most developed parts of the human brain. The auditory association cortex is responsible for making the connection between something we hear and our memory of that sound. Researchers hypothesized that, since the lesion was present in the area of the brain that’s used to process music, perhaps something known as the “release phenomenon” is to blame. A sort of never-ending loop of neural activity prevents the woman’s brain from letting go of the songs and words no matter how much she would like to forget them. This opens the door to a whole new area of exploration in MS research, as scientists study those regions of the brain to learn how the disease might manifest when deep white matter lesions like this occur. Hallucinations, like those experienced by the woman in this case, have rarely been reported in MS patients, but that may be due to physicians overlooking the possible connection. Related News: Warm Weather Makes MS Cognitive Symptoms Worse » Although this woman has yet to find relief from the band playing in her head, she is happy to know that researchers are finally taking her seriously. “Even her husband had trouble understanding what she was going through,” Husain said. For healthy people who experience earworms, Dr. Jeremy Levin, who co-authored the study, said that it’s not an indication of damage, but rather, researchers suspect, “it’s just a memory replaying. Getting a song stuck in your head and having it play over and over can be easily replaced by listening to or thinking about something else. It may come back again but you do have the ability to get rid of it.” While Husain admits that it is theoretically possible for the lesion causing this patient’s earworm to eventually heal and disappear, so far that has not been the case. Instead, for over two years country stars have played a private—albeit unwanted—concert in her mind, and so far there’s no intermission in sight.

0dca2b8d-fb18-4f31-89ac-206ba885d9f7,"Rehabilitation interventions in multiple sclerosis: an overview , –() Multiple sclerosis is a complex, heterogeneous disease associated with long-term disability. Despite the availability of advanced disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies that may decrease activity and progression of disease and alleviate complaints to a certain extent, there is still a need for comprehensive rehabilitation interventions in order to reduce sequels and symptoms of the disease on personal activities and social participation to achieve the highest possible independence and the best quality of life. Timing and setting of rehabilitation interventions should be selected individually depending on disease phase, functional deficits, personal requirements, as well as specific goals. In addition, limitations and disease-specific characteristics that may influence rehabilitation outcome should be noted. Rehabilitation interventions should be considered early for maintaining functional capacity and reducing risk for losing important abilities or independence. Due to gradual failure of adaptive compensatory mechanisms along the course of disease, benefits of rehabilitation interventions are generally higher in earlier phases of MS. Inpatient and outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial in improving disability, participation and quality of life despite progression of the disease. Good evidence exists for different specific interventions improving physical and cognitive performance. Other important issues responsible for beneficial effects of comprehensive rehabilitation in MS include education, instruction, and information of patients and caregivers. Comprehensive assessment of health domains in MS patients using standardized framework and common language for describing the impact of disease at different levels, using International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) core sets may increase the knowledge of needs of these patients for more efficient and adapted rehabilitation interventions meeting these individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS. ICF core sets may increase the knowledge of more efficient and adapted rehabilitation measures meeting more properly individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS.

69e537a5-2c62-4408-b21b-4b81c812fa18,"Treatment Options for MS in Children: Facts for Parents — If you have a child with multiple sclerosis (MS), there are many treatments available to help manage their condition. Some treatments may help slow the development of the disease, while others may help relieve symptoms or potential complications. Read on to learn about the treatments that your child’s health team might recommend. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are a type of medication that can help slow the progression of MS. DMTs may also help prevent relapses, which happen when your child suddenly develops new symptoms. To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 17 types of DMT for the treatment of MS in adults. However, the has only approved one type of DMT for treating MS in children ages 10 years or older. This medication is known as fingolimod (Gilenya). It’s specifically approved to treat relapsing forms of MS. The FDA has not yet approved any DMTs for treating MS in children who are younger than 10 years old. However, your child’s doctor may still prescribe a DMT, even if your child is younger than 10. This is known as “off-label use.” Early treatment with a DMT may help improve your child’s long-term outlook with MS. However, these medications also pose risks of side effects. If your child takes a DMT, their doctor should monitor them for side effects. If they don’t respond well to one type of DMT, their doctor might encourage them to switch to another. Your child’s doctor can explain more about the potential benefits and risks of different DMTs. In addition to DMTs, there are medications available to treat many symptoms and potential complications of MS. For example, depending on your child’s treatment needs, their doctor may prescribe medication to treat one or more of the following: If your child is experiencing a relapse with new symptoms, their doctor may prescribe a short course of treatment with IV corticosteroids. This may help speed up their recovery from the relapse. If your child develops new symptoms or complications of MS, let their health team know. Their healthcare providers can help you learn about medications and other treatments that might provide relief. MS can potentially affect your child’s physical and cognitive functioning in a variety of ways. To help your child learn how to manage daily activities or adapt to their changing needs with MS, their health team may recommend rehabilitation therapy. For example, they may recommend one or more of the following options: This type of therapy involves exercises designed to strengthen and stretch your child’s muscles and support their mobility, coordination, and balance. If your child uses a mobility aid such a walker or wheelchair, their physical therapist may help them learn how to use it. The goal of OT is to help your child develop techniques for completing routine activities safely and independently. An occupational therapist can help your child develop energy conservation techniques, learn how to use adaptive tools, and modify their home and school environments to be more accessible. A speech-language therapist or pathologist can help your child cope with problems they might experience with speaking or swallowing. A psychologist or other health professional may use cognitive rehabilitation to help your child maintain and improve their thinking and memory skills. If your child’s condition is affecting their ability to move around, communicate, concentrate, or complete other routine tasks, let their health team know. They can help you learn more about rehabilitation therapy and how it might fit into your child’s treatment plan. Coping with MS can be stressful. Along with the other potential symptoms and complications, your child might experience feelings of grief, anger, anxiety, or depression. If your child is experiencing emotional or mental health challenges, their doctor may refer them to a mental health specialist for diagnosis and treatment. Their doctor or mental health specialist may recommend behavioral counseling, medication, or both. You should also let your doctor know if you’re finding it hard to cope with the emotional challenges of managing your child’s condition. You might benefit from professional support, too. Feeling well-supported emotionally may enable you to be even more effective in supporting your child. In addition to medications, rehabilitation therapy, and other medical treatments, your child’s health team might recommend changes to their lifestyle to help manage their condition. For example, they might recommend changes to their: Many of the lifestyle habits recommended for managing MS are the same lifestyle habits that support general good health. For example, there’s no specific diet recommended for MS. Your child will likely benefit from eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Your child’s health team may also encourage your child to limit their exposure to hot temperatures. When your child’s body temperature rises, it may worsen their symptoms. Getting early and comprehensive treatment for your child may help improve their health and quality of life with MS. Depending on your child’s specific needs, their health team may recommend disease-modifying therapies and other medications, rehabilitation therapy, lifestyle changes, or other treatments. To learn more about the potential benefits and risks of different treatment approaches, speak to your child’s healthcare providers. — What to Expect When Your Child Starts Treatment for MS The Caregiver’s Guide to Multiple Sclerosis in Children Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis: What You Need to Know Is My Child’s MS Flare an Emergency?

a4932d25-25eb-42ac-80d4-1515a3b742cc,"All About Radiologically Isolated Syndrome and Its Connection to Multiple Sclerosis — — Radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) is a neurological — brain and nerve — condition. In this syndrome, there are lesions or slightly changed areas in the brain or spine. Lesions can occur anywhere in the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic (eye) nerves. Radiologically isolated syndrome is a medical finding during a head and neck scan. It’s not known to cause any other signs or symptoms. In most cases, it doesn’t require treatment. Radiologically isolated syndrome has been linked to . A brain and spine scan of someone with RIS may look like the . However, being diagnosed with RIS doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have MS. Some researchers note that RIS isn’t always linked to multiple sclerosis. Lesions can happen for many reasons and in different areas of the central nervous system. Other show that RIS may be part of the “multiple sclerosis spectrum.” This means that this syndrome may be a “silent” type of MS or an early sign of this condition. A found that about one-third of people with RIS showed some symptoms of MS within a five-year period. Of these, almost 10 percent were diagnosed with MS. The lesions grew or worsened in about 40 percent of people diagnosed with RIS. But they didn’t yet have any symptoms. Where the lesions happen in radiologically isolated syndrome may also be important. One group of researchers found that people with lesions in an area of the brain called the thalamus were at . Another found that people who had lesions in the upper part of the spinal cord rather than in the brain were more likely to develop MS. The same study noted that having RIS wasn’t more of a risk than other possible causes of multiple sclerosis. Most people who develop MS will have more than one risk factor. Risks for MS include: If you’re diagnosed with RIS, you won’t have symptoms of MS. You may not have any symptoms at all. In some cases, people with this syndrome may have other mild signs of a nerve disorder. This includes slight brain shrinkage and inflammatory disease. Symptoms may include: Radiologically isolated syndrome is usually found by accident during a scan for other reasons. Brain lesions have become a more common finding as medical scans improve and are more frequently used. You may have an MRI or CT scan of the head and neck for headache pain, , , a head injury, stroke, and other concerns. Lesions may be found in the brain or spinal cord. These areas may look different from the nerve fibers and tissues around them. They may appear brighter or darker on a scan. Almost of adults with radiologically isolated syndrome had their first brain scan due to headaches. RIS is rare in children, but it does happen. A review of cases in children and teenagers found that almost had some possible signs of multiple sclerosis after their diagnosis. About 61 percent of children with RIS showed more lesions within one to two years. Multiple sclerosis usually happens after the age of 20. A type called can happen in children younger than 18 years. Ongoing research is looking into whether radiologically isolated syndrome in children is a sign that they will develop this disease in early adulthood. MRI and brain scans have improved and are more common. This means that RIS is now easier for doctors to find. More research is needed on whether brain lesions that don’t cause symptoms should be treated. Some doctors are researching whether early treatment for RIS may help prevent MS. Other doctors believe that it’s best to watch and wait. Being diagnosed with RIS doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll ever require treatment. However, careful and regular monitoring by a specialist doctor is important. In some people with this condition, the lesions can worsen quickly. Others may develop symptoms over time. Your doctor may treat you for related symptoms, such as chronic headache pain or migraines. Most people with RIS don’t have symptoms or develop multiple sclerosis. However, it’s still important to see your neurologist (brain and nerve specialist) and family doctor for regular checkups. You’ll need follow-up scans to see if the lesions have changed. Scans may be needed yearly or more often even if you don’t have symptoms. Let your doctor know about any symptoms or changes in your health. Keep a journal to record symptoms. Tell your doctor if you feel anxious about your diagnosis. They may be able to point you to forums and support groups for people with RIS. — — Why It Pays to Start Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Treatment Early Medically reviewed by Although there's no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS), you shouldn't let treatment take a back seat.

La mejora del acceso a los tratamientos para las personas con EM es una prioridad clave y estratégica para el movimiento de MSIF. Actualmente, existen muchos tratamientos que pueden modificar la evolución de la enfermedad, prevenir la acumulación de discapacidad y proteger al cerebro del daño causado por la EM. Lamentablemente, en muchos países, es difícil acceder a estos tratamientos, a menudo imposible. Es por este motivo que la MSIF está trabajando con organizaciones asociadas influyentes para reducir las barreras para accedera los tratamientos en todo el mundo. El acceso a medicamentos asequibles para EM no constituye un problema solo en los países de bajos ingresos. La labor reciente de incidencia en políticas públicas por parte de la Sociedad Nacional de EM (NMSS) demuestra que también es una cuestión crítica en los Estados Unidos. Un estudio reciente publicado en la revista Neurology informa que el costo de los medicamentos para EM se duplicó en los últimos 7 años, a pesar de la introducción de un genérico intercambiable del medicamento de uso generalizado, acetato de glatiramer. El artículo académico está acompañado por una encuesta realizada por NMSS a casi 600 personas con EM, donde se muestra que el 40 % de los encuestados “alteró o interrumpió” el tratamiento modificador de la enfermedad para EM a causa del alto costo. ‎“La EM presenció innovaciones terapéuticas notables en los últimos 25 años, pero dichos avances no sirven de mucho si las personas con EM no pueden acceder a estas innovaciones a causa de los altos costos, o si se enfrentan a los enormes desafíos y decisiones que se mencionaron en nuestra encuesta”. Tim Coetzee, director de incidencia en políticas públicas, servicios e investigación de NMSS. Holly Ridgway, quien recibió el diagnóstico de EM en 2011, expresó que su familia ha tenido dificultades financieras a causa de los costos de sus medicamentos: “No vamos al cine, no cenamos afuera. Mi familia no debería tener que elegir entre conseguirme la medicación o ir al supermercado”. Además de incidir en las políticas públicas para mejorar el acceso a los medicamentos en los EE. UU., la NMSS tiene un papel clave en la labor de la MSIF para mejorar el acceso a escala mundial. ‎• ‎• Escucha sobre personas en los EE. UU. que tienen dificultades con el alto costo de sus medicamentos para EM Winner of the 2020 Global MS Research Booster Award announced Discovering life-changing treatments for progressive MS Las últimas noticias de organizaciones de MS en todo el mundo.

Optic neuritis (ON) is a common manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS), and refers to inflammation of the optic nerve. It can be the initial demyelinating event in up to 20% of patients, and occurs in almost half of patients with MS.1 ON associated with demyelinating disease is generally characterized by acute to subacute, painful, and monocular vision loss. Vision typically worsens over hours to days (not months), and recovery is expected to begin within 1 month of symptom onset. The pain that occurs with optic neuritis is usually ocular, retroocular, periorbital, or a frontal headache. This pain is generally exacerbated with extraocular movements, and occurs in the vast majority of patients with typical ON.2 Patients with features atypical of ON, such as those that suggest other etiologies (i.e. abrupt onset of vision loss suggestive of a vascular etiology), warrant ophthalmology evaluation. The diagnosis of ON involves primarily clinical, electrophysiologic, and imaging evaluations. Clinically, patients typically describe central (less commonly arcuate, cecocentral, or hemianopic) vision loss that progresses over hours to days. Examination is commonly notable for impaired visual acuity, red desaturation, and an afferent pupillary defect. Funduscopic examination can appear normal acutely, but disc edema can be present in approximately one-third of patients (particularly those with anterior optic neuritis).1, 2 Optic disc pallor is generally seen weeks to months following onset of typical optic neuritis. The presence of hemorrhages or exudates on funduscopic examination is more suggestive of other, non-demyelinating etiologies of optic neuropathy and warrants ophthalmology evaluation. Imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of optic neuritis include orbital MRI and optical coherence tomography (OCT). These tools can be particularly helpful if the clinical history or physical examination findings are atypical for ON. Orbital MRI with and without contrast, performed with fat saturation sequences, generally reveals enlargement and enhancement of the affected optic nerve in the acute setting. The enhancement and edema seen on MRI generally improves over time with classic demyelinating ON. OCT evaluates the optic nerve axonal integrity by measurement of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and is generally used to evaluate for evidence of prior ON. The pattern of RNFL thinning most specific to MS is temporal.3 RNFL can appear normal in the acute setting but starts to decline within 4 weeks of ON. OCT at onset of ON is also potentially confounded by edema of the optic disc, which may lead to overestimates of baseline RNFL.4 Ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness, another OCT measure, is not confounded by disc edema but declines in a similar time frame to RNFL and therefore may be more useful as a baseline measurement. The decrease in RNFL is thought to continue for 6 months following ON onset. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) can also provide valuable information regarding optic nerve impairment in ON. VEPs evaluate optic nerve function by calculating P100 latency and amplitude, which are generally abnormal in the setting of acute and remote optic neuritis. Prolonged P100 latency is a characteristic of remote optic neuritis. In terms of other clinical testing, low contrast letter acuity has also emerged as a highly sensitive means by which to detect and quantify visual dysfunction following ON. Such modalities were not available for use in the ONTT, and therefore we are now able to evaluate visual impairment with greater sensitivity following ON. Once primarily ophthalmological causes of monocular vision loss (i.e. CRAO, CRVO, uveitis, glaucoma, retinal pathology, trauma, or corneal pathology) have been ruled out, the differential diagnosis of optic neuropathy, of which optic neuritis is a cause, can be broad. Vascular, inflammatory/autoimmune, infectious, neoplastic, and metabolic causes are considerations. A clinician should further narrow the diagnosis based on the timing of symptoms and associated features (Below). Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), arteritic or nonarteritic Older patients, sudden onset, lack of pain, severe vision loss with prolonged/limited recovery, hemorrhages present, altitudinal defect; see vasculitides below if arteritic Vasculitides (polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, temporal arteritis) Check ANCA, ESR, CRP; generally vascular presentation (acute onset) Temporal arteritis generally associated with Arteritic ION Systemic lupus erhythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome Check ANA, cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies Painful, acute to subacute vision loss associated with red desaturation Painful, acute to subacute vision loss associated with red desaturation Can be associated with other signs of intraocular/intraorbital inflammation (anterior uveitis, dry eye, other cranial neuropathies, glaucoma, optic nerve sheath enhancement) Painless vision loss, optic disc edema, Anti-CRMP5 (CV-2) antibodies CRION (chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy) Granulomatous inflammation, generally responsive to steroids, can be bilateral, painful Acute viral infections (EBV, HSV, VZV, West Nile Virus, CMV) Optic nerve sheath meningioma, but can have paraclinoid or sphenoid wing meningiomas causing compression Progressive vision loss over >10-14 days, young men Usually presents in childhood, bilateral and symmetric optic atrophy Associated nausea, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, usually bilateral Longstanding tobacco and alcohol dependence, generally bilateral, may be related to nutritional deficiencies Insidious, slowly progressive visual loss, with prolonged disc swelling Slowly progressive vision loss, 6-24 months after radiation therapy What is an appropriate diagnostic evaluation for secondary causes of unilateral optic neuritis? When a patient presents with unilateral acute optic neuritis, one should obtain a brain MRI with and without gadolinium contrast in order to evaluate for other signs of central nervous system demyelinating disease, specifically multiple sclerosis. Spinal cord MRI can also be considered to evaluate for subclinical spinal cord lesions, or to investigate further if a history suggestive of myelitis is reported. Laboratory evaluation could include testing for the previously mentioned differential diagnosis of ON: HIV, RPR, ACE, ESR, CRP, aquaporin-4 antibody, Bartonella testing, ANA, ENA, and Lyme testing.4 Testing should be expanded depending on relevant history and findings, as outlined in the table of differential diagnostic considerations above. In the appropriate clinical setting (i.e. when MS, NMOSD, neurosarcoidosis, or CNS infections are suspected), evaluation could include lumbar puncture for assessment of CNS oligoclonal bands, pleocytosis, elevated protein, and/or specific infectious studies. At the Mellen Center, we typically do not perform an extensive evaluation for typical demyelinating optic neuritis, unless a patient’s history or examination is suggestive of other potential etiologies. Atypical features, including lack of eye pain, systemic symptoms, atypical fundus findings, and bilateral disease, generally prompt a more extensive evaluation. How should this evaluation change if the optic neuritis is bilateral? More extensive evaluation is warranted if ON is bilateral, and this should include toxic/metabolic causes as outlined in the Table above. Bilateral optic neuritis can be a presenting symptom of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) syndrome, sarcoidosis, paraneoplastic optic neuropathy (CRMP-5), infections, and chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION). If a patient has bilateral optic neuritis and aquaporin-4 antibody testing is negative, anti-MOG antibody testing should be completed at the Mayo Clinic Laboratory. However, seronegative NMOSD is a possibility and should be considered in the appropriate clinical context, particularly in the setting of severe vision loss with poor recovery.10 If symptoms worsen following a steroid taper, sarcoidosis should be more strongly considered, and chest CT should be completed to evaluate for hilarlymphadenopathy. If paraneoplastic or metastatic disease is suspected, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be completed, and a serum paraneoplastic antibody evaluation should be performed via the Mayo Clinic Laboratory to test for the presence of CRMP-5 antibodies. How should this evaluation change if the optic neuritis is recurrent? Optic neuritis can be recurrent, and potential causes include NMOSD, anti-MOG syndrome, CRION, and sarcoidosis. Therefore, the evaluation for recurrent ON is similar to that of bilateral ON. In any patient with unilateral ON, we generally test for aquaporin-4 antibodies. If this is negative and recurrent ON occurs, aquaporin-4 antibody testing can be repeated in 6 months, as this positive result would change management. Another consideration is anti-MOG syndrome, an increasingly recognized cause of optic neuritis. When a patient presents with acute inflammatory ON, treatment includes possible methylprednisolone, 1000mg IV daily for 3-5 days, followed by prednisone taper (60mg for 4 days, 40mg daily for 4 days, then 20mg daily for 4 days). However, a clinician may opt to defer steroids based upon the patient’s clinical characteristics. In the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), visual recovery was faster in patients receiving IV methylprednisolone compared to those receiving placebo or oral prednisone. However, long-term visual outcomes were not significantly different between these groups. If a patient has visual acuity worse than 20/40, use of IV methylprednisolone followed by a prednisone taper is recommended. If visual acuity is better than 20/40, treatment with IV methylprednisolone should be considered if a patient has baseline visual impairment in the fellow eye, severe pain, scotoma, or an occupation that demands visual precision.13 If a patient’s brain MRI demonstrates gadolinium enhancing lesions, the impetus to treat with IV methylprednisolone is higher. What is the prognosis for recovery of vision after optic neuritis? Following an episode of typical ON, patients can be followed using several clinical and imaging modalities to monitor recovery. Visual acuity tends to recover over a period of weeks, and begins 2-4 weeks after onset.1 Monitoring of RNFL and GCL thinning following an episode of ON generally reveals RNFL thinning as early as 4 weeks, but up to 6 months after the clinical episode. The prognosis for subjective visual recovery after acute demyelinating optic neuritis due to MS is generally good, and recovery begins within 2 to 4 weeks. However, objective evidence including low contrast letter acuity and OCT measures demonstrate longstanding evidence of damage following each ON episode.6 Optic neuritis due to other etiologies (infectious and inflammatory (including NMOSD)) is variable. If a patient does not meet criteria for MS or NMOSD at the time of optic neuritis and no other causes are found, what is the appropriate monitoring and treatment strategy? Following an episode of typical optic neuritis, as reported in the ONTT, 35% of patients developed recurrent ON at ten-year follow-up. This recurrence was more common in patients with abnormal brain MRI. The risk of MS was higher for patients who had brain MRI lesions typical for MS at baseline, and generally lower for males, normal brain MRI at ON presentation, optic disc swelling, and atypical clinical features of ON. Given this risk of developing MS or other neuro-inflammatory disorders following ON, brain MRI should be repeated in 6 months, then after 1 year, to evaluate for the development of lesions that could indicate the development of MS via dissemination in time following a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Patients should be followed clinically for development of new neurological symptoms that could be consistent with a demyelinating event. If a patient is diagnosed with CIS at the time of optic neuritis typical for MS, with risk of MS development, a decision should be made whether initiation of disease modifying therapy is warranted. It is established that MS disease modifying therapies reduce the risk of MS development following a clinically isolated syndrome.17 Such a decision is based upon characteristics of an individual patient, including presence of brain MRI lesions. If a patient has recurrent optic neuritis not meeting MS or NMOSD criteria, what is the appropriate management strategy? If a patient has recurrent optic neuritis, an underlying cause cannot be identified, and steroid responsiveness is apparent, the diagnosis of CRION should be considered. CRION refers to a relapsing form of optic neuritis characterized by inflammation. Patients with CRION tend to have recurrent ON upon steroid withdrawal, so chronic immunosuppression is generally advised with medications including azathioprine, methotrexate, or IVIG. Another consideration in recurrent ON is anti-MOG syndrome, an increasingly recognized etiology of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including optic neuritis. Commercial testing for anti-MOG antibodies is available, and could be conducted if aquaporin-4 antibody testing is negative. The management of anti-MOG syndrome is thought to be similar to that of NMOSD. If a patient with known multiple sclerosis presents with monocular vision loss, what etiologies should be considered? Although optic neuritis is more common earlier in the course of MS, patients with MS can have optic neuritis at any point in their disease. The diagnosis of ON should therefore be considered in an MS patient who reports monocular vision loss, but other etiologies should be considered as well. Such diagnoses include temporal arteritis and ischemic optic neuropathy, which can be seen in older patients; these possible etiologies warrant emergent ophthalmological evaluation in a patient with sudden onset vision loss, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, or new onset headaches. If the patient reports halos, ophthalmology evaluation is warranted to rule out uveitis, which can be associated with MS. Patients with MS who are on disease modifying therapies may also experience vision issues related to these medications. Specifically, patients on fingolimod are at risk for macular edema and can present with blurry or wavy central vision. Patients on natalizumab who are JC virus antibody-positive and therefore at risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can present with hemianopsia that they may perceive as monocular vision loss. Migraines are also common in patients with MS, and visual aura can often be misinterpreted as optic neuritis by patients. If a patient had previous optic neuritis and reports recurrence of symptoms that are not as severe as their initial episode, a pseudoexacerbation should be considered and the patient should be evaluated for infection. Additionally, patients with prior ON can experience Uhthoff’s phenomenon, with worsening of visual function associated with heat. Graves J and Balcer LJ.

1c2d0640-4b50-4c58-b72e-fccedbe71d22,"FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know There are two pieces of encouraging news for people with progressive and relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The news comes in the form of two new drugs recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On March 26, FDA officials the Novartis drug, Mayzent (siponimod), for various forms of multiple sclerosis, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Novartis officials said the pill will be available sometime in early April. They noted that Mayzent, a tablet taken once a day, is the first treatment specifically for people with active SPMS in more than 15 years. The annual price tag is expected to be for the treatment. On March 29, the FDA also EMD Serono’s (cladribrine), also for RRMS and active SPMS but not for clinically isolated syndrome. Company officials told Healthline the annual price tag is expected to be $99,500 for the two-year treatment. There are nearly living with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States and about worldwide. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society states that people with RRMS have a 50 percent chance of progressing to SPMS within the first 10 years. Another 90 percent have a chance of transitioning after 25 years. People with relapsing remitting forms of MS currently have 15 FDA-approved disease modifying treatments (DMTs). People living with SPMS now have three choices. The last MS treatment by the FDA was ocrelizumab in 2017. It entered the market with a $65,000 annual . Here’s a look at the two drugs approved by the FDA last week. In 2010, the FDA Gilenya, the company’s widely used drug for MS treatment. Novartis last year, seeking to block the sales of generic versions of Gilenya after the drug’s main patent expires in August. “Mayzent works to sequester certain white blood cells in lymph nodes. These are considered important in inflammatory response in MS. If they can’t get out into system then they can’t cause over inflammation in MS.” , a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center in Maryland and the associate vice president of healthcare access for National Multiple Sclerosis Society. In the phase III trial of Mayzent with 1,651 patients, the fraction of patients with confirmed progression of disability was statistically significantly lower in the Mayzent group than in the placebo group. Patients treated with Mayzent had a 55 percent relative reduction in annualized relapse rate. “This drug crosses the blood brain barrier,” explained , a neurologist at the University of California San Francisco. “We’re not exactly sure what it does, but the results show it slows progression in those with later stage of disease.” “The immune system is activated in the periphery and dives into brain and causes havoc,” he added. “We believe that in progressive MS cells get into the brain and destroy from the inside out. This medication works in the brain. Others work in the periphery.” Side effects common during the trials included headaches, elevations in blood pressures, increase in liver enzyme, and a reduction in white blood cell counts that might cause infection. Novartis shared with Healthline that it has developed a comprehensive patient support program for Mayzent, to help patients navigate insurance coverage and identify resources for those who are uninsured or underinsured. “Mayzent has been demonstrated to have a modest but statistically significant effect on slowing progression in persons with SPMS who are still ambulatory with or without a device,” , professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. Officials at Merck KGaA, the parent company of EMD Serono, said in a that Mavenclad is the “the first ever oral treatment to provide two years of proven efficacy with a maximum of 20 days of treatment.” Mavenclad is taken for 8 to 10 days in each of the two years of treatment. There are no other treatments needed. In the phase III study of Mavenclad with 1,976 participants, patients experienced a in annual relapse rate and a 33 percent reduction in rate of disability progression measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). They also experienced a lower number of lesions compared to the placebo group. Mavenclad works by targeting certain white blood cells (lymphocytes) that lead the immune attack in MS. The drug temporarily reduces the number of certain lymphocytes without continuous suppression of the immune system. Risks include upper respiratory tract infection, headache, herpes, alopecia, and lymphopenia. Serious adverse reactions reported in the clinical program included malignancies. The company states that due to its safety profile this drug is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. “Price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his/her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out of pocket cost,” EMD Serono officials told Healthline. “Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.” “We are committed to helping support patients who are prescribed Mavenclad. offers personalized patient support, including assistance with navigating insurance coverage questions and additional resources that may be able to help eligible patients who are uninsured or underinsured,” company officials added. The availability of the new drugs is being tempered by their high costs. “While we are grateful to have another treatment available for people with MS, one with a more convenient delivery option, this benefit is overshadowed by the high list price,” said , executive vice president of advocacy for the National MS Society. “To have a new MS treatment priced just shy of six figures a year is disheartening,” Talente told Healthline. “This also illustrates the distorting effect of drug prices in the United States.” Talente said price and a company’s commitment to its patients go hand in hand. Choosing which medication is right is a basic risk benefit equation,” added West. “It is a different equation for everybody. More options mean a better chance to find a great solution for each patient. It’s about matching the right medicine to the right patient at the right time.” West was a paid consultant for Mavenclad and has been compensated by Novartis on other projects in an advisory manner.

Horsfield, Andrea Falini, Giancarlo Comi, Massimo Filippi Objective: We combined structural and functional MRI to better understand the mechanisms responsible for cognitive impairment in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Brain dual-echo, diffusion tensor, 3D T1-weighted, and resting-state (RS) fMRI scans were acquired from 35 consecutive pediatric patients with MS and 16 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Patients with abnormalities in ≥2 neuropsychological tests were classified as cognitively impaired. The regional distribution of white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) damage was assessed using voxel-wise analyses. Default mode network (DMN) RS functional connectivity (FC) was also measured. Results: Sixteen patients (45%) were classified as cognitively impaired. Compared to cognitively preserved (CP) patients, cognitively impaired patients with MS had higher occurrence of T2 lesions as well as more severe damage to the WM and GM, as measured by atrophy and diffusivity abnormalities, in the posterior regions of the parietal lobes close to the midline (precuneus, posterior cingulum, and corpus callosum). Compared to the other study groups, they also showed reduced RS FC of the precuneus, whereas CP patients experienced an increased RS FC of the anterior cingulate cortex. A multivariable model identified diffusivity abnormalities of the cingulum and corpus callosum and RS FC of the precuneus as the covariates more strongly associated with cognitive impairment (C-index = 0.99). Conclusions: In pediatric patients with MS, cognitive dysfunction is associated with structural and functional abnormalities of the posterior core regions of the DMN.

Multiple Sklerose: Kognitive Defizite haben hohe Relevanz für den Alltag Multiple Sklerose: Kognitive Defizite haben hohe Relevanz für den Alltag Dtsch Arztebl 2017; 114(37): [12]; DOI: 10.3238/PersNeuro.2017.09.15.02 Der Erhalt der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit stellt eine der Herausforderungen bei Patienten mit multipler Sklerose dar. Immunmodulatorische Arzneimittel und nichtpharmakologische Maßnahmen können einen positiven Einfluss haben. Neben den klassischen physischen Symptomen, die im Rahmen einer multiplen Sklerose (MS) auftreten, existieren „verborgene Symptome“, zu denen kognitive Veränderungen, Fatigue und emotional-affektive Aspekte wie Depression und Angststörungen zählen. Die Betitelung als „verborgen“ oder „soft“ führt oftmals zu Irritationen, sind diese Beeinträchtigungen doch für die Patienten oftmals zentral und deutlich sichtbar. Mittlerweile gilt es als unbestritten, dass sich die Trias „Fatigue, Depression/Angst und kognitive Störungen“ stark negativ auf die Lebensqualität betroffener Patienten und ihre Berufsfähigkeit auswirkt () . Verborgene Symptome der MS und ihr Einfluss auf Lebensqualität und Berufsfähigkeit Eine kürzlich erschienene Studie zum Einfluss der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit auf den Grad der Arbeitsfähigkeit konnte sehr deutlich zeigen, dass die Arbeitsfähigkeit eine direkte Funktion der kognitiven Leistung ist. Dieser Effekt blieb über verschiedene kognitive Domänen hinweg stabil, sodass dieser enge Zusammenhang als gesichert angesehen werden kann (). Ein weiteres starkes Argument dafür, die Kognition im Rahmen der MS als gewichtig anzusehen, lässt sich aus der jüngsten Publikation zur Schätzung der Kostenbelastung durch MS in Europa ableiten (). Hier zeigt sich sehr deutlich, dass Kognition neben Fatigue einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Belastung leistet, da diese Symptome von Beginn an unabhängig vom Behinderungsgrad präsent sein können und die Produktivität der Patienten negativ beeinflussen. Die Folgekosten in Anbetracht der Betroffenheit oftmals noch sehr junger Patienten sind enorm und schließen vor allem häufige Arbeitsausfälle und Frühverrentung ein. Es sei daher bereits an dieser Stelle betont, dass eine Sensibilisierung seitens der behandelnden Ärzte (vor allem Neurologen und Hausärzte) für die unsichtbaren Symptome dringend angezeigt ist, um durch den Einsatz frühzeitiger Immun- und symptomatischer Therapie das kognitive Netzwerk so lange wie möglich funktionstüchtig zu halten. Die kognitiven Veränderungen bei Patienten mit MS fokussieren sich auf 3 wesentliche Bereiche: kognitive Verlangsamung (Einschränkung in der Informations­verarbeitungs­geschwindig­keit), Beeinträchtigungen der exekutiven Funktionen (z. B. eingeschränktes Multitasking, eingeschränkte mentale Flexibilität). Als hat sich die herausgestellt. Diese Verlangsamung lässt sich oftmals bereits zum Krankheitsbeginn mit sensitiven Testverfahren objektivieren und führt häufig dazu, dass auch andere kognitive Teilleistungen in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden. Zudem ist eine gute kognitive Geschwindigkeit in unserer Hochleistungsgesellschaft von besonderer Bedeutung: Wer in kurzer Zeit viel leistet und dabei noch eine gute Qualität abliefert, hat beruflichen Mitstreitern etwas voraus. Wer aber für eine gute Qualität doppelt so viel Zeit benötigt, fällt rasch aus dem Rahmen. Letzteres ist genau das, was MS-Patienten nicht selten passiert. Gibt man im testpsychologischen Kontext genügend Zeit, sind die Patienten häufig in der Lage, 100 % Qualität zu erbringen. In zeitgebundenen Testverfahren sieht man häufig ein Scheitern, weil die Quantität einfach in der vorgegebenen Zeit nicht erreicht werden kann. Neben der Verlangsamung treten Probleme der auf, und zwar dahingehend, dass die Aufmerksamkeit nicht anhaltend auf dem gleichen Niveau gehalten werden kann, sondern . Das eingeschränkte Multitasking wirkt sich zudem negativ auf die Leistungsfähigkeit im Alltag aus, da nicht mehr parallel, sondernabgearbeitet werden können. Somit haben die kognitiven Domänen, die bei der MS im Speziellen beeinträchtigt sind, eine hohe Alltagsrelevanz und stellen zu jedem Zeitpunkt der Erkrankung eine beachtliche Belastung für die Betroffenen dar. Zur Evolution der kognitiven Veränderungen über die Zeit liegen nur wenige Daten aus longitudinalen und cross-sektionalen Studien vor. Diese aber sprechen kongruent für eine deutlichere Progression in den ersten 5 Jahren nach Krankheitsbeginn und eine Abschwächung im weiteren Verlauf (, ). In jedem Fall unterscheidet sich der Verlauf sehr deutlich von dem der klassischen neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen. Dies ist ein wesentlicher Punkt in der Kommunikation mit den Patienten, da oftmals die Angst im Vordergrund steht, dement zu werden. Letztere Sorge führt häufig zu einer generellen Ablehnung, den eigenen kognitiven Status erheben zu lassen. Daher ist eine frühzeitige Aufklärung der Patienten hinsichtlich der Entwicklung von kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen sehr wichtig. Die Frage nach den konkreten Ursachen für das Auftreten kognitiver Störungen bei MS kann nicht mit Sicherheit beantwortet werden. Dennoch haben sich im Laufe der letzten 20 Jahre Hypothesen aus Studienergebnissen ableiten lassen: Zum einen zeigen bildgebende Daten, dass es nicht primär auf die Anzahl der Läsionen in der weißen und grauen Substanz ankommt, sondern vielmehr auf die Lokalisation (, ). Liegen auch nur wenige Läsionen in für die Kognition strategischen Hirnregionen, kann daraus ein kognitives Defizit resultieren. Neben der Lokalisation der Läsionen spielt die Hirnatrophie eine entscheidende Rolle. Es gilt als gesichert, dass das kortikale Gesamthirnvolumen bei kognitiv beeinträchtigten Patienten kleiner ist als bei Personen mit intakter Kognition (). Darüber hinaus gibt es Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitig auftretende atrophische Veränderung in den ersten beiden Jahren nach Diagnosestellung als Prädiktor für einen ungünstigen kognitiven Verlauf in den Folgejahren zu werten ist (). Mit Korrelationskoeffizienten von 0,5 und größer stellt die zum kognitiven Status dar. In diesem Zusammenhang sei explizit auf den Thalamus verwiesen, da es Evidenz dafür gibt, dass MS-Patienten bereits in frühen Krankheitsstadien eine thalamische Atrophie entwickeln können () und dass sowohl Struktur als auch Funktion des Thalamus maßgeblich die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit beeinflussen (). Aus den kernspintomografisch gefundenen Resultaten lässt sich gesamthaft ableiten, dass sich ein struktureller und funktioneller Schaden negativ auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und therapeutische Ansätze möglichst frühzeitig zum Einsatz kommen sollten, solange das Netzwerk noch Ressourcen zur Kompensation besitzt. Aufgrund der Bedeutsamkeit der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit für das Berufs- und Sozialleben der Patienten ist eine regelmäßige angeraten. Diese Dokumentation dient dazu, dem Patienten zum einen zu signalisieren, dass er von seiner Therapie profitiert und auch hinsichtlich der Kognition stabil ist, zum anderen sollte ein sich deutlich verschlechternder kognitiver Status auch immer Anlass dazu geben, die gegenwärtige Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Ein empfehlenswertes Instrument, um den kognitiven Status im Rahmen der klinischen Routine zu erfassen, ist die (). Sie besteht aus 3 Testverfahren: dem VLMT (verbaler Lern- und Merkfähigkeitstest) () und dem Die Durchführungszeit für die gesamte Screeningbatterie liegt bei circa 20 Minuten. Steht dafür nicht ausreichend Zeit zur Verfügung, empfiehlt es sich, zumindest den SDMT regelmäßig einmal pro Jahr durchzuführen. Die Durchführung nimmt nur 90 Sekunden in Anspruch, und die Aussagekraft des Tests ist dabei äußerst gut. Vor allem das Defizit in der kognitiven Prozessierungsgeschwindigkeit und im Arbeitsgedächtnis kann mit diesem Verfahren sehr zuverlässig erfasst werden. Selbstverständlich ersetzen Screeninginstrumente keine elaborierte neuropsychologische Untersuchung. Sie sollen eher dazu dienen, eine Sensibilisierung für die Kognition zu entwickeln, und können bei deutlich abfallender Leistung im Vergleich zum individuellen Vortest frühzeitig eine kognitive Verschlechterung aufzeigen. Die Behandlung der kognitiven Störungen bei MS ist eine , da es keine wirksame, evidenzbasierte symptomatische Therapie gibt, die jedem betroffenen Patienten empfohlen werden könnte. Zu den verlaufsmodifizierenden Immuntherapien liegen nur wenige Daten zur Kognition vor. Für die Interferone und Glatiramerazetat konnte gezeigt werden, dass sie sich nicht nachteilig auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirken, sondern Patienten unter der Therapie deutlich besser abschneiden als solche unter Placebo (–). Zu Natalizumab liegen Ergebnisse aus 2 Studien vor, die eine signifikante Verbesserung der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit in entscheidenden Domänen dokumentieren (, ). Fingolimod und Dimetylfumarat () wirken sich ebenfalls stabilisierend auf die Kognition aus, konnten aber in bisherigen Studien keine klinisch relevante Verbesserung zeigen. Eine solche Verbesserung konnte jüngst eindrücklich für Daclizumab vorgestellt werden. Im direkten Vergleich zum Interferon beta-1a i.m. schnitten die Patienten über einen Zeitraum von 144 Wochen deutlich besser ab. Hinzu kam, dass die Leistung im SDMT nach dem genannten Beobachtungszeitraum als klinisch relevante Verbesserung im Vergleich zur Baseline-Untersuchung zu werten ist (). Zur symptomatischen Behandlung der kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen muss leider konstatiert werden, dass es keine hinreichende Evidenz für die Wirksamkeit der untersuchten Medikamente gibt, zu denen Modafinil, 4-Aminopyridin, Amantadin, L-Amphetamin, Methylphenidat, aber auch Antidementiva wie Donepezil, Rivastigmin und Memantin zählen (, ). Zu den ist zu sagen, dass sich moderates Ausdauertraining positiv auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und eine Studie zur Frage der Intensität gezeigt hat, dass intensives, moderates und leichtes Training sich gleichsam positiv auswirken. Dies bedeutet, dass Patienten sich durchaus auch körperlich fordern können, sie aber die Trainingsintensität ihrer jeweiligen Verfassung anpassen sollten. Wichtig ist, dass überhaupt körperliche Aktivität durchgeführt wird (, ). Neben sportlicher Aktivität ist auch Hirnleistungstraining eine Maßnahme, von der viele Patienten profitieren (, ). Das Training sollte allerdings spezifisch auf die jeweiligen im Vordergrund stehenden Defizite zugeschnitten sein und nicht einen Rundumschlag darstellen im Sinne von „viel hilft auch viel“. Kognitive Defizite sind ernst zu nehmende Symptome der MS mit hoher Relevanz für den Alltag und die Berufsfähigkeit der Betroffenen. Das Erheben des kognitiven Status sollte bereits im Rahmen der Diagnosestellung erfolgen, um einen Verlauf über die Zeit und einen Vergleich zu einem Ausgangswert bei deutlicher Verschlechterung dokumentieren zu können. Es gibt Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitige Immuntherapie auch als Benefit im Hinblick auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit über die Zeit zu werten ist. Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung kann Anzeichen eines Schubes sein (kognitive Schübe sind keine Chimäre!). Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung (z. B. > 4 Punkte im SDMT) sollte in der Gesamtschau mit anderen Befunden (vor allem MRT) Anlass dazu geben, die bestehende Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Prof. Dr. phil. Dipl.-Psych.

With these goals in mind, the National MS Society convened a group of key stakeholders – including people with MS, support partners, Society staff and clinicians from the fields of neurology, primary care, rehabilitation medicine, psychology, nursing, physical therapy and speech pathology– to help inform the Society’s role in finding solutions for individuals and families who are facing advanced care needs.        “At the Society, when we face a challenge, we get the brightest minds together and put the problems on the table,” said Cyndi Zagieboylo, President & CEO of the National MS Society. “We need to pursue every opportunity to support people with advanced MS in living their best lives.”     People living with MS lent a vital voice to the process. “It’s going to be very important as you think about this that you understand our lived experience,” urged Lisa Iezzoni, MD, a health services researcher who has MS. “It takes me about 10 times longer to do the most basic task.” Karen Jackson, who lives with primary progressive MS, agreed. “Having advanced MS means I have lost the ability to be spontaneous,” she said. “I am forced to plan every minute of every day. The only thing more exhausting than planning my day, is not planning. It takes an annoying sequence of action steps to achieve even the smallest goal, like buying gas or parking the car.”   Resilience, however, rang through despite the challenges of advanced care needs, which for both of these women includes wheeled mobility. “When people ask me how I feel about my MS, I tell them that I’m not sick,” insisted Dr. Iezzoni. “I just can’t walk.” Ms. Jackson added, “Explain to people what your needs are. They want to help.” It’s worth the effort, she says. “Not participating in life is not an option.”   Getting a wheelchair was noted to be a “line in the sand” for many people living with MS, who often view the choice to use one as a loss of independence.  Meanwhile, by trying to stay on their feet, people might be curtailing activities because of increased fatigue, or concerns about stumbling or falling.    “One of our challenges is that the wheelchair is used to symbolize disability,” said physical therapist Jean Minkel (Independence Care System. New York). “The wheelchair should not be considered a failure of therapy.”   Dr. Iezzoni heartily agrees. “When I finally started using a wheelchair 14 years after my first MS symptom, it was like spring after a housebound winter,” she said. “Silliness – that I was afraid people wouldn’t think I was strong because I was using a wheelchair.” Ms. Jackson agreed. “I’m learning to navigate a new normal,” she said. “My goal when I meet you is to have my chair disappear in 10 minutes, so that you only see me!”   Evaluating the home environment is key to determining the type of mobility device needed. “A picture is worth a thousand words and a home visit is a narrative,” said Ms. Minkel.  “To understand the need, we need to see the environment. For example, show me what the front door looks like.”   The wheeled device is not the only crucial factor – so is choosing the proper cushion to sit on. Some cushions can relieve pressure, thus preventing pressure sores (sites of damaged skin that can cause serious infections). “Thirty percent of our clients are at risk for pressure sores,” said Minkel. “Only two percent get them because they have pressure-relieving wheelchair cushions.”   The National MS Society provides guidance for and to navigate the process of choosing and obtaining coverage for a wheeled device.     Participants considered other key issues related to the advanced care needs of people with MS, naming some difficult problems and suggesting solutions. “Respiratory dysfunction begins very early in the disease process,” noted physical therapist Donna Fry, PhD (University of Michigan-Flint). But, she said, respiratory exercises can improve strength in respiratory muscles even late in the disease. Dr. Fry’s team has shown these improvements using “threshold inspiratory muscle trainers,” inexpensive devices that can help breathing muscles to get stronger. “Most clinicians are not aware of the potential early involvement of the respiratory system in people with MS and of accessible, inexpensive equipment that can enhance muscle strength,” she added. “Quite a few people with MS are experiencing significant problems from spasticity,” said neurologist Francois Bethoux, MD (Cleveland Clinic). Spasticity may be as mild as the feeling of tightness of muscles or may be so severe as to produce painful, uncontrollable spasms in the extremities, usually the legs. Dr. Bethoux believes spasticity can often be managed without specialized care. “Optimal care would involve an early diagnosis, setting realistic goals, and re-evaluation,” he said. Plus, stretching is vital, even if mobility is impaired. The Society provides guidelines for people with MS on stretching with a helper. “We all swallow 400-500 times a day, often without knowing,” said speech-language pathologist Alex Burnham (The Boston Home). “But 30-40% of people with MS can have problems with swallowing.” The consequences can be serious – breathing in food or fluids, choking, malnutrition, dehydration, and not taking medicine. Especially later in the disease, says Mr. Burnham, swallowing and feeding issues can have dramatic effects on quality of life, especially if it limits enjoying a meal with friends and family or prevents someone from eating favorite, culturally-significant foods. Mr. Burnham advocated for screening for these problems during regular visits. “Ask patients, have you had any trouble eating? Swallowing your pills?” Burnham also mentioned novel therapies that may prove helpful, such as the “free water protocol,” in which patients are allowed to have water by itself to improve hydration. Another method is neuromuscular electrical stimulation, applied in low doses to the neck.  To help manage swallowing problems early, the Society provides , as well as . Swallowing disorders can occur hand-in-hand with speech difficulties. “It’s never too early to start thinking about assistive technology, especially for people with a wide fluctuation of symptoms,” noted Mr. Burnham. “They might be fine in the morning, but then if they don’t get a nap, fatigue makes it hard for them to speak intelligibly later in the day.” Give people with MS an opportunity to use as many different modes of communication as possible, he advised. “Miscommunication can lead to frustration, social isolation, and a loss of independence,” said Mr. Burnham. “Maintaining any form of communication is critical for empowerment, relationships, and appropriate disease management.”  including the use of smartphone applications.  The Society also guides  healthcare providers on addressing speech problems in people with MS. – “Cognitive changes are among the most prevalent reasons that people with MS are admitted to nursing homes,” said Rosalind Kalb, PhD, Vice President, Healthcare Information and Resources at the Society. “We need to be providing strategies to help people compensate for cognitive changes, and we need to speak to family members, since families may help to pick these changes up earlier.” With mood, it’s vital to understand that although depression in common in MS, some mood changes may be a natural consequence of the process of an advancing chronic disease. “People may be grieving over changes,” said Dr. Kalb. “We need to treat depression when it is present and also be respectful and comfortable with talking with people who are not depressed about how they want to live the rest of their lives.” Learn more about strategies for dealing with cognitive changes, and about coping with the emotional changes that accompany life with MS The group discussed how to achieve optimal care for people with advanced MS.  Nicholas LaRocca, PhD, Vice President of Healthcare Delivery and Policy at the Society, noted that health care concerns are changing as the MS population gets older. “The average age of people with MS has increased by over 30 years since 1984,” he said. “Coexisting conditions, such as hypertension, increase with age and appear to be increasing in MS. Furthermore, people with MS who have some of these conditions at diagnosis reach the most severe level of mobility impairment faster than those who don’t.”   The group agreed that education is needed on both ends of this spectrum. Primary care providers need to be educated about MS so that they can distinguish MS symptoms from conditions that require primary care. And people with MS need to be educated about the importance of watching out for their own health. “A person with a disability still needs their cholesterol checked,” said Ms. Minkel. ”They still need their blood pressure checked.” Neurologists and primary care providers need to communicate, collaborate and coordinate their care of a person with MS.   Early and ongoing evaluation of symptoms also is key. “We need to educate people with MS and their caregivers about advocating for chronic care issues,” said Ruth Whitham, MD (Oregon Health& Science University). “Perhaps we can develop an advanced MS care checklist that would include symptoms to think about and what to do if you notice them.” The goal is to help people with MS to advocate for early and ongoing assessment, and for healthcare providers to ask routinely about changes that may be occurring throughout all bodily systems. Importantly, people with MS need to know they have the right to advocate for care, regardless of how advanced their MS. “We don’t ever want a person to hear, ‘There’s nothing more we can do for you,’” added Dr. Kalb.   , , and   Speakers paid careful attention to how advanced care needs can affect caregivers. “Families can become isolated,” said psychologist David Rintel, EdD, whose father lived with MS. “You feel pretty different from everyone else, and that isolation is harmful to your physical and mental health.” He advised that healthcare providers should see the caregiver occasionally along with the patient, if the patient grants permission, to get their perspective, and also see how the caregiver themselves are doing. “We need to learn the signs of burnout, such as depression, and increased use of alcohol,” he said. “Caregiver burden is real.”   There also is much that a caregiver needs to learn – navigating the healthcare system, how to transfer people safely, and management of bladder and bowel problems. “Dealing with bowel/bladder issues is actually a leading cause of caregiver burnout,” added nurse Cindy Walsh (The Boston Home).    “Families have to learn how to ask for help,” said Dr. Rintel. “They have to ask in a way where they say what, where, when and how long. Most people would help if they understood specifically what you need.”   Learn how to manage caring for a loved one with MS and advanced care needs   The group identified the highest priority research questions that need to be answered concerning the care and support of people with advanced care needs and their families, pinpointing questions in the areas of assistive technology; comorbidities and primary care; health care system issues (e.g., insurance coverage); long-term care; symptoms and complications; skin care; speech, swallowing, and pulmonary functions; and the benefits of wellness/lifestyle interventions. They are now formulating a prioritized list of these questions to help inform the Society’s next steps.   A white paper describing the meeting’s discussion highlights and recommendations regarding the Society’s response to the needs of those affected by advanced MS will be posted on the Society’s web site, and a similar paper will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.   Individuals nationwide may contact the Society’s MS Navigator® program via the Society’s toll-free help line 1-800-344-4867 (1-800-FIGHT MS) or via email (contactusNMSS@nmss.org). The MS Navigator Program connects people to resources,, helps people access optimal healthcare and understand benefits such as health insurance, face financial challenges and planning for the future, and find support when MS progresses.   Right now, MS activists are engaged on a number of fronts to improve quality of life and access to care. Among these is advancing home modification tax credit legislation, to provide financial relief for home modifications to promote safety and mobility.   The National MS Society provides support to people living with advanced MS, including care guides for families, information about symptom management, a guide to financial planning, and information on advanced directives.   The Society also provides support for healthcare professionals who are seeking to help people with MS obtain care at home, in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or adult day homes.

Improving access to treatments for people with MS is a key strategic priority for the MSIF movement. There are now many treatments that can modify the course of the disease, prevent accumulation of disability and protect the brain from damage caused by MS. Unfortunately, access to these treatments is difficult in many countries – often impossible. This is why MSIF is working with influential partner organisations to reduce the barriers to accessing treatments across the world. Access to affordable MS medications is not just an issue in lower income countries. Recent advocacy work from the National MS Society (NMSS) shows it is a critical issue in the United States too. A recent study published in the journal Neurology reports that the cost of MS drugs has doubled in the last 7 years, despite the introduction of a generic form of the widely used drug, glatiramer acetate. The academic paper is accompanied by an NMSS survey of nearly 600 people with MS showing that 40% of respondents had “altered or stopped” disease-modifying therapies for their MS due to high cost. “MS has seen remarkable treatment innovations in the last 25 years, but that progress doesn’t mean much if people with MS can’t access these innovations due to price considerations, nor should they experience the enormous challenges and choices we heard about in our survey,” Tim Coetzee, chief advocacy, services and research officer at the NMSS. Holly Ridgway, who was diagnosed with MS in 2011, said her family has struggled financially because of the cost of her medications: “We don’t go to the movies, we don’t go out to dinner. My family shouldn’t have to choose between getting me my medications and buying groceries”. As well as advocating for improved access to medicine in the US, the NMSS plays a key role in MSIF’s work to improve access worldwide.

Over 1,000 presentations covered virtually every aspect of MS research. Among these were the latest results from trials of emerging therapies, nervous system repair and rehabilitative strategies, studies furthering our understanding of progressive MS, and much more. Access research news, blogs, a Webcast, and other updates from the meeting -- including a special announcement of the first research projects launched by the international . Below are a few highlights from the many presentations focusing on stopping MS, restoring function, and ending MS forever. In most cases, studies presented are considered preliminary. Many results will be analyzed more thoroughly, and usually published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Many studies were presented related to investigational therapies moving through the development pipeline, and others explored benefits and safety of currently available therapies. – A concentrated (high-yield) formulation of Daclizumab (Biogen Idec and AbbVie) targets the immune attack in MS. More than 1,800 participants with relapsing-remitting MS received either DAC HYP injected under the skin once every four weeks, or Avonex® (interferon beta, Biogen Idec) injected once weekly, for 96 to 144 weeks. The annual relapse rate (the primary endpoint of the study) was reduced by 45% in the DAC HYP group over Avonex, and disease activity on MRI was reduced by 54%. There was no apparent reduction in progression of disability. Serious infections, skin-related adverse events, and liver enzyme abnormalities were increased in the DAC HYP group. Biogen Idec and AbbVie plan to file for marketing approval in 2015. ( the abstract.) – To test equivalence of a generic form of glatiramer acetate, a clinical trial involving 735 people with relapsing-remitting MS was conducted. GTR (generic glatiramer acetate, Synthon BV) reduced disease activity on MRI scans similarly to Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd). Participants were randomly assigned to receive GTR (20 mg/day injected under the skin), Copaxone (20 mg/day injected under the skin), or inactive placebo (injected daily under the skin) for nine months. Disease activity on MRI brain scans, the primary endpoint of the study, was equally reduced in both the Synthon GTR and the Copaxone groups. Clinical outcomes and safety/tolerability were similar as well. ( the abstract.) -- RPC1063 (Receptos, Inc.) is an investigational therapy similar to fingolimod, but which appears selective in its activity while it inhibits immune cells from entering the brain and spinal cord. In a phase 2 trial, 258 participants with relapsing MS took oral RPC1063 (.5 mg), RPC1063 (1 mg), or placebo. Results showed cumulative new, active MRI lesions were reduced by 86% in both RPC1063 arms over placebo between weeks 12 and 24 (the primary endpoint). The study was not designed to detect reductions in annual relapse rates. RPC1063 was deemed tolerable, with most common adverse events being respiratory infections, headache, and urinary tract infection. No notable heart, lung, eye problems or cancers were noted. A phase 3 study is ongoing versus interferon beta-1a. ( the abstract.) Dr. Victoria Leavitt (Manhattan Memory Center, New York) and colleagues compared the average core body temperatures (measured with an ear thermometer) of 111 people with relapsing-remitting MS to that of 85 people who did not have MS. The RR MS group had a higher average body temperature, and the researchers also reported that people with RR MS had higher body temperatures than people with secondary-progressive MS. The researchers speculate that higher temps reflect the inflammatory process in the brain, which is active in RR MS. Further research is necessary to determine whether body temperature is a useful tool for tracking the shift from RR MS to secondary-progressive MS. (Read abstracts and .) -- “Comorbidities” are medical conditions that can occur alongside MS, such as hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease. Dr. Ruth Ann Marrie (University of Manitoba) noted that these can play a role in disease progression, citing a 2010 study in which she and colleagues examined nearly 9,000 people enrolled in the , and found that these and similar conditions were associated with a substantially increased risk of disability progression. “Among people with MS, we have an opportunity to aggressively treat comorbidity and improve the course of disease,” she said. ( the abstract.) about managing MS and another condition. -- Cholesterol is an important component of myelin, the nerve insulation damaged by MS. Dr. Charlotte Teunissen (VU University Medical Center Amsterdam) reviewed the evidence that cholesterol may be a useful biomarker for MS progression, noting that high serum cholesterol is related to clinical signs of progression, such as reduced thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (in the back of the eye). Related to cholesterol is its metabolite (breakdown product) 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and its levels have been linked to brain tissue volume and also disease progression. Serum levels of this molecule change before the appearance of clinical signs in mouse models of MS. Dr. Teunissen is now funded by the international to search for such biomarkers. ( the abstract.) -- First results from a small, involving people with relapsing MS were presented by Dr. Jeffrey Cohen of the Cleveland Clinic. This was a safety trial of a strategy aimed at using people’s own stem cells taken from their bone marrow, called mesenchymal stem cells, to inhibit immune mechanisms and augment natural tissue repair processes. After the cells were grown and re-injected, the researchers reported finding no serious safety concerns or any uptick in disease activity. A larger, controlled study of this approach to test for benefits is in the planning process. ( the abstract.) -- Cell-based therapies represent a promising area of research for both slowing MS activity and for repairing the brain’s myelin that has been damaged by MS, although they are still experimental in MS. Finding good sources of and faster ways to produce them would help drive progress. One approach is to use a person’s skin or other adult cells and reprogram them to become stem cells (called “induced pluripotent stem cells”). Dr. Stefano Pluchino’s team (University of Cambridge, UK) and collaborators in Italy described a new process they successfully used to transform mouse skin cells directly into brain stem cells in only one step, rather than many steps previously required. ( the abstract.)  – Dr. Catherine Lubetzki (Salpetriere Hospital, Paris) described the chemical factors that can activate and recruit immature myelin repair cells residing in the brain (oligodendrocyte precursor cells or OPCs) to sites of MS injury. Some immune factors activate OPCs, and other proteins, such as semaphorins, guide them to where they are needed and increase myelin repair. She noted that new insights into these processes have led to lab testing of potential new myelin repair strategies which are being readied for testing in people. ( the abstract.) about research to repair the nervous system. – Dr. Laura De Giglio (Sapienza University of Rome, Italy) and team previously reported that Nintendo’s videogame “Dr. Kawashima Brain Training™” improved attention, processing speed and working memory in people with MS. Now they report that it also increased “connectivity” between areas of the brain, shown by functional MRI (which captures active images of the brain while a person is performing tasks). Further research in larger groups of people should help refine this approach for improving cognitive function in people with MS. ( the abstract.) -- Dr. Rob Motl (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and team explored the relationship between aerobic fitness and hippocampal volume in MS. The hippocampus – a region of the brain important for cognition and memory – has a role in transforming new information into long-term memory. Novel evidence showed an association between aerobic fitness and greater hippocampal volume. This work provides a stronger basis for examining aerobic exercise training as an approach for delaying or reversing shrinkage of the hippocampus in MS, which is exciting news for people with MS who struggle with memory loss. ( the abstract.) about rehabilitation research to restore function. ENDING MS – Finding and Understanding MS Risk Genes -- Dr. David Hafler (Yale University) delivered the keynote lecture on how to use risk genes as guideposts for understanding what goes wrong in MS, how to fix it, and even prevent it. He and others founded the International MS Genetics Consortium, a team that has revolutionized the study and understanding of MS genetics. He noted that there will likely be hundreds of MS risk genes uncovered. “Each by itself has a small effect on disease risk; but each interacts with the environment,” he noted. “These are not bad genes, and it’s not a bad environment – it’s a bad interaction.” ( the abstract.) -- Dr. Philip De Jager (Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston) presented the latest findings by the International MS Genetics Consortium from a National MS Society-funded study. The goal was to replicate and expand its pivotal genetics study . From cumulative studies involving over 80,000 people, Dr. De Jager announced that they have identified more than 159 genetic variations related to MS, and more importantly, have begun to identify the specific immune cells and proteins involved, and how much weight each one carries in terms of risks of developing MS. “We have created a reference map of MS susceptibility,” said Dr. De Jager. “Now we turn to the task of understanding the biology of MS susceptibility.” ( the abstract.) -- Dr. Noriko Isobe (University of California, San Francisco) and the International MS Genetic Consortium reported on how genes differ between African Americans and Caucasians with MS, following up on a . Seven novel genes were identified among African Americans with MS that were not uncovered in the larger gene scans. These results may help sort out why MS is often more severe for African Americans, and also may help identify the MS risk genes that may be most important. ( the abstract.) -- Dr. Jennifer Graves and the Network of Pediatric MS Centers reported on findings from an of what triggers MS in kids. They showed that low vitamin D status, which has been linked to MS risk, was associated with MS relapses only if kids have a specific immune gene (HLA-DRB1*15:01/03). Further research, which is underway, may shed new light on who may be helped most by vitamin D supplementation. ( the abstract.) – Because low levels of vitamin D have been linked to increased risk of developing MS, Dr. Marianna Cortese  (University of Bergen, Norway) and team wanted to know at what ages vitamin D supplements might decrease the risk of MS. They surveyed 953 people with MS and 1717 people without MS about their use of cod liver oil (a source of vitamin D) during childhood, adolescence and adulthood. They found that those who reported taking cod liver oil at ages 13-18 had nearly half the risk of developing MS compared to those who never took cod liver oil or who took it at other ages. According to this study, teen years may be the best time for vitamin D supplements to reduce the risk of developing MS. ( the abstract.) – Looking for links between dietary patterns and the risk of developing MS, Dr. Dalia Rotstein (Harvard’s Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston) and colleagues evaluated dietary habits reported by women involved in the Nurses’ Health Study (I and II), focusing in on any apparent differences between the 480 women who developed MS and those who did not. The researchers looked at five popular diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, and found that none were associated with higher or lower risk of developing MS. The need for more research on diet is one of the drivers of the National MS Society’s planned summit meeting on wellness research and programs. (the abstract.) Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

The following questions may help you better understand the different ways that APS may affect your memory. However, you should always speak with your doctor about symptoms and management of your disease. What are the common causes of cognitive dysfunction? What is the frequency of cognitive dysfunction in antiphospholipid syndrome patients? What are the mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in antiphospholipid syndrome? How do you treat cognitive dysfunction in antiphospholipid syndrome patients? How can cognitive dysfunction in antiphospholipid syndrome patients be prevented? Does antiphospholipid antibody positivity affect cognition in systemic lupus erythematosus patients? What is the next step if you think you suffer from cognition dysfunction? Antiphospholipid syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies – antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) – that “attack” the person’s own body, resulting mainly mainly blood clots (thickened blood) and/or . The three most common medical tests to detect aPL are: People who are aPL-positive, that is, those who produce aPL, may or may not develop clinical problems. Different types of clinical problems aPL-positive patients experience include: blood clots such as a deep vein thrombosis (a clot that forms in the vein usually in a leg), a pulmonary embolus (when the clot travels to the lung), or a stroke (when a clot forms in an artery) pregnancy complications such as miscarriages, early delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, or preeclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine during pregnancy) neurological problems such as cognition problems (see below for further definition) or transient ischemic attack (like a stroke but reversible within a short period) other clinical problems such as low platelet counts or heart valve disease Cognition is the brain process involved in thinking, learning, acquiring knowledge and understanding our environment. When your brain functions well, your cognitive system allows you to think, control your movements and communicate with others. These functions involve different parts of the brain. Cognitive dysfunction is a significant deficit in any or all of the brain functions, such as planning, organizing, learning, recall or speaking (verbal fluency). A patient who suffers from cognitive dysfunction can: forget different things, such as a phone number or a person’s name be disoriented in time or space, that is, does not know where he/she is, or today’s date have trouble in talking fluently, for example, may forget some words or does not use the appropriate word 3. What are the common causes of cognitive dysfunction? The most common causes of cognitive dysfunction in the general population are: progressive central nervous system disorders (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) Other potential causes of cognitive dysfunction are: infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection or meningitis environmental exposures such as carbon monoxide poisoning or solvents medications such as opioids, muscle relaxants, anxiety drugs or antiseizure drugs hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia (low or high level of blood sugar) dehydration (when the body does not have enough water) Other potential causes of cognitive dysfunction are: neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, movement disorders or brain tumor chronic conditions such as hypothyroidism diabetes mellitius, vitamin B12 deficiency chronic alcohol or substance (such as cocaine, opioids) abuse sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia) Other autoimmune disorders – such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or “lupus”), fibromyalgia, Sjogren’s, rheumatoid arthritis history of developmental disorders or learning disabilities 4) How is cognitive dysfunction generally diagnosed? There are different tests that can be used to diagnose cognitive dysfunction. Relatively quick screening tests (mental status evaluations) are based on simple questions such as patient’s name and date of birth, today’s date, or the name of the hospital. There are also quick 5- to 10-minute standardized screening measures such as the Mini Mental Status Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which can be administered and scored. More sophisticated evaluations are performed by a trained neuropsychologist and provide detailed information about the patient’s cognitive function based on their gender, age, educational level and ethnicity. These tests evaluate different cognition-related functions handled by your brain. Here are some examples: attention and concentration (ability to pay selective attention to something while ignoring other things, ability of a person to stay focused on a topic or event) learning (acquisition) and memory (delayed recall) of new information ability to understand auditory and written verbal material thinking of the names of things and verbal fluency perceptual disorders such as the ability to recognize symbols, for example, geometrical figures or country’s flags 5) What is the frequency of cognitive dysfunction in antiphospholipid syndrome patients? There are different types of cognitive dysfunction, depending on the severity of clinical manifestations. We can summarize them as: The most common form in the general population, and more commonly in elderly, is mild cognitive impairment. The frequency in the American population ranges between 7% to 25% and increases with the age. It is difficult to estimate the true frequency of cognitive dysfunction in APS patients because other conditions (listed above) can be the cause of, or contribute to, cognitive dysfunction in a person who also happens to have APS. For instance, many APS patients with cognitive dysfunction also have lupus or a history of strokes. Although the literature is limited, studies report the frequency of cognitive dysfunction, defined as significant deficits in any or all of the cognitive functions regardless of severity, as 20% to 80% in aPL-positive patients. Based on these studies, we estimate the frequency of cognitive dysfunction in different subgroups of aPL-positive patients as: patients with positive aPL but without APS/lupus: 20% to 40% lupus patients with positive aPL only or APS: 20% to 55% 6) What are the mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in antiphospholipid syndrome? Blood clots – such as stroke or multiple small blood clots – can deprive the brain of oxygen, which can cause damage to brain cells in the form of lesions. Eventually, these lesions can cause a person to have cognitive dysfunction. Other mechanisms, independent of blood clots, include: Impairment of the blood-brain barrier (a semipermeable membrane that separates the blood from the brain’s fluid and which functions as a barrier to the passage of cells, particles and large molecules into the brain) caused by aPL. This can result in antiphospholipid antibodies and other substances to pass into the brain and bind to the brain cells. For example, when aPL are injected in mices brains, the animals display impaired motor coordination as well as hyperactivity that manifests as increased stair-climbing). Direct aPL interference with the function of brain cells. Psychological and behavioral factors associated with having APS (such as depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue). 7) How do you treat cognitive dysfunction in antiphospholipid syndrome patients? Treatment of cognitive dysfunction in APS patient is not yet well established. Firstly, we have to make sure that the cognitive dysfunction is due to APS, and that all the treatable causes are excluded. Secondly, symptoms may be ameliorated by cognitive behavioral therapy. The goal here is to adapt a patient’s behavior to manage daily tasks in which memory is used. Behavioral therapy is tailored based on the patient’s symptoms, helping patient identify problems better, and finding a way to face them. Exercises, intellectual stimulations, diet, improving the sleep quality, and social interaction can also improve the cognitive function (further discussed below). Mindfulness (meditation activities) may also be useful particularly for attention and concentration problems. Blood thinners can treat and prevent blood clots in APS patients but are not helpful in treating cognitive dysfunction. A small-scale study showed that Rituximab, a drug used to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis may improve some aPL-related clinical problems, including cognitive dysfunction. More specifically, improvement in attention, visuomotor speed (that is, the speed of coordination of movement and visual perception by the brain), and flexibility was noted in a small number of APS patients with cognitive dysfunction. It should be noted that these results must be confirmed by a large-scale controlled studies. 8) How can cognitive dysfunction in antiphospholipid syndrome patients be prevented? Correcting risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity has considerable impact on reducing the risk of cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, several preventive factors have been identified for cognitive dysfunction in general, which include: The most important individual factor): Low level of education is correlated with a higher risk of developing cognitive dysfunction. Those who keep stimulating their brain by mental exercises (such as crossword or Sudoku puzzles), learning a new language, or going out with their families and friends (instead of staying home watching TV) have the lowest risk of developing cognitive dysfunction. Benefits of physical exercise are well known for cognitive functions and general health. According to the Lancet Commission (2017), there is an inverse relationship between physical activity and the risk of developing a severe cognitive impairment. The benefits fluctuate depending on the type of physical exercises. In addition, the National Academics 2017 recommend physical exercise to decrease or delay cognitive dysfunction. Physical exercise also decreases the risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, which are important risk factors of cognitive dysfunction. A real connection between diet and the risk of developing cognitive dysfunction exists. A balanced diet is recommended for all patients (that is, eating less meat and more fruits and vegetables, dried fruits and nuts). However, some vitamins such as Vitamin B12 or Vitamin B9 (folic acid) have a positive impact on prevention cognitive dysfunction, especially for patients with a high blood level of homocysteine. Social interaction can prevent cognitive dysfunction. Isolation and loneliness have negative impacts on cognitive function. There are different theories for this connection. One theory is that loneliness can decrease sleep quality, increase the risk of depression, and eventually increase the risk of cognitive dysfunction. Sleep plays a crucial role in consolidating memory and eliminating toxic substances produced by the brain. Some studies have reported that bad sleep quality leads to significant metabolic and inflammatory changes in our body, and are related to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and cognition problems. 9) Does antiphospholipid antibody positivity affect cognition in systemic lupus erythematosus patients? Cognitive dysfunction in lupus patients can develop independent of aPL. However, aPL positivity is more frequent in lupus patients with cognitive dysfunction, compared to those without cognitive dysfunction. 10) What is the next step if you think you suffer from cognition dysfunction? You are forgetting your medications or important meetings or appointments. It is hard for you to handle a conversation, such as understanding what people are saying or responding to questions. You have trouble recognizing faces or remembering names of familiar people. You are having difficulty solving simple problems or organizing activities. You are getting lost when driving or walking even in familiar places. Your doctor will investigate the reversible causes of cognitive dysfunction and, if needed, order a neuropsychological tests.

b228bbba-c5db-4a25-9d1b-c3b0546daea8,"Which Are the Safest (and Least Safe) MS Drugs on the Market? — A new comprehensive report on the safety of MS drugs may have doctors rethinking their recommendations. The results are in, and according to a comparing the safety records of all multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs on the market, Tecfidera took the top safety prize. The report reveals that newer MS drugs received high marks for safety, while older interferon drugs had more reported side effects. California-based health informatics company analyzed side effects data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The FDA asks that doctors, consumers, and drugmakers report any serious negative health events they or their patients experience while taking an FDA-approved drug. Using a formula called the “reporting odds ratio” (ROR), analysts compare how often an adverse event (AE) has been reported, regardless of drug, to how often the event has been reported for a specific drug in the FAERS database. This helps safety professionals identify AE and drug pairs with a higher than usual occurrence of a particular side effect, sending up a red flag. Because the ROR is a ratio that is not affected by length of time a drug has been on the market, the analysts at AdverseEvents were able to compare the oldest MS drugs with the newest and compile accurate results, giving each drug an “RxScore.” So, comparing the AEs reported for all MS drugs only during the time period since Tecfidera won approval did not affect the outcome, said Keith Hoffman, Vice President of Scientific Affairs at AdverseEvents, in an interview with Healthline. “We have completed that time comparison with other drug classes many times and the overall results stayed the same.” The RxScore scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a greater risk of adverse events. Avonex, Rebif and Betaseron, all interferons, had the worst safety records, with scores between 53 and 55. Copaxone had the fourth highest score at 47.4. Betaseron had the highest ratio for reports of disability or death, while Avonex users were hospitalized due to AEs the most often. People taking Avonex reported more malignant tumors, breast cancer diagnoses, and flu-like symptoms than those taking other drugs, while Betaseron users reported more heart attacks, bacterial infections, and liver problems. Rebif received the worst RxScore, with a higher proportion of negative events including suicidal behavior, optic nerve inflammation, and cancers of the female reproductive system. Copaxone fared worst for life-threatening allergic reactions and psychiatric symptoms. But Copaxone, FDA-approved in 1996, scored best on measures of several side effects, including cognitive disorders and flu-like symptoms, making it the safest of the older first-line MS drugs. Tecfidera attained the lowest RxScore of 33 and the lowest ROR of life-threatening events, hospitalizations, disability, or death. It also scored lowest for everything from bacterial infections to optic nerve disorders and liver problems. Overall, Tecfidera had the lowest ROR for 24 out of the 58 side effects the researchers studied. Gilenya scored second best at 39.4, but users had more cardiac-related AEs, including lowered heart rate, and the drug also scored the worst for vision disorders and skin cancers. Gilenya, FDA-approved in 2010, did not hold the lowest score for any reported AEs. Aubagio, with the same RxScore as Gilenya, had the highest number of reports of diarrhea, but that’s the only side effect for which it scored the highest, making it among the safest of the MS therapies. Tysabri scored relatively well but had the highest ROR for cognitive disorders, JC virus positive tests, and secondary progressive MS. The report also concluded that the relationship between Tysabri and primary multifocaleukoencephalothopy, or PML, a rare and deadly brain infection, was confirmed. Extavia had the worst safety score of any of the new MS drugs at 44.9, and users suffered the most depression, falls, headaches, and injection site reactions. Understand the JC Virus and the Risks for MS Patients » The FAERS database only examines side effects, not effectiveness. And it cannot predict side effects that may emerge over time. “We are limited by what is recorded into FAERS,” Hoffman points out. “If a safety concern takes years to manifest after a drug’s approval we will not see those reports until they are filed.” Although this report is an effective tool for neurologists recommending drugs to their patients, doctors must also consider each drug’s effectiveness. Does it have a track record for reducing relapses, preventing disability, or protecting neurons? Weighing the risks and benefits is a crucial process when selecting a drug for an MS patient. And everyone’s MS experience is different. Nobody will have all of the reported side effects—or all of the benefits.

989f887f-2454-437a-bbeb-749abb921d96,"The FDA has approved Vumerity, a new drug to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Experts say Vumerity is effective and has fewer side effects than current medications. Biogen has set the annual price of Vumerity at $88,000, drawing criticism from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Biogen has released the annual price it will charge for a new oral treatment for relapsing forms of . The company said the price for Vumerity will be $88,000 per year. The company sent a statement to Healthline saying it is taking steps to make sure the drug is affordable for customers. “Biogen will work to maximize patient access to Vumerity through their insurance benefits, including potential value-based agreements with payers based on real-world patient outcomes,” the statement read. Biogen and Alkermes plc the approval of by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late October, making it the 18th FDA-approved treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The announced price tag brought quick criticism from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “Vumerity is an efficacious and tolerable treatment option for people with relapsing MS, but being priced only $500 lower than the least expensive oral disease modifying treatment does not show the commitment to affordable access that we had hoped,” Bari Talente, executive vice president, advocacy, National MS Society, said in a . She noted the price of Tecfidera, another Biogen treatment for MS, has risen $40,000 to almost $95,000 since it debuted in 2013. “We urge Biogen to publicly commit to keeping price increases lower than the rate of inflation,” Talente said. Vumerity is expected to be similar in results to but with fewer side effects. “Both drugs use a unique mechanism of action that is not offered by other treatments,” , a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center in Maryland and the vice president of healthcare access for , told Healthline. Past has shown that Tecfidera has success on multiple sclerosis with a 53 percent reduction of relapses, 38 percent reduction in the likelihood of disability progression, and 90 percent reduction on active contrast MRI lesions. However, “Tecfidera has bad side effects, especially in the beginning,” noted Costello. “Vumerity is different and has less gastrointestinal problems.” Costello explained that people with uncomfortable side effects may not adhere to a treatment. Considered a follow-up drug to Tecfidera, doctors predict better adherence with Vumerity due to the fewer side effects. The active ingredient in Vumerity is diroximel fumarate, which is rapidly converted to monomethyl fumarate in the body. Tecfidera is a dimethyl fumarate and also converts to monomethyl fumarate. “[The drugs] become identical in what they do in the body. But, how they get there is different,” explained Costello. “We expect Vumerity to provide the same benefits as Tecfidera, but we are waiting [on] results,” , neurologist at Missouri Baptist Medical Center in St. Louis, a trial site for the EVOLVE-MS study, told Healthline. Singer is also the director and founder of . “The research I presented at ECTRIMS in September 2019 showed approximately 30 percent of those on Vumerity had gastrointestinal side effects but less than 1 percent discontinue due to this side effect,” Singer told Healthline. “The full results from the EVOLVE-MS trials are pending.” Vumerity is approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS, and active secondary progressive MS. It’s not approved for primary progressive or secondary progressive MS that’s not active. But, “it may work for other forms of MS,” said Costello. “We want the DMTs to be a positive experience,” Singer said. “Vumerity provides another option for MS.” The drug’s warning label does include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) as a possible risk. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy. Gastrointestinal issues are common but not to the extent with Tecfidera. Other warnings are allergies, liver damage, and low white blood cell count. “There are very rare cases of PML with Tecfidera in MS patients with very low lymphocytes (white blood cell type) for numerous months in patients over age 50. Simple blood counts should be done to monitor,” said Singer. “The goal with Vumerity is to achieve success of Tecfidera with better tolerability,” explained Singer. Biogen offers customer-assisted programs to help reduce or eliminate costs. Costello explained that both Tecfidera and Vumerity have a unique mechanism of action, unlike any other drug. This provides people with options and different ways to reduce inflammation with MS. Treatment choices are up to doctors and their patients making a shared decision. Costello suggests talking about goals, risk tolerance, monitoring, and your ability to adhere to a specific treatment. “The disease, plus the person’s goals and values, is the conversation that drives the medication choice,” said Costello.

2098dd21-a88a-4c70-a492-b8d41dc0ac32,"What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting For more than three decades, multiple sclerosis (MS) experts from around the world have gathered in a European city each fall to share the results of their research at the annual meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). This year’s gathering was held in Berlin, Germany, October 10-12, where the findings were presented from hundreds of studies on topics ranging from the safety and effectiveness of investigational medications to the role of diet in controlling symptoms of MS. Along with the annual meetings of organizations such as the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), the ECTRIMS meeting is an important forum for researchers and clinicians to compare notes, generate hypotheses, make plans for future research, and discuss how best to translate study findings into improved patient care. This ECTRIMS 2018 research update article highlights more than 30 studies with important implications for people with MS. While these studies represent only a small sampling of the research presented at ECTRIMS, they were selected for their relevance to the current and potential near-term management of MS, and with a view toward addressing a variety of topics. Accordingly, the study findings reported below are organized into eight categories: We hope this information will be of interest and value. For additional information about MS, symptoms, and symptom management, as well as MSAA’s programs and services, please visit or call . Questions for MSAA’s Client Services department may be emailed to . And as always, please note that your healthcare provider remains your best source of information on the medical and overall management of your MS, and should be consulted with any questions you may have or before making any changes to a treatment regimen or other aspects of your approach to living with MS. For readers who are not familiar with study protocol, to follow is a helpful listing that provides a brief explanation of the different clinical trial phases. Phase I studies are primarily concerned with assessing the drug’s safety. This initial phase of testing in humans is done in a small number of healthy volunteers, and is designed to determine what happens to the drug in the human body – how it is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. Once a drug has been shown to be safe, it must be tested for efficacy. This second phase of testing may last from several months to two years, and involve up to several hundred patients. Phase II studies are often “double-blinded,” meaning that the participants, medical staff, and investigators are not told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo. In a Phase III study, a drug is usually tested in several hundred to several thousand patients, usually in multiple medical facilities around the world. Phase III studies typically last two or more years. Only after a Phase III study is successfully completed can a pharmaceutical company request FDA approval for marketing the drug. Phase IV clinical trials are conducted after a drug has been approved. Participants are enrolled to further monitor safety and side effects, while evaluating long-term efficacy. Ongoing decline in relapse rate seen in long-term study of Gilenya People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who took Gilenya (fingolimod) for five years or more had low rates of disease activity during that period, with gradually decreasing relapse rates, researchers reported. The investigators drew on data from LONGTERMS, an open-label, single-arm, extension study assessing the ongoing safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 0.5 mg of Gilenya in RRMS patients who had participated in earlier clinical trials of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT). The LONGTERMS study evaluated 754 patients. Sixty-seven percent of study subjects were women, and the mean time since MS diagnosis was 4.8 years. The annualized relapse rate in the population declined from 0.26 at one year to 0.16 at five years and to 0.14 for those patients for whom data were available at the 10-year mark. Of the 697 patients for whom five-year data was available, 78 percent were free from confirmed disability progression in the six months prior to assessment. The most common adverse events reported were viral upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and hypertension. The most common serious adverse events were MS relapse, basal cell carcinoma, and pneumonia.  Charting rise in treatment-satisfaction scores with switch to Aubagio Patients switching to Aubagio (teriflunomide) from other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) showed improvements in treatment satisfaction up to 96 weeks after switching, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Phase III TENERE study extension and the non-interventional TAURUS-MS I study. Both studies employed the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), which was administered at baseline and every 24 weeks thereafter in the TENERE extension study, and at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 in TAURUS-MS I. More than 650 patients from the two studies switched to 14 mg/day of Aubagio after having been on other DMTs. From baseline (initiation of Aubagio) to week 96, Global Satisfaction scores increased for patients from both studies. The average change from baseline was 9.1 in TENERE and 15.3 in TAURUS-MS I, with both changes being statistically significant. Tecfidera altered composition of gut microbiome in 12-week study  Tecfidera (delayed-release dimethyl fumarate) altered the gut microbiome in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who took the oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) over 12 weeks. The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other microbes found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system. Recent research suggests that the composition of the microbiome, as defined by the presence and number of various microbes, may affect the course of MS. In a study involving 36 patients with RRMS, 17 types of microbes were significantly altered in MS patients compared with 165 healthy controls. In particular, people with MS had lower levels of compared to the healthy controls. Twenty-seven of the study participants received Tecfidera, while nine received an injectable DMT. At two weeks, subjects receiving Tecfidera reported a worsening of GI symptoms compared to baseline, but this impact on symptoms was not seen at 12 weeks. Meanwhile, at 12 weeks, the Tecfidera patients had an increased abundance of . Similar alterations were not seen in the participants receiving an injectable DMT. Researchers continue to investigate not only the role of the gut microbiome in MS, but also the impact that individual microbes may have on disease course. As those investigations continue, this study adds to the understanding of the interplay between MS medications and the composition of the microbiome. As the investigators note, “It could therefore be speculated that direct effects on the gut microbiome are part of the therapeutic actions” of Tecfidera. Exploring treatment outcomes in African Americans relative to Caucasian Americans Do treatment outcomes on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) differ between African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CA)? A team of researchers posed that question in the context of the widely held view that African Americans often have a more aggressive form of MS than Caucasian Americans, and therefore may require more efficacious therapies.   To find answers, those investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of the CombiRx study, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated combined use of interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate in relapsing-remitting MS. The CombiRx study followed patients for three years. Eighty-eight percent of the study’s 1,008 patients identified as Caucasian Americans, and 7 percent identified as African Americans. At the start of the study, the AA participants had worse disability and a higher total burden of brain/spine lesions than CA participants. Once on treatment, however, there was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. While that finding is welcome news, the researchers noted that there is a need to study larger numbers of African-American patients to further explore the relative efficacy of DMTs in the AA and CA populations. They added that research into the causes of disparity in disease burden prior to treatment also is warranted. Support for early initiation of Betaseron in clinically isolated syndrome Starting Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) sooner rather than later in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) yields benefits up to 15 years after initiation of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), researchers report. Investigators in the BENEFIT 15 study monitored long-term outcomes in people who had CIS and at least two lesions on MRI that were suggestive of MS. In an earlier, related study, those individuals were randomly assigned to receive Betaseron (early-treatment group) or placebo. After either two years or conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS), patients in the placebo group were offered Betaseron (delayed-treatment group). Of the 468 participants who had been randomized in the initial study, 261 enrolled in a follow-up study 15 years later. One hundred and sixty one were in the early-treatment group and 100 were in the delayed-treatment group. In the delayed-treatment group, Betaseron had been initiated an average 1.5 years after randomization. The annualized relapse rate in the full analysis set was 0.18 over 15 years. Notably, however, the risk of relapse in the early-treatment group was 19-percent lower than in the delayed-treatment group, and the risk for conversion to clinically definite MS by Year 15 was 31-percent lower. The researchers concluded that their results “support a sustained benefit of early intervention in reducing the risk of relapse and conversion to CDMS.” Tracking the efficacy of interferon beta-1a for up to 10 years With many people with MS now on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for several years, there is an increasing focus on the long-term safety and effectiveness of those medications. Researchers recently evaluated the ongoing efficacy of one of the first DMTs, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, in 1,240 individuals receiving care at four MS centers throughout Italy. (In the United States, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a is available as Rebif.) The primary endpoint of their study was the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) as measured by clinical relapse, confirmed disability progression, and MRI for brain/spine lesions. Seventy-one percent of the study participants were women, and the participants’ mean age at the start of treatment was 34.6 years. The patients were followed for an average of approximately 7.5 years. Seventy-four percent of patients remained on treatment at two-year follow-up, just under half were still on therapy at the 5-year mark, and 28 percent were on the medication after 10 years of follow-up. At two years, 44 percent of patients did not have evidence of disease activity, while 25 percent were free of disease activity at five years and 19 percent were at 10 years. The researchers concluded that those percentages constitute “further evidence of sustained interferon beta-1a efficacy in modifying the natural course of MS.” Plegridy use in real-world setting consistent with clinical trial findings A post-approval, real-world analysis of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) in 963 patients with relapsing-remitting MS yielded safety and efficacy findings consistent with those from the pre-approval clinical trials of the DMT. The interim analysis from the Plegridy Observational Program included data on 242 newly diagnosed individuals and 721 people who had been diagnosed one year or longer before study entry. The newly diagnosed (ND) patients generally were younger than their non-newly diagnosed (NND) counterparts (mean age 37.7 years versus 46.0 years) and had less disability, but had experienced more relapses in the prior year. Treatment discontinuation rates were similar for the two groups (31 percent for ND patients versus 32 percent for NND patients). The most commonly cited reasons for treatment discontinuation in both groups were adverse effects and lack of efficacy. The most frequently reported adverse effects were redness at the injection site and influenza-like illness. Eighty-two percent of newly diagnosed individuals and 85 percent of those who were non-newly diagnosed were relapse-free up to two years after starting Plegridy.   Glatiramer acetate slows disability progression for up to 10 years Glatiramer acetate, which is marketed as Copaxone and in generic formulations, including Glatopa, showed enduring benefit over the course of 10 years of therapy, making it a cost-effective option for long-term treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, according to British investigators. The researchers drew on clinical data and cost-effectiveness models to assess the impact of glatiramer acetate (GA) on patient health and health-system economics. The analysis included 752 people treated with GA and another 898 people with MS who were not treated. The investigators found that, relative to no treatment, GA use led to a 17-percent reduction in disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Further, among people treated with GA, there was only a 1.2-percent difference in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores in six-year and 10-year data. The study’s authors concluded that the 10-year analysis “continues to support the long-term efficacy of GA in terms of disability, based on EDSS, and utility with no apparent evidence of a waning in treatment effect” making it highly cost-effective based on prevailing prices in the United Kingdom.   Reductions in relapse rate, MRI disease activity after three-to-five years of Ocrevus Two studies of people with relapsing-remitting MS show that use of the disease modifying therapy (DMT) Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) for three-to-five years is associated with reductions in annualized relapse rate (ARR) and several MRI measures of disease activity, according to researchers. The studies followed patients who had participated in the Phase III OPERA I and OPERA II trials that led to FDA approval of Ocrevus. In those 96-week studies, patients were randomized to receive either Ocrevus or interferon beta-1a. Upon completion of the Phase III trials, patients were able to enter an open-label extension study in which they would either continue on Ocrevus, if they had been assigned to receive that medication initially, or switch from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus if they had been in the comparator group. Among those who received Ocrevus during the initial two-year trial and for three years afterwards in the open-label extension, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) declined from 0.13 in the year before the open-label extension to 0.07 at Year 3 of the extension (or five years, in total, from starting Ocrevus). For individuals who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the ARR decreased from 0.20 in the year before switching to 0.07 at three years post-switch. At five-year follow-up, the proportion of people with clinically defined disability progression was lower in those who had been on Ocrevus for five years than for those who had taken the medication for three years. Meanwhile, in people who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the adjusted number of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI was 0.48 lesions/scan prior to switching medications, and decreased to rates of 0.007, 0.004, and 0.004 after one, two, and three years, respectively, on Ocrevus. Individuals on Ocrevus for the full five-year period maintained low numbers of lesions on MRI. Compared to patients who started Ocrevus after two years on interferon beta-1a, those treated with Ocrevus from the outset had less brain atrophy as measured by whole brain volume, grey matter volume, and white matter volume on MRI. No MRI disease activity in most study subjects after six years on Lemtrada Most people with relapsing-remitting MS who began therapy with Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) after having received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in a clinical trial were free of MRI indications of disease activity six years after switching medications, researchers reported. The TOPAZ trial followed 143 patients who initially had received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in the Phase III CARE-MS study. These individuals entered an initial extension study in which they switched to Lemtrada, which was given in doses of 12 mg/day for five days at baseline, and then 12 mg/day for three days 12 months or more later. The participants were then eligible to enter TOPAZ, an additional five-year extension study. In TOPAZ, investigators had the option of giving these patients additional courses of alemtuzumab or another disease-modifying therapy as they thought necessary. Eighty-two percent of the participating patients completed Year 2 of TOPAZ (Year 6 after starting Lemtrada). Fifty-seven percent did not receive an additional dose of Lemtrada or another DMT during those six years. The annualized relapse rate at Year 6 after Lemtrada initiation was 0.19 percent. Further, 69 percent of patients were free of MRI disease activity, and 89 percent did not have new gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Meanwhile, safety results were consistent with those seen in Lemtrada-treated patients in the initial CARE-2 study and its two-year extension. Overall, researchers noted, Lemtrada improved clinical and imaging outcomes in patients who switched to the medication after receiving subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, and those improvements were sustained over six years in the absence of further treatment. Assessing the long-term safety and effectiveness of Tysabri An analysis of more than 6,100 people with relapsing-remitting MS who have taken Tysabri (natalizumab) for several years shows the long-term effectiveness of the medication and indicates that its safety profile remains consistent with ongoing use, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to characterize the Tysabri patient population and assess the medication’s impact on relapses and other measures of MS activity. At the time of the analysis, the program included 6,149 participants. Their median exposure to Tysabri was 38 doses, and median follow-up time was slightly over five years. Fifty-two percent of patients had discontinued the medication. The patients’ annualized relapse rate declined by 89 percent while on Tysabri, from 1.99 prior to starting the medication to 0.21. The greatest reduction was seen in the approximately 10 percent of patients who had not taken another disease-modifying therapy (DMT), but those who had taken one or two prior DMTs saw ARR reductions of 93 percent and 87 percent, respectively. Fourteen percent of these individuals experienced at least one serious adverse effect, with infections/infestations being the most commonly reported issues.   Evobrutinib shows favorable impact on lesion count, relapse rates Evobrutinib, or M2951, is an orally administered compound being investigated as a potential treatment for immune-mediated diseases including MS, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Evobrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the development and function of immune cells, including B lymphocytes and macrophages. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers announced 24-week results of a double-blind, randomized, 48-week, Phase II study of evobrutinib in patients aged 18 to 65 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) with relapses. In the study, 267 participants were randomized to receive evobrutinib 25 mg daily, 75 mg daily, 75 mg twice daily, placebo, or open-label Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate 240 mg twice-daily. (The Tecfidera group served as a reference arm in the study, and no formal comparisons were made between people in that group and those receiving evobrutinib or placebo.) The study’s primary endpoint was the sum of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 24 weeks was a key secondary endpoint, as were safety assessments. The primary analysis comparing the evobrutinib groups to the placebo group was planned to occur when all randomized patients either reached 24 weeks of treatment or had discontinued the study before that point. Ninety-one percent of patients completed 24 weeks of therapy. The study met its primary endpoint, with patients in the evobrutinib 75-mg once-daily and 75-mg twice-daily groups having significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions than placebo patients at each time point studied. For weeks 12-24, the mean total of such lesions was 3.85 in the placebo group, 4.06 in the evobrutinib 25 mg once-daily group, 1.69 in the evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily group, and 1.15 in the evobrutinib 75 mg twice-daily group. The evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily and 75 mg twice-daily groups also had greater reductions in the ARR than placebo. No treatment-associated infections or significant reductions in lymphocyte counts were observed in those receiving evobrutinib. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in more than 5 percent of patients, included increased liver-enzyme levels in patients receiving 75 mg of evobrutinib twice daily, but these changes were reversible and did not cause symptoms. French study details impact of biotin on disability measure, walking speed   Biotin is a vitamin involved in energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, including the activation of an enzyme in myelin synthesis. In the MS-SPI study, a high-dose, pharmaceutical-grade biotin known as MD1003 reversed MS-related disease disability in 13 percent of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). To assess the efficacy and safety of MD1003 in a real-world setting, as opposed to in a clinical trial such as MS-SPI, researchers monitored outcomes in primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients at a clinic in France. From January 2016 through May 2018, 220 individuals with progressive MS who were receiving care at the clinic in Toulouse, France, received 300 mg/day of the oral medication. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented data on the first 91 patients to complete one year of follow-up. Those patients’ mean age at baseline was 59.5 years. Sixty-two percent were females, and 70 percent had SPMS. The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline was 5.9, and their mean timed 25-foot walk time was 50.7 seconds. At the end of one year of treatment with MD1003, 23 percent of the participants had an improvement in their EDSS score and 23 percent had a 20 percent or greater improvement in the time it took them to walk 25 feet. During the one-year period, 11 percent of patients had active disease, such as a clinically defined relapse, a gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesion on MRI, or both. Researchers said, “This real-world study supports the growing body of evidence that MD1003 is an effective and safe treatment for PMS.”  Gauging the impact of ozanimod on early and advanced relapsing-remitting MS Ozanimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulator that targets two cell-surface receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5, suspected of playing a role in multiple sclerosis. The agent was evaluated in two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. In SUNBEAM, individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) received ozanimod on a daily basis (either ozanimod HCl 1 mg or 0.5 mg) or a weekly injection of interferon beta-1a for 12 months or longer. In RADIANCE, the participants were randomized to the same treatments, but for 24 months. More than 2,600 people participated in the trials. A post hoc analysis presented at the 2018 ECTRIMS meeting examined how outcomes in SUNBEAM and RADIANCE differed between patients with early RRMS and advanced RRMS. The designation of early MS was based on a composite baseline profile that included three years or less from diagnosis, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤3.5, and use of one or no disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The early MS group consisted of 1,392 patients, while there were 1,267 people in the advanced MS group. Thirteen hundred and ninety-two patients were included in the early MS group. Key differences between the two groups at baseline included median years since diagnosis (0.5 years for the early group and 5.7 for the advanced group), median EDSS (2.0 versus 3.5), mean relapses within the last year (1.4 versus 1.2), and mean count of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (1.77 versus 1.67). In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) was lower in those who received ozanimod than in patients who received interferon. In the early group, the ARR was 0.149 for those on 1 mg of ozanimod HCI, 0.200 for the ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg patients, and 0.285 for the interferon group. The annualized relapse rates in the advanced RRMS group were 0.217 for ozanimod HCI 1 mg, 0.277 for ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg, and 0.363 for interferon. MRI measures of disease activity also favored ozanimod over interferon. In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, individuals receiving either dose of ozanimod had lower mean numbers of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and new/enlarging T2 lesions at 12 months than patients receiving interferon. Surveying real-world experience with treating MS with rituximab Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and several forms of cancer. Because it depletes B cells, which are key components of the immune system, some neurologists prescribe rituximab to treat MS, although it currently does not have FDA approval specifically for use in MS. Investigators at the University of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain MS Center examined the safety and effectiveness of rituximab in 125 people with MS. The participants had an average age of 44 years and had an MS disease duration of slightly more than 10 years. Seventy-two percent were female; 62 percent had relapsing-remitting MS. With an average follow-up of 40.6 months, most individuals had six or seven rituximab infusions. While on rituximab, 16 percent of participants had infections requiring an emergency department visit, and 11 percent had infections necessitating hospitalization. Thirty-seven percent of patients had an infusion reaction on their first infusion that required interrupting the infusion, but that percentage fell to 14 percent on the second infusion. None experienced an infusion reaction that required hospitalization. Two individuals (1.6 percent of the total) were diagnosed with cancer after starting rituximab. While on rituximab treatment, 5 percent of patients had a clinical relapse, 2 percent had an enhancing lesion on MRI, and – based on detailed analysis – 8 percent of those with available MRI data had a new lesion on T2 imaging. Those findings prompted the researcher to conclude that rituximab appears to be a safe and effective option for long-term MS treatment. Two trials to examine the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS Two Phase III trials will assess the safety and efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody ofatumumab relative to Aubagio (teriflunamide) in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Like Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), ofatumumab targets the CD20 marker on the surface of B cells. The identically designed ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II trials have enrolled a combined total of 1,884 patients in 37 countries. Study participants will be randomized to receive either 20 mg subcutaneous injections of ofatumumab every four weeks (following an initial regimen of three 20-mg subcutaneous doses per week in the first 14 days) or 14 mg of Aubagio taken orally once daily. Annualized rate of confirmed relapses is the primary endpoint for both trials. Secondary outcomes include confirmed disability worsening and MRI-related measures. Enrollment for both studies has been completed. Both employ an adaptive design in which study duration is not fixed over a specified period of time but rather is dependent on reaching a pre-specified number of events. Phase II study to explore impact of opicinumab in targeted population Early-phase research into investigational agents often identifies patient groups that have a better response to treatment than other patient types. That was the case in the Phase II SYNERGY study of opicinumab. Opicinumab is a human monoclonal antibody active against LINGO-1, a protein that exercises an effect on the differentiation and regeneration of central nervous system cells. SYNERGY investigated the infused medication’s safety and efficacy as an add-on therapy to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS. The study found that a patient subpopulation (defined by disease duration and baseline MRI findings) was associated with an enhanced response to treatment. The Phase II AFFINITY trial is following up on those findings by taking a closer look at the impact of opicinumab in that patient population. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers provided an overview of the AFFINITY study’s design and demographics. AFFINITY is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 750 mg of opicinumab administered intravenously every four weeks compared to placebo as an add-on to DMTs. The trial will last for 72 weeks. The population being studied encompasses people aged 18-58 years with relapsing-remitting or secondary-progressive MS who have had MS for 20 years or less and who have Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 2.0 and 6.0. Further, the study’s inclusion criteria specify a clinical relapse in the last four to 24 months or brain MRI evidence of disease activity in the past two years. Because opicinumab is being studied as an add-on therapy, patients must be stable on interferon beta, dimethyl fumarate, or natalizumab for at least six months. Further, the patients must have brain imaging findings indicative of lower myelin content and more preserved tissue integrity in brain T2 lesions. The study’s main endpoint is Overall Response Score, an integrated assessment of disability improvement and worsening based on the EDSS and other measures. The study began in September 2017, and remains open to enrollment. Study investigators noted that AFFINITY is expected to enroll approximately 240 participants at roughly 150 sites in about 25 countries. Cladribine is an oral medication approved for use in several countries for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). It is not approved for that use in the United States. The medication has an unusual dosing pattern in that it is taken for up to 20 days over the course of two years. It also has an unusual mechanism of action: it targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to a reduction in the total count of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented an update on the safety profile of Cladribine Tablets in people with RRMS who took the medication as a monotherapy (without use of other MS agents at the same time). The study assessed data from three clinical trials and a patient registry, and reported information collected through May 2017. The analysis included data on 923 patients who received cladribine at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg and 641 patients who received placebo. It focused on the incidence of adverse events per 100 patient-years. The cladribine group had an average age of 36.5 years at study enrollment; two-thirds of the cladribine patients were women. The rate of serious treatment-emergent adverse events per 100 patient years through May 2017 was 3.88 for the cladribine group and 2.24 for the placebo group. Adverse events occurring at a higher rate in the cladribine group than in the placebo group included abnormally low levels of lymphocytes (a white blood cell) and serious infections, including serious herpes zoster. Study authors concluded that the updated safety profile “was generally consistent with that from two years prior,” adding, “No new major safety findings were identified in the updated dataset, where patients were followed for up to 10 years.”  Elezanumab: Phase I trial supports the need for larger studies A small, early-stage study of a monoclonal antibody directed at a new target in MS showed the medication to be well-tolerated, but did not demonstrate a clear-cut impact on symptoms, highlighting the need for further testing in a larger population, the study’s authors said. Elezanumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa), which has been shown to inhibit key processes in neurologic regeneration and functional recovery following inflammation or trauma. A Phase I placebo-controlled, 29-week study randomized 20 people with MS to one of three treatment groups or to a placebo group. Elezanumab was administered intravenously every four weeks for a total of four doses. Patients in the three active treatment groups received an initial “loading” dose followed by maintenance doses of either 150 mg, 600 mg, or 1800 mg of elezanumab. Twenty-five percent of all participants reported headaches. Most individuals receiving elazanumab did not report a clinically significant improvement in, or worsening of, MS symptoms. However, testing showed that as levels of elezanumab in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased, levels of free soluble RGMA decreased, while total RGMA (both free and antibody-bound) increased in step with CSF elezanumab exposure. Investigators concluded that, “Additional long-term studies are required to elucidate elezanumab efficacy in a more robust patient population.” Survey results reveal people with multiple sclerosis want more information on preventing brain atrophy Cognitive changes are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting more than half of those living with the condition. A new survey examines the topic of brain volume loss, known as brain atrophy, in people with multiple sclerosis. The survey, conducted by the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) and sponsored by Celgene, included more than 1,300 people with multiple sclerosis or someone responding on their behalf. Based on the survey findings that were presented at ECTRIMS 2018, maintaining cognitive function is the second most common concern for respondents. Only the prevention of physical disability progression was reported more often (45 percent). The survey findings also suggest that there is a high level of interest in better understanding how brain atrophy may impact disease progression. Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that they have not talked to any member of their medical team about brain atrophy, and only 20 percent reported being moderately or very satisfied with the amount of information available on potential ways to prevent brain atrophy. These study results indicate that additional education on the topic of brain atrophy is an area of interest to the MS community. Global initiative seeks to improve shared decision-making and communication between healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners Navigating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a global initiative that aims to improve outcomes for people with MS through the global adoption of strategies that optimize therapeutic decision-making. This initiative also aims to improve the way that healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners communicate around benefit and risk in the management and treatment of their disease. In order to better understand the potential barriers to effective communications and shared-decision making, the Navigating MS Steering Committee developed and distributed a survey to MS healthcare professionals and people with MS to identify potential and perceived barriers to successful shared-decision making in MS practice. A total of 73 neurologists, 104 nurses, and 1,184 individuals with MS have responded to the survey. Differences in the perception of neurologists, nurses, and people with MS regarding the adequacy of resources required for successful shared-decision making was demonstrated in the data received. Four main areas of contention were identified: lack of education, resources, time, and variable involvement of the interdisciplinary (healthcare) team. Nurse respondents indicated a perceived proficiency with shared-decision making and adequacy of education and training to fulfil this role. However, 73 percent of people with MS who responded indicated a strong preference for engagement with the neurologist in discussing the benefits and risks of treatment options. There was no clear consensus regarding the degree to which decision-making is accurately a collaborative process within the interdisciplinary team. Half of the nurses stated that the decisions were shared, although people with MS reported a lot of ambiguity and variation in how actively involved they were in the decision-making process. Despite neurologists stating the main barrier to shared-decision making was lack of time, 49 percent of people with MS strongly disagreed that time was a barrier to shared-decision making, with 60 percent of nurses reporting clinic timeframes as adequate. The disagreement in perceptions among clinicians and people with MS demonstrates an ongoing need to educate both healthcare professionals and patients on best practices in adopting a shared-decision making approach to discussions around treatment decisions. The Navigation MS initiative has received funding from Biogen, Celgene, EMD Serono, Genentech, Novartis, and Sanofi Genzyme.  It might seem paradoxical that people who experience fatigue should exert themselves in order to have more energy, but that is exactly what researchers found when conducting a study of 60 individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and fatigue. The 47 females and 13 males participating in the study had an average age of 30 years and a baseline mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score of 56.7. They were divided into two groups, balanced by age, gender and FSS score. People in the first group walked on a treadmill three times a week for six weeks, with the pace increasing from easy to brisk during each session and the duration of exercise increasing from 10-15 minutes initially to 25-32 minutes by the end of the study. People in the second group did not exercise but instead received amantadine, a medication used to treat movement disorders. While the people who did not exercise had no meaningful change in their FSS scores over the 12-week course of the study, those assigned to the exercise group saw their mean FSS score improve to 35.67 (versus 56.7 for all at the start of the study) at six weeks and to further improve to 29.11 at 12 weeks. The researchers concluded, “A specially designed walking exercise program with gradual increments in time and speed for 12 weeks can improve fatigue in RRMS patients. A long-term follow-up is recommended to verify the maintained effect on such improvement.”  Securing the long-term benefits of activity in MS: “Keep going!” Is the improvement in quality of life typically seen in exercise and activity programs for people with MS sustained after those programs end? That is the question a team of investigators posed in a study of 56 women with MS. Their answer: Yes, over the short term; and no, over the long term. The women, who had an average age of 34.5 years, were divided into groups, with some assigned to exercise and others to engaging in leisure-time activities such as making crafts. The women completed surveys to measure their sleep quality, fatigue, and depression, if any, at the start of the study and at several points afterward. Women in both groups showed improvement in sleep, fatigue, and depression at the end of the study and four weeks after its conclusion. By the 20-week mark after the study, however, MS symptoms had begun to increase, leading the researchers to comment that “continuous exercising appears to be of utmost importance for keeping symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances stably low.” There is growing evidence that diet plays a role in the MS disease course, but researchers continue to debate how best to study the issue in a scientifically rigorous manner. One practical concern is whether sufficient numbers of people with MS will be able to adhere to restrictive diets long enough for studies to yield valid results. A six-month pilot study involving 36 women with MS provides encouraging news in this regard. The study assigned 18 of the women to the intervention group – and to following a restrictive, modified Mediterranean diet for six months. The women in this group participated in training sessions with a nutritionist and attended monthly meetings to assess and encourage their adherence to the diet. The other 18 participants acted as a control group; they participated in educational seminars. All 18 women in the intervention group completed the study, with a 90.3-percent mean self-reported rate of adhering to the study diet. At the time of the ECTRIMS meeting in early October, 14 of the 18 women in the control group had completed the six-month study, three more were on track to finish in the weeks just ahead, and there was only one anticipated drop out. Sixteen of the 18 women in the intervention group reported that their overall health had benefited from following the study diet, with 14 women reporting benefit in terms of specific MS symptoms. The intervention group subjects also showed greater improvement than the women in the control group on measures of fatigue and MS impact. The researchers concluded, “It is feasible to enroll MS patients into a rigorous dietary intervention study requiring significant commitment and randomization and reasonable to expect high adherence to this type of dietary program utilizing educational methods to promote adherence.” They added, “Larger-scale clinical trials to assess the role of diet for symptom management and even as a disease modifier in MS are feasible and warranted.” Exploring the impact of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet on MS The benefits of a ketogenic diet – a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan – have long been promoted by some people with MS and their physicians, while others have said that there has not been adequate research to support the approach. A recent pilot study sought to add to the knowledge base on the subject by assessing how following a ketogenic diet for six months affected 20 people with relapsing-remitting MS. Researchers reported that no subjects experienced worsening diseases – as assessed by clinical symptoms and brain MRI – while on the diet. Further, fatigue and depression scores improved from baseline, and body-mass index and insulin levels declined. While additional data is being collected, those findings prompted the investigators to conclude that ketogenic diets appear to be “safe, feasible, and well-tolerated” in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Despite the old saying, misery doesn’t actually appear to love company  The more social support a person with MS enjoys, the less pain is likely to interfere with his or her life – even as the intensity of pain increases. That is the bottom-line finding of a study involving 196 people with MS who reported experiencing pain. Study participants had an average age of almost 54 years; 82 percent were women and 18 percent were men. Researchers assessed the participants’ degree of social support, pain intensity, and pain interference at the start of the study and again after an average of roughly 3.5 years. As would be expected, as the intensity of pain changed, so did the extent to which pain caused interference in a person’s life. However, the study also found that “higher levels of perceived social support [are] associated with subsequent improvements over time in pain interference in individuals with MS and pain, even when controlling for changes in pain intensity.” In simpler language, the more friends, family members, and other meaningful relationships a person has in his or her life, the less he or she will experience interference from pain, even when the pain is intensified. Conversely, the investigators found that “lower levels of social support prospectively predict increases in pain interference.” Commenting that their findings “are consistent with other research indicating multiple health benefits from the presence of social support,” the study’s authors noted the importance of investigating means to enhance such support for people with MS who are experiencing pain. Pain and sleep issues are top reasons for cannabis-based product use in people with MS Roughly one in five people with MS surveyed by researchers at a Canadian hospital reported using cannabis-based products (CBP) on a regular basis, with pain and sleep problems as the most commonly cited reasons for use. Investigators at the University of British Columbia MS clinic distributed surveys on CBP use to 600 patients attending the clinic from January to March 2018. Two hundred and fifty-nine participants completed and returned the survey. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were female, and the most common age range of respondents was 45 to 55 years. Sixty-one percent of respondents reported never using CBP, and another 16 percent said they rarely did so. Of the remainder, 15 percent reported daily use, 4 percent said they used CBP weekly, and 3 percent said they used CBP on a monthly basis. Researchers noted that responder bias might cause overestimation of CBP use. Seventy-one percent of regular CBP users said they sought relief from pain with a cannabis-based product. Help with sleep also was cited by 71 percent of respondents. Other reported reasons for use included mood (44 percent), spasticity (40 percent), tremor (11 percent), and bladder dysfunction (9 percent). Ninety-five percent of regular users said they had obtained relief of symptoms from CBP. More than half (52 percent) had discussed their CBP use with a neurologist; 35 percent had not tried other symptomatic medications. With the increasing liberalization of state laws regarding use of cannabis-based products for both medical and recreational purposes, CBP is likely to be an increasingly accessible option for more and more people with MS. Reassurance on use of DMTs in women pursuing pregnancy “How will this medication affect my ability to conceive, and to deliver a healthy baby?” It’s a question MS clinicians hear frequently when talking with women of child-bearing age about starting a disease-modifying therapy (DMT). A recent retrospective analysis by Israeli researchers provides reassuring news with regard to this important concern. The investigators examined data on 125 women with relapsing-remitting MS who had a total of 219 live births between 2002 and 2017. They divided the women into three groups: those who were not treated with a DMT in the three months prior to becoming pregnant; those who were treated in the three months prior to pregnancy; and those who were treated during pregnancy. After adjusting for factors including age, disease severity, and known fertility problems, the researchers found that use of DMTs shortly before and during pregnancy did not affect fertility or pregnancy outcomes. They found no significant differences between women in the three groups in terms of the need for fertility treatment and time to pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, complications during pregnancy, or incidence of relapses during pregnancy or in the first year following delivery. The investigators concluded, “The decision regarding DMTs treatment in RRMS patients during child-bearing years should not be influenced by the question of pregnancy in the near future.” However, treatment discussions along with pregnancy planning should always be discussed with one’s healthcare team in advance. Additionally, none of the DMTs have been approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy and certain DMTs may present more of a risk than others. Sexual dysfunction common in women with clinically isolated syndrome   More than one-half of women with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a common precursor to MS, experience sexual dysfunction. That is the main finding of a small study in which Egyptian researchers gathered data from August 2011 to June 2017. Noting that sexual dysfunction has been reported in between 40 percent and 80 percent of women with multiple sclerosis, the investigators sought to determine the frequency of the condition in CIS. They had 43 women with CIS complete the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire (MSIQ-19), as well as instruments assessing fatigue, cognitive function, anxiety, and depression. Fifty-six percent of the women reported at least one manifestation of sexual dysfunction. Eight cited a lack of sexual interest or desire, five reported less intense orgasms, and four said they experienced inadequate vaginal lubrication. Beyond those primary aspects of sexual dysfunction, women also reported that symptoms of CIS – such as urinary and bowel problems and difficulty with concentration – interfered with their sexual function. Lack of confidence about sexuality and fear of rejection also was reported to contribute to sexual difficulties. Fatigue and depression were significant predictors of sexual dysfunction. Further, women who reported sexual dysfunction were older than those who did not report such difficulties (27.5 years versus 23.1 years), but the two groups did not differ in terms of occupation, educational level, or location of brain/spine lesions on MRI. The investigators noted that four patients reported experiencing sexual dysfunction before the emergence of neurological symptoms of MS. As researchers continue to “fill in the gaps” on the many facets of CIS, this study points to the importance of patients talking frankly with clinicians about the full range of issues they may be experiencing. Is menopause a turning point for MS disease course? Relapse rates declined but disability increased in the years following menopause among 148 women with relapsing forms of MS, suggesting that “natural menopause could be a turning point to a less inflammatory, progressive phase of disease,” according to researchers. Those findings and conclusions are from an observational study conducted at 16 MS centers across Italy. Women were followed for a period of roughly 3.5 years before and after natural menopause, meaning menopause not brought about by surgical removal of the ovaries. Ninety-three percent of the women received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during that period. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the women declined from 0.22 before menopause to 0.13 following menopause. However, their scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) increased from a median of 2.0 at menopause to 2.27 two years later and to 2.46 four years after menopause. On the EDSS, an increasing score reflects increased disability. The investigators noted that the findings are in keeping with the results of earlier research they have conducted with a smaller group of women. The impact of endocrine (or hormonal) factors on MS is a focus of considerable research, and studies such as this one suggest avenues for further investigation, while also helping clinicians and patients better anticipate changes that may await across one’s lifespan.  Promising results for stem cell therapy in “aggressive MS”  Clinicians long have faced a challenge in treating “aggressive MS” – a term used when one’s MS is marked by frequent relapses and rapid progression of disability. An international study presented at the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting offers hope that removing, treating, and re-infusing a patient’s own hematopoietic (blood-tissue forming) stem cells may be a safe and effective first-line therapy for this uncommon but extremely debilitating type of MS. The study involved 20 patients treated in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, Italy, and the United States. None had received more than three months of standard DMT treatment before undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or AHSCT (with autologous signifying that the cells came from the patient, rather than from a donor). The patients, who ranged in age from 19 to 52 years, had a median EDSS score of 6.5 prior to treatment. They were followed for a median time of 30 months after transplantation. The median improvement in their EDSS score from pre-treatment to last follow-up was 2.5, which was a statistically significant difference. None had a clinical relapse following transplant. Three patients had new lesions on MRI at their first follow-up visit, but no other new or gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen on later scans. The investigators reported that, “There were routine toxicities, but no treatment-related mortality.” The researchers added that the study results demonstrate the potential role of AHSCT as a first-line treatment for aggressive MS. Additional studies will continue to provide answers on the potential benefits and risks of this intriguing experimental treatment. Low immunization rates against respiratory disease in people with MS Pneumonia and influenza pose serious threats in the setting of MS, but more than 70 percent of people with MS in an Argentine study had not been vaccinated against either illness, researchers reported. The investigators noted that age, smoking, severe disability, and use of immunosuppressive medications all increase the risk of respiratory infections, adding that people with MS have a risk three-times higher than that of the general population for contracting community-acquired pneumonia. Against that backdrop, the researchers conducted an online survey of 220 people with MS and 62 healthy controls. The proportion of people not receiving either the pneumococcal pneumonia or influenza vaccine was high in both groups – 71.4 percent of people with MS and 79 percent of the healthy controls. Among the unvaccinated patients with MS, 80 percent were on a DMT medication, 31 percent smoked or had only recently stopped smoking, 22 percent were aged 50 years or older, and 11 percent had severe disability. The investigators concluded that the low vaccination rates combined with the high prevalence of risk factors among MS patients underscores the need to develop consensus policies on immunization in people who have MS. Impact of magnetic stimulation on balance in people with MS Using a coil held over a person’s head to direct magnetic stimulation to the brain improved balance and walking ability in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and a related movement disorder, according to a group of Egyptian researchers. The investigators studied 43 people with RRMS and truncal ataxia, a condition that can diminish balance and the ability to walk. In the first phase of their study, half of the participants received actual magnetic stimulation while the other half received a sham treatment. In the study’s second phase, all subjects received 12 sessions of magnetic stimulation over four weeks every third month, for a total of 48 sessions. Each session lasted several minutes. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and 10-Minute Walk Test (10MWT) were used to measure the impact of treatment, with patients assessed before, during, and at the completion of treatment. The researchers reported that from the pre-treatment baseline to the last session, participants saw a 36-percent improvement in the 10MWT and a 46-percent improvement in BBS score. These individuals also saw improvement on an imaging assessment of white matter in the brain. The investigators said that the adverse effects of treatment were mild and transitory, with two people reporting nausea, two experiencing dizziness, and three having headaches. Based on these findings, the researchers said that non-invasive, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a long-term beneficial effect on improving balance in people with MS and ataxia.

83099e81-7d36-465e-827d-ad5cb119c360,"Multiple Sclerosis Relapses Don’t Necessarily Occur After Pregnancy In a new study, researchers say there was no significant increase in relapse rate after childbirth for women with MS. Pregnancy may not cause multiple sclerosis (MS) to worsen as previously thought. For the past 20 years, women with MS were told that while pregnancy might help , those relapses often got worse after childbirth. However, researchers say in a that they discovered the disease didn’t show increased relapse activity after a woman has given birth. The research team was headed by , a clinical assistant professor of neurology at the University of Southern California (USC) Keck School of Medicine as well as an affiliated investigator in neurology with Kaiser Permanente Research. “This is a super interesting study,” , PhD, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline. “We have had this dogma for a long time,” said Bebo. “Women with MS showed an exacerbated rate of relapses after pregnancy, but Dr. Langer-Gould questioned this and found in this preliminary study a different result.” Previous studies occurred before current disease-modifying treatments.There are now approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Almost in the United States are estimated to be living with MS. Of these, about are women. The objective of the recent study was to investigate what happens to women with MS after giving birth. Researchers looked at the risk of relapses and identified potentially modifiable risk factors. This population study looked at 466 pregnancies from 375 women in the years 2008 to 2016. The records were taken from the Kaiser Permanente Southern and Northern California databases. The participants were surveyed about treatments, breastfeeding, and relapses. “This study provides an important update on previous data, which had indicated that women with MS were more likely to have a relapse in the first three to six months postpartum, with that risk being higher for patients with more active disease before pregnancy,” , professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. Of the women in the study, 38 percent weren’t on any treatment in the year prior to conception, while 15 percent had clinically isolated syndrome and 8 percent relapsed during pregnancy. No increase in relapses postpartum were observed, although the authors point out that some of the women had only had a single episode. About one-third of the women breastfed exclusively, which seemed to reduce the relapse rate. “This is good news for women with MS who wish to have children, and larger population-based studies of this type are encouraged,” noted Giesser. Immune mechanisms are triggered during pregnancy to keep a woman’s body from rejecting the fetus. This mechanism is also responsible for suppressing the immune system responsible for MS relapses. “These results are exciting, as MS is more common among women of childbearing age than in any other group,” Langer-Gould said in a . “This shows us that women with MS today can have children, breastfeed, and resume their treatment without experiencing an increased risk of relapses during the postpartum period,” she added. “The results are somewhat preliminary and not definitive,” noted Bebo. “But it provides an important piece of information that adds to our knowledge for MS and pregnancy, before and after.” The authors report the lack of rebound disease activity in the early postpartum period is likely due to a combination of the participants in a population-based setting, inclusion of women diagnosed after a single relapse, and high rates of breastfeeding. “There were not a lot of people in the study that were on the stronger DMTs, so it may be skewed to a more calm version of disease,” cautioned Bebo, “There wasn’t a lot of exacerbation postpartum.” “We do not know how certain DMTs will affect pregnancy,” Bebo said. He emphasized the importance of pregnant women with MS contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to us a shared-decision approach to treatment. “People should have all the information in making family decisions, and this is something that can help,” said Bebo. “This information is helpful, but everyone needs to evaluate their own circumstance with their healthcare provider to make informed decisions on how to proceed.” Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

Jim O’Donnell will receive one of the highest awards the Society bestows upon volunteers: the Society’s Lifetime Achievement Award. Jim has supported the Society for more than 30 years, lending his time and talent to move our mission forward in impressive ways.  For the second time in six years, Dr. Eugene May was inducted in to the National MS Society’s Volunteer Hall of Fame. While Dr. May was recognized for his contributions to Advocacy in 2009, he was more recently acknowledged for the exceptional care he provides to people with MS when he received the the Health Professional Hall of Fame award. Haggen earned their spot in the Volunteer Hall of Fame as a result of their long history of community involvement and philanthropy that has helped those affected by MS. Doug Toelle, an Alaskan MS Activist, was inducted in to the National MS Society Hall of Fame for Advocacy. Doug is a proactive, persistent advocate who has forged strong relationships with his local, state, and federal legislators. Aside from his role as an MS Activist, he is also a mentor to other activists, a self-help group leader, Walk MS participant, and long-time attendee at the Society’s Public Policy Conference. ""Receiving the scholarship had meant a great deal to me. Not just financially, my family and I already bear a brunt of costs with my medical care and medicines, but the social benefit as well. It warms my heart to know people out there care to assist people with their desire for higher education."" Receiving the Society's scholarship is meaningful to me because I know that I am supported in my efforts to achieve my dreams. Receiving this scholarship makes me feel that the society believes in me. It is comforting to know that there is help available for people that live with MS as part of their daily lives. “Receiving this scholarship at the time I did was an indescribable blessing, as it was exactly what I needed to pay that last bit of tuition, as well as provide the psychological boost I needed to believe that I could handle taking on the larger course load and survive as a family without my income.” “In the end, I'm not sure yet how everything will turn out, but I do know this: Someday I will be able to look a patient in the eyes and say, ‘Don't worry. We have a cure.’” When I was nine, I realized the severity of my mom’s disease. While driving us to a New Year's Eve party at our church, she completely lost her sight. I was terrified! The blindness was temporary, but turned into severe double vision. “No matter how much good you do, you may get some bad in return and when you get it you can't let it change who you are and what you believe.” My dad has taught me the power of sacrifice, and that for the ones you love, no sacrifice is too big. He never let any struggles he faced be known to his work or family; he pushed through for us. “My mom accepts her MS and doesn't want anyone to feel sorry for her; she wants to show everyone that multiple sclerosis will not stop her. Her fearless attitude has rubbed off on me and I could not be more grateful.” “[My mom] has inspired me to excel even in the face of difficulties; I have watched her refuse to let MS hold her back, even though it is by no means easy. In everything she strives to be her best and in doing so she has inspired me to do my best as well and to work hard even when it hurts.” Cermit Rickey of Tacoma, Washington is the first to admit that he had “no idea what he was doing” when he agreed to join the Society’s advocacy efforts for his first-ever State Action Day. He had participated in Society sponsored self-help groups for years but he had little experience in advocacy or politics. That leap of faith in 2006, quickly turned Cermit into a life-long advocate. When it comes to being part of the MS movement, Scott is a jack of all trades. Whether he’s capturing photos at Bike MS or Walk MS, leading as a team captain, or meeting with his legislators at the Capitol, the depth and breadth of Scott’s experience demonstrates his commitment to ending MS forever. Long-time MS activist, Gayle Rundstrom, knows how to connect with others. She builds relationships with community members, legislators, and social media contacts – all to raise awareness about MS and help move us toward a world free of MS. Martin and Lisa Boon first became connected with the Society in the early 1990s after Lisa was diagnosed with MS. They have participated in and volunteered at countless Bike MS and Walk MS events, and joined the Washington State Action Day. Lisa leads a local self-help group, is an MS Ambassador, and regularly volunteers to lead educational programs in her community. Alaska State Senator, Dennis Egan, has a long history of public service. Whether it’s his time as Juneau mayor, assembly member, planning commissioner, or member of the Juneau of Chamber of Commerce, he has a dynamic history of involvement in his community. The Senator also lives with multiple sclerosis. We asked Sen. Dennis Egan to share his thoughts on why connecting with his constituents are important – and how to make the most of a visit. https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Helpful-Links/Contact-UsContact Us If you would like to hear about updates, sign up for emails or find us on our social network pages. https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Helpful-Links/Contact-UsContact Us If you would like to hear about updates, sign up for emails or find us on our social network pages. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

69f02059-66d6-4c0a-a62f-2b2d5391cb2c,"Highlights from the AAN and CMSC 2017 Annual Meetings Highlights from the AAN and CMSC 2017 Annual Meetings During the past few decades, advancements made in multiple sclerosis (MS) research have revolutionized the field. Thus far in 2017, the brisk pace has continued. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) meeting in April 2017 in Boston, Massachusetts and the Consortium of MS Centers Conference (CMSC) in May 2017 in New Orleans, Louisiana were both venues for healthcare professionals and researchers to convene and report their latest progress. We’ve included some of the most interesting and cutting-edge ideas presented at these conferences in this update. Ocrevus® (ocrelizumab) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS and primary-progressive MS. Ocrevus is a targeted antibody that works in a unique way among MS medications by removing the B cells from the blood. B cells are a type of immune cell that is now recognized as critical in MS-lesion formation. Data presented highlighted the significant effects of Ocrevus in MS. A sub-analysis looking at the rate of No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA) in people with early MS (defined as having the first symptoms for less than two years with no previous MS treatments) in the relapsing-remitting MS trials OPERA I and OPERA II found a 76-percent increase in NEDA with Ocrevus treatment versus the Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) comparison group. Individuals with NEDA have no new MRI lesions, relapses, or signs of clinical progression. Essentially, their MS is stable by all measures. Another sub-study highlighted the quick onset of action with Ocrevus. Researchers found that people receiving treatment already received a benefit within the first eight weeks, with a reduction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity and relapses. This is notable, especially for individuals with very active MS. Finally, the results of the year-three extension studies of Ocrevus in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) were presented. These studies found that individuals who started on Ocrevus continued to have exceedingly low relapse rates with good safety profiles during the third year of treatment. Furthermore, individuals who initially were randomized to the Rebif treatment group were found to have significantly decreased relapse rates when switched to Ocrevus during the extension study. The original Lemtrada® (alemtuzumab) trials in relapsing-remitting MS, CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II, showed a markedly significant decrease in clinical relapses and new MRI-lesion formation in people treated with Lemtrada versus those treated with Rebif. The vast majority of individuals in these trials have continued to follow up in the extension trials, providing at least six years of data. Study investigators reported at the AAN meeting that Lemtrada-treated participants continued to have good MS-disease control many years after they were enrolled, and more than 50 percent of these individuals never required a re-dosing to treat recurrent disease activity. Furthermore, the rate of brain-volume loss was significantly decreased in those who were originally randomized to Lemtrada versus those in the Rebif comparison group. Brain-volume loss continued to remain low during the six-year follow-up period. Although extension studies are not generally regarded to have the same scientific stringency as the initial randomized studies, they provide important information regarding the long-term benefits and risks of a given treatment. While a wide variety of MS treatment options are available, they generally have not been compared in head-to-head trials. Data collected in the “real world” setting of MS centers allows for some comparative evidence between drugs, but this does not come with the same rigor as a clinical trial. Researchers from Cleveland presented one such study at AAN. They compared 390 people with MS on Tecfidera® (dimethyl fumarate, DMF) and 293 people with MS on Gilenya® (fingolimod). They found that individuals taking Tecfidera were more likely to discontinue the medication because of side effects. These individuals also had a higher likelihood of new lesions on brain MRI within the first 12 months of treatment and an increased worsening on their timed 25-foot walking tests. However, a similar proportion of people in both groups experienced new clinical relapses. As noted earlier, readers should keep in mind that these findings were not from a rigorous comparison trial, but rather through data collected from individuals in a clinical setting. Individuals within the two treatment groups were not matched in terms of gender, age, time since diagnosis, or disease severity prior to initiation of treatment. Additionally, no one was “blinded,” so both the participants and the medical staff knew which medication was being taken. These details affect the ability to definitively compare the two medications to one another. TeriPRO was an open-label study of 545 individuals with MS who were started on Aubagio® (teriflunomide) and followed for 48 weeks. The goal of the study was to evaluate for patient-reported outcomes. A total of 58 percent of people in the study were switched from another MS therapy. At 48 weeks, 68 percent of people were satisfied with Aubagio as a treatment. The relapse rate in this study was reported to be very low, with one relapse reported for every eight individuals in the study. Ampyra® (dalfampridine) is FDA-approved for individuals with MS who are experiencing gait issues. It works by blocking potassium channels and allowing for more efficient conduction of the nerve impulses from the brain to the spinal cord, resulting in the ability to walk quicker or farther in about 40 percent of those taking the medication. Researchers in Italy conducted a study in which they tested Ampyra in people with MS-related cognitive dysfunction to see if they could find a benefit in this realm. A total of 120 people with MS were enrolled into the study – 50 percent into the Ampyra group and 50 percent into a placebo group. Results showed that people in the Ampyra group performed better on cognitive testing than the placebo group, with 76 percent of the treated group showing at least a 20-percent improvement compared to 44 percent of the controls. As might be expected, this benefit was not sustained after Ampyra was discontinued. Although researchers did find improved cognitive function with this medication, the participants did not find that it translated to improved quality of life. Based on the findings in this study, Ampyra may be a useful treatment for patients with cognitive dysfunction. “MyMSTeam” is an online social network of 75,000 people with MS. More than 1,100 people from this group responded to a survey regarding their MS symptoms, their definition of MS progression, and factors that impact MS medication choices. As in previous studies, fatigue was the most common symptom reported (82 percent), followed by gait issues (64 percent), and problems with balance (64 percent). Respondents reported that they most often define MS disability progression by losing the ability to walk and exercise (42 percent), the inability to do daily functions (25 percent), or the inability to be independent (22 percent). In terms of choices of medications, almost half (47 percent) found their doctor’s opinion to be the most important factor in choosing a medication. Interestingly, for those on an oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT), only 40 percent reported the doctor’s opinion as the most important factor, while 36 percent said that the method of administration was the most important factor. For people taking injections, 53 percent reported the doctor’s opinion to be most important. Surveys such as this are valuable for health professionals. They allow for greater understanding of the experience of a person with MS, which will allow for treatment strategies that align more closely to a person’s needs. To optimize health and functioning in people with MS, all aspects of health must be considered. Researchers conducted a survey of 7,400 people with MS enrolled in the NARCOMS study to evaluate the impact of lifestyle factors on overall health and wellness in people with MS. Lifestyle factors included diet, body-mass index, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking status. Correlations were then drawn between suboptimal lifestyle factors, e.g., smoking, poor diet, and low physical activity, and a person’s risk for depression, fatigue, or cognitive dysfunction. Interestingly, the study authors found that 43 percent of the respondents met criteria for having optimal health habits. Suboptimal habits were reported as follows: 36 percent in the area of diet, 17 percent for body-mass index, 4 percent in terms of leisure-time physical activity, and 0.5 percent for smoking status. When disease duration and level of disability were accounted for, people with two or more sub-optimal health habits were found to be at greater risk for depression, fatigue, and cognitive issues, versus those with one or none of these habits. This study highlights the importance for doctors and other care providers to continue to encourage people with MS to adopt the healthiest lifestyle possible. Doing so may help to minimize their risk for depression, fatigue, and cognition – all of which are common symptoms in MS. The concept of wellness encompasses not only physical wellbeing, but also includes emotional, social, and spiritual wellness. Wellness is critical to optimizing quality of life. The promotion of wellness, in addition to standard medical therapies, should be a priority among MS providers. Researchers from Colorado presented data from a study that surveyed individuals who took part in community-based wellness programs. The study found that the participants experienced a significant decrease in stress as well as increased feelings of overall health, positive behavior change, empowerment, and self-efficacy. For anyone not familiar with this term, self-efficacy is the ability we believe we have to meet challenges and achieve goals. Future studies in wellness should serve to identify specific strategies, either community-based or directed by MS centers, which can be employed to enhance wellness in the lives of people with MS. In recent years, the concept of resilience has become of interest to MS researchers. Although many definitions may be found for resilience, one definition that is often used is the ability for a person to continue to move toward wellbeing in the face of illness and adversity. Researchers from Canada performed a survey that examined levels of resilience in 300 individuals with MS. They found high levels of resilience among the survey respondents, although these levels in people with MS were still lower than individuals who had other medical conditions (spinal cord injuries or diabetes). More work needs to be done to understand the factors that might determine whether an individual with MS has a high or low resilience level, and how levels of resilience can impact the course of MS. Furthermore, interventions that can be identified to support those individuals with low resilience are needed. Mindfulness is a cognitive technique that focuses on teaching people to approach stress and life challenges in a different way. The goal of mindfulness is to teach individuals to stay fully in the present, without added judgment or assumptions about their present or future situations. It was originally developed for people with cancer and chronic pain and has been shown to significantly decrease anxiety, depression, and stress in these and many other conditions. Mindfulness has enormous potential for people with MS, where uncertainty for the future can often lead to increased stress and anxiety. In a study presented at the CMSC meeting, researchers from Ohio conducted a randomized trial of people with MS who were assigned to mindfulness, versus adaptive cognitive therapy, versus a control group that was put on a waiting list. Although no effect was seen on cognitive functioning, investigators found that the mindfulness group had improved emotional regulation during the course of the study. Future studies with mindfulness and MS should explore the broad potential for the use of this technique in the treatment of individuals with MS. Nutrition is a topic of high interest to individuals with MS and researchers. It is unclear if and how a person’s diet might impact their MS course, either in a positive or negative way. Utilizing the NARCOMS registry, researchers from the United States and Canada examined diet quality and its potential link to a person’s MS severity as well as associated symptoms. They reported their findings at the CMSC meeting. NARCOMS is an international registry of 37,000 people with MS who are asked to respond to questionnaires about their MS at regular intervals. In this study, 7,400 NARCOMS participants responded to a survey that looked at the quality of their diet. Whole grains and diets high in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and red/processed meats, are some of the categories that were focused upon. Study investigators found that people who scored in the top 20 percent of highest diet quality (low in added sugar and red/processed meats; high in fruit, vegetables, and legumes) had lower levels of overall disability and less depression. Overall, people with higher diet quality scores were more likely to be older, have a leaner body mass index, and were non-smokers. A large percentage of individuals with MS report at least some challenge with gait. While many people with MS might use a cane or walker to alleviate some of their difficulties, the use of these mobility devices has unexpectedly been associated in previous studies with an increased risk of falls. Many people do not receive any formal instruction on how to use their mobility device. Researchers from Oregon suspected that this lack of education might be part of the reason for the link between using a device and falls. They conducted a study to evaluate the effect of training with a mobility device on a person’s mobility and satisfaction with the device. The study randomized 40 individuals with MS to either six weekly training sessions versus a group on a waiting list. After three months, researchers found that people in the device-training group had fewer falls coupled with greater satisfaction with their device. Furthermore, people in the device-training group showed a trend towards less sitting and greater walking. This study suggests that formal instruction on the use of a mobility device may be of significant benefit. MSAA’s free mobile phone application, , was highlighted during the segment on shared decision making at the CMSC conference. Available for Android and iOS devices, the My MS Manager app allows users to track and manage their MS medications and symptoms, journal information, share data with physicians, and more. My MS Manager was developed in conjunction with @Point of Care, an app developer of innovative digital tools that connect clinicians, patients, and caregivers. During the presentation, MS expert neurologist Dr. James Bowen discussed the results of a survey that demonstrated the impact of the MSAA app. Data for the survey were collected and analyzed from 9,910 individuals with MS and 12,234 clinicians. Results of the survey showed the My MS Manager app helps improve patient-clinician communication regarding MS, facilitates discussions about fatigue (addressed through the app’s fatigue-assessment scale), and provides those using the app with the sense that their clinician is more invested in their MS management. Building on this success, MSAA and @POC plan to add updated features and symptom-management scales to the app in the near future.

91693732-5802-4202-865a-11aaca7d945a,"— — Nerves send and receive messages from every part of your body and process them in your brain. They allow you to: Many nerves are coated in myelin. Myelin is an insulating material. When it’s worn away or damaged, nerves can deteriorate, causing problems in the brain and throughout the body. Damage to myelin around nerves is called demyelination. Nerves are made up of neurons. Neurons are composed of: The axon sends messages from one neuron to the next. Axons also connect neurons to other cells, such as muscle cells. Some axons are extremely short, while others are 3 feet long. Axons are covered in myelin. Myelin protects the axons and helps carry axon messages as quickly as possible. Myelin is made of membrane layers that cover an axon. This is similar to the idea of an electrical wire with coating to protect the metal underneath. Myelin allows a nerve signal to travel faster. In unmyelinated neurons, a signal can travel along the nerves at about 1 meter per second. In a myelinated neuron, the signal can travel 100 meters per second. Certain medical conditions can damage myelin. Demyelination slows down messages sent along axons and causes the axon to deteriorate. Depending upon the location of the damage, axon loss can cause problems with: Inflammation is the most common cause of myelin damage. Other causes include: Demyelination prevents nerves from being able to conduct messages to and from the brain. The effects of demyelination can occur rapidly. In (GBS), myelin may only be under attack for a few hours before symptoms appear. Not everyone is affected by demyelinating conditions in the same way. However, some demyelinating symptoms are very common. Early symptoms — which are among the first signs of demyelination — include: Symptoms associated with the effect of demyelination on nerves Nerves are a key part of your body functions, so a wide range of symptoms can occur when nerves are affected by demyelination, including: Symptoms can come and go in chronic conditions, like (MS), and progress over years. There are different types of demyelination. These include inflammatory demyelination and viral demyelination. Inflammatory demyelination happens when the body’s immune system attacks myelin. Types of demyelination like MS, , and are caused by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. GBS involves inflammatory demyelination of peripheral nerves in other parts of the body. Viral demyelination occurs with (PML). PML is caused by the JC virus. Myelin damage can also occur with: Hypoxic-ischemic demyelination occurs due to vascular disease or a lack of oxygen in the brain. MS is the most common demyelinating condition. According to the , it affects 2.3 million people worldwide. In MS, demyelination occurs in the white matter of the brain and in the spinal cord. Lesions or “plaques” then form where myelin is under attack by the immune system. Many of these plaques, or scar tissue, occur throughout the brain over the course of years. There’s no cure for demyelinating conditions, but new myelin growth can occur in areas of damage. However, it’s often thinner and not as effective. Researchers are looking into ways to increase the body’s ability to grow new myelin. Most treatments for demyelinating conditions reduce the immune response. Treatment involves using drugs like interferon beta-1a or glatiramer acetate. People with low vitamin D levels more easily develop MS or other demyelinating conditions. High levels of vitamin D may reduce inflammatory immune responses. Demyelinating conditions, especially MS and optic neuritis, or inflammation of the optic nerve, are detectable with MRI scans. MRIs can show demyelination plaques in the brain and nerves, especially those caused by MS. Your healthcare provider may be able to locate plaques or lesions affecting your nervous system. Treatment can then be directed specifically at the source of demyelination in your body. The central nervous system (CNS) is able to produce its own cholesterol. Current show that if you take statins to reduce the cholesterol in your body, they’re not likely to affect your CNS cholesterol. Many have also found that statin treatment may protect against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in people who haven’t already experienced cognitive impairment and are still relatively young. have found that statins may slow the rate of cognitive decline and delay the onset of AD. Research continues, and we don’t have a definite answer yet. Some studies show that statins don’t affect the CNS or remyelination, and still others say they do. Currently, most of the evidence doesn’t show statin therapy to be harmful to remyelination within the CNS. Still, the effects of statins on cognitive function remain controversial at this time. Activating the immune system with a vaccine can trigger an autoimmune reaction. This tends to occur only in a few individuals with hypersensitive immune systems. Some children and adults experience “acute demyelinating syndromes” after exposure to certain vaccines, such as those for influenza or HPV. But there have only been , and it’s not certain that vaccines were the cause of the demyelination. Demyelinating conditions can seem painful and unmanageable at first. However, it’s still possible to live well with MS and other common conditions. There’s promising new research about the causes of demyelination and how to treat the biological sources of myelin deterioration. Treatments are also being improved for the management of pain caused by demyelination. Demyelinating conditions may not be curable. However, you can talk to your healthcare about medications and other treatments that may help you learn more about your condition. The more you know, the more you can do to address the symptoms, such as making lifestyle changes, to help you effectively manage the pain. — — Everything You Should Know About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM): What You Should Know Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Possible Ways to Improve Remyelination Multiple sclerosis is a chronic illness of the central nervous system.

9e84144c-e92c-439c-b3c7-241a17851de1,"— Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a chronic health condition that affects nerves in the eyes, spinal cord, and sometimes brain. It’s also known as Devic disease or Devic syndrome. It may cause vision loss, muscle weakness, and other symptoms. Read on to learn more about this condition, including how it’s diagnosed and treated. NMO is believed to be an autoimmune condition, where the body’s own immune system attacks healthy cells. In NMO, the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS) and optic nerves. Your CNS includes your spinal cord and brain. Your optic nerves carry signals between your eyes and brain. When your immune system attacks your CNS and optic nerves, it can cause inflammation and nerve damage. This can produce symptoms such as eye pain, vision loss, and muscle weakness. NMO is more common in people of Asian, African, and Native American descent. Women account for more than of cases of NMO. NMO symptoms most often appear in but may develop at any age. They may include: muscle weakness or paralysis in your arms and legs Most people with NMO develop a relapsing form of the disease. They experience multiple episodes of NMO symptoms known as relapses. These may occur months or years apart. People with relapsing NMO tend to partially recover between relapses. Many of them eventually develop lasting vision loss and muscle weakness or paralysis that persist between relapses. A smaller number of people with NMO develop a monophasic form of the disease. They experience a single episode of symptoms that may last for several months. They may also have lasting vision loss and muscle weakness. Contact your doctor right away if you develop NMO symptoms such as eye pain, vision loss, muscle weakness, loss of sensation, or loss of control of your bowel or bladder. To make an NMO diagnosis, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and medical history and conduct a physical exam. The following tests can help your doctor to make an NMO diagnosis: , to assess your eye function and structure , to assess your strength, coordination, sensation, thinking, memory, vision, and speech , to create pictures of your spinal cord, brain, and optic nerves , to collect a sample of fluid from around your brain and spine for testing , to check for certain antibodies that are found in many people with NMO About of people with NMO produce a type of immune molecule known as anti-AQP4 antibodies. Your NMO treatment options will partly depend on whether or not you produce these antibodies. Your doctor may prescribe several NMO treatments to help reverse recent symptoms or prevent future attacks. Immediately following an NMO attack, your doctor may treat symptoms by injecting you with high doses of the corticosteroid methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol). If corticosteroids don’t improve your symptoms and you have anti-AQP4 antibodies, you may receive a plasma exchange (PLEX) to lower your antibody levels. During this procedure, a healthcare provider removes blood from your body with an IV. Your plasma (the liquid part of your blood) is then separated from cells and replaced with a synthetic substitute. The healthcare provider then returns the blood to your body with an IV. The process may take hours and may be repeated several times over several days. To prevent relapses, your doctor may also prescribe immune-suppressing medications. If you produce anti-AQP4 antibodies, you may receive intravenous immune-suppressing medications including eculizumab (Soliris) or inebilizumab (Uplizna) to prevent future attacks. Several other immune-suppressing drugs are used off-label to reduce the risk of recurrence. These include azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), rituximab (Rituxan), or mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept). Your doctor may prescribe other medications, rehabilitative therapy, and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms or complications of NMO. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the potential benefits and risks of your treatment options. NMO is similar to multiple sclerosis (MS) in several ways. Both conditions are autoimmune disorders that affect nerve cells in the CNS and optic nerves. They may produce similar symptoms, such as vision loss and muscle weakness. the specific immune cells and autoimmune processes that are involved in NMO aren’t the same as those involved in MS people with MS don’t have anti-AQP4 antibodies, while 70 percent of people with NMO do some of the treatments that work for MS don’t work for NMO NMO relapses also tend to produce more severe symptoms than MS relapses NMO tends to cause irreversible health problems more quickly than MS, although both conditions can cause lasting damage over time NMO affects some people with the condition more severely than others. The condition may eventually cause lasting health problems, such as vision loss, muscle weakness, and issues with bowel and bladder control. It may affect your ability to see, get around, and complete day-to-day tasks. In severe cases, complications of the disease can make it difficult to breathe. Your doctor and other members of your treatment team can help you develop a plan to manage your symptoms, improve your quality of life, and support your ability to complete daily tasks with NMO. medications to help limit relapses, relieve symptoms, and treat complications physical therapy to help maintain or improve your strength and mobility occupational therapy to help you adapt to changes in how your body functions Your doctor may encourage you to meet with a social worker to help you access social support services such as disability benefits. Your doctor may also refer you to a professional counselor or patient support group to help meet your mental health and social support needs. Let your doctor or other members of your treatment team know if your symptoms change, you have concerns about your treatment plan, or you’re finding it difficult to manage the challenges of living with NMO. It’s difficult to predict how NMO will develop in any one person. The condition causes more severe symptoms in some people and sometimes leads to potentially life threatening complications. According to the authors of a review article in , early treatment is important for reducing the risk of disability and death from NMO. Getting treatment may help limit relapses, prevent complications, and improve your long-term outlook. The authors of the review report that roughly of people with NMO who don’t get treatment die within 5 years of their first episode. If you have NMO, eating a well-balanced diet is important for promoting good overall health. A registered dietitian can help you develop a healthy eating plan that’s sustainable for you. eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein limiting your intake of foods that are high in saturated fats or sugar, such as processed meats, pastries, and sweets drinking 6 to 8 cups of water or other sugar-free fluids per day avoiding or limiting your intake of alcohol and caffeine Some NMO treatments may affect your appetite or weight. Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned. Your doctor or dietitian may recommend changes to your dietary habits if you develop urinary frequency, constipation, or other challenges with your bladder or bowel habits. If you receive a diagnosis of NMO, your long-term outlook will partly depend on the form of NMO that you develop, the treatment that you receive, and your overall health. Following your recommended treatment plan may help limit relapses, prevent complications, and keep you healthier for longer. Talk to your doctor to learn more about your treatment options and outlook with this condition. — What’s the Difference Between Neuromyelitis Optica and MS?

1c0eeeaf-5114-4bdc-bd56-30f811959851,"In this guest blog, Lyndsay Killick from The White Hart in West Bergholt, Essex gives this year’s 925 Challenge teams her advice. Hi all, its Lyndsay here from The White Hart in West Bergholt! Hopefully, if you’re taking part in the 925 Challenge at least one of the MS-UK team members will have mentioned us and how brilliant we are already, haha! In 2018 I decided to give the MS-UK 925 Challenge a go for personal reasons. As a child growing up, my dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and it had a massive impact on all our family’s lives. For many years, we as a family fundraised and I thought it was about time to do it again. So we signed up! Little did I know at the time that we, a small country pub, would be up against some major corporate companies. The pressure was well and truly on!   We organised a game called ‘Pennies for Pounds’ and our customers got well and truly carried away. So much so that we got three or four boards completed really quickly! We then held a raffle for an alcohol hamper, but my main event was the Auction of Promises. This proved to be an amazing fundraiser and being in a village, we were lucky enough to get our whole community engaged and involved. Customers and local business jumped on board and donated their time and services to be auctioned off. We had so many different types of auction lots, from an hours’ worth of ironing and freshly home baked scones, to free swimming lessons, dog walking and even a chance to fly in a two seater plane, plus football season tickets, a day’s shooting trip – the list was endless! The evening was a huge success and we raised just over £4,000. I was absolutely overwhelmed at how the whole village dug deep and pulled together. It made me quite emotional. Our target was obviously to raise £925 in 9 weeks, 5 days and 2 hours but in total we raised an impressive £6,000 and definitely gave the big coproates a run for their money! I really can’t express to you how proud we all felt and how much fun we had smashing through that target. Keep going guys and girls, every penny will make a massive difference and no matter what you raise you are all heroes! Fundraiser of the Month - Trekking the Thames for MS-UK In this guest blog our October Fundraiser of the Month, Dan Young, tells us about how he raised an amazing £870 for MS-UK by walking the length of the River Thames this summer... On 12 August, I set off to walk the length of the River Thames from the source in Kemble, Gloucester to the Thames Barrier. When planning to do the walk, I decided to do it in memory of my Gran who had passed away after living with multiple sclerosis (MS) and as such, chose to raise money for MS-UK. The route is 184 miles mainly following the Thames Path and at about 16 miles a day, I expected it take 12 days of walking through the summer heat. However, the British weather did not fail to disappoint. The first week poured with rain and in the second week, the temperature rose to 30C at its peak. The weather made it harder than it already was. The long walks without seeing anyone were tough. I could walk 10 miles in the Oxfordshire countryside with only cows for company so when I finally saw another person I instantly wanted to talk to them! Speaking of animals, they can be stubborn when they want to be. I had a number of situations with cows and sheep refusing to move out of my way, which left a dip in the Thames my only option at times. They were mostly harmless though and it was nice to roam through the fields and hills in the countryside and enjoy the long walks. The scenery changed as I approached Reading and towards Central London. It was quite a relief to start walking on actual paths rather than cuttings in the grass as my feet started to feel every lump and bump in my path. As I got into Central London, I soon turned into a tourist, walking past the Houses of Parliament and crossing the river to walk past the almighty Shard. The end stretch from Tower Bridge to the Thames Barrier was the toughest! At this point, there were only 10 miles left but my feet were not in the best state. The area around the O2 gives little shade apart from the reflection of the sun off the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf but I pushed through. I finished at the Thames Barrier, 11 days and four hours after starting and had raised an amazing £870! I am absolutely thrilled that I’ve stepped forward (no pun intended) and done it! I’ve already started to plan my next adventure but for now, I’ll put my feet up… Has Dan inspired you?

One of our Community Champions, Gwynfa Podgorski, reveals how rare coins found in MS-UK collection pots can raise more funds than their face value might suggest. As a Community Champion, Gwynfa hands out MS-UK collection pots to local shops and collects the funds for our charity. Who would have thought a 50p coin with Jemima Puddleduck on it could earn £9 for MS-UK?  Having read somewhere about certain coins being worth more than their face value I decided it was time to check my change. Having been a Community Champion for a few months now, counting money out of the MS-UK pots I have in local stores has become second nature. Much to my surprise, I have found several commemorative 50p coins in there. Battle of Hastings, any Olympics ones, Benjamin Britten, Peter Rabbit, Paddington Bear, basically any 50p coin which celebrates events over the years are all potentially worth more than their face value. Checking possible value on eBay (most sell for £1-£2) I decided Jemima could be worth rather more than 50p. Indeed, she has a new home with a buyer in Wales and after paying fees to eBay, PayPal and Postage, MS-UK has an extra £9 instead of the 50p coin someone kindly put in the pot. When I find any foreign coins in a pot I take them to my local Scope Charity shop who collect them and sell them on when they have enough. If any of you find similar and would like to try to sell them for additional funds for MS-UK I am happy to help with advice on how to or even doing the selling. To get in touch with Gwynfa or become a Community Champion contact . My name is Laura and I work on the helpline here at MS-UK. I have set myself a challenge to swim 60 lengths a week, every single week for one whole year! Swimming isn’t something I have ever been particularly that good at; I can swim but I have never been a strong swimmer at all. I much prefer things like yoga and Pilates! I wouldn’t describe myself as particularly fit either, but I am quite active in that I spend my days chasing after two young children. The reason for this challenge is because this month would have been my Dad’s 80 birthday. Unfortunately, he died in 2010, a few months before his 71 birthday. I’d spent some time thinking about and discussing with family that I’d wanted to do something to mark the occasion. If he was here we’d have thrown a party, so why not still do something else instead? I thought a challenge of some kind would be good, it would get me out and doing something just for me. Me-time is needed when life can be so busy. I’m not a runner - I’ve tried in the past and it really isn’t for me…I don’t enjoy cycling so that was out of the question. I didn’t really want to do a one-off event and I’m not doing this necessarily, entirely for the fundraising. I just wanted to do something a bit different. My dad lived with multiple sclerosis (MS) for a very long time. More years with it than without, in fact. He loved to be in the water. He was a good swimmer in his younger days and loved the benefits of hydrotherapy in his later years. The water provided a lovely sense of freedom and relaxation. A swimming challenge seemed the best option to keep that connection with something he liked to do too. I decided to cover the distance of 80km (80 miles seemed just way too far!) for his 80 birthday but stretch this over a year to make it achievable. It works out roughly 60 lengths of a 25 metre pool every week. This is the hardest part for me… committing to go every week. My motivation will come from always thinking about why I am doing it and the fact I have no real reason why I cannot find the time in the week to do so. Next year will be the 10 year anniversary of him passing so it seemed fitting to carry the challenge over a year to signify that too. I have been ‘training’ since May and I’m pleased to say I have not missed a week yet! I thought I ought to do some kind of training as I wasn’t even sure I could manage one length let alone 60! My first swim back in May was really tough;  I only managed 12 lengths and I was really out of puff. What I am amazed about is how quickly I have built up strength and stamina, and how much I am enjoying the peaceful time in the water. I officially started my challenge this week and Tuesday night I swam 60 lengths for the first time ever! Now the challenge is on and I will do the same every week until the 80km is completed. I have set up a JustGiving page for donations to the MS-UK counselling service. If you would like to donate . Alternative supported exercise options for people with MS Our Helpline team have written about alternative places to exercise with  in this blog... If you don’t live near an or any of the other options mentioned in  there will likely be other avenues of support.

Mainstream and conventional gyms are likely to be physically accessible and many now have specific services aimed at ensuring they are as inclusive as possible for people with additional needs. A good example of this is who run leisure centres and gyms across Lincolnshire and offer a range of disability activities and services to help people exercise. Most areas across the UK will operate some kind of ‘exercise referral scheme’ in partnership with health and leisure services. You will likely need a referral from your GP or other health professional. As part of this referral scheme for people with long term conditions, you will get the support of an exercise professional with experience and training in supporting people with additional health needs and the ongoing support of an accessible exercise environment. A good example of the GP referral schemes is who supports people with long-term conditions who want to positively influence their health and wellbeing through their GP exercise referral scheme in their various centres nationwide. We wish you all the best in finding the right exercise option for you. If you know of options that haven’t made our list why not drop us a line and share our experiences? Don’t forget that MS-UK has a Choices booklet about that we hope you will find useful.  If you would like to find out more about exercise options with MS, call our Helpline on 0800 783 0518, chat to the team on our website or email .  A rainy Royal Parks Half Marathon doesn’t stop #TeamPurple! On Sunday 13 October 2019 our Events Fundraiser Jenny supported the Royal Parks Half Marathon… We had an amazing team of 14 take on the Royal Parks Half Marathon this year. It was a muddy one! The rain during the night before made the start and finish line very muddy so our runners knew they were going to get very messy – if only you could run in wellington boots! Despite the overcast, drizzly weather the team were in great spirits. They were supported by our cheer point of volunteers at mile 11, all of whom had taken part in running events before so they knew how to give that much needed encouragement. And of course, we kept up our reputation of being the noisiest cheer point on the route! I would like to say a massive thank you to all our supporters – it makes a huge difference! I would also like to say a big congratulations to our #TeamPurple runners who have so far raised an epic £4,162.82, which is well over target, with more funds set to come in. Every penny goes towards supporting those affected by multiple sclerosis to live happier and healthier lives – thank you! Have you been inspired by this event? MS-UK have places in the Vitality Big Half in London on the 02 March 2020. The minimum fundraising requirement or this event is £250.00. To register your interest call Jenny today on 01206 226500 or email . In this guest blog, Shaun Collins tells us about why he has taken on not just one run in aid of MS-UK, but many! This weekend he will be joining #TeamPurple at the Royal Parks Half Marathon, here’s why… My journey with MS-UK started in 2017 after my good friend Lewis Miller had been diagnosed with (MS). After his diagnosis, Lewis had continued running marathons and around that time I had started running again. Whilst at that point I thought I’d be happy once I’d managed a 5k, I had always had the thought in my mind to run a marathon having grown up in London and I no longer really had an excuse. If Lewis could do it with what he was going through, what excuse did I have for not doing it! Having made the decision, I went online to find an Autumn marathon and started by running the Birmingham Marathon in 2017. It didn’t go to plan, I hit the much talked about wall and walked most of the last 11 miles!  I have since continued running and thanks to MS-UK, got a place to take part in the Virgin Money London Marathon in 2018 which really did fulfil a lifelong ambition and this time I managed to run the whole marathon which was my aim! I have had a year off doing marathons due to the birth of our third child but decided I still needed to do something again so I chose to run the Great North Run and Royal Parks Half Marathons this year continuing to raise money for MS-UK! The team at MS-UK, particularly Jenny, have been amazing and have been so supportive through every event I have done! If you would like to sponsor me for my events this year, visit .  My work will match fund up to £1,000 so for every donation you give, the amount will be doubled! I have plans to run three marathons in eight weeks next year so watch this space for more ways that you can support me and MS-UK! This week is National Work Life week, which is all about focusing on wellbeing at work. You might be thinking about talking to your employer about your MS, but just what is the best way to inform them? Rebecca Armstrong, MSer and HR specialist reveals what to consider and what to expect One of the hardest questions that I get asked on my Facebook group is ‘should I tell my employer?’ The issue of disclosure is a tricky one, particularly as you won’t know if you have done the right thing until it’s too late. What is true is that once you have done it there is no going back, but remember that can be a good thing. So, if you decide to disclose you then have to decide who to tell and how to do it. In this blog, we focus on these important questions and provide you with some guidance on how to make this important disclosure. Before you arrange to speak to work, it’s a good idea to prepare what you will say. It is important to remember that can be difficult to understand and so you may need to explain exactly what it is and most importantly how it impacts you. Think about examples of how it impacts your work (if at all) that can help explain. Be prepared for the response, we have all been frustrated with comments such as ‘you don’t look unwell’ or ‘my Aunty had MS and…’ but often this is someone’s way of trying to make sense of something. When we don’t understand something, we will try and relate it to something we do and often these (insensitive) comments can simply be that. Think about how you can pre-empt such comments by being prepared, for example, ‘MS is different for every person, in fact, no two people are the same, the impact it has on me is…’ Consider taking some resources with you, MS-UK has a range of leaflets available on its website which you can print or provide links to. These are a useful way of providing information in a simple way and of course you could take a copy of the MS-UK magazine, ! It is also a good idea to think about what (if anything) you need in terms of reasonable adjustments. Your employer has a legal obligation to make reasonable adjustments, by being clear about what you need it will help this process. Of course, for many of us, we may not need adjustments straight away. Consider requesting a regular review (if you don’t have this already), so that if this changes you can discuss what is needed. Once you have decided what to say, the final consideration is who to tell. Typically this would be your manager as they will be the person who supports you day to day. You can expect that they will need to tell the HR department so that you can make sure you are properly supported. They may ask you who you want to know about your MS at work and of course you can choose that you do not want anyone else to know about it. Disclosure is a big step and one which is entirely your choice, you are not obliged to tell your employer about your MS. However, if they are not aware then they will not be able to support you. To continue the conversation and discuss any other MS work related issues join Today is World Mental Health Day and our MS-UK Counselling team are looking at common mental health myths head on… Myths and beliefs about mental health issues can be instilled in us from an early age. These myths and beliefs are not designed to harm – they are passed to us in good faith mainly from parental figures, care givers and the environment in which we develop. These myths are designed to protect us from emotional issues rather than support us. The result is that we learn how to suppress our emotions rather than express them. Here are some common myths we often come across as counsellors with MS-UK… Mental health problems are widespread. According to around one in four people will experience a mental health problem each year and they can affect people from every walk of life. Myth 2 - I can’t do anything to support someone with a mental health problem Ask how somebody is doing. It’s highly unlikely that you will make things worse. In fact, it may be that your relative, friend or colleague needs to talk to somebody and you ask them how they are doing helps them to open up about how they are feeling People want to feel heard. You offering a listening ear can often help more than you realise. Try not to judge what the person is saying, even though what you are hearing may be shocking. They are being brave talking to you Sometimes the person may feel worried or feel embarrassed about what they may have shared with you and wonder how you are going to act around them going forward. Try and treat them in the same way as you did before they opened up to you It is OK to ask if somebody wants to talk more than once. It may be that the first time you asked them they didn’t feel able or ready to talk but they feel able to talk now Myth 3 - People experiencing mental health problems aren’t able to work People living with mental health problems can hold down a successful job. If one in four people experience a mental health problem each year these statistics suggest that in fact we probably all work with someone who is experiencing a mental health problem. Myth 4 - People with mental health problems can’t recover People can and do recover from mental health conditions and recovery means being able to live, work, learn and participate in the community. There is lots of different support and help available to help people recover. Mental health problems may not go away forever but lots of people with mental health problems still work, have families and friends, engage in hobbies and interests and lead full lives. Myth 5 - People living with mental health conditions are usually violent and unpredictable Most people living with mental health conditions are not violent. In fact, somebody with mental illness is actually more likely to be a victim of violence than to inflict it. According to , the movement working to end mental health discrimination, the majority of violent crimes are committed by people who do not have mental health problems. It also states people with mental health problems pose more of a danger to themselves than to others, with 90% of people dying through suicide having experienced mental distress. Myth 6 - Young people just go through ups and down as part of puberty – it doesn’t mean anything One in eight young people experience a mental health problem, according to the NHS’s Mental Health of Children and Young People 2017 report. This statistic is widely thought to just be the tip of the iceberg. You may find it helpful to look at the charity, Young Minds. Visit . Myth 7 - People with mental health problems are lazy and should try harder to snap out of it This is not true. There are many reasons why someone may have a mental health problem and being lazy or weak is not one of them. People cannot just snap out of a mental health problem and many people may need help to get better. This help may include counselling, medication, self help and support from friends and family. Depressive disorders occur at high rates among patients with MS and this can have a major, negative impact on quality of life for people living with multiple sclerosis, according to a . However, counselling can be helpful in finding ways to talk about thoughts and feelings associated with MS. It is World Mental Health Day and in this guest blog, Julie tells us why she took years to come to terms with her diagnosis of MS and how MS-UK Counselling has helped her… ‘To this day I struggle to think about the day I was given the news of my . Unfortunately, it was dealt with dreadfully. I was on my own and not prepared at all. The consultant showed me my MRI scan and quite bluntly said the only thing she could think was that it was MS. I could barely breathe but knew I had to try to listen so as not to miss any information. She asked me what I was doing later that afternoon and I replied that I was due to go on holiday with my husband and daughter. She said: ‘Have a good time and try not to think about it too much.’ I couldn't believe what I was hearing, the sheer insensitivity. It took me years to accept my diagnosis and to learn to accept it.’ ‘I first noticed something was wrong around 2009 whilst on a charity walk. After around 40 minutes my right foot felt wobbly and slapped the ground. I didn't take much notice and for the next few years, nothing changed much until one day when I was meeting a friend in town. I parked a way out and by the time I got to the centre my right leg really ached and I couldn't control my foot. I made an appointment with my GP who couldn't find anything much but referred me for physiotherapy. Physio had no effect and when I described the of weakness, a tickling sensation and pins and needles I was referred for an MRI of my spine. This came back as normal but the consultant decided I should have further imaging of my head and neck and it was this scan that showed the lesions.’ ‘One day, my MS nurse pointed out that every year I bring up the bad experience I had when I was diagnosed, and maybe I should consider some .  ‘I had no reservations about accepting help and found it a relief to talk to my counsellor. My first session was comforting and I felt listened to and cared for. I felt I mattered.  ‘The service has helped immensely. I have discovered I am actually stronger than I thought and have learned coping mechanisms for the times that are tricky.  ‘I would say to anybody struggling emotionally not to wait as I did and to seek help. It is available, and any good GP will help, or you can self-refer. The good thing about the MS-UK Counselling service is that the people have knowledge of the disease which makes a huge difference.  ‘I have also found exercise and meditation hugely beneficial in helping with anxiety.’ MS-UK Counselling is confidential and open to anyone living with multiple sclerosis.

48f6e9da-9a5b-4f9e-83e3-984be68ce97f,"— — Unexplained weight loss, or losing weight without trying, can be a cause for concern. It might indicate an underlying condition. A good rule of thumb is to see your doctor if you’ve lost a significant amount — more than 5 percent of your weight — within 6 to 12 months. In addition, take note of any other symptoms to talk over with your doctor. Remember, not all weight loss is serious. It can happen after a life-changing or stressful event. However, unintentional weight loss may be a sign of one of these medical conditions. Muscle loss, or , can lead to unexpected weight loss. The major symptom is muscle weakness. One of your limbs may even look smaller than the other. Your body is made of fat mass and fat-free mass, which includes muscle, bone, and water. If you lose muscle, you’ll lose weight. This can happen if you don’t use muscles for a while. It’s most common in people who don’t exercise, work desk jobs, or are bedridden. Generally, exercise and proper nutrition will reverse muscle loss. , or overactive thyroid, develops when your makes too much thyroid hormone. These hormones control many functions in the body, including metabolism. If your thyroid is overactive, you’ll quickly burn calories even if you have a good appetite. The result can be unintentional weight loss. Treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on your age and severity of your case. Generally, it’s treated with anti-thyroid medications, radioactive iodine, beta-blockers, or surgery. is an autoimmune disease that makes your immune system attack the lining of your joints, leading to inflammation. Chronic inflammation can speed up metabolism and reduce overall weight. Symptoms of RA include joint swelling and pain. It usually affects the same joints on both sides of your body. If you have RA, your joints might feel stiff if you don’t move for an hour or more. The exact cause of RA is unknown. It may be linked to: Treatment of RA typically begins with medication. include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, corticosteroids, biologics, and Janus associated kinase inhibitors. Another cause of unwanted weight loss is . If you have type 1 diabetes, your immune system attacks cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Without insulin, your body can’t use glucose for energy. This causes high blood glucose. Your kidneys remove unused glucose through urine. As sugar leaves your body, so do calories. Treatment of type 1 diabetes includes insulin, blood sugar monitoring, diet modifications, and exercise. Weight loss may be a side effect of , which is defined as feeling sad, lost, or empty for at least two weeks. These emotions interfere with daily activities, such as going to work or school. Depression affects the same parts of the brain that control appetite. This can lead to poor appetite, and eventually, weight loss. In some people, depression may increase appetite. The symptoms vary from person to person. Other symptoms of depression include: , psychotherapy, and are used to treat depression. Unexpected weight loss may be a symptom of . IBD is a term that encompasses several chronic inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract. The two most common types are and . The chronic inflammation of IBD puts your body in a state, which means that it’s constantly using up energy. IBD also disrupts ghrelin, the hunger hormone, and leptin, the satiety hormone. This results in decreased appetite and weight loss. These symptoms are triggered by certain foods. If you have IBD, you might be hesitant to eat. Treatment of IBD usually consists of nutritional support, medication, and in some cases, surgery. is a progressive lung disease. This includes and . Many people with COPD have both. Emphysema slowly damages the air sacs in your lungs, making it hard to breathe. Chronic bronchitis causes inflammation of the airways that bring air to your lungs. This produces mucus, coughing, and breathing issues. Early COPD is mild. Some people may not show symptoms but those that may appear include: In later stages, COPD can cause weight loss. Labored breathing burns a lot of calories. According to , a person with COPD may need 10 more times more calories to breathe than a person without COPD. It can also feel uncomfortable to eat and breathe at the same time. The main cause of COPD is cigarette smoking. Long-term exposure to irritants such as air pollution and dust can also lead to COPD. Treatment includes medications, such as bronchodilators, and lung therapies, like oxygen therapy. causes inflammation of your heart’s inner lining, or endocardium. It develops when germs —usually bacteria — enter the bloodstream and collect in your heart. Most people with endocarditis have a . This may come along with a poor appetite. Elevated body temperature also increases metabolism and burns fat, causing weight loss. Endocarditis is rare in healthy hearts. It’s more likely to affect people with damaged heart valves, artificial heart valves, or congenital heart defects. Treatment of endocarditis includes antibiotics and surgery. Another cause of unexplained weight loss is , a contagious condition that usually affects the lungs. It’s caused by bacteria. Weight loss and decreased appetite are major symptoms of TB, but the reasons aren’t fully understood. TB spreads through the air. You can catch TB without getting sick. If your immune system can fight it, the bacteria will become inactive. This is called latent TB. Over time, it can turn into active TB. Symptoms include: Some people are at risk for active TB. This includes people with weak immune systems, especially those who have: TB is typically treated with a course of antibiotics for six to nine months. is the general term for diseases that cause abnormal cells to quickly divide and spread. According to the , one of the first signs may be unexplained weight loss of 10 pounds or more. This is common with cancers of the pancreas, lung, stomach, and esophagus. Cancer increases inflammation. This promotes muscle wasting and disrupts appetite-regulating hormones. A growing tumor may also increase your resting energy expenditure (REE), or how much energy your body burns at rest. Many conditions can cause these symptoms. Sometimes, cancer doesn’t cause any symptoms. Treatment depends on the type of cancer. Typical treatments include, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. develops when the immune system attacks the adrenal glands. In turn, the adrenal glands can’t make enough hormones like and aldosterone. Cortisol regulates many functions, including metabolism and appetite. Low levels of cortisol may lead to poor appetite and weight loss. Addison’s disease is rare, affecting roughly in the United States. Treatment includes medications that’ll regulate your adrenal gland. attacks immune cells called T cells. This makes it difficult to fight infections. If left untreated, HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Advanced forms of these conditions often cause weight loss. Symptoms like sore throat, mouth sores, and fatigue can make eating uncomfortable. HIV also increase the risk of secondary infections, which increase REE. Symptoms of HIV depend on the person and stage of infection. Antiretroviral therapy is used to treat HIV and stop the spread of the virus and may improve weight loss. Weight loss is a complication of . CHF develops when the heart can’t fill up with enough blood, the heart can’t pump blood with enough force, or both. It may affect one or both sides of the heart. If you have CHF, your digestive system can’t receive enough blood. This can lead to nausea and early fullness. Additionally, it might be hard to breathe while eating. The inflammation in damaged heart tissue also speeds up metabolism, causing unintentional weight loss. There are several medications used to treat CHF, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics. In some cases, surgery might be necessary. Women are at higher risk for COPD. Women are also more likely to develop hyperthyroidism and more likely to have RA. It’s normal for your body weight to fluctuate. However, if you’re losing weight without changing your habits, something else might be going on. If you experience a 5 percent weight loss in 6 to 12 months, or if you notice any of the above symptoms, visit your doctor. — — How Weight Loss Relates to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Explore the relationship between COPD and weight loss, learn how to get the right nutrients to maintain a healthy weight, and more.

Introduction Social cognition refers to a wide range of cognitive capacities elicited by, about, and directed towards other people [1]. In particular, these skills allow humans to both understand themselves and interact with and understand others, engaging in appropriate goal-directed behaviors [1]. Given that social cognition may play a prominent role in clinical care of most psychiatric and neurological illnesses [2], including neurodegenerative conditions, an emerging literature addresses the study of the neurobiological processes underlying social interactions and the behavioral correlates of the breakdown of these processes. In particular, growing evidence suggests that neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are associated with some level of social cognitive impairment that has the potential to disrupt interpersonal relationships, thereby eliminating the benefits that social interactions may have for patients with other neurocognitive impairments. However, the frequency, extent, and clinical correlates of these abnormalities are not fully established. This review aims to summarize some of the basic components of social cognition, also referring recent hypotheses derived from network-based approaches, and to discuss clinical manifestations of social cognitive dysfunctions in most NDs, addressing the pertinent literature published in the last 10 years. 1.1. Social Cognition, Social Behavior, and Social Functioning. The term ""social"" implies that the processing demands are related to specific classes of stimuli, such as emotional expressions on a face, in the voice, or from body posture, also including higher-order functions, such as making inferences about other people's mental states (e.g., theory of mind (ToM)), making moral decisions, regulating emotions and feelings, and experiencing and expressing empathy [1, 3, 4]. Moreover, at the outset, it is useful to clarify the significance of social behavior, cognition, and functioning, which are substantially related to one another. ""Social cognition"" refers to any cognitive processing (e.g., perception, reasoning, memory, attention, motivation, and decision-making) that appears to be relatively specialized for the social domain. It causes ""social behavior"" that comprises the readily observable interactions between an individual and other people, while ""social functioning"" is broader than social behavior in that it consists in the long-term and contextualized ability of an individual to interact with others (i.e., social behavior when integrated over time and context) [5]. Finally, the ""social brain"" historically refers to a number of brain structures, some of which, when damaged, may be involved in the impairment of social cognition and behavior (i.e., ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction and superior temporal cortex, insula, and fusiform gyrus) [3], while others have been found activated in healthy brains when people perform social tasks in a magnetic resonance scanner by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [1, 3, 6]. Furthermore, considering that no social process can be attributed to a single structure alone, the recent network-based approach to brain function, principally related to the growing implementation of resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies, allowed the identification of a distributed network supporting social function, which included regions from the original social brain [1, 6, 7]. 1.2. Network-Based Approach to Social Cognition. A core social cognition network is centered on the amygdala which has been proven to play a pivotal role in emotion processing, from triggering emotional responses to detecting socially salient stimuli and performing social affiliative behaviors [4, 8, 9], and to be connected to multiple brain regions involved in emotion circuits [10, 11]. Abnormalities within this network, comprising most components of the social brain (i.e., medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, inferior frontal gyrus, and superior temporal sulcus), have been revealed in patients affected by schizophrenia [12, 13], frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) [14, 15], and autism spectrum disorder [16-18]. In particular, activation in the OFC and ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been shown to be not essential for affective responses, but critical for the attribution of meaning to an affective stimulus [19], while activation in the lateral part of the prefrontal region has been found to be associated with a feeling of displeasure and inhibits behavior [20]. Therefore, alterations in these areas may lead to inappropriate social behaviors [21, 22]. A second network involved in social cognition is the so-called ""mentalizing"" network, which includes the right temporoparietal junction as a key region [23], found to be activated when a subject spontaneously tracks others' mental states [24, 25] and when mentalizing is required as part of another judgment, such as in the case of moral judgments [26] or even when a subject observes a scenario in which a protagonist holds a false belief [27, 28, 29]. In this regard, while ToM refers to the cognitive ability to infer and reason about our own and other people's beliefs, intentions, or emotions, empathy consists in a basic perceptual capacity of understanding others' feelings and subjective psychological states [30], motivating prosocial behaviors [31]. The empathy network, the third circuit implicated in social cognition, includes cingulo-insular structures [32] and has been shown to be impaired in several neuropsychiatric conditions [33, 34]. Finally, of interest for social interactions is also the so-called ""mirror neuron system"", mainly involving the inferior frontal gyrus, the inferior parietal lobule, the fusiform face area, and the superior temporal sulcus [35, 36], activated during the observation of the actions of others, including emotion recognition [37, 38], and, therefore, typically impaired in autism [39-41]. 1.3. Clinical Assessment of Social Cognition. From a clinical point of view, failures of social cognition, most often characterized by impairment of one or more of the four networks cited above, have been assessed using more specific tools useful to investigate the four different domains. Evidence underlined the need for introducing validated tasks of social cognition in the assessment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases [42-44]. In particular, some neurological disorders, characterized by the neurodegeneration of frontomedian areas, such as the behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), need more specific neuropsychological testing of social cognition for assessing frontomedian cortex functions, in contrast to the well-known sensitivity of executive tests mainly for the frontolateral cortex [45]. With regard to social cognitive measures designed to detect abnormal social behaviors, a range of informant-rated measures (i.e., patients' self-report data might be distorted because of the lack of emotional insight), such as those derived from the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) [46] and Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) [47], both exploring changes in personality and behavior that are associated with frontoexecutive dysfunction, and from Socioemotional Dysfunction Scale (SDS) [48], Social Inappropriateness Scale [49], and Social Impairment Rating Scale (SIRS) [50], focused on the detection of interpersonal phenomena and social impairment. With regard to assessing ToM abilities, several tools allow exploring a patient's ability to infer what others are thinking and feeling, and to reason about how their thoughts and feelings will influence their behavior. False-belief tasks [51] are extensively validated measures of ToM that assess the ability to disregard one's own knowledge about the world and consider that someone else might have a different, erroneous belief. Measures that assess social inference, such as the ability to detect sarcasm, also provide insight into the potential difficulties related to social interaction, such as The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT) [52] that allows the detection of sincerity. ToM alterations can also be assessed with the Strange Stories test [53], in which patients are asked to demonstrate their understanding of stories in which characters' behavior can be best understood by attributing to him/ her a specific underlying mental state. The Faux-Pas Test [54] also involves a series of written stories, but patients are asked to detect the faux pas and to understand beliefs, intentions, and inappropriateness. Finally, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) [55] explores the ability to make inferences on the basis of observable features, such as facial expression and eye gaze, asking participants to infer the mental state of a person on the basis of a photograph of their eyes and the surrounding area. To provide potential insights into empathic disturbances, valuable information may be derived from self-rated and informant-rated measures of affective empathy, such as the Empathic Concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Inventory (IRI-EC) [56], which investigates the feelings of warmth, compassion, and concern for others; the Perspective-Taking subscale of the IRI (IRI-PT), which allows distinguishing between affective abnormalities that reflect a lack of caring and those that reflect a lack of understanding; and the Empathy Quotient (EQ) [57], which measures the ability of understanding and predicting other people's affective and cognitive empathy and the nature of any emotional response to other people. Finally, among emotion-relevant performance tasks, which consist in evaluating emotional response to viewing photographs or videos, the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) [58] allows differentiating between mental state understanding (cognitive empathy) and subjective emotional response (affective empathy). Deficits of social perception may be manifested as a deficit in identifying others' emotions, and this dysfunction may be assessed through the presentation of static photographs of high-intensity facial expressions. In this regard, the most commonly used task is the Ekman Faces, the one for assessing emotion labelling and discrimination [59]: participants are asked to identify which emotion is shown by a picture of a face and whether two faces show the same or different emotions. Moreover, to evaluate the intensity of a facial expression, the ""Facial Expressions of Emotion: Stimuli and Tests"" includes images that vary in their emotional intensity, enabling clinicians to create tasks that are graded in difficulty. The breadth and specificity of difficulties in recognizing emotions can be assessed with batteries of tests, such as the Comprehensive Affect Testing System [60] and the Florida Affect Battery [61], which use not only visual stimuli, but also auditory. Both of these batteries incorporate multiple subtasks that assess the ability to process visual (facial expressions), auditory (prosody), and visual-auditory (simultaneous facial expressions and prosody) emotional information. The evaluation of the ability to integrate social perceptual cues with contextual information that forms part of normal social encounters can also be clinically useful. One measure that can be used for such an assessment is the Emotion Evaluation Test, which forms part of TASIT Part 1 [52], evaluating the ability to recognize emotions from dynamic, multimodal stimuli that are embedded into specific social scenarios. In particular, participants are shown videos in which an actor interprets one of seven basic emotions, sometimes with ambiguous dialogue, sometimes without any dialogue and they are asked to identify the emotional expression depicted. In summary, when social cognitive dysfunction is suspected on the basis of clinical evidence, at least one measure of each of the four social cognitive domains should be evaluated [5] and, if specific social cognitive deficits are identified, a more comprehensive assessment that focuses on the domain(s) in question should be conducted. In this regard, Table 1 summarizes the abovementioned assessment tools, reporting the neurological disorders in which impairment of social cognition domains has been explored and the respective neuroanatomical correlates of these dysfunctions. The selection of the more appropriate protocol should be guided by the clinical validity of the tests to be administered (i.e., sensitivity and specificity for the neurological disorder of interest) and by the existence of population norms [5], and potential disadvantages may be linked to the lack of population norms in the case of some measures. 2. Social Cognition Abnormalities in Neurodegenerative Disorders 2.1. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Frontotemporal Disease Spectrum Disorders (ALS-FTSD) 2.1.1. Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD). Social cognition has been reported as selectively vulnerable in FTLD, a term that grouped a clinically and pathologically complex spectrum of non-Alzheimer neurodegenerative disorders featured by selective and progressive atrophy of frontal, insular, and temporal brain lobes [62]. In the late 19th century, this complex group of disorders was denominated as Pick's disease in homage to Arnold Pick who helped in the study and description of these disorders. Although FTLD is considerably uncommon compared to Alzheimer's disease, this disease spectrum is one of the most important causes of young onset dementia and entails high clinical and socioeconomic costs [63]. Three major FTLD clinical syndromes, described considering the predominant clinical manifestations, are the bvFTD, mainly featured by disturbances in social behavior and in executive functioning [64, 65]; the primary progressive aphasias (PPAs) (semantic variant (svPPA), nonfluent agrammatic variant (nfvPPA), and logopenic variant), a group of disorders mainly characterized by linguistic and behavioral alterations [66]); and the syndromes characterized by the cooccurrence of FTLD with neurological disorders mainly affecting cortical and subcortical brain areas, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [67], progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and the corticobasal syndrome (CBS) [63], which mainly affect motor functions, but also impact social behavior. (1) Alterations in the Four Domains of Social Cognition. Social cognition deficits are pervasive in FTLD. However, among the aforementioned syndromes, dysfunctions in social interaction processes have been mostly described in patients with bvFTD [64, 65]. In particular, six core symptoms are recognized in the revised diagnostic criteria [64]: (i) early (i.e., within the first three years of symptom onset) behavioral disinhibition, for example, socially inappropriate behavior, loss of manners or decorum, or impulsive actions; (ii) early apathy or inertia; (iii) early loss of sympathy or empathy, for example, diminished response to other people's needs and feelings and diminished social interest; (iv) early perseverative, stereotyped, or compulsive/ritualistic behavior, for example, repetitive movements and stereotypy of speech; (v) hyperorality and dietary changes, for example, altered food preferences, binge eating, and oral exploration of inedible objects; and (vi) executive dysfunction; with at least 3 of these 6 features required for a diagnosis of bvFTD. In bvFTD patients, impairments have been described in different social cognitive processes associated with previous behaviors ranging from basic affective to more high-order and reflexive processes [65, 68-71] and, interestingly, bvFTD has been proposed as a disease model for studying interactions between emotion processing, social cognition, and interoception [72]. In particular, with regard to basic social cognitive processes, bvFTD patients can exhibit emotion-processing alterations, including abnormalities of the perception of emotional and social cues [73-76], altered empathic concern [77], and alterations in affective expression that includes the presence of apathy or, by contrast, euphoric mood states, overfamiliarity, jocularity, and silliness [78, 79]. Furthermore, the bvFTD patients may present disturbances in the more reflexive social cognitive processes including reduced theory of mind abilities [43], mentalizing deficits [80], diminished prosocial sentiments [81], and reduced long-term cooperative behaviors [70, 82, 83]. Recently, impaired performances at RMET have been revealed to better discriminate bvFTD patients from healthy subjects or Alzheimer's disease patients than altered performances in executive tests, thereby underlining the relevance of social cognition abnormalities in bvFTD diagnosis [84-89]. In particular, executive function tests, such as Stroop task and Trail Making Test, have been shown to be less disease specific than social cognition tests, such as the RMET, for the differential diagnosis across different forms of dementia [85-89]. In support of this, recent meta-analyses confirmed the central role of ToM in bvFTD diagnosis by showing significantly higher and domain-specific impairments of ToM (and emotion recognition) in bvFTD in comparison to control subjects and Alzheimer's disease [90] or other clinical conditions including multiple psychiatric, neurological, and developmental disorders [91]. However, questionnaires that also account for behavioral disorders, such as apathy evaluation scale (AES) [92] and FrSBe scale, especially in the informant-report version, have been shown to significantly differentiate bvFTD patients from healthy controls [84]. Of note, some of the most frequent behavioral symptoms in bvFTD, including apathy, impulsivity, and disinhibition, have been associated to implicit difficulties in social interaction and alterations in the processing of social cues, suggesting a tight interplay between social cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in this condition [68, 93]. Thus, the apathetic presentation of bvFTD includes patients who have a lack of interest in their social surroundings as they present difficulty in initiating, planning, and motivating social behavior, related to atrophy in frontal areas and basal ganglia [93-95]. Along this vein, impulsive and disinhibited bvFTD patients exhibit inappropriate social behavior including undue familiarity, disorganized behaviors, and sexual acting out related to impaired mechanisms of cognitive control as a consequence to atrophy in the OFC, frontal ventromedial, and cingulate cortices and anterior temporal areas [96]. Alterations in the social cognitive process can also transfer to moral domains in bvFTD patients, who may show altered moral judgments, displaying more utilitarian judgments in the face of moral dilemmas [97, 98], a pattern also observed in extreme criminal terrorists [99]. Moreover, these patients can display increased antisocial and criminal behavior [100, 101], as well as a relatively high incidence of legal violations [102] and a heightened expression of counter-empathy emotions such as envy and gloating for others' misfortunes [103]. With regard to the ability to make judgements about others' behavior, attitudes, and emotions (i.e., social perception and empathy domains), patients with bvFTD may experience impaired emotion recognition, empathy, and sarcasm detection [73, 77, 104, 105]. In particular, performance on the newly developed TASIT-S, regarding emotion recognition and sarcasm detection, has been revealed impaired in bvFTD and relatively intact in AD [14]. However, although most studies have focused on the verbal categorization of facial expressions [106], deficits have also been reported under different task conditions and stimulus modalities including vocal [107], bodily [108], and musical [109] expressions of emotion. Moreover, the emotion recognition of film stimuli is also impaired [75, 110], although the psychological reactivity to negative film stimuli does not appear to differ from controls [75]. In addition to these deficits in recognizing emotions in others, bvFTD patients have also shown abnormal emotion suppression, emotion generation, and experience of self-conscious emotion, as revealed for bvFTD patients viewing disgust-invoking stimuli, who have been shown to display reduced facial expressions of disgust, reduced physiological reactivity, and reduced self-reported experience of disgust, compared to controls [111]. Furthermore, a deficit in social context processing was observed in the performance of FTLD patients in the empathy for pain task (EPT) [77], a suitable instrument that evaluates empathy in the context of intentional/accidental harm. Accidental pain situations are less clear and explicit; hence, they require greater demands to ascertain the action's intentionality and integration of contextual information. When performing the EPT, the FTLD patients do not easily discriminate between accidental and intentional situations revealing difficulties in integrating social context cues and agents' intentionality [73]. With regard to linguistic variants of FTLD, namely PPAs including svPPA and nfvPPA, some evidence also revealed alterations in several social cognitive processes. Several reports showed deficits in face and emotion recognition, and in ToM processes in both svPPA and nfvPPA [109, 112-114]. (2) Neuroanatomical Bases of Social Cognition Impairment in FTLD and Network-Based Approaches. Most of the aforementioned behavioral alterations might reflect a general disturbance in different neural networks. To date, it has been reported that the functioning of three neural networks can be altered in FTLD, including the salience network, the dorsal attention network, and the default mode network. Firstly, the salience network (SLN) [115] composed of the anterior cingulate, insula, striatum, and amygdala, which is activated in healthy subjects during tasks requiring attentional selection, task switching, and self-regulation of behavior, has been reported as impaired in FTLD as a consequence of atrophy over the main hubs of SLN [115]. In particular, the insula, a key region of SLN, is highly connected with the anterior portion connecting with the lateral OFC, while the posterior portion connects with the superior temporal cortex; in bvFTD, both the ventral (frontoinsular) and dorsal areas of the anterior insular are affected [116]. Degeneration of these connected areas has been shown to be related to the impairment of emotion recognition and processing [109, 117], social cognition [118], and interoception [119] in bvFTD. Secondly, it has been reported that in FTLD there is an abnormal increased connectivity in other networks including the dorsal attention network and default-mode network (DMN) [120]. Alterations in connectivity patterns of those networks seem to be at the core of the decline in executive functions and attention, as well as apathy in patients with FTLD [120, 121]. Thirdly, clinical alterations in FTLD have been associated to a disorder of functional frontolimbic disconnection leading to a compensatory hyperconnectivity in prefrontal areas in response to the absence of affective feedback during the planning and execution of behavior [121]. More recently, an integrative model suggested that the functioning of a network known as the social context network (SCN), composed by fronto-temporo-insular areas, might explain the social cognitive, executive, and behavioral alterations in FTLD [68, 122-124]. Arguably, in control subjects, the SCN favors (a) to update context cues to make predictions, (b) to consolidate context-target associative learning, and (c) to coordinate internal and external milieus [68, 122]. In linguistic variants, comparative analysis of regional gray matter related to social cognition deficits have revealed a differential pattern of fronto-insulo-temporal atrophy in bvFTD, in contrast to a set of dissociable insulo-temporal areas for svPPA and for nfvPPA [112]. Thus, face and emotion recognition impairments in nfvPPA were related to the atrophy of the bilateral posterior fusiform gyrus, bilateral insular cortex, and anterior temporal lobe [112]. Conversely, emotion recognition deficits in svPPA have been associated to atrophy in left temporal structures and also to amygdala atrophy [125]. Finally, deficits in ToM in nfvPPA have been associated with temporal pole and insular cortex degeneration. In contrast, theory of mind disturbances in svPPA are consistent with the patients' atrophy in the left temporal lobe and the medial frontal cortex [113]. Taken together, the integration of the study of social cognitive factors, such as emotion processing, empathy, ToM, moral cognition, and sociobehavioral regulation, are considered as the current target to assess complex behaviors in FTLD. In fact, a deep comprehension of the neurocognitive processes that subsume the interplay between the sociomoral cognition, the executive function, and the behavior seems to be the most robust way to create new perspectives for the diagnosis and new targets of intervention in FTLD. 2.1.2. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Its Disease Spectrum. The presence of impaired social cognition in ALS, with or without dementia, provides additional evidence in favour of the existence of an ALS-FTLD continuum and appears to have crucial implications for patients' and caregivers' training from early disease stages. ALS, the most common motor neuron disease, has been traditionally classified as a disease of the motor system. However, cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions are now recognized as an integral part of ALS-related clinical syndrome [67, 126]. In particular, about 50-60% among ALS patients may develop frontotemporal dysfunctions [67, 127], mostly characterized by executive and language impairment, variable memory dysfunctions, and/or behavioral impairment [67, 128]. Apathy is the most pronounced ALS-related behavioral change [129], while disinhibition and disorganization have been less frequently reported [130]. In addition, approximately up to 15% of ALS patients will either present with or develop FTLD, exhibiting a strong clinical and pathological overlap between ALS and FTLD [131]. Thus, the abovementioned heterogeneity results in different categorization groups across a spectrum of disease, including cognitive impairment, behavioral impairment, and ALS-FTLD [67, 131]. Impaired social cognition is now recognized as a part of the cognitive phenotype of ALS, despite the fact that there is significant heterogeneity in tasks used to study social cognition. During the last decades, an increasing body of studies focus on patients' performance in tests related to social cognition [67] and also evaluated its neuroanatomical correlates [132]. On the other hand, social cognition is included in an ALS cognitive screening testing (i.e., Edinburg Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS); [133]) and in the ""Axis II: Defining the neuropsychological deficits"" of the recently suggested diagnostic criteria for ALS-frontotemporal spectrum disorders (ALS-FTSD) [67]. Moreover, the evaluation of social cognition in ALS-FTSD may have an utmost importance in clinical settings, given the potential effects of its impairment on patients' quality of life and ability to engage in end-of-life decisions [134-136]. However, it is still debatable whether social cognition deficits are independent of other cognitive deficits in ALS or are part of the executive deficits or not [137-143] and to what degree they are associated with other cognitive deficits, including memory function [136]. Of note, a subgroup of ALS patients without dementia has been found to present impaired social cognition without executive dysfunction [140]. (1) Alterations in the Four Domains of Social Cognition. Changes in emotion-processing ability and reduced capacity in the emotional recognition of facial expressions (i.e., mostly related to negative emotions, including fear, anger, and disgust [144, 145]) is more likely in patients with ALS-FTLD [141, 146-148]. In particular, the latter, in association with the fact that the severity of social cognition deficits is much more pronounced and widespread in FTLD patients [149, 150], corroborates the existence of a considerable clinical overlapping between ALS and FTLD. Social behavior dysfunction in ALS mainly includes apathy [141]. Moreover, loss of empathy [141], deficits in emotion processing [147, 151-153] and emotional empathy attribution [139], and compromised ability to make social inferences [142, 146] have also been described in nondemented ALS patients. Patients with ALS show difficulty on tests tapping onto ToM components, exhibiting impaired abilities (i) to describe the intentions and feeling of characters [139, 142, 154], (ii) to identify and explain social faux pas [155], and (iii) to estimate preferences for objects based on the interpretation of eye gaze direction [141, 156]. Even though previous evidence revealed a more pronounced impairment in affective rather than cognitive component of ToM [157], Trojsi et al. [136] found that both cognitive and affective ToM may be impaired in the early disease stages by simultaneously comparing both ToM components [136]. Of note, cognitive ToM impairments have been mostly linked to a more general executive dysfunction [154]. Clinical variables have been directly or indirectly related to patients' ToM and other social abilities. For instance, the majority of studies with impairments include patients with an average duration of 30 months [141, 142, 155], bulbar onset [156], and/or cognitive impairment [142, 146]. With regard to the latter, it is still unclear whether social cognitive impairment is independent of other cognitive deficits (particularly executive dysfunction) or not. In particular, Watermeyer et al. [143] revealed that impaired social cognition in ALS has been mainly attributed to primary executive dysfunction, found to be the main predictor of social cognition performance above and beyond demographics, behavior, mood, and personality variables. Severe deficits in both cognitive and affective ToM have been proven to be related to apathy and impaired verbal fluency and naming [157], while early in the disease course impaired ToM has been associated to executive dysfunction [137]. On the other hand, there are several studies that failed to find an association between social cognition/ToM and executive impairment [137, 141, 155]. In this regard, Trojsi et al. [136] recently reported that both cognitive and affective ToM components are associated with nonexecutive impairment, including memory prose and visuospatial ability. (2) Neuroanatomical Bases of Social Cognition Impairment in ALS. Some multimodal studies have directly addressed in vivo the degeneration of social brain networks in ALS, using neuroimaging techniques tailored to the study of structural changes (gray matter, white matter) [139, 148] and functional alternations (fMRI) [132]. Evidence was related to the emotion circuits, including amygdala and medial prefrontal, OFC and anterior cingulate cortices, and ""mentalizing"" and ""empathy"" networks. In particular, patterns of gray matter atrophy in anterior cingulate and right frontoinsular cortices were found significantly associated with emotional and empathy performances in nondemented ALS patients [139]. Moreover, a significant decline of emotion recognition skills (particularly affecting the identification of negative emotions) has been found related to microstructural changes (measured through fractional anisotropy) in right inferior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior frontooccipital fasciculus in nondemented ALS patients [148]. Interestingly, also in ALS patients the right hemisphere has been confirmed to play a key role in the identification of others' emotions, especially those negative, with specific damage of ventral associative tracts connecting frontal, temporal, limbic, and occipital areas [147]. Focusing on the cognitive ToM component, Carluer et al. [137] detected significant correlations between cognitive ToM deficit (i.e., false-belief task) and brain metabolic rate of glucose consumption in the bilateral dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as in supplementary motor areas. These findings are in line with the involvement of dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal areas in cognitive ToM [158, 159], as well as the contribution of the supplementary motor area in the ""mirror neuron system"" [160]. 2.2. Parkinson's Disease and Parkinsonisms. Parkinson's disease (PD), mainly characterized by motor symptoms (i.e., resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability), may exhibit early nonmotor symptoms, including neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep problems, and cognitive deficits, hypothesized to be secondary to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the consequent hypostimulation of the prefrontal cortex [161]. Among nonmotor domains, social cognition has been explored in PD, especially with regard to emotion recognition and ToM abilities. However, emerging evidence has underlined the severity of nonmotor symptoms of PSP and CBS, which may substantially impact on social interactions and contribute to alter emotion recognition [162, 163]. 2.2.1. Alterations in the Four Domains of Social Cognition. As for emotion recognition in PD, several studies [164-169] revealed emotion recognition deficits in PD patients when compared to matched healthy controls. However, other studies failed to find these deficits [170-174]. A recent meta-analytic review [175], which investigated the emotion recognition from faces and voices in PD, revealed significant and modest deficits of this ability in nondemented PD patients, independently from the level of motor disability. Furthermore, several studies revealed that PD patients were more impaired in recognizing negative emotions (anger, disgust, fear, and sadness) than positive ones (happiness, surprise) [176], while other studies suggested that the recognition of negative emotions may be impaired mainly in the early stages of PD and, then, this impairment has been shown to mainly affect the positive ones [177]. In particular, Hipp et al. [178] showed that, at the early stages, PD patients might be still prone to compensate the deficient input of low contrast sensitivity that is crucial for the appreciation of negative facial emotions. Impairments of facial emotion recognition in PD patients were found to be independent of depressive symptoms [167, 179-181], executive deficits [179, 180], and clinical aspects (i.e., disease duration and severity, [180]). Moreover, some studies revealed that emotion recognition abnormalities may occur after subthalamic nucleus stimulation [182-185], probably due to alterations of projections to cortical areas, particularly the OFC, which has been already implicated in emotion recognition [186]. However, a recent study of Albuquerque et al. [187] did not confirm these findings in advanced PD. With regard to PSP and CBS, also belonging to the FTLD spectrum of neurodegeneration (i.e., abnormal function/ levels of the microtubule associated protein tau), patients affected by PSP may exhibit impaired facial (i.e., sadness and sadness) and voice emotion recognition [188, 189] as well as CBS patients, who may exhibit difficulties in recognizing disgust, sadness, surprise, and happiness, but not anger and fear [163]. Moreover, half of the PSP patients reported that social impairments negatively impacted their quality of life [190] and, in this regard, this self-perceived social impairment may be the result of the loss of emotion knowledge or breakdown of higher-order social inferences, known as ""theory of mind,"" as observed in FTLD [105]. In support of this overlap of social cognition impairment between FTLD and PSP, Shany-Ur et al. [191] assessed socioemotional comprehension, including visual perspective taking, belief representation, and emotion reading in a population of neurodegenerative patients, including patients with FTLD and PSP, using the Social Inference-Enriched (SI-E) and Social Inference-Minimal (SI-M) subtests of the TASIT [52]. They revealed that both patients with bvFTD and with PSP had significantly poorer scores than healthy controls on the TASIT SI-E ""think"" questions across verbal cue items, indicating an impaired ability to represent others' verbalized opinions/beliefs, and on the TASIT SI-E ""do"" questions across all items, indicating impaired ability to comprehend others' intentions. In particular, impairment of the comprehension of insincere communication and sarcasm was observed in PSP as well as in bvFTD patients, though to a major extent in patients with bvFTD [191]. Of note, failure to comprehend complex social interactions has been demonstrated to exacerbate patients' poor social self-monitoring and aberrant social behavior, thereby severely impacting interpersonal communication and patients' management [192]. Conversely, in CBS observation of facial apraxia, which results in the inability to express facial emotional expressions [193], and flat aprosodic speech [194] may reflect a compromised ability to express emotions. Several studies explored the two different subcomponents of ToM (i.e., affective and cognitive subcomponents) in PD patients and revealed deficits of both across the entire disease course [169, 195-198]. Importantly, Peron et al. [199] found no different performance on ToM tasks between medicated and nonmedicated PD patients at early stages, suggesting that ToM deficits could be observed in PD patients when the degenerative process has spread beyond the dopaminergic pathways, but not in the early PD patients, in whom neuronal loss is limited to the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. However, more recent studies did not confirm these findings, but revealed the occurrence of impairment of cognitive ToM in both medicated and unmedicated PD [196, 200], whereas other studies showed impairment of affective ToM [195] or deficits of both ToM subcomponents [198, 201]. Deficits of the cognitive ToM subcomponent have been found associated predominantly with executive dysfunction [198, 200, 202-204]. Conversely, Roca et al. [196] did not find any association between cognitive ToM, depression, executive dysfunctions, and medication usage. With regard to deficits of the affective ToM subcomponent, they have been associated with apathy [198] and reduced quality of life [201] and may be predicted by poor cognitive status and the dysfunction of visuospatial abilities [205]. 2.2.2. Neuroanatomical Bases of Social Cognition Impairment in PD and Parkinsonisms. With regard to structural neural bases of the deficits in facial emotion recognition, Ibarretxe-Bilbao et al. [206] revealed an association between these deficits and reduced volume in OFC, associated to the degeneration of OFC and amygdala. More recently, Baggio et al. [207] confirmed the pivotal role of abnormalities within these areas in impaired facial emotion recognition and also found that poor sadness, disgust, and anger identification were also related to dysfunction in other cortical regions, such as postcentral and right occipital fusiform gyri, ventral striatum, subgenual cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Previous neuroimaging studies, focusing on functional changes associated with the impaired recognition of emotions in PD patients, revealed that the impaired emotional facial recognition network was characterized by a decreased metabolism within the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus (BA 31), right superior frontal gyrus (BAs 10, 9, and 6), and left superior frontal gyrus (BAs 10 and 11) [208]. Furthermore, Wabnegger et al. [209] found that, when compared to healthy subjects, PD patients showed a stronger activation in somatosensory cortices, which are involved in decoding emotional states by internally generating somatosensory representations that simulate how one feels when displaying a certain facial expression and, therefore, may be substantially involved in emotion recognition (Figure 1). With regard to parkinsonisms, impaired emotion recognition in PSP patients have been associated with gray matter atrophy in the right inferior frontal gyrus [188], while in CBS neuroimaging analyses revealed that emotion-processing deficits were associated with the atrophy of the paracentral gyrus/precuneus region, as well as of the basal ganglia [163]. PSP patients have been proven to exhibit mild but significant focal deficits in social cognition [191], which is consistent with evidence showing that they may often manifest behavioral and personality changes, hypothesized to occur as a result of a disconnection between subcortical structures and the prefrontal cortex [210, 211]. With regard to neural correlates of ToM deficits in PD, Peron et al. [212] revealed a significant association between impaired ToM abilities and decreased cerebral glucose metabolism in brain areas belonging to the ""ToM network"" (i.e., bilateral cingulate gyri, middle and inferior frontal gyri, fusiform and superior temporal gyri, and bilateral parietal and bilateral occipital lobes). In addition, Diez-Ciranda et al. [213] observed that reduced gray matter volume in the precentral and postcentral gyrus and in the middle and inferior frontal gyri may be involved in ToM deficits in PD. Moreover, these authors reported an association between ToM impairment and alterations of white matter in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, adjacent to the parietal lobe, and of the white matter adjacent to the frontal lobe. In atypical parkinsonisms, ToM abilities have been poorly explored. In detail, impaired ToM abilities have been described in PSP patients [188] and found to be related to grey matter atrophy in the right inferior frontal gyrus and in the anterior medial frontal cortex, both associated to the ToM domain. Finally, Poletti and Bonuccelli [214] described a case of affective ToM impairment in a case of clinically diagnosed CBS with a bilateral 18-FDG positron emission tomography hypometabolism in the frontaltemporal-parietal cortices, more marked in the right hemisphere. However, no data have been reported about ToM abnormalities in patients affected by multisystem atrophy. 2.3. Alzheimer's Disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent neurodegenerative dementia and the first cause of neurocognitive disorder in the world, is typically characterized by an early and progressive episodic memory loss. From the neuropathological point of view, the progressive neurodegeneration initially affects the hippocampi, the entorhinal and posterior cingulate cortices, and, subsequently, the entire temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices [215]. Following this anatomical pathway, social cognition dysfunctions can occur during the course of the disease, particularly in the moderate-severe stages [216]. In contrast, earlier in the disease, social incongruities appear largely modulated by general cognitive decline in memory, language, and executive domains, rather than a genuine social dysfunction [217]. In particular, although considerably less common than in bvFTD, AD patients may present impaired social behavior, ToM, loss of empathy, facial emotion recognition, and inaccurate self-awareness, and, although uncommon as first symptoms, among alterations of social behavior, disinhibition, social awkwardness, and apathy have been reported, respectively, in 6.9%, 5%, and 2% of cases [218]. 2.3.1. Alterations in the Four Domains of Social Cognition. With regard to apathy and disinhibition, associated with AD severity, one of the most common tools for social/behavior evaluation in dementia, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [219], has been used in combination with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale [220], which is a disease severity scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 2 (severe impairment). Several NPI dimensions, but in particular apathy and disinhibition, were correlated with the CDR score. Moreover, apathy was the most prevalent in all CDR groups and the only symptom with frequencies exceeding 50% in AD patients with CDR 0.5, 1, and 2 [221]. Other types of social disturbances are rarely described in AD, such as criminal behaviors, which are more recurrent in bvFTD [101]. In fact, rarely, AD patients may present an atypical, bvFTD-like clinical profile in very early stages of disease. However, this presentation is characterized by a milder and more restricted behavioral profile than in bvFTD, with high cooccurrence of memory dysfunction and dysexecutive abnormalities, and a pattern of atrophy centered on temporoparietal regions, as in typical AD [222]. Deficits in recognizing others' emotions are reported in AD [223] and in its prodromal stage, the so-called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [224]. Most emotion recognition studies have required participants to identify emotional expressions in pictures producing mixed results, with evidence of both impaired [223, 225-227] and intact [228, 229] recognition overall. When considering specific emotions, the findings are also inconsistent. More recently, a large sample of neurodegenerative patients, including AD, was studied by using short films instead of photographs [229]. This study revealed that emotion recognition was indistinguishable by comparing the AD group to healthy controls. However, in this regard, it should be kept in mind that concomitant basic and high-level visual and visuospatial difficulties in AD may negatively impact facial recognition, which in turn translate in an impaired emotion recognition [230]. ToM deficits are reported in AD [231, 232], although ToM alterations in AD remains a controversial subject. Specifically, performances at ToM tests have been revealed to not reflect a genuine ToM deficit, rather a deficit mediated by general (and particularly executive) cognitive decline [233]. Loss of empathy has also been reported in AD, particularly as the so-called cognitive empathy (i.e., the ability to understand) in the context of a relative preservation of affective empathy (i.e., the ability to share) [234]. This pattern of spared/impaired types of empathy has been shown to be related to the vulnerability of a distributed network of regions, centered on the frontoinsular cortices, the integrity of which in AD is crucial for preserved social functioning [234]. Finally, AD patients may also present poor self-awareness of their functional limitations that may exacerbate their behavior abnormalities, as well as the reliability of the patient [235]. Self-awareness can be easily tested by asking the patient for a description of themselves, using a scale rating their competency across different domains (i.e., daily living activities and cognitive/emotional interpersonal control) (such as the Patient Competency Rating Scale) [235]. In particular, AD patients resulted in being more prone to overestimate cognitive and emotional functioning in comparison to bvFTD patients who may overestimate their functioning in all domains [235]. 3. Conclusions and Future Perspectives Abnormal interpersonal behavior is commonly observed in clinical practice, representing part of the core diagnostic criteria for many clinical disorders. Therefore, to overcome the potential consequences related to social isolation, known to be a risk factor for morbidity and mortality [2], social cognitive intervention may be prospected to reduce the negative impact of such disabilities on mental health, improving the ability to form and consolidate interpersonal networks. Among these strategies, targeted training programs may be implemented on the basis of the recent evidence of structural plasticity in well-known socioaffective and sociocognitive brain networks after training-induced behavioral improvements in healthy adults [236] and of potential advantages from targeted training programs on emotion recognition in neurodegenerative patients [104, 237]. Recently, increasing interest has been addressed to the potential benefits of pharmacotherapy on social cognition deficits, such as the potential effects of the peripheral administration of exogenous oxytocin, shown to exert prosocial effects [238-241], probably mediated by the modulation of the serotonergic system [239]. Another emerging approach is related to the use of brain stimulation techniques, such as theta burst and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to modulate empathy-related brain activity. In particular, rTMS sessions, by stimulating the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, have been revealed to be useful in improving self-reported social functioning in the case of autism spectrum disorders [242] and major depressive disorders [243]. Finally, given the critical role of caregivers' wellbeing and collaboration in any therapeutic and rehabilitation plan, treatment efforts should also be directed towards ensuring the availability of appropriate education and support for them. https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/1849794 Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding this article.

These symptoms can run the gamut from mild tingling to more severe vision loss. Start Slideshow of What is MS? Credit: Getty Images (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system, meaning it affects the brain and spinal cord. In the most common type (known as relapsing remitting MS), symptoms come and go. These can run the gamut from mild tingling to more severe vision loss. However, MS is tricky. Because so many other conditions can also cause similar symptoms, a hypochondriac could easily think they have it when they don't. On the other side, it can take years or even decades for people with MS to be diagnosed. Only a doctor can perform the appropriate tests to confirm whether these symptoms are indeed MS. of of Fatigue Credit: Getty Images Some 80% of people with MS will experience fatigue at one point or another, but fatigue can have many causes. Some people experience “MS lassitude,” a very severe fatigue that occurs daily that tends to get worse as the day wears on. “People describe it as unlike anything they’ve ever felt,” says Rosalind Kalb, Ph.D., vice president of the Professional Resource Center at the in New York City. of of Numbness Credit: Getty Images Numbness (or a lack of sensation in various parts of the body) is often one of the first symptoms to bring a person with MS to the doctor. Numbness can occur in the face, the body, or the arms and legs, and can interfere with walking, holding on to objects, and even chewing, if the numbness affects the face. Sometimes the feeling—or lack thereof—progresses over hours or days, but it usually subsides on its own. of of Tingling Credit: Getty Images Tingling is related to numbness and may feel like your arm, fingers, or toes are falling asleep, yet never quite waking up. Like other MS symptoms, this is a result of damaged nerves sending mixed signals to the different parts of the body. People may also experience something called the “MS hug.” “It feels like somebody is grabbing them very tightly around the midsection, but it’s not muscular,” says Kalb, who is also principal author of . “It’s a sensory phenomenon that feels like this tight banding.” of of Balance and coordination problems Credit: Getty Images Movement problems are a hallmark of MS. “Impaired nerve conduction means muscles are not behaving the way they used to,” explains Kalb. People may report they feel suddenly weak in one limb or they may find objects slipping easily out of their hands. If there’s damage to the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance, people might also be unsteady on their feet and prone to falling. of of Spasticity Credit: Getty Images Spasticity can involve both stiffness as well as involuntary muscle contractions. As a symptom of MS, it’s most common in the legs and may manifest as a mild feeling of tightness in the muscles or as more severe pain. In extreme cases, spasticity can cause a person’s body to become distorted and twisted, almost as if they’re folded up like a pretzel. The symptom often goes hand-in-hand with weakness of the limbs or other parts of the body. of of Vision problems Credit: Getty Images Like numbness, vision problems are one of the most common early symptoms prompting a person to visit the doctor. The problem can manifest as double vision, eye pain, blurred vision, or a scotoma (it looks like a hole in your vision). These symptoms usually result from optic neuritis or inflammation of the optic nerve, says Mark Keegan, M.D., associate professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Although vision problems can interfere with working and driving, they do tend to resolve on their own. of of Pain Credit: Getty Images “The majority of people with MS do experience pain related to their MS,” says Kalb. The pain is often the direct result of nerves damaged by the disease. If this is the case, the person may feel severe burning sensations in their legs, feet or hands, or might imagine a knife is stabbing the side of his or her face because the nerves on that side are inflamed. But pain can also be musculoskeletal, resulting not from nerve damage, but from impaired gait that causes misalignment of the hips and spine. of of Bladder dysfunction Credit: Getty Images Bladder problems in people with MS can manifest in two, seemingly opposite ways. Some people have difficulty emptying their bladder. That means urine stays too long in the bladder, leading to infection, discomfort, and a distended bladder. Or people might have the opposite problem with the bladder responding to even the tiniest bit of fluid. “You’re always feeling like you have to go to the bathroom but there’s nothing there,” says Kalb. The brain is either telling the bladder it’s full when it’s empty, or signaling it’s empty when it’s full. of of Constipation Credit: Getty Images The most common bowel problem related to MS is constipation. “This is because the nerves and muscles are not doing what we most of the time take for granted, which is moving things efficiently through the system,” Kalb says. The problem can be compounded if the person also has bladder dysfunction and is cutting back on water. “That only contributes to the constipation problem,” Kalb says. of of Dizziness and vertigo Credit: Getty Images Fortunately, dizziness and vertigo aren’t among the most common MS symptoms as they can be, Kalb says, “truly awful.” At their worst, people feel they “can’t get the world to stop spinning and have to stay in bed until it goes away,” she adds. The good news is that the symptoms often do go away and, for others, common drugs used to treat dizziness and vertigo in otherwise healthy people can be effective. of of Sexual dysfunction Credit: Getty Images There are three types of sexual problems related to MS, and the first is direct neurological damage to the nervous system. For women, that means loss of sensation, loss of vaginal lubrication, and an inability to achieve orgasm. For men, it can mean sensory changes as well as difficulty getting and maintaining an erection and difficulty reaching orgasm. In addition, people with MS might feel reticent about sex because they’re tired or are worried about bladder control. Some MS medications can also affect sexual function. of of Depression Credit: Getty Images Not surprisingly, depression is common among people with MS. Changes in the immune system can contribute to depression, as can biochemical changes in the brain. But simply living with a chronic, unpredictable disease can trigger depression. “The most important thing for people with MS and their families to understand is that this is not about being weak or crazy or somehow emotionally damaged,” says Kalb. “This is a symptom of MS just like any other symptom that needs to be appropriately treated.” of of Cognitive dysfunction Credit: Getty Images Cognitive dysfunction affects upwards of 60% of people with MS, says Kalb. The good news is that only specific areas are affected. This could be recent or “working” memory or the speed at which a person is able to process information. Or a person may have trouble focusing or multi-tasking. Once these problems start, they often don’t go away, but they do progress slowly. “With appropriate diagnosis and strategies for managing, people can stay ahead of it and use compensatory strategies,” says Kalb. Cognitive changes are severe for only a small percentage of people. of of Anxiety Credit: Getty Images This is the “poor second cousin to depression,” says Kalb. That’s because depression gets all the attention, though anxiety can be equally debilitating. Not only are there organic changes in the brain that result in anxiety, but the ongoing, uncertain nature of MS can be nerve-wracking. MS can also involve mood swings and irritability, although the irritability may be a consequence of depression. of of Emotional changes Credit: Getty Images About 10% of people with MS may experience “pseudobulbar affect” (PBA), a neurologic change that usually occurs in tandem with cognitive changes. Here, the expression of a mood or feeling is disconnected from how a person’s actually feeling so a person may have uncontrolled bouts of crying when they’re not actually sad or they may laugh hysterically at inappropriate times. of of Speech and voice disorders Credit: Getty Images Up to 40% of people with experience problems with their voice or speech. One possible problem is dysarthria, a motor speech problem that manifests as slurring, poor articulation of words, and speaking too loudly or too softly. Another possibility is dysphonia, a change in voice quality, such as sounding hoarse or nasal. of Replay gallery By Amanda Gardner What is MS?

a1fa8d15-03d9-4229-bf73-a9e5d83775d9,"Lupus-related Fatigue and Cognitive Dysfunction: The Chicken and the Egg Summary of a presentation to the SLE Workshop at Hospital for Special Surgery Lupus-related Fatigue and Musculoskeletal Problems Treatment of Lupus-related Fatigue: Keeping Healthy is the Best Defense In those with , (also known as systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE), the story of and is what Dr. Melanie Harrison compares to the story of the “chicken and egg.” Each symptom directly impacts the other and can wreak havoc upon the human body by forcing one to endure an ongoing cycle of confusion caused by exhaustion, which is caused by confusion, which is caused by exhaustion, and so on. Such a scenario is hard for individuals to live with and difficult for physicians to diagnose. Among the general population of the United States, fatigue is the main complaint in over ten million doctor visits, or one quarter of all visits annually. This is largely because the condition itself is so dynamic; many patients suffering from fatigue often complain of physical fatigue, where joints and bones are just worn out, while others describe more of a psychological fatigue that results from the . Still others complain simply of mental fatigue, when their mind is hazy or not operating as clearly as they believe it should. At different times and in different ways, just about anyone can suffer from one or any combination of these ailments. Despite such different ways of presenting itself, each variable symptom of fatigue is equally real and can often be much more pronounced in those with lupus. According to Dr. Harrison, those with lupus tend to experience lupus-related fatigue as “something more from inside” the human body. Though the term sounds uncertain, it lends itself to a different, and some may argue deeper, understanding of the symptom in those who experience it as a result of lupus; fatigue is more than mere listlessness. Rather, it is when one has little trouble beginning a task, but instead tires easily and has trouble keeping up (again, whether it be mentally, physically, psychologically, or otherwise). “Fatigue, especially related to autoimmune diseases like lupus, is often persistent,” Dr. Harrison says. “It’s very intangible, but you know the difference - especially those with lupus know the difference. It’s not the same thing as just having a cold, it’s not the same thing as just not getting a good night’s sleep.” Along with skin rashes and , fatigue is among the most common symptoms of lupus. Over 81 percent of those with lupus, both active and inactive, will experience troublesome fatigue that will impair their ability to live normally. Despite this high percentage, fatigue, because of the variability of the symptom and its typically subtle development, is often overlooked by both patients and physicians. Indeed, many times it is only when patients first complain of fatigue that they realize that something has ""been off"" for quite a while. This, according to Dr. Harrison, is one reason why physicians have had such trouble diagnosing it.  “Because we can’t do a blood test for it, we can’t do an for it, we don’t have specific questions…it’s really difficult for us to measure it,” says Dr. Harrison. As a result, the medical community has had little chance to study fatigue and, what is infinitely worse, rarely claims success in treating the ailment unless both a trigger and a continuous cause for the symptom are known. Causes for fatigue can be many, and this is why narrowing down one specific cause can be so difficult. From a physical standpoint, fatigue can be the result of exertion, pain, or illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, , or lupus; behaviorally, it can be caused by poor sleep, substance abuse, stress, or any other type of disruption in daily activities; and psychologically, it may result from problems such as mood disorders or cognitive dysfunction itself. Cognitive function refers to the sum of all activities that compose cognitive thought. This includes the taking in of new information, interpretation of information, creating and storing new memories, problem solving, etc. If any cognitive processes are disrupted, one is said to suffer from cognitive dysfunction. In those with lupus, 80 percent complain of cognitive problems that interrupt their life. Sometimes this can manifest itself in trivial ways such as forgetting what one is supposed to buy at the supermarket, while at other times more serious information may be in question, e.g., forgetting where to pick up one’s children. Often, cognitive dysfunction can lead to a severe decrease in quality of life because cognitive problems create a sense of insecurity. “There can be loss of independence, either because you actually can’t do things like pay the bills properly or because you’re afraid that if you try to do something, it’s not going to be done right, so you just avoid those activities,” Dr. Harrison says. “There’s a great deal of anxiety and a great deal of depression associated with it.” According to Dr. Harrison, there is also a great sense of fear surrounding cognitive dysfunction. Patients worry that the disease will progress, eventually leaving their minds “demented.” Based on her years of study, Dr. Harrison has concluded that in most cases (barring the occurrence of other medical conditions such as recurrent stroke or other conditions affecting the brain) patients suffering from cognitive dysfunction do not experience progressive symptoms. The causes of cognitive dysfunction are similar to those of fatigue. In those with lupus they can include any sort of disease affecting the central nervous system, any condition affecting the brain, psychiatric disturbances (including any one or combination of 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes outlined by the American College of Rheumatology), fever, medication (such as steroids like prednisone), sleep disturbance, pain, and fatigue. The similarities do not end there. In those with lupus, cognitive dysfunction, just like fatigue, can range from mild to severe and can manifest itself in any number of ways, leaving patients accurately describing the same symptom while each experiences it differently. “A lot of people will say that they know they are not thinking as clearly as they did before they developed lupus,” says Dr. Harrison. “Some days are definitely better than others, and some weeks are better than others, and some months are better than others, but they never quite return to what their baseline was before they had the disease.” There is no definitive treatment for cognitive dysfunction (again, because just as in fatigue, there are no specific causes that always create the condition in the human body). When placed side by side, the symptoms of fatigue and the symptoms of cognitive dysfunction are strikingly similar and are indicative of a cycle of conditions that can be crippling. Dr. Harrison clearly states the problem when she says that, “thinking becomes more difficult when you’re fatigued and when you’re concentrating on thinking clearly, it causes fatigue because your thinking is impaired. Now, which of these started this vicious cycle?” For those with lupus, a good night of sleep is among the most valuable activities in which one can engage in order to stay healthy and avoid symptoms of the disease like fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Unfortunately, 61 percent of those with lupus claim that they do not feel refreshed after a night of sleep. Typically, those with lupus have sleep problems that may include any or all of the following: Another element of sleep disorder Dr. Harrison identifies is what she calls “sleep phobia”: “Lupus patients tend to lay awake and are concerned about not sleeping, but what happens when you’re thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m not falling asleep and I have so much to do tomorrow?’” says Dr. Harrison. “The more anxious you get, the less likely that you’ll be able to fall asleep or sleep well when you do fall asleep.” As stated earlier, lack of sleep can lead to fatigue and can cause great anxiety, but it can also lead to feelings of depression, which can worsen the symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and make sleep more difficult, creating yet another “chicken and egg” scenario where one condition furthers the other in a reciprocal motion. Lupus-related Fatigue and Musculoskeletal Problems In those with lupus, as in the general population, musculoskeletal problems such as arthritis account for a significant portion of the patient complaints. Musculoskeletal problems are commonly cited as a cause for fatigue. Typically, these are not chronic, but in those with lupus, there are joint and muscle pains that are inflammatory and therefore more difficult to endure. Of those with lupus, over 95 percent claim to suffer the pain and swelling associated with arthritis (the most common symptom of lupus). An additional 20-30 percent of patients also suffer from , a condition similar to arthritis where aches and pains are present but fail to show up visibly in physical examinations or on blood tests. Again, these conditions can cause sleep disorders which, in turn, cause both fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Anemia is yet another condition that affects many in the general population, but is also commonly associated with lupus, lupus-related fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. In the bloodstream, iron is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. When a patient is anemic (defined as an iron deficiency), a situation arises in which a patient’s blood cells cannot carry enough oxygen. The body is then forced to cope by drawing more oxygen in through such means as yawning, increasing feelings of fatigue. When those with lupus experience this, they typically experience it as what Dr. Harrison calls “anemia of a chronic disease,” in which patients develop anemia slowly – the result of the inflammation in the body. “You have enough iron,” Dr. Harrison says, “but your system is just not working well.” Treatment of Lupus-related Fatigue: Keeping Healthy is the Best Defense Dr. Harrison stresses that although the medical community does not know everything there is to know about lupus-related fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, they are making great strides forward in their studies. “The moral of the story is that the cause of fatigue is not clear,” she says, “but we’ve made some progress and are learning more about the topic.” Dr. Harrison reiterates that the causes for both fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in those with lupus are numerous and can range from separate conditions within the body such as mood disorders, muscle aches, or lung ailments (such as chronic bronchitis) to external factors such as at work and in the home or medication use. Regardless of the cause, once the cycle of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction has started, the symptoms can be difficult to handle. Simply because there are questions left unanswered when dealing with lupus does not mean that physicians have no advice when it comes to limiting the effects of the disease. Dr. Harrison points out, as most medical professionals do, that it is vital to maintain a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and exercise. Keeping to these standards may not prevent all the symptoms of the disease, but in the long run it will keep one’s body strong and well prepared to deal with whatever lupus-related conditions may arise.

Life Extension Update Exclusive Ginkgo improves attention in MS patients On April 27 2005 at the American Academy of Neurology's 57th Annual Meeting Jesus Lovera, MD of the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine reported that ginkgo may help improve attention in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Dr Lovera, who is a research fellow and neurology instructor, said of ginkgo, ""It has been shown to be of benefit in Alzheimer's, but we did not know if it would work for MS. We wanted to see if there was any suggestion that it could help patients with MS that are having cognitive problems."" Dr Lovera and his colleagues at OHSU provided 20 multiple sclerosis patients with a twice daily 120 milligram ginkgo biloba supplement and gave 19 patients a placebo for 12 weeks.  Participants were tested them on attention skills before and after treatment. The researchers used a test known as a ""Stroop,"" which measures attention and includes planning, decision making and goal directed behavior. The two groups were similar in their education level, type of multiple sclerosis, years with the disease, neurophsychological test scores, and number of men and women. Test results determined that the ginkgo group was 13 percent faster on average than those who received the placebo. Dr Lovera described the difference in scores as comparable to that which would be observed between healthy people in their thirties compared to those in their fifties. Minimal side effects were reported. As ginkgo appeared to be more helpful to participants who had specific problems in the Stroop test, Dr Lovera stated that his team ""would like to do another study in which we choose patients that are impaired in this particular test. We would also like to test it at higher doses."" Protocol Multiple sclerosis The causes of MS include environmental conditions and exposures, immune system factors, possibly viruses, and genetic factors. MS is more common among Caucasians, especially those with connections to Northern Europeans, than among other races, and is very rare in groups such as Eskimos who live at high latitudes. Women are twice as likely to have MS as men. Cognitive dysfunction occurs in about half of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Fortunately, only about 10% of MS patients develop cognitive dysfunction severe enough to significantly impact daily life. Family members of MS patients are usually the first to notice changes in personality or changes in their daily routine. Cognitive dysfunction can range from not being able to find the right word in conversation to impaired reasoning ability. Measuring cognitive dysfunction requires specially trained medical professionals known as neuropsychologists. Neuropsychologists conduct a series of tests to determine the level of cognitive dysfunction present and the strengths still retained by the MS patient. Studies were conducted at the University of Wisconsin to examine the relationship between vitamin D and MS. Working with the basic research used to study the effects of vitamin D3 on mouse models, it was found that vitamin D3 could ""completely prevent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)."" EAE is the widely accepted mouse model of human MS. The working hypothesis was that vitamin D produced in the skin a selective immune system regulator capable of suppressing MS. The theory is supported by anecdotal evidence from Switzerland where a profound difference between MS rates exists between the high-altitude Swiss and the low-altitude coastal Norwegians. The study concluded that early intervention with a protocol of hormonally active vitamin D might prevent genetically susceptible people from developing MS (Hayes et al. 1997). Research into the use of vitamin B12 has been conducted in Japan and England. In Japan, researchers found that massive doses of vitamin B12 (60 mg a day for 6 months) improved visual and auditory potentials over the treatment period (Kira et al. 1994). The study in England arrived at the conclusion that for those patients below the age of 18, early symptoms were associated with lower vitamin B12 levels, compared to those patients who were older than 18 when MS was first detected (Sandyk et al. 1993). https://www.lifeextension.com/protocols/neurological/multiple-sclerosis Featured Products Ginkgo Biloba Certified Extract Ginkgo may: Help to maintain normal circulation Help to maintain the normal function and tone of blood vessels Maintain oxygen and glucose metabolism in the brain Prevent capillary fragility and blood leakage into surrounding tissue Help the normal function of factors that maintain a normal blood flow Maintain normal coagulation of blood Reduce tissue damage caused by low blood flow May help control radiation-induced brain edema in-vitro Help slow the aging process in the brain https://www.lifeextension.com/newshop/items/item00778.html Vitamin D capsules Vitamin D is necessary for utilization of calcium and phosphorus and in many ways acts as a hormone. The two most important forms of vitamin D are cholecalciferol (D3), which is derived from our own cholesterol and ergocalciferol (D2), a plant analogue derived from the diet. The cholecalciferol supplied by the Life Extension Buyers Club is synthetic, but its form is identical to that which is derived from cholesterol and synthesized by sunlight on the skin. Cholecalciferol Vitamin D is essential for bone growth and maintenance of bone density. A dietary deficiency of vitamin D inhibits the production of the protein that binds calcium in the intestines, so that calcium cannot be absorbed, even if there is adequate intake. Deficiencies of vitamin D are often found in the elderly and in women who have low intake of milk and receive inadequate exposure to sunlight. https://www.lifeextension.com/newshop/items/item00251.html Questions?

It can cause symptoms that come and go, including numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, vision problems and trouble walking or talking. In this protocol, learn about the causes of MS and what treatments are available. Discover how an imbalanced immune system contributes to the inflammation that drives the disease. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to modulate the immune response in MS and help improve symptoms, in some clinical trials. What is Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath—the coating that insulates and protects neurons. This demyelination causes disruptions in neural communication and potentially neuronal death, leading to disability. MS may follow several disease courses, the most common of which is relapsing remitting. Relapsing remitting MS is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks followed by periods of remission. Natural interventions such as vitamin D and essential fatty acids may help relieve inflammation and improve symptoms of MS. What are the Risk Factors for Multiple Sclerosis? Genetic predisposition Viral infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) Vitamin D deficiency Hormonal imbalance Exposure to organic solvents Food sensitivities Smoking What are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Note: Symptoms of MS vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms may include: Fatigue Numbness or tingling in limbs Impaired vision Muscle weakness, clumsiness Loss of balance, dizziness, potential nausea and vomiting Bladder dysfunction Changes in memory, reasoning, and spatial perception What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis? Note: There is currently no cure for MS. Treatments include therapies to calm acute attacks, slow or modify the disease course, and alleviate symptoms. Several experimental therapies are currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Therapies for acute attacks: Corticosteroids Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange to remove inflammatory factors and antibodies) Disease-modifying therapies: Beta interferons to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression Glatiramer acetate, an immunomodulator Immunosuppressant drugs (eg, mitoxantrone) Monoclonal antibodies (eg, natalizumab) Dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker, to increase the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses Symptom management may include: muscle relaxants medications to reduce fatigue antidepressants What are Additional Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis? Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech therapy Cognitive rehabilitation Vocational rehabilitation Swank low-fat diet Hormone therapy What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Multiple Sclerosis? Vitamin D. As vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS, supplementation may be helpful. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that MS patients taking vitamin D had fewer relapses and less inflammation. Essential fatty acids. Omega-3 (ie, DHA and EPA) and certain omega-6 (ie, GLA) fatty acids have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve some symptoms of MS. Antioxidants. Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, and MS patients tend to have low levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione peroxidase. Supplementing with selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, and/or N-acetylcysteine may boost glutathione peroxidase levels for potential benefits. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to inhibit the activity of ICAM-1, a protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Supplementation with lipoic acid reduced ICAM-1 levels and T-cell migration into the central nervous system in patients with MS. Vitamin B12. Patients with MS may be deficient in vitamin B12. Supplementation has been shown in several studies to improve symptoms and the clinical course of the disease in patients with MS. Biotin. Biotin (vitamin B7) has demonstrated positive effects in patients with MS. Studies showed high doses of biotin improved measures of MS-related disabilities in some patients. Other natural interventions that may benefit patients with MS include coenzyme Q10, ginkgo biloba, green tea, and curcumin. 2 Introduction Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of autoimmunity and inflammation characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath that insulates and protects neurons. When a patient experiences an ""attack,"" or episode of increased disease activity, the resultant impairment of neuronal communication can manifest as a broad spectrum of symptoms, affecting sensory processing, locomotion, and cognition. Scientific research suggests both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease. Current medical treatments for MS include potent immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce immune function, and anti-inflammatory medications as well as invasive procedures such as plasma exchange, which attempts to reduce inflammatory mediators in a patient's blood. Largely ignored and discounted by mainstream medicine, nutrients offer immune-modifying benefits that can help complement pharmacological and clinical interventions and improve quality of life for MS patients. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests vitamin D may be a missing link in virtually all autoimmune diseases, including MS. This single vitamin has the ability to modulate the immune system in ways that even pharmaceutical drugs cannot. A multitude of epidemiological studies have revealed that individuals with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are at considerably increased risk for developing MS; in fact, up to 90% of MS patients are deficient in vitamin D.1 3 Understanding Multiple Sclerosis Within the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) a vast network of neurons are constantly communicating amongst themselves, and with the peripheral nervous system (outside of the brain and spinal cord), to control every aspect of human function, from sight and hearing, to cognition and mobility. The efficiency and accuracy of communication between individual neurons form the basis for our ability to do things as diverse as complete simple daily tasks and comprehend complex philosophical or mathematical ideas. Neuronal communication is similar to the transmission of an electrical current through a series of wires. Droves of neurons work together to deliver messages to every corner of the body by transmitting signals along their long, cylindrical mid-sections called axons and passing it on to the next neuron. This is repeated until the message reaches its destination. Like electrical wires, neuronal axons require insulation to ensure that they are able to transmit a signal accurately, and at high speeds. Specialized cells called oligodendrocytes provide this insulation to neurons by wrapping the axons in an insulating material called myelin. Without this myelin sheath, neuronal communication becomes nearly impossible, and neurons become susceptible to damage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease which ultimately leads to the inability of neurons to communicate amongst themselves. Because multiple sclerosis is not selective for specific neurons, and can progress through the brain and spinal cord randomly, each patient's symptoms may vary considerably. During the initial stages of the disease, symptoms often emerge for a finite time before regressing for an extended period. 4 Pathology of Disease Progression Demyelination MS is an immuno-inflammatory disease in which immune cells enter the central nervous system (CNS) and destroy the myelin sheath. Immune cells, which become activated through complex mechanisms migrate into the CNS, and attack the myelin sheath. The resultant demyelination is thought to be carried out by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages, three primary classes of immune cells, which are routinely found in MS lesions.2 Loss of myelin followed by subsequent lack of neural communication and neuronal death is accepted as the primary cause of disability in MS patients.3 Axonal transection, or the severing of axons, occurs under conditions of both acute and chronic demyelination.4-6 Remyelination Remyelination is the process by which demyelinated axons are naturally re-wrapped with myelin, restoring nerve conduction and functionality.7 This phenomenon is the result of oligodendrocytes repairing the damage to the myelin sheath that occurs during an episode of increased disease activity. However, as the disease progresses over years (usually decades) the oligodendrocytes begin to lose their ability to repair the damage, and symptoms become progressively worse and episodes more frequent due to remyelination failure. In addition to developing therapies that slow MS disease progression, many laboratories are developing novel therapeutics that aim to promote remyelination and reverse existing CNS damage. Inflammation In addition to immune-mediated loss of myelin, another characteristic feature of MS is inflammation caused by a class of white blood cells called T cells.8,9 Some of the damage in the CNS is directly carried out by two subpopulations of T lymphocytes called T helper 1 and T helper 17 which produce pro-inflammatory factors.10 Recent studies have identified that chemical mediators, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), contribute to the autoimmune characteristics of these T cells. Data suggest absence of these pro-inflammatory signals was sufficient to prevent inflammation in the brain.11 This suggests that therapeutic strategies directed at blocking the production of inflammatory mediators could be effective for treating MS. Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Panacea? Mainstream medicine has failed to recognize the pivotal role of vitamin D in regulating the overactive immune system in MS patients. Greater than 30 years have passed since vitamin D was originally hypothesized to be an important environmental determinant of the prevalence of MS.12,13 During the three decades following the initial linking of vitamin D and MS, evidence has continued to mount. It is now known that MS occurs more frequently in individuals with lower blood levels of vitamin D. A study published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association found that, compared to those with the highest vitamin D blood levels, those with the lowest blood levels were 62% more likely to develop MS. MS attacks occur less frequently during seasons corresponding with the highest exposure to sunlight; since vitamin D synthesis depends upon exposure of the skin to sunlight, the summer months also bring the highest blood levels of vitamin D.14 A recent study has quantified the impact of vitamin D blood levels on risk for MS relapse—for each 4 ng/ml increase in 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the blood, the risk for MS relapse is reduced by 12%. The investigators who conducted this study concluded that ""Clinically, raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels by [20 ng/ml] could halve the hazard of a relapse.""15 Vitamin D mediates these disease-modifying effects through complex and powerful interactions with the immune system. Hostile immune cells, which attack the myelin sheath, are calmed upon exposure to vitamin D. In fact, when aggressive immune cells taken directly from MS patients are exposed to the active form of vitamin D, the cells divide and reproduce much more slowly, indicating that vitamin D has the ability to impede the aberrant autoimmunity that is a driving force in MS. However, vitamin D does more than just arrest damaging immune cells; it also supercharges protective immune cells. T-reg cells are specialized components of the immune system that help keep immunity balanced. If too few T-reg cells are present, the immune system becomes overactive, as in autoimmune diseases like MS. Vitamin D increases the number of protective T-reg cells, restoring equilibrium to an overactive immune system.16 In a randomized controlled trial, supplementation with doses of vitamin D ranging from 10,000 IU to 40,000 IU daily over the course of 52 weeks resulted in a reduction in relapses and a reduction in the number of aggressive immune cells in patients with MS.17 Despite robust findings across a range of studies on the link between vitamin D and MS, mainstream medicine and the federal government have only just recently begun to realize the need to initiate federally funded trials. Results of a large scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the effects of vitamin D in MS are currently pending.1 Life Extension customers should not be surprised if vitamin D emerges as a frontline treatment for MS in the coming years. However, instead of waiting for mainstream physicians to begin recommending vitamin D to MS patients, Life Extension suggests all individuals monitor their blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and maintain a blood level of 50–80 ng/mL. This is because low vitamin D levels are also an emerging risk factor for numerous other diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.18-22 The amount of supplementation required to achieve this blood level varies from person to person, but it appears many individuals require supplementation of 5,000‒8,000 IU vitamin D daily to reach these levels. More information about the role of vitamin D in health is available in the compelling Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""Startling Findings About Vitamin D Levels in Life Extension Members."" 5 Risk Factors for MS Genetics and Family History Studies have established a definitive role for genetics as contributing factor for developing MS. The most compelling data reveal that while unrelated adopted siblings have a 0‒2% disease risk, identical twins demonstrate a 25% disease risk.23 Several studies have identified susceptibility genes related to many aspects of immune function.24-28 While these genetic links are helpful in understanding MS population clusters, findings such as the 25% disease risk among identical twins and the geographic distribution of MS suggest that up to 75% of MS must be attributable to non-genetic or environmental factors. Infection Infection is one of the more widely suspected non-genetic risk factors for MS. Data suggest that, in genetically predisposed individuals, exposure to an infectious agent may lead to MS.29 One common theory, molecular mimicry, proposes that presentation of foreign antigens that are molecularly similar to self-antigens leads to an autoimmune response.30,31 In other words, viruses involved in the development of autoimmune diseases could possibly display very similar proteins to the proteins found on nerves making these nerves also a target for antibodies. Investigators have probed the involvement of several viruses including: herpes simplex virus (HSV), rubella, measles, mumps, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV).32 Currently, the strongest evidence for the involvement of an infectious agent implicates EBV. Virtually all patients who have MS are infected with the EBV.32 Further, levels of antibodies to EBV are strongly correlated with the risk of developing the disease.33 Low Vitamin D Levels Considering the regulatory role that vitamin D plays in immune system reactivity, it is not surprising that population-based studies have consistently found lower levels of vitamin D in the blood of patients with MS compared to healthy control subjects. Data from the Nurses' Health Study (more than 92,000 women followed from 1980 to 2000) and the Nurses' Health Study II (more than 95,000 women followed from 1991 to 2001), support the notion of a protective effect for vitamin D against the risk of developing MS. The incidence of MS was 33% lower in women that consumed the most vitamin D as compared to those that consumed the least. In addition, those that consumed at least 400 IU daily of vitamin D from supplements had an astounding 41% lower incidence of MS.18 In a recent study, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco discovered low 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels in African Americans with MS as compared to controls.34 The senior author, who is also the associate director of UCSF Multiple Sclerosis Center concluded, ""It seems relatively clear low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis."" Hormones Studies have shown that MS is more common in women than men, and that the disease course is affected by the fluctuation of steroid hormones during the female menstrual cycle.35 It is also widely reported that MS patients who become pregnant experience a significant decrease in relapses, enabling women who have MS to bear children safely.36 Animal models of multiple sclerosis have shown that the pregnancy hormone, estriol, can ameliorate disease and can cause an immune shift.36,37 Other studies note that pregnant women who have MS tend to experience a rebound of their disease within three months post-delivery.38 These findings suggest hormones can regulate the course of MS, and this theory is further supported by research demonstrating that steroid hormones (eg, estrogens, testosterone, progesterone, and, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) can modulate the immune system.39-41 The specific relationship of hormones to the disease process of MS is complex, with ratios between the individual hormones also playing a role. For example, during a human study that examined the presence of MS lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients with high estradiol and low progesterone levels had more lesions that those who had low levels of both hormones. Further, patients with a high estrogen to progesterone ratio had a significantly greater number of ""active,"" inflamed lesions than patients who had a low ratio.42 These studies suggest that maintaining youthful hormone balance may ease the symptoms of MS. A study from Italy provided further evidence that abnormal hormone levels may play a role in the development of MS. The investigators measured hormone levels in 35 women and 25 men with MS, and in 36 people without the disease. Women with low testosterone levels were found to have more brain tissue damage, as determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The women with MS had lower levels of testosterone throughout their monthly cycle compared to women who did not have the condition. Testosterone levels did not vary between men with MS and unaffected men. However, men with MS who had the highest levels of the female hormone estradiol were found to have the greatest degree of brain tissue damage.43 More information about optimizing and balancing hormone levels can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols. Organic Solvents In the mid-1990s, researchers in Sweden evaluated 13 studies investigating the connection between solvent exposure and autoimmune disease. Organic solvents include chemicals such as toluene, paint thinner, and acetone, the latter of which is commonly found in nail polish remover. Ten of those studies indicated a significant relationship between organic solvent exposure and MS. All of the analyses suggested exposure to solvents increases a person's relative risk of developing MS.44 In another study scientists analyzed the occupational health records of more than 57,000 workers in Norway, covering a 16-year period. They concluded that workers, such as painters, who are routinely exposed to organic solvents, had twice the risk of developing MS than those who were not occupationally exposed. These results were compatible with the hypothesis that organic solvents are a possible risk factor for MS.45 Individuals interested in protecting themselves from organic solvents and other environmental toxins should read Life Extension's ""Metabolic Detoxification"" protocol. Food Sensitivities Sensitivities to certain foods may also play a role in the development or exacerbation of MS. Antibodies to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, is more common in patients with MS.46,47 MS is also most prevalent in areas where consumption of wheat gluten and milk are also high.48 This relationship led scientists to explore a possible link between antibodies produced to bovine milk proteins and the ability of those antibodies to cross-react to the protective sheathes around nerves triggering an MS episode. Indeed, this immunologic cross-reactivity has been demonstrated in the laboratory in rodents that have MS.49,50 Further investigations have revealed that in MS patients, higher levels of these antibodies are produced within the central nervous system.51 Additional studies are still needed to understand how this cross-reactivity plays into the development and progression of MS. To help rule out food sensitivities, Life Extension suggests blood testing such as the Food Safe Allergy test and the Celiac Disease Antibody Screen. Call 800-226-2370 for more information on how to obtain this type of testing. Additional information about food allergies is available in the Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""What's Really Making You Sick?"" Smoking A recently published literature review, evaluating more than 3,000 MS cases and 450,000 controls, supports the emerging consensus that smoking increases the risk of developing MS by approximately 50%.52 It is unlikely that smoking alone accounts for the worldwide variation in MS prevalence, and thus, the interplay between genetic markers and smoking has also been investigated. One such study reported that smokers that have two known genetic markers for MS had two times the risk for developing MS than their non-smoking counterparts.53 Another study has also verified that smokers diagnosed with MS but in remission have 3.5 times the risk of reactivating and progression of their disease than their non-smoking counterparts.54,55 6 Symptoms and Diagnosis MS can affect people of all ages; however, the average age of disease onset is between 20 and 40 years.48 Fatigue, numbness in the limbs, impaired vision, muscle weakness, loss of balance, and bladder dysfunction are frequent symptoms. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers.48 Symptoms affecting mobility tend to appear early in the course of MS and they may include weakness, clumsiness, leg dragging, stiffness, and a tendency to drop objects. Common sensory symptoms include numbness, sensations of heaviness, tingling, and electrical sensations. Visual symptoms are also common, affecting more than one-third of all people who have MS. The classic visual disturbances, such as blurred or foggy vision and eyeball pain, usually appear early in the course of the disease. MS can also interfere with the nerves that supply the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which is where balance is perceived. This can result in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. In the later stages of the disease, involvement of the genitourinary tract may result in loss of bladder, sexual, and bowel function.56 Over 40% of MS patients suffer from changes in memory, reasoning, spatial perception, and verbal fluency.57 Symptoms of MS are often triggered or worsened by an increase in body temperature. MS is a tremendously variable and unpredictable disease. Different patients will experience different symptoms, rates of disease progression, and responses to treatment. Four Disease Courses Have Been Identified in MS Progressive relapsing (PR) MS, which is the least common disease course, shows progression of disability from onset but with clear acute relapses, with or without full recovery. Approximately 5% of people with MS appear to have PRMS at diagnosis. Secondary progressive (SP) MS begins with an initial relapsing-remitting disease course, followed by progression of disability. Typically, secondary-progressive disease is characterized by: less recovery following attacks, persistently worsening functioning during and between attacks, and accompanied by progressive disability. Many patients with RRMS do develop SPMS ultimately. Primary progressive (PP) MS is characterized by progression of disability from onset, without plateaus or remissions or with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements. A person with PPMS, by definition, does not experience acute attacks. Ten percent of diagnosed MS are PPMS. Relapsing remitting (RR) MS represents 85% of clinical diagnoses of the disease. It is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks with full recovery or with residual deficit upon recovery. Periods between disease relapses are characterized by a lack of disease progression. Diagnosis No single test gives a definitive diagnosis for MS, and variable symptoms and disease course make early diagnosis a challenge. Most presumptive diagnoses of MS are based on the clinical symptoms seen in an acute attack. These presumptions are then supported by a combination of diagnostic imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), antibody testing of the fluid found in the CNS, measurements to evaluate how efficiently nerves conduct impulses (since demyelination slows nerve conduction) and evaluation of how the symptoms progress through time.58 7 Conventional Therapies A cure for MS has yet to be discovered, and although recent efforts have brought advances in available treatments, substantial room for improvement remains. Presently, conventional medical treatment typically focuses on strategies to treat acute attacks, to slow the progression of the disease, and to treat symptoms. Conventional Medical Treatments to Treat Acute Disease Flares Corticosteroids. For acute MS flares, corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are commonly administered in high doses to suppress the immune system and decrease the production of proinflammatory factors. These drugs are often prescribed for short periods and can be effective at alleviating the symptoms of MS. Corticosteroids should not be used for long-term therapy, however, because of their many side effects, including increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cataracts, elevated blood sugar, mood swings and weight gain. Also, while corticosteroids may reduce the symptoms of the disease, they have no effect on its progression.59 Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). Plasmapheresis is a process in which whole blood is separated into blood cells and plasma, the liquid part of blood. In MS patients the plasma contains unusually high levels of antibodies and proinflammatory factors that exacerbate symptoms. Plasma exchange helps remove these factors quickly and is sometimes used to help combat severe symptoms of multiple sclerosis relapses in people who are not responding to intravenous steroids. Conventional Medical Treatment to Modify the Course of the Disease Beta interferons. Beta interferons (Avonex, Betaseron) reduce inflammation and slow progression of the disease, but like many medications used in conventional medical treatment of MS, the mechanism of action is poorly understood60,61 This specific treatment may be accompanied by adverse effects such as suicidal depression, liver damage, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions.62 Glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is an MS treatment that yields fewer adverse side effects than beta interferon while still remaining clinically effective. Glatiramer has a chemical structure similar to the protective myelin sheath around nerves and serves as a decoy for antibodies that would otherwise attack this sheath.63 Side effects may include flushing, rapid heartbeat, nausea, shortness of breath after injection, and injection site reactions.64 Mitoxantrone and fingolimod. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) and fingolimod (Gilenya) are immunosuppressants. Clinical data show these drugs can slow the rates at which disability progresses and the rate at which new lesions form in the brain and spinal cord. These therapies, however, are not used as a first-line treatment as they can cause severe side effects including heart disease, leukemia, decreased white blood cell counts, and increased rates of infection.65 Natalizumab. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is thought to block a protein that allows white blood cells to enter the brain and spinal cord and cause disease progression in MS. Due to an association with three cases of a potentially fatal infection of the CNS,66 this is a controversial drug that is only available for patients enrolled in the Tysabri Outreach Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH) program.67 This medication is reserved for people who do not see results from other types of treatments. Dalfampridine. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medication approved in 2010 that increases the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses.68 This drug represents a new class of therapies that is aimed at addressing neurologic deficits directly. Medications to Treat Symptoms Muscle relaxants. Multiple sclerosis patients may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in the legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may improve muscle spasticity. However, baclofen may increase weakness in the legs, and tizanidine may cause drowsiness or a dry mouth. Medications to reduce fatigue. Drugs such as amantadine (Symmetrel) may help reduce fatigue. Other medications. Medications may also be prescribed for depression, pain and bladder or bowel control problems that may be associated with multiple sclerosis. Medications on the Horizon There are approximately 20 experimental therapies that are on the pathway to approval by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA). Investigators are making progress toward developing treatments that may be capable of protecting the CNS as well as encouraging repair of brain and spinal cord lesions. Many of these drugs are potentially valuable as treatments for MS, but are months or years from traversing all phases of the FDA process. Laquinimod. Laquinimodhas been shown to decrease proinflammatory factors and increase factors that promote nerve protection without increasing risk of infection. Laquinimod was well tolerated by most patients, with only a few reports of adverse effects.69 Alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is an antibody specific for mature white blood cells that targets them for destruction by the immune system. This drug is approved for the treatment of certain types of lymphoma and leukemia. In one study, it was shown to be more effective than beta interferon in reducing disability progression and relapse rate, however, the trial was discontinued early due to serious side effects.70 Fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a substance that has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and shows promise in MS to decrease white blood cell infiltration into the spinal cord.71 Therapy and Rehabilitation to Improve Quality of Life In addition to one or more drug-based therapies, MS patients will often participate in rehabilitation programs intended to maintain or improve their ability to perform at home and at work. More specifically these programs focus on general fitness and aim to address problems related to mobility, speech and swallowing, and cognitive deficits. Common rehabilitation strategies include: Physical therapy. Practices that aide mobility and functionality through structured physical activity on a scheduled basis. Occupational therapy. Skills aimed at using work, self-care, and leisure activities to foster development and limit disability. Speech therapy. Work with speech therapists can help MS patients overcome speech and language difficulties and help with troublesome swallowing. Cognitive rehabilitation. Assistance in managing difficulties with memory, high order thinking, and perception. A variety cognitive rehabilitation options are available. For example, playing chess regularly is a great way to promote neuronal function and communication; computer-based ""brain training"" programs are also helpful. Vocational rehabilitation. Support in making career plans, gaining job skills, and approaches to remaining gainfully employed. 8 Multiple Sclerosis Nutritional Protocol Most patients that employ complementary treatments for MS do so as an accompaniment with conventional drug treatments and find both classes of therapy to provide clinical benefits.72 The following section outlines key details and evidence-based findings concerning the latest complementary approaches to treating MS. Vitamin D As previously mentioned, mainstream medicine has overlooked a critical missing link in MS management—vitamin D. This hormone-like vitamin is capable of safely interacting directly with the genome to modulate a variety of physiological functions, including aspects of immune function involved in autoimmune diseases like MS. Two human clinical trials demonstrated that individuals with MS using vitamin D tended to have fewer relapses and less inflammation.17,73,74 In a year-long Vitamin D study, recurrence rate of MS ""attacks"" was 27% lower compared to baseline.74 In another large-dose Vitamin D trial, MS patients given 28,000‒280,000 IU weekly were found to have fewer active lesions during the 28-week long study.75 In light of the accumulating epidemiological and clinical evidence of the importance of vitamin D in this disease, supplementing the diet with vitamin D appears to be a low cost means to address this risk. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are polyunsaturated FAs which cannot be synthesized in humans and therefore must be provided via dietary sources. Both plant and animal foods are potential sources of omega-3 FAs. For example, linolenic acid, found in flaxseed, flaxseed oil, and preferably, fish and fish oils have very high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A small study looking at the effects of omega-3 FAs on MS found that immune cells from treated patients and healthy controls produced significantly fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines after three months of treatment with 6 grams of fish oil per day.76 One double-blind placebo-controlled study exists to date looking at the effect of omega-3 FAs on MS disease progression. In this study 312 patients were given either fish oil or olive oil placebo for two years. The results of this trial exhibited a trend toward decreased disease severity in the omega-3 FA group when compared with control.77 More recent studies have shown that MS patients given 10 grams of fish oil per day for three months exhibited significantly reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a factor correlated with disease progression, and also had greater concentrations of omega-3 FAs in their red blood cell membranes.78 Other work has shown that MS patients, while on a low-fat diet with omega-3 FA supplementation, experienced significantly reduced fatigue and lower relapse rates.79 Based upon clinical data and patient accounts, omega-3 FAs appear to be well tolerated and safe with no reports of adverse events. Linoleic Acid and Omega-6 Fatty Acids Linoleic acid is converted to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a beneficial omega-6 FA, after it is taken orally. However, this conversion is occasionally impaired, especially during inflammatory disease states.48,80 GLA has been shown to quell inflammation and research involving an animal model of MS has demonstrated that GLA administration significantly improved clinical outcomes when compared with control treatment.81 Some studies have shown significantly reduced relapse rates and disease progression scores, while others have found no differences between treatment and control groups.81-83 A closer look at data from these trials revealed that patients with lower levels of disability at the beginning of the trial exhibited a smaller increase in disability over the study period than did controls. In addition, linoleic acid was found to reduce the severity and duration of MS episodes in patients at all levels of disease severity.84 Selenium and Vitamin E Patients who have MS tend to have abnormally low levels of glutathione peroxidase, a powerful endogenous antioxidant.85,86 Researchers in Denmark conducted a small study in which patients with MS were given an antioxidant mixture containing about 2,000 mcg selenium, 2 grams vitamin C, and 480 mg vitamin E once daily for five weeks. Although glutathione peroxidase levels were initially lower in patients with MS than in normal control subjects, after five weeks of antioxidant therapy, levels of this antioxidant enzyme increased five-fold and reported side effects were minimal.85 ""[O]xidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. This finding also suggests the importance of antioxidants in diet and therapy of MS patients.""87 N-Acetylcysteine An effective strategy for increasing the body's supply of the powerful antioxidant glutathione is taking the oral supplement N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant that serves as a precursor to glutathione.48,88 NAC's potential benefit in the context of MS has been noted by some researchers.48,89 In a rodent MS model, NAC was able to diminish clinical symptoms and pathological evidence of CNS injury, and attenuate inflammation.90 Lipoic Acid Lipoic acid (LA) is a dietary supplement with antioxidant properties and has been studied specifically in MS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated primarily by immune cells, are implicated as mediators of demyelination and nerve damage.91,92 Known to cross the blood-brain barrier, LA decreases the activity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. It is believed that ICAM-1 and other adhesion molecules are responsible for allowing certain pro-inflammatory immune cells, like T-lymphocytes, to enter the CNS, paving the way for induction or exacerbation of inflammation and tissue damage.93-95 In an animal MS model, LA produced a significant reduction of demyelination and infiltration of the CNS by T lymphocytes.96-98 Other researchers have followed up on these studies. In a pilot clinical trial, 37 patients with MS were randomly assigned to receive various doses of LA (up to 2,400 mg/day) or placebo. After two weeks, patients were assessed for levels of ICAM-1 and tolerability of high-dose LA. In addition to being well tolerated by patients, LA treatment was associated with reduced ICAM-1 levels and reduced T-cell migration into the CNS.99 Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is an essential part of healthy mitochondrial function and energy production with potential usefulness in treating MS. Decreased levels of CoQ10 are associated with many disease states, including heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.100,101 CoQ10 was low in patients with MS.102 Several clinical trials of CoQ10 have been performed in neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.103 CoQ10 is a powerful lipid-soluble antioxidant that is also capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E in the body. Based upon clinical evidence, CoQ10 appears to be well tolerated and safe with potential usefulness in the management of MS. Vitamin B12 Some data suggest patients with MS have abnormally low levels of vitamin B12 in their cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, or both.104 In fact, clinical vitamin B12 deficiency and MS share remarkably similar characteristics, occasionally rendering correct diagnosis difficult.105 Notably, vitamin B12 plays a key role in the generation of myelin and thus, for decades, integrative physicians have prescribed B12 injections for patients who have MS. Data suggest patients given vitamin B12 supplements have experienced clinical improvements in their symptoms.48 For example, in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the effects of six months of vitamin B12 (1 mg/week injection) on 138 patients with MS. The researchers concluded that the clinical course of patients with MS improved after beginning vitamin B12 treatment.106 Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo biloba extracts are primarily composed of flavonoids and terpenoids and have been reported to have properties that can influence neural activity and improve cognitive performance. While controlled trials of the effects of ginkgo biloba on cognitive function have generated inconsistent findings, more recent studies found encouraging results for patients with MS.107-109 In one study, patients received 120 mg of ginkgo biloba extract or placebo twice per day for 12 weeks. Those patients taking ginkgo biloba exhibited improved measures of attention and reported fewer difficulties with memory. Green Tea (Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate) Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of many active ingredients of green tea that have been reported to have beneficial effects on the nervous and immune systems. In an animal study of MS, ECGC was found to prevent severity of clinical signs by decreasing inflammation and protecting nerve cells.110 According to animal research, green tea has the ability to significantly increase regulatory T cells which are critical to providing balance to the immune system and suppressing autoimmunity.111 Curcumin Curcumin is an active component of turmeric, a popular Indian spice. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent anti-inflammatory effects.112 A research group carrying out animal studies has demonstrated exciting findings that curcumin treatment results in a significant reduction in disease severity and a reduction in duration of acute attacks.113 In a follow-up study, laboratory researchers found curcumin not only suppressed disease severity, but also was associated with reduction of levels of IL-17 a cytokine that has been directly implicated in the progression of MS.114 Biotin Biotin, a water-soluble B-complex vitamin, is sometimes referred to as vitamin B7. Biotin participates in biochemical reactions catalyzed by decarboxylase enzymes, supporting energy production and fatty acid and myelin synthesis.115,116 The Adequate Intake for biotin is 30 micrograms, and low-to-moderate amounts are common in multivitamin supplements.117,118 Biotin's role in neuron functioning is evidenced by its therapeutic effect in a rare genetic disease known as biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease.118 Children affected by this disease experience progressive neurological dysfunction, including speech and motor dysfunction, mental retardation, seizures, and possibly death. Early treatment with biotin and thiamine (vitamin B1) appears to prevent progression in most cases.119,120 More recently, researchers have been exploring biotin's potential benefits in patients with MS. In the first clinical trial to demonstrate the potential of high-dose biotin in MS therapy, 23 patients with progressive MS were treated with 100–300 mg biotin daily for an average of 9.2 months. While improvements were not seen for two to eight months after initiating biotin therapy—suggesting biotin may instigate a slow and progressive repair of MS-related nerve damage—vision improved in all four participants with MS-related optic nerve injury, and motor function and overall disability improved in 16 of 18 participants (89%) with prominent spinal cord involvement.116,118 In a randomized controlled trial, 154 patients with progressive MS received either 100 mg biotin three times daily or placebo for 12 months. Thirteen (12.6%) of the biotin-treated subjects versus none of the placebo subjects exhibited improvements in measures of MS-related disability after nine months that persisted through the end of the trial. In addition, only 4.2% of biotin-treated subjects compared with 13.6% of placebo subjects had progressively worsening disability scores at nine months. At the end of the 12 months, placebo subjects were switched to high-dose biotin, and overall stabilization of disability was seen in all subjects at a 24-month follow-up.121 Biotin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients have been observed to be lower than those of healthy people, leading to speculation that low biotin availability may contribute to the pathology of MS.122 Although the mechanism of biotin's ability to prevent or repair nerve damage is unknown, biotin may prevent progressive demyelination by improving mitochondrial function, increasing brain energy production, supporting myelin production by increasing lipid synthesis, and affecting gene expression.118,123 Biotin is excreted through the urinary system, and high doses appear to be well tolerated in trials to date.118,124 However, high doses of biotin may interfere with certain lab tests, including thyroid function tests, leading to misdiagnosis of thyrotoxicosis.117,125,126 In addition, the possibility of teratogenicity has been suggested by animal research124; therefore, the safety of high-dose biotin in pregnancy is not established. Swank Diet Dr. Roy Swank first proposed a connection between increased consumption of saturated animal fat and the incidence of MS in 1950.127 He conducted a study which enrolled 208 patients with MS in the early 1950s, all of whom had experienced at least two acute relapses, and followed their progress over 34 years.128 In this study, patients maintained the now termed Swank diet, which consists of: less than 15 grams/day of saturated animal fat, 10‒15 grams/day of vegetable oil, 5 grams/day of cod liver oil, and one multivitamin. Long-term follow-up results from this study indicate that the patients adhering to the Swank diet experienced reduced MS disease activity and progression of disability when compared to patients that did not follow the regimen. While these results are encouraging, this trial is criticized for its lack of a proper control group and un-blinded design. Nevertheless, the Swank diet remains one of the most popular complementary approaches to treating MS. Swank Low-Fat Diet: Detailed Guidelines Saturated fat should remain less than 15 grams per day Unsaturated fat should be approximately 20‒50 grams per day No red meat should be consumed during the first year After the first year, a maximum of 3 oz. of red meat per week Dairy products must have 1% butterfat or less Processed foods containing saturated fat should not be eaten A source of omega-3, a multivitamin, and a mineral supplement are recommended daily Wheat, gluten or dairy product quantities are not restricted, unless they are foods which cause allergies or reactions. 9 Hormone Therapy Because women often experience improvement of MS symptoms while pregnant, hormone therapy using estrogen has been studied as a treatment for the disease. In human studies, estriol treatment (8 mg/day) in nonpregnant women with MS was associated with reduced lesion numbers and lesion volumes and when treatment ceased, these values returned to levels observed before treatment.37 Patients given estriol also had enhanced cognitive function. With respect to immune studies, estriol was associated with reduced pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production and these changes correlated well with the reduced formation of lesions.39 Other studies have shown that male MS patients treated with 10 mg of testosterone exhibited improved cognitive performance and reduced brain atrophy, although MRI data showed no change in lesion formation.129 In another similar study, testosterone treatment in males was associated with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and increased production of neuroprotective factors.130 There is currently debate among researchers about the role of hormones with MS and how that relationship may be exploited as a means of therapy. Some studies argue for hormone replacement as a new therapeutic approach.131 More information can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols.

This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Quality of life (QoL) has gained increasing importance in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess QoL and potentially associated factors such as depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism in patients starting glatiramer acetate (GA) in clinical practice. A prospective cohort study carried out in relapsing-remitting MS patients starting GA as first-line treatment. Patient information on QoL (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 [MSQoL-54]), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), sexual dysfunction (Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19) and work absenteeism was assessed from starting GA to week 96. Ninety-eight evaluable patients were enrolled in the study (mean age, 38.0 ± 8.4 years; female, 69.4%; mean MS duration, 42.6 ± 62.9 months; annual relapse rate since MS diagnosis, 0.4), and followed up at weeks 24 (n=96), 48 (n=94), 72 (n=89) and 96 (n=80). Patient QoL was preserved during the study, with improvements on the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health (p<0.05) and health distress (p<0.05). Depression, primary and secondary sexual dysfunction remained stable, but the number of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction decreased at week 96 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism also decreased over the study (p<0.01). Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism affected MSQoL-54 physical and mental health composites (p<0.05). QoL of our patients was preserved during the 96-week administration of GA. Though depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism impair patient QoL, they remained stable or even improved during the study. Absenteeism; Depression; Glatiramer acetate; Quality of life; Multiple sclerosis; Sexual dysfunction Quality of life assessment in patients with has gained increasing importance as it encompasses all aspects of patients lives that may be affected by the disease. Though patients quality of life worsens as multiple sclerosis progresses and physical function deteriorates, it depends not only on the disability caused by physical limitations but also on their emotional status, which may also affect the perception of wellbeing and quality of life [-]. In this scenario, depression has been shown to have a notable impact on quality of life, and is considered a significant and independent predictor of impaired quality of life [-]. Sexual dysfunction is another common and often underestimated clinical symptom of multiple sclerosis that, along with its emotional , has been shown to affect patients quality of life [,]. The information available on the impact of sexual dysfunction on quality of life, however, is still limited. The consequences of multiple sclerosis often negatively affect patients working life and may even lead to permanent unemployment []. This unemployment represents one of the factors that most modifies patients way of living as a result of its influence on their usual activities or interests and its impact on increasing emotional distress [], while sustaining employment has been shown to be associated with improved quality of life [,]. First-line disease-modifying drugs for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis including (INFb)-1a, INFb-1b and glatiramer acetate have been shown to improve the course of the disease. However, their effect on patients quality of life has not yet been fully clarified. Indeed, the information available on INFb's effect on quality of life is controversial, ranging from some benefit [] to absence of effect [-] or even to quality of life detriment []. The effect of glatiramer acetate treatment on quality of life has not been well assessed, and improvements in quality of life have been reported in treatment-naïve patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis six months after starting GA treatment that were sustained for another six months []. In light of the above, this study aimed to expand the information available on quality of life and potentially associated factors such as depression, and work absenteeism in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis starting glatiramer acetate as first-line treatment in clinical practice. This study was conducted in the Departments of at 37 Spanish hospitals in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, all its amendments and national regulations. The study was approved by the ethic committee of Hospital Donostia (San Sebastián, Spain) and all patients gave their written informed consent. Between November 2009 and November 2010, all patients meeting selection criteria who agreed to participate in the study were consecutively recruited into the study. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 to 60 years, with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, no previous treatment for multiple sclerosis and a score of 5.5 or less on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Patients were to start (Copaxone®, Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., London, United Kingdom) for multiple sclerosis treatment and must not have had any cognitive impairment that precluded understanding of the patients information sheet and informed consent form. This was a prospective cohort study conducted in patients with -remitting multiple sclerosis receiving glatiramer acetate treatment for multiple sclerosis and followed-up for two years according to clinical practice. All treatments were administered from commercial sources and according to routine clinical practice. No restrictions regarding patients treatment were specified in the study protocol. Patients information was retrieved from their medical charts at the start of glatiramer acetate treatment (baseline) and at weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96. The data retrieved at these visits included , medical history of multiple sclerosis, patients disability according to the EDSS [], quality of life measured according to scores on the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Live-54 (MSQoL-54) questionnaire [,], depression according to scores on the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [,], sexual disfunction according to the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19 (MSISQ-19), [,] and work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis according to the occurrence of work absenteeism, the number of working days missed and the causes of work absenteeism. EDSS scores, which range from 0 (normal neurological status) to 10 (death from multiple sclerosis), were obtained by the same researcher in a given patient. The MSQoL-54 questionnaire consists of 54 items distributed in 12 multiple-item scales and two single-item scales, including questions from the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey as a generic core measure and 18 additional items specific for multiple sclerosis that assess health , sexual function, overall quality of life, cognitive function and energy. Physical and mental health composite scores are calculated as a simplified two-dimension solution to MSQoL-54 questionnaire. The composites scores range from 0 (poor health) to 100 (optimal health). The BDI is composed of 21 categories of symptoms and attitudes which describe a specific behavioral manifestation of depression and consist of a graded series of four to five self-evaluative statements. Numerical values are assigned for each statement from 0 (neutral) to 3 (maximal severity) indicating the degree of severity of the manifestations of depression. Total scores range from 0 to 63, where higher scores indicate worse depressive states. Patients may also be categorized as having ups and downs considered normal if their BDI scores were 10 or less, as having mild mood disturbance if their BDI scores were between 11 and 16, as having borderline clinical depression if their BDI scores were between 17 and 20, as having moderate depression if their BDI scores were between 21 and 30, as having severe depression if their BDI scores were between 31 and 40 and as having extreme depression if their BDI scores were higher than 40. The cut-off value of at least 17 points was established as suggestive of the presence of depression. The MSISQ-19 consists of 19 items assessing the perceived influence of multiple sclerosis symptoms on sexual activity and satisfaction. Scores on the MSISQ-19 show the presence of primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction. Primary sexual dysfunction occurs as a result of neurologic changes related to multiple sclerosis that directly affect sexual feelings and/or sexual response, secondary sexual dysfunction refers to physical changes related to multiple sclerosis that affect the sexual response indirectly and tertiary sexual dysfunction refers to psychological, emotional, social and cultural aspects of multiple sclerosis that impact upon sexuality. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, measured according to scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire. Sample size was calculated to fulfill the primary objective of the study. At the time of study design, the only data available on the impact of multiple sclerosis therapy on quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire was reported by Simone et al., who found that multiple sclerosis patients followed up for two years experienced a decrease of six or more points in 80% of MSQoL-45 measurements (dimensions and summary composite scores), with an standard deviation of approximately 20 points []. Taking into account these data, an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a two-sided analysis, the number of evaluable patients needed to be enrolled into the study to detect a difference of six or more points in MSQoL-54 scores would be of 92 patients; considering a percentage of missing data of 20% or lower, e.g. due to non-evaluable patients, the total sample size would be of 110 patients. Analysis of the primary endpoint included the calculation of mean scores and standard deviations (SD) of both physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study. Comparison of these scores during the study was performed using the repeated measures general linear model. Comparison of scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline with those reported at week 24, 48, 72 and 96 were also performed using paired t-tests. The secondary endpoints included assessment of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism at baseline. Other secondary endpoints were the change in depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism during the study and their impact on patients quality of life. The distribution of patients according to the following categories of the BDI was calculated as the frequency and valid percentage in each study visit: ups and downs considered normal (BDI scores, =10), mild mood disturbance (BDI scores, 11-16), borderline clinical depression (BDI scores, 17-20), moderate depression (BDI scores, 21-30), severe depression (BDI scores, 31-40) and extreme depression (BDI scores, >40). The overall frequency of patients with depression, which was defined as a BDI score =17, was also calculated. Comparison of mean BDI scores and the proportion of patients within the above categories during the study was performed using paired t-tests and McNemars tests, respectively. The impact of depression on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire reported by patients with those without depression using t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. The frequencies and valid percentages of patients with primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores were calculated in each study visit. The overall frequency of sexual dysfunction in each study visit was also assessed according to patients with at least one of these categories (primary, secondary or tertiary sexual dysfunction). Changes during the study were assessed using McNemars tests. The impact of sexual dysfunction on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire between patients without sexual dysfunction and those with any kind of sexual dysfunction by using Mann-Whitney tests. Work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis was assessed according to the frequency and valid percentage of patients missing at least one day from work, the mean (SD) number of working days missed and the causes for work absenteeism. Changes in the frequency of patients absent from work and the number of working days missed during the study were assessed using McNemars tests and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. The impact of work absenteeism on patients quality of life was assessed by comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire in patients at least one day absent from work versus those with no day absent from work using Mann-Whitney tests. A correction method for multiple testing was not performed in the statistical analysis for the present study due to the controversy about its use in observational studies leading to potential risks and errors [,]. Further information on this subject is provided in Appendix 1. Missing data were not considered in the analyses and a significance level of 0.05 was used for statistical testing. The statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). A total of 101 patients agreed to participate in the study, three of whom were excluded from the analysis due to insufficient available data. Therefore, the evaluable population comprised a total of 98 patients, whose characteristics are described in Table 1. Patients disposition during the study is shown in Figure 1. When paired comparisons were performed to assess differences in EDSS scores from baseline, it was shown that the mean EDSS scores remained stable throughout the study period but with a slight tendency to improvement at week 96 (mean [SD], 1.1 [0.3] versus 1.0 [0.2], p=0.058). In addition, the proportion of patients with minimal disability slightly increased and the proportion of patients with moderate disability that did not need any technical aid slightly decreased, though not significantly, reaching 95.0% (n=76) and 5.0% (n=4) of patients, respectively, at week 96. Even though scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire improved slightly during the 96-week study period, the results obtained from the repeated measures general linear model showed that statistically significant differences were not attained in either the physical or mental health composites (Figure 3). Similarly, comparison of scores on the physical and mental health composites between baseline and weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 only showed statistically significant differences in the mental health composite at week 72, in which the scores were significantly higher than baseline (mean [SD], 70.6 [15.3] versus 73.9 [15.9], p<0.05; Figure 4). In addition, consistent statistically significant improvements from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 were observed in the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health and health distress (Figure 4). A total of 65 (66.3%) patients reported experiencing ups and downs considered normal according to the BDI at baseline, while 20 (20.4%) patients showed mild mood disturbance, 10 (10.2%) borderline clinical depression and 3 (3.1%) patients moderate depression. Therefore, a total of 13 (13.3%) patients showed overall depression (Table 2). No significant differences were found in either the mean BDI scores or the distribution of patients among the BDI categories throughout the study. The analysis of the impact of depression on patients quality of life showed that patients with depression reported worse scores on both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study period (Figure 5a). Multiple sclerosis intimacy and sexuality questionnaire-19 The overall frequency of patients with baseline sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores reached 43 (45.3%) patients, and remained stable throughout the 96-week study period. When the type of sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 was analyzed at baseline, primary sexual dysfunction was found in 31 (32.6%) patients, secondary sexual dysfunction in 21 (22.1%) patients and tertiary sexual dysfunction in 17 (17.9%) patients (Table 2). Distribution of patients with primary and secondary sexual dysfunction did not significantly change from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 or 96. However, the proportion of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction tended to decrease from baseline to week 72 (p=0.057), reaching statistically significance at week 96 (p<0.05). The presence of sexual dysfunction was shown to worsen patients quality of life, as patients with sexual dysfunction reported lower scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire during the whole study period (Figure 5b). *p<0.001; p<0.005; p<0.01; §p<0.05. D: depression; MHC: mental health composite; ND: no depression; NSD: no sexual dysfunction; NWA: no work absenteeism; PHC: physical health composite; SD: sexual dysfunction; WA: work absenteeism. At baseline, 46 (52.9%) patients reported having missed at least one day from work in the previous six months due to multiple sclerosis. The mean (SD) number of working days missed was 45.8 (56.5) days and the main reasons for work absenteeism were clinical signs of multiple sclerosis and disease relapses (Table 2). When work absenteeism was analyzed over the whole study, statistically significant decreases from baseline were observed in the proportion of patients missing at least one day from work at week 24 (p<0.01), week 48 (p<0.001), week 72 (p<0.01) and week 96 (p<0.01). Even though the number of working days missed from work decreased from baseline, statistically significant differences were only reached at week 48 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism was associated with patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, as patients absent from work reported worse scores on both the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline, week 24, week 48, week 72 and week 96 (Figure 5c). This prospective cohort study showed that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate under clinical practice conditions. Although glatiramer acetate treatment may have played a role in slowing down worsening of multiple sclerosis, this finding must be considered with caution since our patient population had intrinsically low disease activity in terms of EDSS scores and annual relapse rate. However, other studies also showed low disease activity in patients treated under clinical practice conditions [,], and another reported early gain in quality of life measured by the Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life scale in patients receiving glatiramer acetate in daily practice []. A protective effect on quality of life of other first-line treatments for multiple sclerosis such as IFNb has also been previously suggested in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis[], whose quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54, Short Form 36-Item Health Survey and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires remained stable for up to three years [-]. However, though some improvements in the physical health composite of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire have been reported after two years of treatment with IFNb [], detriments in patients quality of life have also been reported during the same duration of IFNb treatment, mainly as a result of worsening of the mental health composite []. In our study, disability, depression, primary sexual dysfunction and secondary sexual dysfunction were observed to remain stable during the study period, while tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis were significantly improved at week 96. Maintenance of disability even during 15 years of glatiramer acetate administration has been previously reported, showing a mean EDSS change of 0.6 points from the start of treatment []. However, since the EDSS is highly dependent on ambulation and does not provide information on parameters associated with patients wellbeing [], other parameters that might be potentially associated with patients wellbeing needed to be assessed. Indeed, our results support the influence of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism on the quality of life of patients with relapsing remitting-multiple sclerosis. These results are in line with previous studies reporting that multiple sclerosis patients with lifetime major depression show lower quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire, mainly in terms of energy, mental health, cognitive function, general quality of life, and emotional role limitations []. Depression measured according to the BDI or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression has been reported to be associated with both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [-], regardless of the disease-related physical disability and disease type []. Depression has been claimed to be a significant independent predictor of impaired patient quality of life measured using the MSQoL-54 and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires [-]. Patients with sexual dysfunction have also been shown to have poorer quality of life, with significantly lower scores on all scales of the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey [] and on all of scales of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire except for pain and cognitive function []. Similar detriments in quality of life were observed in unemployed versus unemployed patients, who had lower scores on most dimensions of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [,], suggesting the importance of sustained employment after the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis []. Though the low disease activity of our study patient population does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the effect of glatiramer acetate, decreased work absenteeism has previously been reported in patients receiving this agent [,]. In addition, there is no evidence that glatiramer acetate aggravates depression and it might even induce an antidepressant effect through its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activity []. Indeed, switching to glatiramer acetate has been recommended when a depressive episode is confirmed in patients receiving INFb []. Moreover, recently published data on patients switching from IFNb to glatiramer acetate [], and preliminary results from ongoing studies in patients switching to glatiramer acetate [,] showed patients quality of life remained stable or even improved. The authors acknowledge that although observational studies provide valuable information on treatments administered in clinical practice, their limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. The open-label study design, the absence of a comparator group and the potential regression to the mean effect should also be taken into account. In addition, data on other factors that might have influenced patients quality of life such as relapses, fatigue and treatment-related adverse events were not retrieved, and longer follow-up might have been needed for potential differences to become evident. The low disease activity of the study patient population precluded drawing conclusions about the effect of glatiramer acetate and may limit the representativeness of the study findings. Though caution is advisable when interpreting the study results, we consider that they still provide helpful information to physicians when treating multiple sclerosis in clinical practice. In conclusion, the study results show that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate in clinical practice conditions. Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis are factors that significantly impair patients quality of life. However, our study shows stable disability, depression and primary/secondary sexual dysfunction as well as improved tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism. The study findings should be interpreted with caution based on the low disease activity of the patient population. Further research is still needed to confirm the effect of glatiramer acetate, and to increase knowledge of other potentially associated factors, the long-term effect of multiple sclerosis therapies and the impact of the switch to glatiramer acetate on patients quality of life. There is currently no unanimity about the use of multiple test corrections (methods such as those of Bonferroni, Holm, Benjamini, etc.). In general, these methods reduce the probability of making type I errors, but they increase the probability of making type II errors. It seems cautious to prioritize minimizing the probability of type I errors over type II errors in studies where: several treatments are compared, probabilistic independence is expected between analysis groups and/or variables that would give rise to multiple tests, results have confirmatory implications for practical use. Methods of correcting for multiple testing provide solutions for these situations. However, if any of the above conditions are not a priority or are not applicable to the study, it would be cautious to minimize the probability of making a type II error rather than a type I error. Using multiple test corrections would minimize type I errors, but it would also increase the probability of type II errors, which would imply that differences that are really related to the phenomena under study would not be detected. In the present study, the effect of only one treatment was assessed during the study follow-up, and its use was supported by certain evidence of effectiveness. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume the overall absence of probabilistic independence in the measurements of variables of patients included in the study. Consequently, the authors decided to prioritize the avoidance of increasing the probability of committing type II errors. For readers who may be interested in the effect of multiple test corrections, Bonferroni correction would result in a p-value that was estimated to be of 0.0003 for the analyses carried out in this study. The authors would also like to explain that significant p-values of the study analyses were classified to be shown in the article as p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.005 or p<0.001. The data included in this appendix is intended to provide the reader interested in knowing more about multiple test corrections with some information to interpret the study results based on the multiple test correction approach used. Finally, the authors would like to advise the reader that the study conclusions should not be considered as definitive. As mentioned in the article, the study findings should be interpreted with caution and further research is still needed to confirm them.
